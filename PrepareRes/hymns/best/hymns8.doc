NOTES OF 1973 RESELECTION
This 1973 edition of "Hymns and Spiritual Songs" is not a revision of the Hymnbook. With one exception, it is a reselection of hymns that have appeared in the series from 1856, through 1881, 1903, 1932, 1951 and 1962.
Many changes were made in the 1951 and 1962 editions, and whilst some additions were made, a number of well-known and well-loved hymns were excluded, for various reasons. It is in response to a widespread desire for some of these to be replaced, that the present version comes.
Where appropriate a return is made to the original compositions of the authors.<p>R.S.
