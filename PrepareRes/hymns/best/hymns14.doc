ACCOUNT OF THE 1856 HYMN BOOK
Upon this let the compiler's private account of his labours be heard. I was asked in 1856 to examine carefully some hymn books which were in common use. To do so was easy; to express my judgment faithfully, and yet not invidiously, was difficult. After consideration, I determined to give my judgment by this attempt at a book more suited for present need than any I know of. It rests with others to decide how far I have or have not succeeded. I may add that my rules while working were these:
1. Retouch as little as possible, and with as light a hand as possible.
But, 2, allow to remain (a) no false, no faulty, no defective doctrine -- cost what it might; (b) no dispensational incongruities; (c) no want of keeping in the truth or truths stated; (d) no ambiguities between that which is and that which is not true; and
3. Add as many new hymns as the Lord might enable me. I now leave my labour with the Lord.<p>G.V.W.
