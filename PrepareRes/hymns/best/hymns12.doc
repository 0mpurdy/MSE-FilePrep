FROM THE PREFACE OF 1903 HYMNBOOK
It should be remembered with regard to alterations in some of the hymns retained, that the object in compiling such a hymn book as the present, is not to give a collection of original hymns, but to provide, as far as may be, utterances suited for singing in the assembly.
The book is still "The Little Flock Hymn Book," that is, it is a continuation, so far as grace has been given, of the labours of G.V.W. and J.N.D., and in no sense a new collection of hymns. The notice of G.V.W. as to the edition of 1856, taken from the cover of the "Present Testimony," December 1857, is here given, so that those who use it may have before them, with Mr. Darby's preface (save that part which refers to the arrangement of the edition of 1881), a complete history of the book.<p>T.H.R.
