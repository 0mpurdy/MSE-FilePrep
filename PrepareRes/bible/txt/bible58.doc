{#Hebrews}
{1}
1  God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
2  at the end of these days has spoken to us in [the person of the] Son, whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; Hath in these last days spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
3  who being [the] effulgence of his glory and [the] expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made [by himself] the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high, Who being the brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
4  taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they. Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
5  For to which of the angels said he ever, *Thou* art my Son: this day have *I* begotten thee? and again, *I* will be to him for father, and *he* shall be to me for son? For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
6  and again, when he brings in the firstborn into the habitable world, he says, And let all God's angels worship him. And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
7  And as to the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire; And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
8  but as to the Son, Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the age, and a sceptre of uprightness [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom. But unto the Son [he saith], Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom.
9  Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, [even] thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
10  And, *Thou* in the beginning, Lord, hast founded the earth, and works of thy hands are the heavens. And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
11  They shall perish, but *thou* continuest still; and they all shall grow old as a garment, They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
12  and as a covering shalt thou roll them up, and they shall be changed; but *thou* art the Same, and thy years shall not fail. And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
13  But as to which of the angels said he ever, Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet? But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
14  Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation? Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
{2}
1  For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things [we have] heard, lest in any way we should slip away. Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip.
2  For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution, For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;
3  how shall *we* escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken [of] by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard; How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard [him];
4  God bearing, besides, witness with [them] to [it], both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of [the] Holy Spirit, according to his will? God also bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?
5  For he has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to come, of which we speak; For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
6  but one has testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him, or son of man that thou visitest him? But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
7  Thou hast made him some little inferior to the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, [and hast set him over the works of thy hands;] Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:
8  thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in subjecting all things to him, he has left nothing unsubject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to *him*, Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
9  but we see Jesus, who [was] made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste death for every thing. But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
10  For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings. For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
11  For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified [are] all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified [are] all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
12  saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in [the] midst of [the] assembly will I sing thy praises. Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.
13  And again, I will trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children which God has given me. And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.
14  Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil; Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
15  and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage. And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
16  For he does not indeed take hold of angels [by the hand], but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham. For verily he took not on [him the nature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Abraham.
17  Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people; Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
18  for, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
{3}
1  Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of [the] heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus, Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
2  who is faithful to him that has constituted him, as Moses also in all his house. Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house.
3  For *he* has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house. For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.
4  For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things [is] God. For every house is builded by some [man]; but he that built all things [is] God.
5  And Moses indeed [was] faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after; And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
6  but Christ, as Son over his house, whose house are *we*, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end. But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
7  Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice, Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,
8  harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
9  where your fathers tempted [me], by proving [me], and saw my works forty years. When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
10  Wherefore I was wroth with this generation, and said, They always err in heart; and *they* have not known my ways; Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in [their] heart; and they have not known my ways.
11  so I swore in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest. So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
12  See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from [the] living God. Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
13  But encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called To-day, that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
14  For we are become companions of the Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end; For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
15  in that it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation; While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
16  (for who was it, who, having heard, provoked? but [was it] not all who came out of Egypt by Moses? For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
17  And with whom was he wroth forty years? [Was it] not with those who had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? But with whom was he grieved forty years? [was it] not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
18  And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who had not hearkened to the word? And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
19  And we see that they could not enter in on account of unbelief;) So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
{4}
1  Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed [of it]. Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
2  For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit *them*, not being mixed with faith in those who heard. For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it].
3  For we enter into the rest who have believed; as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works had been completed from [the] foundation of [the] world. For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
4  For he has said somewhere of the seventh [day] thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works: For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
5  and in this again, If they shall enter into my rest. And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest.
6  Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the word, Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
7  again he determines a certain day, saying, in David, 'To-day,' after so long a time; (according as it has been said before), To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
8  For if Jesus had brought them into rest, he would not have spoken afterwards about another day. For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
9  There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God. There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
10  For he that has entered into his rest, he also has rested from his works, as God did from his own. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.
11  Let us therefore use diligence to enter into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word. Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
12  For the word of God [is] living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to [the] division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of [the] heart. For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
13  And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things [are] naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
14  Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession. Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.
15  For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.
16  Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
{5}
1  For every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things [pertaining] to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
2  being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity; Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
3  and, on account of this [infirmity], he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
4  And no one takes the honour to himself but [as] called by God, even as Aaron also. And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as [was] Aaron.
5  Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, *Thou* art my Son, *I* have to-day begotten thee. So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.
6  Even as also in another [place] he says, *Thou* [art] a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec. As he saith also in another [place], Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
7  Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard because of his piety;) Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;
8  though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered; Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
9  and having been perfected, became to all them that obey him, author of eternal salvation; And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
10  addressed by God [as] high priest according to the order of Melchisedec. Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
11  Concerning whom we have much to say, and hard to be interpreted in speaking [of it], since ye are become dull in hearing. Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.
12  For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have again need that [one] should teach you what [are] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, [and] not of solid food. For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which [be] the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
13  For every one that partakes of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe; For every one that useth milk [is] unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
14  but solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
{6}
1  Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on [to what belongs] to full growth, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God, Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
2  of [the] doctrine of washings, and of imposition of hands, and of resurrection of [the] dead, and of eternal judgment; Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
3  and this will we do if God permit. And this will we do, if God permit.
4  For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of [the] Holy Spirit, For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
5  and have tasted the good word of God, and [the] works of power of [the] age to come, And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
6  and have fallen away, crucifying for themselves [as they do] the Son of God, and making a show of [him]. If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put [him] to an open shame.
7  For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God; For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:
8  but bringing forth thorns and briars, it is found worthless and nigh to a curse, whose end [is] to be burned. But that which beareth thorns and briers [is] rejected, and [is] nigh unto cursing; whose end [is] to be burned.
9  But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus. But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
10  For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work, and the love which ye have shewn to his name, having ministered to the saints, and [still] ministering. For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
11  But we desire earnestly that each one of you shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end; And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
12  that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises. That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
13  For God, having promised to Abraham, since he had no greater to swear by, swore by himself, For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
14  saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee; Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
15  and thus, having had long patience, he got the promise. And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
16  For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure. For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.
17  Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath, Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath:
18  that by two unchangeable things, in which [it was] impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us, That by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:
19  which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil, Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
20  where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec. Whither the forerunner is for us entered, [even] Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
{7}
1  For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings, and blessed him; For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
2  to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace; To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
3  without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually. Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
4  Now consider how great this [personage] was, to whom [even] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils. Now consider how great this man [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
5  And they indeed from among the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is from their brethren, though these are come out of the loins of Abraham: And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
6  but he who has no genealogy from them has tithed Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises. But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
7  But beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed by the better. And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
8  And here dying men receive tithes; but there [one] of whom the witness is that he lives; And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
9  and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes. And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
10  For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him. For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
11  If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with *it*, what need [was there] still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be named after the order of Aaron? If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
12  For, the priesthood being changed, there takes place of necessity a change of law also. For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
13  For he, of whom these things are said, belongs to a different tribe, of which no one has [ever] been attached to the service of the altar. For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
14  For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests. For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
15  And it is yet more abundantly evident, since a different priest arises according to the similitude of Melchisedec, And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
16  who has been constituted not according to law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life. Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
17  For it is borne witness, *Thou* art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec. For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
18  For there is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness, For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
19  (for the law perfected nothing,) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God. For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.
20  And by how much [it was] not without the swearing of an oath; And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:
21  (for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who said, as to him, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent [of it], *Thou* [art] priest for ever [according to the order of Melchisedec];) (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
22  by so much Jesus became surety of a better covenant. By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
23  And they have been many priests, on account of being hindered from continuing by death; And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
24  but he, because of his continuing for ever, has the priesthood unchangeable. But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
25  Whence also he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
26  For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens: For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
27  who has not day by day need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then [for] those of the people; for this he did once for all [in] having offered up himself. Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
28  For the law constitutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which [is] after the law, a Son perfected for ever. For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
{8}
1  Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking [is], We have such a one high priest who has sat down on [the] right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens; Now of the things which we have spoken [this is] the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
2  minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, [and] not man. A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
3  For every high priest is constituted for the offering both of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that this one also should have something which he may offer. For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore [it is] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
4  If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law, For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
5  (who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things, according as Moses was oracularly told [when] about to make the tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain.) Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, [that] thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
6  But now he has got a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is mediator of a better covenant, which is established on the footing of better promises. But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
7  For if that first was faultless, place had not been sought for a second. For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
8  For finding fault, he says to them, Behold, days come, saith the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant as regards the house of Israel, and as regards the house of Juda; For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
9  not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in [the] day of my taking their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because *they* did not continue in my covenant, and *I* did not regard them, saith [the] Lord. Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
10  Because this [is] the covenant that I will covenant to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts; and I will be to them for God, and *they* shall be to me for people. For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
11  And they shall not teach each his fellow-citizen, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all shall know me in themselves, from [the] little one [among them] unto [the] great among them. And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
12  Because I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
13  In that he says New, he has made the first old; but that which grows old and aged [is] near disappearing. In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.
{9}
1  The first therefore also indeed had ordinances of service, and the sanctuary, a worldly one. Then verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
2  For a tabernacle was set up; the first, in which [were] both the candlestick and the table and the exposition of the loaves, which is called Holy; For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein [was] the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.
3  but after the second veil a tabernacle which is called Holy of holies, And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
4  having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which [were] the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant; Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
5  and above over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which it is not now [the time] to speak in detail. And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
6  Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the services; Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].
7  but into the second, the high priest only, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people: But into the second [went] the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and [for] the errors of the people:
8  the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the [holy of] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has [its] standing; The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
9  the which [is] an image for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices, unable to perfect as to conscience him that worshipped, are offered, Which [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
10  [consisting] only of meats and drinks and divers washings, ordinances of flesh, imposed until [the] time of setting things right. [Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation.
11  But Christ being come high priest of the good things to come, by the better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, (that is, not of this creation,) But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
12  nor by blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the [holy of] holies, having found an eternal redemption. Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].
13  For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh, For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:
14  how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship [the] living God? How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
15  And for this reason he is mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
16  (For where [there is] a testament, the death of the testator must needs come in. For where a testament [is], there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
17  For a testament [is] of force when men are dead, since it is in no way of force while the testator is alive.) For a testament [is] of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
18  Whence neither the first was inaugurated without blood. Whereupon neither the first [testament] was dedicated without blood.
19  For every commandment having been spoken according to [the] law by Moses to all the people; having taken the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
20  saying, This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you. Saying, This [is] the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.
21  And the tabernacle too and all the vessels of service he sprinkled in like manner with blood; Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.
22  and almost all things are purified with blood according to the law, and without blood-shedding there is no remission. And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
23  [It was] necessary then that the figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices better than these. [It was] therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
24  For the Christ is not entered into holy places made with hand, figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us: For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
25  nor in order that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own; Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;
26  since he had [then] been obliged often to suffer from the foundation of the world. But now once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for [the] putting away of sin by his sacrifice. For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
27  And forasmuch as it is the portion of men once to die, and after this judgment; And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
28  thus the Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation. So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
{10}
1  For the law, having a shadow of the coming good things, not the image itself of the things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually yearly, perfect those who approach. For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
2  Since, would they not indeed have ceased being offered, on account of the worshippers once purged having no longer any conscience of sins? For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
3  But in these [there is] a calling to mind of sins yearly. But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again [made] of sins every year.
4  For blood of bulls and goats [is] incapable of taking away sins. For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
5  Wherefore coming into the world he says, Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared me a body. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
6  Thou tookest no pleasure in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin. In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
7  Then I said, Lo, I come (in [the] roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
8  Above, saying Sacrifices and offerings and burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou willedst not, neither tookest pleasure in (which are offered according to the law); Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure [therein]; which are offered by the law;
9  then he said, Lo, I come to do thy will. He takes away the first that he may establish the second; Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
10  by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once [for all].
11  And every priest stands daily ministering, and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
12  But *he*, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down in perpetuity at [the] right hand of God, But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
13  waiting from henceforth until his enemies be set [for the] footstool of his feet. From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
14  For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
15  And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness [of it]; for after what was said: [Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
16  This [is] the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days, saith [the] Lord: Giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings; This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
17  and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more. And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
18  But where there [is] remission of these, [there is] no longer a sacrifice for sin. Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.
19  Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the [holy of] holies by the blood of Jesus, Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
20  the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
21  and [having] a great priest over the house of God, And [having] an high priest over the house of God;
22  let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water. Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
23  Let us hold fast the confession of the hope unwavering, (for he [is] faithful who has promised;) Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; (for he [is] faithful that promised;)
24  and let us consider one another for provoking to love and good works; And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
25  not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom [is] with some; but encouraging [one another], and by so much the more as ye see the day drawing near. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is]; but exhorting [one another]: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
26  For where we sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains any sacrifice for sins, For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
27  but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and heat of fire about to devour the adversaries. But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
28  Any one that has disregarded Moses' law dies without mercy on [the testimony of] two or three witnesses: He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
29  of how much worse punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and esteemed the blood of the covenant, whereby he has been sanctified, common, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
30  For we know him that said, To me [belongs] vengeance; *I* will recompense, saith the Lord: and again, The Lord shall judge his people. For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth] unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
31  [It is] a fearful thing falling into [the] hands of [the] living God. [It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
32  But call to mind the earlier days in which, having been enlightened, ye endured much conflict of sufferings; But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;
33  on the one hand, when ye were made a spectacle both in reproaches and afflictions; and on the other, when ye became partakers with those who were passing through them. Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.
34  For ye both sympathised with prisoners and accepted with joy the plunder of your goods, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better substance, and an abiding one. For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
35  Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.
36  For ye have need of endurance in order that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
37  For yet a very little while he that comes will come, and will not delay. For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
38  But the just shall live by faith; and, if he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him. Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
39  But *we* are not drawers back to perdition, but of faith to saving [the] soul. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
{11}
1  Now faith is [the] substantiating of things hoped for, [the] conviction of things not seen. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
2  For in [the power of] this the elders have obtained testimony. For by it the elders obtained a good report.

By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
6  But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]. For he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them who seek him out. But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

10  for he waited for the city which has foundations, of which God is [the] artificer and constructor. For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.
11  By faith also Sarah herself received strength for [the] conception of seed, and [that] beyond a seasonable age; since she counted him faithful who promised. Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
12  Wherefore also there have been born of one, and that of one become dead, even as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the countless sand which [is] by the sea shore. Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
13  All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar off and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
14  For they who say such things shew clearly that they seek [their] country. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
15  And if they had called to mind that from whence they went out, they had had opportunity to have returned; And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
16  but now they seek a better, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city. But now they desire a better [country], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.

18  as to whom it had been said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called: Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
19  counting that God [was] able to raise [him] even from among [the] dead, whence also he received him in a figure. Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.

32  And what more do I say? For the time would fail me telling of Gideon, and Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah, and David and Samuel, and of the prophets: And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and [of] Barak, and [of] Samson, and [of] Jephthae; [of] David also, and Samuel, and [of] the prophets:

1  Let *us* also therefore, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, laying aside every weight, and sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race that lies before us, Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset [us], and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
2  looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured [the] cross, having despised [the] shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

4  Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, wrestling against sin. Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
5  And ye have quite forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: My son, despise not [the] chastening of [the] Lord, nor faint [when] reproved by him; And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
6  for whom [the] Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives. For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
7  Ye endure for chastening, God conducts himself towards you as towards sons; for who is the son that the father chastens not? If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
8  But if ye are without chastening, of which all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
9  Moreover we have had the fathers of our flesh as chasteners, and we reverenced [them]; shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live? Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected [us], and we gave [them] reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
10  For they indeed chastened for a few days, as seemed good to them; but he for profit, in order to the partaking of his holiness. For they verily for a few days chastened [us] after their own pleasure; but he for [our] profit, that [we] might be partakers of his holiness.
