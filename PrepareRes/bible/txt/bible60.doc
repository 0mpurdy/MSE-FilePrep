1  Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ, to [the] sojourners of [the] dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
2  elect according to [the] foreknowledge of God [the] Father, by sanctification of [the] Spirit, unto [the] obedience and sprinkling of [the] blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied. Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
3  Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his great mercy, has begotten us again to a living hope through [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ from among [the] dead, Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
4  to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance, reserved in [the] heavens for you, To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
5  who are kept guarded by [the] power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in [the] last time. Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
6  Wherein ye exult, for a little while at present, if needed, put to grief by various trials, Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
7  that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes, though it be proved by fire, be found to praise and glory and honour in [the] revelation of Jesus Christ: That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:
8  whom, having not seen, ye love; on whom [though] not now looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with [the] glory, Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see [him] not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
9  receiving the end of your faith, [the] salvation of [your] souls. Receiving the end of your faith, [even] the salvation of [your] souls.
10  Concerning which salvation prophets, who have prophesied of the grace towards you, sought out and searched out; Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace [that should come] unto you:
11  searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which [was] in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which [belonged] to Christ, and the glories after these. Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
12  To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things, which have now been announced to you by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by [the] Holy Spirit, sent from heaven, which angels desire to look into. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
13  Wherefore, having girded up the loins of your mind, [be] sober [and] hope with perfect stedfastness in the grace [which will be] brought to you at [the] revelation of Jesus Christ; Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
14  as children of obedience, not conformed to [your] former lusts in your ignorance; As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:
15  but as he who has called you is holy, be ye also holy in all [your] conversation; But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;
16  because it is written, Be ye holy, for *I* am holy. Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
17  And if ye invoke as Father him who, without regard of persons, judges according to the work of each, pass your time of sojourn in fear, And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning [here] in fear:
18  knowing that ye have been redeemed, not by corruptible [things, as] silver or gold, from your vain conversation handed down from [your] fathers, Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, [as] silver and gold, from your vain conversation [received] by tradition from your fathers;
19  but by precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, [the blood] of Christ, But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:
20  foreknown indeed before [the] foundation of [the] world, but who has been manifested at the end of times for your sakes, Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,
21  who by him do believe on God, who has raised him from among [the] dead and given him glory, that your faith and hope should be in God. Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
22  Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth to unfeigned brotherly love, love one another out of a pure heart fervently; Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, [see that ye] love one another with a pure heart fervently:
23  being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by [the] living and abiding word of God. Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.
24  Because all flesh [is] as grass, and all its glory as [the] flower of grass. The grass has withered and [its] flower has fallen; For all flesh [is] as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:
25  but the word of [the] Lord abides for eternity. But this is the word which in the glad tidings [is] preached to you. But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
{2}
1  Laying aside therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings, Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
2  as newborn babes desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation, As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:
3  if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord [is] good. If so be ye have tasted that the Lord [is] gracious.
4  To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious, To whom coming, [as unto] a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, [and] precious,
5  yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
6  Because it is contained in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be put to shame. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
7  To you therefore who believe [is] the preciousness; but to the disobedient, the stone which the builders cast away as worthless, this is become head of [the] corner, Unto you therefore which believe [he is] precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
8  and a stone of stumbling and rock of offence; [who] stumble at the word, being disobedient to which also they have been appointed. And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, [even to them] which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
9  But *ye* [are] a chosen race, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, that ye might set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light; But ye [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
10  who once [were] not a people, but now God's people; who were not enjoying mercy, but now have found mercy. Which in time past [were] not a people, but [are] now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
11  Beloved, I exhort [you], as strangers and sojourners, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; Dearly beloved, I beseech [you] as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
12  having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that [as to that] in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may through [your] good works, [themselves] witnessing [them], glorify God in [the] day of visitation. Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by [your] good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
13  Be in subjection [therefore] to every human institution for the Lord's sake; whether to [the] king as supreme, Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
14  or to rulers as sent by him, for vengeance on evildoers, and praise to them that do well. Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
15  Because so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye put to silence the ignorance of senseless men; For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
16  as free, and not as having liberty as a cloak of malice, but as God's bondmen. As free, and not using [your] liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
17  Shew honour to all, love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the king. Honour all [men]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
18  Servants, [be] subject with all fear to your masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the ill-tempered. Servants, [be] subject to [your] masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
19  For this [is] acceptable, if one, for conscience sake towards God, endure griefs, suffering unjustly. For this [is] thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
20  For what glory [is it], if sinning and being buffeted ye shall bear [it]? but if, doing good and suffering, ye shall bear [it], this is acceptable with God. For what glory [is it], if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer [for it], ye take it patiently, this [is] acceptable with God.
21  For to this have ye been called; for Christ also has suffered for you, leaving you a model that ye should follow in his steps: For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:
22  who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth; Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
23  who, [when] reviled, reviled not again; [when] suffering, threatened not; but gave [himself] over into the hands of him who judges righteously; Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously:
24  who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, in order that, being dead to sins, we may live to righteousness: by whose stripes ye have been healed. Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
25  For ye were going astray as sheep, but have now returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls. For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
{3}
1  Likewise, wives, [be] subject to your own husbands, that, even if any are disobedient to the word, they may be gained without [the] word by the conversation of the wives, Likewise, ye wives, [be] in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;
2  having witnessed your pure conversation [carried out] in fear; While they behold your chaste conversation [coupled] with fear.
3  whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel; Whose adorning let it not be that outward [adorning] of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;
4  but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible [ornament] of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price. But [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, [even the ornament] of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
5  For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God heretofore adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands; For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:
6  as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children ye have become, doing good, and not fearing with any kind of consternation. Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
7  [Ye] husbands likewise, dwell with [them] according to knowledge, as with a weaker, [even] the female, vessel, giving [them] honour, as also fellow-heirs of [the] grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered. Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with [them] according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
8  Finally, [be] all of one mind, sympathising, full of brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded; Finally, [be ye] all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, [be] pitiful, [be] courteous:
9  not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but on the contrary, blessing [others], because ye have been called to this, that ye should inherit blessing. Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
10  For he that will love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile. For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:
11  And let him avoid evil, and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.
12  because [the] eyes of [the] Lord [are] on [the] righteous, and his ears towards their supplications; but [the] face of [the] Lord [is] against them that do evil. For the eyes of the Lord [are] over the righteous, and his ears [are open] unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord [is] against them that do evil.
13  And who shall injure you if ye have become imitators of that which [is] good? And who [is] he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?
14  But if also ye should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed [are ye]; but be not afraid of their fear, neither be troubled; But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy [are ye]: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
15  but sanctify [the] Lord the Christ in your hearts, and [be] always prepared to [give] an answer [to] every one that asks you to give an account of the hope that [is] in you, but with meekness and fear; But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and [be] ready always to [give] an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
16  having a good conscience, that [as to that] in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may be ashamed who calumniate your good conversation in Christ. Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.
17  For [it is] better, if the will of God should will it, to suffer [as] well-doers than [as] evildoers; For [it is] better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.
18  for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, [the] just for [the] unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in flesh, but made alive in [the] Spirit, For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:
19  in which also going he preached to the spirits [which are] in prison, By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
20  heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in [the] days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
21  which figure also now saves you, [even] baptism, not a putting away of [the] filth of flesh, but [the] demand as before God of a good conscience, by [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ, The like figure whereunto [even] baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
22  who is at [the] right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him. Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
{4}
1  Christ, then, having suffered for us in [the] flesh, do *ye* also arm yourselves with the same mind; for he that has suffered in [the] flesh has done with sin, Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
2  no longer to live the rest of [his] time in [the] flesh to men's lusts, but to God's will. That he no longer should live the rest of [his] time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
3  For the time past [is] sufficient [for us] to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, walking in lasciviousness, lusts, wine-drinking, revels, drinkings, and unhallowed idolatries. For the time past of [our] life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:
4  Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with [them] to the same sink of corruption, speaking injuriously [of you]; Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with [them] to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of [you]:
5  who shall render account to him who is ready to judge [the] living and [the] dead. Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
6  For to this [end] were the glad tidings preached to [the] dead also, that they might be judged, as regards men, after [the] flesh, but live, as regards God, after [the] Spirit. For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
7  But the end of all things is drawn nigh: be sober therefore, and be watchful unto prayers; But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.
8  but before all things having fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins; And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
9  hospitable one to another, without murmuring; Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
10  each according as he has received a gift, ministering it to one another, as good stewards of [the] various grace of God. As every man hath received the gift, [even so] minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
11  If any one speak -- as oracles of God; if any one minister -- as of strength which God supplies; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might for the ages of ages. Amen. If any man speak, [let him speak] as the oracles of God; if any man minister, [let him do it] as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
12  Beloved, take not [as] strange the fire [of persecution] which has taken place amongst you for [your] trial, as if a strange thing was happening to you; Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:
13  but as ye have share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, that in the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exultation. But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
14  If ye are reproached in [the] name of Christ, blessed [are ye]; for the [Spirit] of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you: [on their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.] If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy [are ye]; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
15  Let none of you suffer indeed as murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or as overseer of other people's matters; But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or [as] a thief, or [as] an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.
16  but if as a christian, let him not be ashamed, but glorify God in this name. Yet if [any man suffer] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
17  For the time of having the judgment begin from the house of God [is come]; but if first from us, what [shall be] the end of those who obey not the glad tidings of God? For the time [is come] that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if [it] first [begin] at us, what shall the end [be] of them that obey not the gospel of God?
18  And if the righteous is difficultly saved, where shall the impious and [the] sinner appear? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
19  Wherefore also let them who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator. Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls [to him] in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
{5}
1  The elders which [are] among you I exhort, who [am their] fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also [am] partaker of the glory about to be revealed: The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
2  shepherd the flock of God which [is] among you, exercising oversight, not by necessity, but willingly; not for base gain, but readily; Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight [thereof], not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
3  not as lording it over your possessions, but being models for the flock. Neither as being lords over [God's] heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
4  And when the chief shepherd is manifested ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
5  Likewise [ye] younger, be subject to [the] elder, and all of you bind on humility towards one another; for God sets himself against [the] proud, but to [the] humble gives grace. Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all [of you] be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
6  Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in [the due] time; Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
7  having cast all your care upon him, for he cares about you. Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
8  Be vigilant, watch. Your adversary [the] devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
9  Whom resist, stedfast in faith, knowing that the selfsame sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which [is] in [the] world. Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
10  But the God of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, when ye have suffered for a little while, himself shall make perfect, stablish, strengthen, ground: But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you].
11  to him [be] the glory and the might for the ages of the ages. Amen. To him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
12  By Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I suppose, I have written to you briefly; exhorting and testifying that this is [the] true grace of God in which ye stand. By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
13  She that is elected with [you] in Babylon salutes you, and Marcus my son. The [church that is] at Babylon, elected together with [you], saluteth you; and [so doth] Marcus my son.
14  Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all who [are] in Christ. Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace [be] with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
