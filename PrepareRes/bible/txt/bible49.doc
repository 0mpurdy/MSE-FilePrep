1  Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, to the saints and faithful in Christ Jesus who are at Ephesus. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
2  Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Grace [be] to you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
3  Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ; Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [places] in Christ:
4  according as he has chosen us in him before [the] world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love; According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
5  having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
6  to [the] praise of [the] glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved: To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
7  in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences, according to the riches of his grace; In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
8  which he has caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and intelligence, Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
9  having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:
10  for [the] administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; in him, That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; [even] in him:
11  in whom we have also obtained an inheritance, being marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his own will, In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
12  that we should be to [the] praise of his glory who have pre-trusted in the Christ: That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
13  in whom *ye* also [have trusted], having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, In whom ye also [trusted], after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
14  who is [the] earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to [the] praise of his glory. Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
15  Wherefore *I* also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which [is] in you, and the love which [ye have] towards all the saints, Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,
16  do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention [of you] at my prayers, Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
17  that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you [the] spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
18  being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, [and] what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
19  and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, And what [is] the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
20  [in] which he wrought in the Christ [in] raising him from among [the] dead, and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies, Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places],
21  above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come; Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
22  and has put all things under his feet, and gave him [to be] head over all things to the assembly, And hath put all [things] under his feet, and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the church,
23  which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all: Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
{2}
1  and *you*, being dead in your offences and sins -- And you [hath he quickened], who were dead in trespasses and sins;
2  in which ye once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience: Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
3  among whom *we* also all once had our conversation in the lusts of our flesh, doing what the flesh and the thoughts willed to do, and were children, by nature, of wrath, even as the rest: Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
4  but God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love wherewith he loved us, But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
5  (we too being dead in offences,) has quickened us with the Christ, (ye are saved by grace,) Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
6  and has raised [us] up together, and has made [us] sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus, And hath raised [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus:
7  that he might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus. That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
8  For ye are saved by grace, through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is God's gift: For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God:
9  not on the principle of works, that no one might boast. Not of works, lest any man should boast.
10  For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God has before prepared that we should walk in them. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
11  Wherefore remember that *ye*, once nations in [the] flesh, who [are] called uncircumcision by that called circumcision in [the] flesh done with the hand; Wherefore remember, that ye [being] in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
12  that ye were at that time without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
13  but now in Christ Jesus *ye* who once were afar off are become nigh by the blood of the Christ. But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
14  For *he* is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of enclosure, For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];
15  having annulled the enmity in his flesh, the law of commandments in ordinances, that he might form the two in himself into one new man, making peace; Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, [so] making peace;
16  and might reconcile both in one body to God by the cross, having by it slain the enmity; And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
17  and, coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who [were] afar off, and [the glad tidings of] peace to those [who were] nigh. And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.
18  For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
19  So then ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God, Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
20  being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone, And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner [stone];
21  in whom all [the] building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord; In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
22  in whom *ye* also are built together for a habitation of God in [the] Spirit. In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
{3}
1  For this reason *I* Paul, prisoner of the Christ Jesus for you nations, For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
2  (if indeed ye have heard of the administration of the grace of God which has been given to me towards you, If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
3  that by revelation the mystery has been made known to me, (according as I have written before briefly, How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
4  by which, in reading it, ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery of the Christ,) Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
5  which in other generations has not been made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in [the power of the] Spirit, Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
6  that [they who are of] the nations should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of [his] promise in Christ Jesus by the glad tidings; That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:
7  of which I am become minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me, according to the working of his power. Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
8  To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ, Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
9  and to enlighten all [with the knowledge of] what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God, who has created all things, And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
10  in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God, To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
11  according to [the] purpose of the ages, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord, According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
12  in whom we have boldness and access in confidence by the faith of him. In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
13  Wherefore I beseech [you] not to faint through my tribulations for you, which is your glory. Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
14  For this reason I bow my knees to the Father [of our Lord Jesus Christ], For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
15  of whom every family in [the] heavens and on earth is named, Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
16  in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
17  that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
18  in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what [is] the breadth and length and depth and height; May be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
19  and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled [even] to all the fulness of God. And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.
20  But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think, according to the power which works in us, Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
21  to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages. Amen). Unto him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.

1  *I*, the prisoner in [the] Lord, exhort you therefore to walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye have been called, I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,
2  with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing with one another in love; With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
3  using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
4  [There is] one body and one Spirit, as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling; [There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;
5  one Lord, one faith, one baptism; One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
6  one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all. One God and Father of all, who [is] above all, and through all, and in you all.
7  But to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
8  Wherefore he says, Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
9  But that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth? (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
10  He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things; He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
11  and *he* has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
12  for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to [the] work of [the] ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
13  until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at [the] full-grown man, at [the] measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ; Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
14  in order that we may be no longer babes, tossed and carried about by every wind of *that* teaching [which is] in the sleight of men, in unprincipled cunning with a view to systematized error; That we [henceforth] be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, [and] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
15  but, holding the truth in love, we may grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ: But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, [even] Christ:
16  from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to [the] working in [its] measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love. From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
17  This I say therefore, and testify in [the] Lord, that ye should no longer walk as [the rest of] the nations walk in [the] vanity of their mind, This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
18  being darkened in understanding, estranged from the life of God by reason of the ignorance which is in them, by reason of the hardness of their hearts, Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:
19  who having cast off all feeling, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greedy unsatisfied lust. Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
20  But *ye* have not thus learnt the Christ, But ye have not so learned Christ;
21  if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as [the] truth is in Jesus; If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:
22  [namely] your having put off according to the former conversation the old man which corrupts itself according to the deceitful lusts; That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
23  and being renewed in the spirit of your mind; And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
24  and [your] having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness. And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
25  Wherefore, having put off falsehood, speak truth every one with his neighbour, because we are members one of another. Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.
26  Be angry, and do not sin; let not the sun set upon your wrath, Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
27  neither give room for the devil. Neither give place to the devil.
28  Let the stealer steal no more, but rather let him toil, working what is honest with [his] hands, that he may have to distribute to him that has need. Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with [his] hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.
29  Let no corrupt word go out of your mouth, but if [there be] any good one for needful edification, that it may give grace to those that hear [it]. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
30  And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which ye have been sealed for [the] day of redemption. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
31  Let all bitterness, and heat of passion, and wrath, and clamour, and injurious language, be removed from you, with all malice; Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
32  and be to one another kind, compassionate, forgiving one another, so as God also in Christ has forgiven you. And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
{5}
1  Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children, Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
2  and walk in love, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour. And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
3  But fornication and all uncleanness or unbridled lust, let it not be even named among you, as it becomes saints; But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
4  and filthiness and foolish talking, or jesting, which are not convenient; but rather thanksgiving. Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
5  For this ye are [well] informed of, knowing that no fornicator, or unclean person, or person of unbridled lust, who is an idolater, has inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
6  Let no one deceive you with vain words, for on account of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
7  Be not ye therefore fellow-partakers with them; Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
8  for ye were once darkness, but now light in [the] Lord; walk as children of light, For ye were sometimes darkness, but now [are ye] light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
9  (for the fruit of the light [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth,) (For the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
10  proving what is agreeable to the Lord; Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
11  and do not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather also reprove [them], And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them].
12  for the things that are done by them in secret it is shameful even to say. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
13  But all things having their true character exposed by the light are made manifest; for that which makes everything manifest is light. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
14  Wherefore he says, Wake up, [thou] that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee. Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
15  See therefore how ye walk carefully, not as unwise but as wise, See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
16  redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
17  For this reason be not foolish, but understanding what [is] the will of the Lord. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord [is].
18  And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
19  speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
20  giving thanks at all times for all things to him [who is] God and [the] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
21  submitting yourselves to one another in [the] fear of Christ. Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
22  Wives, [submit yourselves] to your own husbands, as to the Lord, Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
23  for a husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ [is] head of the assembly. *He* [is] Saviour of the body. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
24  But even as the assembly is subjected to the Christ, so also wives to their own husbands in everything. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing.
25  Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
26  in order that he might sanctify it, purifying [it] by the washing of water by [the] word, That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
27  that *he* might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless. That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
28  So ought men also to love their own wives as their own bodies: he that loves his own wife loves himself. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
29  For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly: For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
30  for we are members of his body; [we are of his flesh, and of his bones.] For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
31  Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
32  This mystery is great, but *I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
33  But *ye* also, every one of you, let each so love his own wife as himself; but as to the wife [I speak] that she may fear the husband. Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife [see] that she reverence [her] husband.
{6}
1  Children, obey your parents in [the] Lord, for this is just. Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
2  Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)
3  that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest be long-lived on the earth. That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
4  And [ye] fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in [the] discipline and admonition of [the] Lord. And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
5  Bondmen, obey masters according to flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity of your heart as to the Christ; Servants, be obedient to them that are [your] masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
6  not with eye-service as men-pleasers; but as bondmen of Christ, doing the will of God from [the] soul, Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
7  serving with good will as to the Lord, and not to men; With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:
8  knowing that whatever good each shall do, this he shall receive of [the] Lord, whether bond or free. Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether [he be] bond or free.
9  And, masters, do the same things towards them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their and your Master is in heaven, and there is no acceptance of persons with him. And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
10  For the rest, brethren, be strong in [the] Lord, and in the might of his strength. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
11  Put on the panoply of God, that ye may be able to stand against the artifices of the devil: Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
12  because our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual [power] of wickedness in the heavenlies. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high [places].
13  For this reason take [to you] the panoply of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having accomplished all things, to stand. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
14  Stand therefore, having girt about your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
15  and shod your feet with [the] preparation of the glad tidings of peace: And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
16  besides all [these], having taken the shield of faith with which ye will be able to quench all the inflamed darts of the wicked one. Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
17  Have also the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is God's word; And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
18  praying at all seasons, with all prayer and supplication in [the] Spirit, and watching unto this very thing with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints; Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
19  and for me in order that utterance may be given to me in [the] opening of my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the glad tidings, And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
20  for which I am an ambassador [bound] with a chain, that I may be bold in it as I ought to speak. For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
21  But in order that *ye* also may know what concerns me, how I am getting on, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in [the] Lord, shall make all things known to you; But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
22  whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that ye may know of our affairs and that he may encourage your hearts. Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and [that] he might comfort your hearts.
23  Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God [the] Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
24  Grace with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Grace [be] with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. <<[To [the] Ephesians written from Rome, by Tychicus.]>>
