22  Who rejoice even exultingly and are glad when they find the grave? -- Which rejoice exceedingly, [and] are glad, when they can find the grave?
23  To the man whose way is hidden, and whom +God hath hedged in? [Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
24  For my sighing cometh before my bread, and my groanings are poured out like the waters. For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
