{#1 Corinthians}
{1}
1  Paul, [a] called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother, Paul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes [our] brother,
2  to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to [those] sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours: Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
3  Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
4  I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;
5  that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word [of doctrine], and all knowledge, That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and [in] all knowledge;
6  (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,) Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
7  so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
8  who shall also confirm you to [the] end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. Who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that ye may be] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
9  God [is] faithful, by whom ye have been called into [the] fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
10  Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and [that] there be no divisions among you; but [that] ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
11  For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of [the house of] Chloe, that there are strifes among you. For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them [which are of the house] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
12  But I speak of this, that each of you says, *I* am of Paul, and *I* of Apollos, and *I* of Cephas, and *I* of Christ. Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
13  Is the Christ divided? has Paul been crucified for you? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul? Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
14  I thank God that I have baptised none of you, unless Crispus and Gaius, I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
15  that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name. Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
16  Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other. And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
17  For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
18  For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power. For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
19  For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
20  Where [is the] wise? where scribe? where disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? Where [is] the wise? where [is] the scribe? where [is] the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
21  For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe. For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
22  Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom; For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
23  but *we* preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness; But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
24  but to those that [are] called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God's power and God's wisdom. But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
25  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
26  For consider your calling, brethren, that [there are] not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born. For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:
27  But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things; But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
28  and the ignoble things of the world, and the despised, has God chosen, [and] things that are not, that he may annul the things that are; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, [yea], and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:
29  so that no flesh should boast before God. That no flesh should glory in his presence.
30  But of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption; But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
31  that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in [the] Lord. That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
{2}
1  And *I*, when I came to you, brethren, came not in excellency of word, or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God. And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
2  For I did not judge [it well] to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified. For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
3  And *I* was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling; And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
4  and my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of [the] Spirit and of power; And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
5  that your faith might not stand in men's wisdom, but in God's power. That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
6  But we speak wisdom among the perfect; but wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to nought. Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
7  But we speak God's wisdom in [a] mystery, that hidden [wisdom] which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom], which God ordained before the world unto our glory:
8  which none of the princes of this age knew, (for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;) Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known [it], they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
9  but according as it is written, Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
10  but God has revealed to us by [his] Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. But God hath revealed [them] unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
11  For who of men hath known the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? thus also the things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
12  But *we* have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which [is] of God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God: Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
13  which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual [things] by spiritual [means]. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
14  But [the] natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him; and he cannot know [them] because they are spiritually discerned; But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned.
15  but the spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
16  For who has known the mind of [the] Lord, who shall instruct him? But *we* have the mind of Christ. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
{3}
1  And *I*, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ. And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, [even] as unto babes in Christ.
2  I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able; I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able [to bear it], neither yet now are ye able.
3  for ye are yet carnal. For whereas [there are] among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man? For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
4  For when one says, *I* am of Paul, and another, *I* of Apollos, are ye not men? For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
5  Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each. Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
6  *I* have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase. I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
7  So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
8  But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
9  For we are God's fellow-workmen; ye are God's husbandry, God's building. For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, [ye are] God's building.
10  According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it. According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
11  For other foundation can no man lay besides that which [is] laid, which is Jesus Christ. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
12  Now if any one build upon [this] foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw, Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
13  the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare [it], because it is revealed in fire; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is. Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
14  If the work of any one which he has built upon [the foundation] shall abide, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
15  If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but *he* shall be saved, but so as through [the] fire. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
16  Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you? Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
17  If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are *ye*. If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.
18  Let no one deceive himself: if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise. Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
19  For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
20  And again, [The] Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are vain. And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
21  So that let no one boast in men; for all things are yours. Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
22  Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are yours; Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
23  and *ye* [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's. And ye are Christ's; and Christ [is] God's.
{4}
1  Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of [the] mysteries of God. Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
2  Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found faithful. Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
3  But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined of you or of man's day. Nor do I even examine myself. But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
4  For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord. For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
5  So that do not judge anything before [the] time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have [his] praise from God. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
6  Now these things, brethren, I have transferred, in their application, to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us the [lesson of] not [letting your thoughts go] above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for [such a] one against another. And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.
7  For who makes thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou hast not received? but if also thou hast received, why boastest thou as not receiving? For who maketh thee to differ [from another]? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive [it], why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received [it]?
8  Already ye are filled; already ye have been enriched; ye have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that *we* also might reign with you. Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
9  For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men. For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.
10  *We* [are] fools for Christ's sake, but *ye* prudent in Christ: *we* weak, but *ye* strong: *ye* glorious, but *we* in dishonour. We [are] fools for Christ's sake, but ye [are] wise in Christ; we [are] weak, but ye [are] strong; ye [are] honourable, but we [are] despised.
11  To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are in nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home, Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
12  and labour, working with our own hands. Railed at, we bless; persecuted, we suffer [it]; And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:
13  insulted, we entreat: we are become as [the] offscouring of the world, [the] refuse of all, until now. Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, [and are] the offscouring of all things unto this day.
14  Not [as] chiding do I write these things to you, but as my beloved children I admonish [you]. I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn [you].
15  For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you through the glad tidings. For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
16  I entreat you therefore, be my imitators. Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
17  For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in [the] Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways [as] they [are] in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly. For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
18  But some have been puffed up, as if I were not coming to you; Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
19  but I will come quickly to you, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of those that are puffed up, but the power. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
20  For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power. For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.
21  What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love, and [in] a spirit of meekness? What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and [in] the spirit of meekness?
{5}
1  It is universally reported [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as [is] not even among the nations, so that one should have his father's wife. It is reported commonly [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.
2  And *ye* are puffed up, and ye have not rather mourned, in order that he that has done this deed might be taken away out of the midst of you. And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
3  For *I*, [as] absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as present, For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, [concerning] him that hath so done this deed,
4  [to deliver,] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this: In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
5  to deliver him, [I say,] [being] such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
6  Your boasting [is] not good. Do ye not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Your glorying [is] not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
7  Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened. For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
8  so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.
9  I have written to you in the epistle not to mix with fornicators; I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
10  not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the avaricious and rapacious, or idolaters, since [then] ye should go out of the world. Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
11  But now I have written to you, if any one called brother be fornicator, or avaricious, or idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or rapacious, not to mix with [him]; with such a one not even to eat. But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
12  For what have *I* [to do] with judging those outside also? *ye*, do not ye judge them that are within? For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
13  But those without God judges. Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves. But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
{6}
1  Dare any one of you, having a matter against another, prosecute his suit before the unjust, and not before the saints? Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
2  Do ye not then know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy of [the] smallest judgments? Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
3  Do ye not know that we shall judge angels? and not then matters of this life? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
4  If then ye have judgments as to things of this life, set those [to judge] who are little esteemed in the assembly. If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
5  I speak to you [to put you] to shame. Thus there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who shall be able to decide between his brethren! I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
6  But brother prosecutes his suit with brother, and that before unbelievers. But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
7  Already indeed then it is altogether a fault in you that ye have suits between yourselves. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong? why are ye not rather defrauded? Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather [suffer yourselves to] be defrauded?
8  But *ye* do wrong, and defraud, and this [your] brethren. Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that [your] brethren.
9  Do ye not know that unrighteous [persons] shall not inherit [the] kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who make women of themselves, nor who abuse themselves with men, Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
10  nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor abusive persons, nor [the] rapacious, shall inherit [the] kingdom of God. Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
11  And these things were some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
12  All things are lawful to me, but all things do not profit; all things are lawful to me, but *I* will not be brought under the power of any. All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
13  Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God will bring to nothing both it and them: but the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
14  And God has both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up from among [the dead] by his power. And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
15  Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then, taking the members of the Christ, make [them] members of a harlot? Far be the thought. Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make [them] the members of an harlot? God forbid.
16  Do ye not know that he [that is] joined to the harlot is one body? for the two, he says, shall be one flesh. What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
17  But he that [is] joined to the Lord is one Spirit. But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
18  Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may practise is without the body, but he that commits fornication sins against his own body. Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
19  Do ye not know that your body is [the] temple of the Holy Spirit which [is] in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own? What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost [which is] in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
20  for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your body. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
{7}
1  But concerning the things of which ye have written [to me]: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman; Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman.
2  but on account of fornications, let each have his own wife, and each [woman] have her own husband. Nevertheless, [to avoid] fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
3  Let the husband render her due to the wife, and in like manner the wife to the husband. Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
4  The wife has not authority over her own body, but the husband: in like manner also the husband has not authority over his own body, but the wife. The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.
5  Defraud not one another, unless, it may be, by consent for a time, that ye may devote yourselves to prayer, and again be together, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency. Defraud ye not one the other, except [it be] with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.
6  But this I say, as consenting [to], not as commanding [it]. But I speak this by permission, [and] not of commandment.
7  Now I wish all men to be even as myself: but every one has his own gift of God: one man thus, and another thus. For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
8  But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them that they remain even as I. I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
9  But if they have not control over themselves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
10  But to the married I enjoin, not *I*, but the Lord, Let not wife be separated from husband; And unto the married I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from [her] husband:
11  (but if also she shall have been separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband;) and let not husband leave wife. But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband: and let not the husband put away [his] wife.
12  But as to the rest, *I* say, not the Lord, If any brother have an unbelieving wife, and *she* consent to dwell with him, let him not leave her. But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
13  And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to dwell with her, let her not leave [her] husband. And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
14  For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother; since [otherwise] indeed your children are unclean, but now they are holy. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
15  But if the unbeliever go away, let them go away; a brother or a sister is not bound in such [cases], but God has called us in peace. But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such [cases]: but God hath called us to peace.
16  For what knowest thou, O wife, if thou shalt save thy husband? or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt save thy wife? For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save [thy] husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save [thy] wife?
17  However, as the Lord has divided to each, as God has called each, so let him walk; and thus I ordain in all the assemblies. But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.
18  Has any one been called circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: has any one been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
19  Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but keeping God's commandments. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
20  Let each abide in that calling in which he has been called. Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
21  Hast thou been called [being] a bondman, let it not concern thee; but and if thou canst become free, use [it] rather. Art thou called [being] a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use [it] rather.
22  For the bondman that is called in [the] Lord is the Lord's freedman; in like manner [also] the freeman being called is Christ's bondman. For he that is called in the Lord, [being] a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, [being] free, is Christ's servant.
23  Ye have been bought with a price; do not be the bondmen of men. Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
24  Let each, wherein he is called, brethren, therein abide with God. Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
25  But concerning virgins, I have no commandment of [the] Lord; but I give my opinion, as having received mercy of [the] Lord to be faithful. Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
26  I think then that this is good, on account of the present necessity, that [it is] good for a man to remain so as he is. I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, [I say], that [it is] good for a man so to be.
27  Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed; art thou free from a wife? do not seek a wife. Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
28  But if thou shouldest also marry, thou hast not sinned; and if the virgin marry, they have not sinned: but such shall have tribulation in the flesh; but I spare you. But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.
29  But this I say, brethren, the time is straitened. For the rest, that they who have wives, be as not having [any]: But this I say, brethren, the time [is] short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;
30  and they that weep, as not weeping; and they that rejoice, as not rejoicing; and they that buy, as not possessing; And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
31  and they that use the world, as not disposing of it as their own; for the fashion of this world passes. And they that use this world, as not abusing [it]: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
32  But I wish you to be without care. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord; But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
33  but he that has married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please his wife. But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please [his] wife.
34  There is a difference between the wife and the virgin. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she that has married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband. There is difference [also] between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please [her] husband.
35  But I say this for your own profit; not that I may set a snare before you, but for what [is] seemly, and waiting on the Lord without distraction. And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
36  But if any one think that he behaves unseemly to his virginity, if he be beyond the flower of his age, and so it must be, let him do what he will, he does not sin: let them marry. But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of [her] age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
37  But he who stands firm in his heart, having no need, but has authority over his own will, and has judged this in his heart to keep his own virginity, he does well. Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.
38  So that he that marries himself does well; and he that does not marry does better. So then he that giveth [her] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth [her] not in marriage doeth better.
39  A wife is bound for whatever time her husband lives; but if the husband be fallen asleep, she is free to be married to whom she will, only in [the] Lord. The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
40  But she is happier if she so remain, according to my judgment; but I think that *I* also have God's Spirit. But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.

1  But concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
2  If any one think he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know [it]. And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
3  But if any one love God, *he* is known of him): But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
4  -- concerning then the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing in [the] world, and that there [is] no other God save one. As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing in the world, and that [there is] none other God but one.
5  For and if indeed there are [those] called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are gods many, and lords many,) For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
6  yet to us [there is] one God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom [are] all things, and *we* by him. But to us [there is but] one God, the Father, of whom [are] all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom [are] all things, and we by him.
7  But knowledge [is] not in all: but some, with conscience of the idol, until now eat as of a thing sacrificed to idols; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. Howbeit [there is] not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat [it] as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
8  But meat does not commend us to God; neither if we should not eat do we come short; nor if we should eat have we an advantage. But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
9  But see lest anywise this your right [to eat] itself be a stumbling-block to the weak. But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
10  For if any one see thee, who hast knowledge, sitting at table in an idol-house, shall not his conscience, he being weak, be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to the idol? For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;
11  and the weak [one], the brother for whose sake Christ died, will perish through thy knowledge. And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
12  Now, thus sinning against the brethren, and wounding their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
13  Wherefore if meat be a fall-trap to my brother, I will eat no flesh for ever, that I may not be a fall-trap to my brother. Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
{9}
1  Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not *ye* my work in [the] Lord? Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
2  If I am not an apostle to others, yet at any rate I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are *ye* in [the] Lord. If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
3  My defence to those who examine me is this: Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,
4  Have we not a right to eat and to drink? Have we not power to eat and to drink?
5  have we not a right to take round a sister [as] wife, as also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and [as] the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
6  Or *I* alone and Barnabas, have we not a right not to work? Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
7  Who ever carries on war at his own charges? who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? or who herds a flock and does not eat of the milk of the flock? Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
8  Do I speak these things as a man, or does not the law also say these things? Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
9  For in the law of Moses it is written, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that is treading out corn. Is God occupied about the oxen, For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
10  or does he say [it] altogether for our sakes? For for our sakes it has been written, that the plougher should plough in hope, and he that treads out corn, in hope of partaking of [it]. Or saith he [it] altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, [this] is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.
11  If we have sown to you spiritual things, [is it a] great [thing] if *we* shall reap your carnal things? If we have sown unto you spiritual things, [is it] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
12  If others partake of this right over you, should not rather *we*? But we have not used this right, but we bear all things, that we may put no hindrance in the way of the glad tidings of the Christ. If others be partakers of [this] power over you, [are] not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
13  Do ye not know that they who labour [at] sacred things eat of the [offerings offered in the] temple; they that attend at the altar partake with the altar? Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live [of the things] of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
14  So also the Lord has ordained to those that announce the glad tidings to live of the glad tidings. Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
15  But *I* have used none of these things. Now I have not written these things that it should be thus in my case; for [it were] good for me rather to die than that any one should make vain my boast. But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for [it were] better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
16  For if I announce the glad tidings, I have nothing to boast of; for a necessity is laid upon me; for it is woe to me if I should not announce the glad tidings. For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
17  For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with an administration. For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation [of the gospel] is committed unto me.
18  What is the reward then that I have? That in announcing the glad tidings I make the glad tidings costless [to others], so as not to have made use, as belonging to me, of my right in [announcing] the glad tidings. What is my reward then? [Verily] that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.
19  For being free from all, I have made myself bondman to all, that I might gain the most [possible]. For though I be free from all [men], yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
20  And I became to the Jews as a Jew, in order that I might gain the Jews: to those under law, as under law, not being myself under law, in order that I might gain those under law: And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
21  to those without law, as without law, (not as without law to God, but as legitimately subject to Christ,) in order that I might gain [those] without law. To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.
22  I became to the weak, [as] weak, in order that I might gain the weak. To all I have become all things, in order that at all events I might save some. To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all [men], that I might by all means save some.
23  And I do all things for the sake of the glad tidings, that I may be fellow-partaker with them. And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with [you].
24  Know ye not that they who run in [the] race-course run all, but one receives the prize? Thus run in order that ye may obtain. Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
25  But every one that contends [for a prize] is temperate in all things: *they* then indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown, but *we* an incorruptible. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
26  *I* therefore thus run, as not uncertainly; so I combat, as not beating the air. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:
27  But I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest [after] having preached to others I should be myself rejected. But I keep under my body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
{10}
1  For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
2  and all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
3  and all ate the same spiritual food, And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
4  and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed [them]: (now the rock was the Christ;) And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
5  yet God was not pleased with the most of them, for they were strewed in the desert. But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
6  But these things happened [as] types of us, that we should not be lusters after evil things, as they also lusted. Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
7  Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. Neither be ye idolaters, as [were] some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
8  Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
9  Neither let us tempt the Christ, as some of them tempted, and perished by serpents. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.
10  Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer. Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.
11  Now all these things happened to them [as] types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come. Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
12  So that let him that thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
13  No temptation has taken you but such as is according to man's nature; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able [to bear], but will with the temptation make the issue also, so that [ye] should be able to bear [it]. There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it].
14  Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
15  I speak as to intelligent [persons]: do *ye* judge what I say. I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
16  The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not [the] communion of the blood of the Christ? The bread which we break, is it not [the] communion of the body of the Christ? The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
17  Because we, [being] many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf. For we [being] many are one bread, [and] one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.
18  See Israel according to flesh: are not they who eat the sacrifices in communion with the altar? Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
19  What then do I say? that what is sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
20  But that what [the nations] sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. Now I do not wish you to be in communion with demons. But I [say], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.
21  Ye cannot drink [the] Lord's cup, and [the] cup of demons: ye cannot partake of [the] Lord's table, and of [the] table of demons. Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.
22  Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
23  All things are lawful, but all are not profitable; all things are lawful, but all do not edify. All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
24  Let no one seek his own [advantage], but that of the other. Let no man seek his own, but every man another's [wealth].
25  Everything sold in the shambles eat, making no inquiry for conscience sake. Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, [that] eat, asking no question for conscience sake:
26  For the earth [is] the Lord's and its fulness. For the earth [is] the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.
27  But if any one of the unbelievers invite you, and ye are minded to go, all that is set before you eat, making no inquiry for conscience sake. If any of them that believe not bid you [to a feast], and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
28  But if any one say to you, This is offered to holy purposes, do not eat, for his sake that pointed it out, and conscience sake; But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth [is] the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:
29  but conscience, I mean, not thine own, but that of the other: for why is my liberty judged by another conscience? Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another [man's] conscience?
30  If *I* partake with thanksgiving, why am I spoken evil of for what *I* give thanks for? For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
31  Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatever ye do, do all things to God's glory. Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
32  Give no occasion to stumbling, whether to Jews, or Greeks, or the assembly of God. Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:
33  Even as *I* also please all in all things; not seeking my own profit, but that of the many, that they may be saved. Even as I please all [men] in all [things], not seeking mine own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved.
{11}
1  Be my imitators, even as *I* also [am] of Christ. Be ye followers of me, even as I also [am] of Christ.
2  Now I praise you, that in all things ye are mindful of me; and that as I have directed you, ye keep the directions. Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered [them] to you.
3  But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head [is] the man, and the Christ's head God. But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman [is] the man; and the head of Christ [is] God.
4  Every man praying or prophesying, having [anything] on his head, puts his head to shame. Every man praying or prophesying, having [his] head covered, dishonoureth his head.
5  But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered puts her own head to shame; for it is one and the same as a shaved [woman]. But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with [her] head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
6  For if a woman be not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if [it be] shameful to a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered. For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
7  For man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being God's image and glory; but woman is man's glory. For a man indeed ought not to cover [his] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
8  For man is not of woman, but woman of man. For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
9  For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
10  Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head, on account of the angels. For this cause ought the woman to have power on [her] head because of the angels.
11  However, neither [is] woman without man, nor man without woman, in [the] Lord. Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
12  For as the woman [is] of the man, so also [is] the man by the woman, but all things of God. For as the woman [is] of the man, even so [is] the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
13  Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman should pray to God uncovered? Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
14  Does not even nature itself teach you, that man, if he have long hair, it is a dishonour to him? Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
15  But woman, if she have long hair, [it is] glory to her; for the long hair is given [to her] in lieu of a veil. But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for [her] hair is given her for a covering.
16  But if any one think to be contentious, *we* have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God. But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
17  But [in] prescribing [to you on] this [which I now enter on], I do not praise, [namely,] that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse. Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
18  For first, when ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you, and I partly give credit [to it]. For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
19  For there must also be sects among you, that the approved may become manifest among you. For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
20  When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat [the] Lord's supper. When ye come together therefore into one place, [this] is not to eat the Lord's supper.
21  For each one in eating takes his *own* supper before [others], and one is hungry and another drinks to excess. For in eating every one taketh before [other] his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
22  Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them who have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this [point] I do not praise. What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not.
23  For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread:
24  and having given thanks broke [it], and said, This is my body, which [is] for you: this do in remembrance of me. And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
25  In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink [it], in remembrance of me. After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.
26  For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.
27  So that whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
28  But let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup.
29  For [the] eater and drinker eats and drinks judgment to himself, not distinguishing the body. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
30  On this account many among you [are] weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep. For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
31  But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
32  But being judged, we are disciplined of [the] Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
33  So that, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
34  If any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not come together for judgment. But the other things, whenever I come, I will set in order. And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
{12}
1  But concerning spiritual [manifestations], brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant. Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
2  Ye know that when ye were [of the] nations [ye were] led away to dumb idols, in whatever way ye might be led. Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
3  I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in [the power of the] Spirit of God, says, Curse [on] Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in [the power of the] Holy Spirit. Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and [that] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
4  But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
5  and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord; And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
6  and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
7  But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
8  For to one, by the Spirit, is given [the] word of wisdom; and to another [the] word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
9  and to a different one faith, in [the power of] the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in [the power of] the same Spirit; To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
10  and to another operations of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to a different one kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues. To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
11  But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as he pleases. But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
12  For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also [is] the Christ. For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is] Christ.
13  For also in [the power of] one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
14  For also the body is not one member but many. For the body is not one member, but many.
15  If the foot say, Because I am not a hand I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body? If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
16  And if the ear say, Because I am not an eye I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body? And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
17  If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if all hearing, where the smelling? If the whole body [were] an eye, where [were] the hearing? If the whole [were] hearing, where [were] the smelling?
18  But now God has set the members, each one of them in the body, according as it has pleased [him]. But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
19  But if all were one member, where the body? And if they were all one member, where [were] the body?
20  But now the members [are] many, and the body one. But now [are they] many members, yet but one body.
21  The eye cannot say to the hand, I have not need of thee; or again, the head to the feet, I have not need of you. And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
22  But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
23  and those [parts] of the body which we esteem to be the more void of honour, these we clothe with more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness; And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness.
24  but our comely [parts] have not need. But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to [the part] that lacked; For our comely [parts] have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that [part] which lacked:
25  that there might be no division in the body, but that the members might have the same concern one for another. That there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.
26  And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with [it]; and if one member be glorified, all the members rejoice with [it]. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
27  Now *ye* are Christ's body, and members in particular. Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
28  And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues. And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
29  [Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all [in possession of] miraculous powers? [Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all workers of miracles?
30  have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
31  But desire earnestly the greater gifts, and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence. But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
{13}
1  If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become [as] sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
2  And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
3  And if I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not love, I profit nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor], and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
4  Love has long patience, is kind; love is not emulous [of others]; love is not insolent and rash, is not puffed up, Charity suffereth long, [and] is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
5  does not behave in an unseemly manner, does not seek what is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute evil, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
6  does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth, Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
7  bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
8  Love never fails; but whether prophecies, they shall be done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be done away. Charity never faileth: but whether [there be] prophecies, they shall fail; whether [there be] tongues, they shall cease; whether [there be] knowledge, it shall vanish away.
9  For we know in part, and we prophesy in part: For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
10  but when that which is perfect has come, that which is in part shall be done away. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
11  When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; when I became a man, I had done with what belonged to the child. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
12  For we see now through a dim window obscurely, but then face to face; now I know partially, but then I shall know according as I also have been known. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
13  And now abide faith, hope, love; these three things; and the greater of these [is] love. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity.
{14}
1  Follow after love, and be emulous of spiritual [manifestations], but rather that ye may prophesy. Follow after charity, and desire spiritual [gifts], but rather that ye may prophesy.
2  For he that speaks with a tongue does not speak to men but to God: for no one hears; but in spirit he speaks mysteries. For he that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth [him]; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
3  But he that prophesies speaks to men [in] edification, and encouragement, and consolation. But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men [to] edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
4  He that speaks with a tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies [the] assembly. He that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
5  Now I desire that ye should all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy. But greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, unless he interpret, that the assembly may receive edification. I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater [is] he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
6  And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I shall speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching? Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
7  Even lifeless things giving a sound, whether pipe or harp, if they give not distinction to the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
8  For also, if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for war? For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
9  Thus also *ye* with the tongue, unless ye give a distinct speech, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking to the air. So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.
10  There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of undistinguishable sound. There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them [is] without signification.
11  If therefore I do not know the power of the sound, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks a barbarian for me. Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh [shall be] a barbarian unto me.
12  Thus *ye* also, since ye are desirous of spirits, seek that ye may abound for the edification of the assembly. Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
13  Wherefore let him that speaks with a tongue pray that he may interpret. Wherefore let him that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue pray that he may interpret.
14  For if I pray with a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. For if I pray in an [unknown] tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
15  What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
16  Since otherwise, if thou blessest with [the] spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the simple [Christian] say Amen, at thy giving of thanks, since he does not know what thou sayest? Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
17  For *thou* indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
18  I thank God I speak in a tongue more than all of you: I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:
19  but in [the] assembly I desire to speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also, [rather] than ten thousand words in a tongue. Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that [by my voice] I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue.
20  Brethren, be not children in [your] minds, but in malice be babes; but in [your] minds be grown [men]. Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.
21  It is written in the law, By people of other tongues, and by strange lips, will I speak to this people; and neither thus will they hear me, saith the Lord. In the law it is written, With [men of] other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.
22  So that tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to unbelievers; but prophecy, not to unbelievers, but to those who believe. Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying [serveth] not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.
23  If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and simple [persons] enter in, or unbelievers, will not they say ye are mad? If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in [those that are] unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
24  But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or simple [person] come in, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all; But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or [one] unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:
25  the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling upon [his] face, he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you. And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on [his] face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.
26  What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each [of you] has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edification. How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.
27  If any one speak with a tongue, [let it be] two, or at the most three, and separately, and let one interpret; If any man speak in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most [by] three, and [that] by course; and let one interpret.
28  but if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in [the] assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God. But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
29  And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge. Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
30  But if there be a revelation to another sitting [there], let the first be silent. If [any thing] be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.
31  For ye can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
32  And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
33  For God is not [a God] of disorder but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints. For God is not [the author] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
34  Let [your] women be silent in the assemblies, for it is not permitted to them to speak; but to be in subjection, as the law also says. Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but [they are commanded] to be under obedience, as also saith the law.
35  But if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in assembly. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
36  Did the word of God go out from you, or did it come to you only? What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?
37  If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is [the] Lord's commandment. If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.
38  But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant. But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
39  So that, brethren, desire to prophesy, and do not forbid the speaking with tongues. Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
40  But let all things be done comelily and with order. Let all things be done decently and in order.
{15}
1  But I make known to you, brethren, the glad tidings which I announced to you, which also ye received, in which also ye stand, Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2  by which also ye are saved, (if ye hold fast the word which I announced to you as the glad tidings,) unless indeed ye have believed in vain. By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
3  For I delivered to you, in the first place, what also I had received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
4  and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
5  and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
6  Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also have fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
7  Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
8  and last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to *me* also. And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
9  For *I* am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called apostle, because I have persecuted the assembly of God. For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
10  But by God's grace I am what I am; and his grace, which [was] towards me, has not been vain; but I have laboured more abundantly than they all, but not *I*, but the grace of God which [was] with me. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which [was bestowed] upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
11  Whether, therefore, I or they, thus we preach, and thus ye have believed. Therefore whether [it were] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
12  Now if Christ is preached that he is raised from among [the] dead, how say some among you that there is not a resurrection of [those that are] dead? Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
13  But if there is not a resurrection of [those that are] dead, neither is Christ raised: But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
14  but if Christ is not raised, then, indeed, vain also [is] our preaching, and vain also your faith. And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain.
15  And we are found also false witnesses of God; for we have witnessed concerning God that he raised the Christ, whom he has not raised if indeed [those that are] dead are not raised. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
16  For if [those that are] dead are not raised, neither is Christ raised; For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
17  but if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins. And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins.
18  Then indeed also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
19  If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are [the] most miserable of all men. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
20  (But now Christ is raised from among [the] dead, first-fruits of those fallen asleep. But now is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept.
21  For since by man [came] death, by man also resurrection of [those that are] dead. For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.
22  For as in the Adam all die, thus also in the Christ all shall be made alive. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
23  But each in his own rank: [the] first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at his coming. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
24  Then the end, when he gives up the kingdom to him [who is] God and Father; when he shall have annulled all rule and all authority and power. Then [cometh] the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
25  For he must reign until he put all enemies under his feet. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
26  [The] last enemy [that] is annulled [is] death. The last enemy [that] shall be destroyed [is] death.
27  For he has put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he says that all things are put in subjection, [it is] evident that [it is] except him who put all things in subjection to him. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under [him, it is] manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.
28  But when all things shall have been brought into subjection to him, then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all.) And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
29  Since what shall the baptised for the dead do if [those that are] dead rise not at all? why also are they baptised for them? Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
30  Why do *we* also endanger ourselves every hour? And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
31  Daily I die, by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
32  If, [to speak] after the manner of man, I have fought with beasts in Ephesus, what is the profit to me if [those that are] dead do not rise? let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die. If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
33  Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
34  Awake up righteously, and sin not; for some are ignorant of God: I speak to you as a matter of shame. Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak [this] to your shame.
35  But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come? But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
36  Fool; what *thou* sowest is not quickened unless it die. [Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
37  And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain: it may be of wheat, or some one of the rest: And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other [grain]:
38  and God gives to it a body as he has pleased, and to each of the seeds its own body. But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
39  Every flesh [is] not the same flesh, but one [is] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another [flesh] of birds, and another of fishes. All flesh [is] not the same flesh: but [there is] one [kind of] flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, [and] another of birds.
40  And [there are] heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but different is the glory of the heavenly, different that of the earthly: [There are] also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial [is] one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial [is] another.
41  one [the] sun's glory, and another [the] moon's glory, and another [the] stars' glory; for star differs from star in glory. [There is] one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for [one] star differeth from [another] star in glory.
42  Thus also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility. So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
43  It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
44  It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body: if there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [one]. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
45  Thus also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a quickening spirit.
46  But that which is spiritual [was] not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual: Howbeit that [was] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
47  the first man out of [the] earth, made of dust; the second man, out of heaven. The first man [is] of the earth, earthy: the second man [is] the Lord from heaven.
48  Such as he made of dust, such also those made of dust; and such as the heavenly [one], such also the heavenly [ones]. As [is] the earthy, such [are] they also that are earthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they also that are heavenly.
49  And as we have borne the image of the [one] made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly [one]. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
50  But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom, nor does corruption inherit incorruptibility. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
51  Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed, Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
52  in an instant, in [the] twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and *we* shall be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
53  For this corruptible must needs put on incorruptibility, and this mortal put on immortality. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.
54  But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word written: Death has been swallowed up in victory. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
55  Where, O death, [is] thy sting? where, O death, thy victory? O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory?
56  Now the sting of death [is] sin, and the power of sin the law; The sting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law.
57  but thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ. But thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
58  So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in [the] Lord. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

1  Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the assemblies of Galatia, so do *ye* do also. Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
2  On [the] first of [the] week let each of you put by at home, laying up [in] whatever [degree] he may have prospered, that there may be no collections when I come.

7  For I will not see you now in passing, for I hope to remain a certain time with you, if the Lord permit. For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
8  But I remain in Ephesus until Pentecost. But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

10  Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear; for he works the work of the Lord, even as I. Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also [do].
11  Let not therefore any one despise him; but set him forward in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren. Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
12  Now concerning the brother Apollos, I begged him much that he would go to you with the brethren; but it was not at all [his] will to go now; but he will come when he shall have good opportunity. As touching [our] brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
13  Be vigilant; stand fast in the faith; quit yourselves like men; be strong. Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
14  Let all things ye do be done in love. Let all your things be done with charity.
15  But I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the saints for service,) I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and [that] they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
16  that *ye* should also be subject to such, and to every one joined in the work and labouring. That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with [us], and laboureth.
17  But I rejoice in the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus; because *they* have supplied what was lacking on your part. I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
18  For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: own therefore such. For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.

21  The salutation of [me] Paul with my own hand. The salutation of [me] Paul with mine own hand.
22  If any one love not the Lord [Jesus Christ] let him be Anathema Maranatha. If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
23  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.
24  My love [be] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. My love [be] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. <<[The first [epistle] to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus and Timotheus.]>>
