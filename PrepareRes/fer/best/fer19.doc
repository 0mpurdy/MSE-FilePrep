INDIVIDUALITY IN THE SERVANT
@1 Timothy 3: 1 - 16
F.E.R. It is helpful to remember that these two epistles and the epistle to Titus were written to individuals; so that what comes out in them has reference to individual conduct pretty much. What comes out in epistles addressed to churches is more general. Both Timothy and Titus were servants, and a great deal is brought out in these epistles which is intended to govern the conduct of the servant. Nothing can be more important at the present day than that the sense of individuality should be maintained with us -- everything depends on that. One's position is that one stands apart from the great organizations into which christianity has involved itself. In doing that, however, we have to be uncommonly careful that we do not constitute ourselves another organization. This would only add to the confusion. Two or three of us may be able to walk together, but it does not necessarily follow that we form a kind of community or body.
F.W.T. I suppose it would be necessary to have learned what was written to the churches, before the conduct here could be carried out?
F.E.R. Yes. In the first few chapters the apostle gives the position, and proper order of the church of God -- "These things write I ... that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God" (verses 14, 15). The apostle has tarried long, and it leaves a long interval in which a man ought to know how to behave himself in the house of God. That is the great point in the first epistle; in the second epistle the point is that we should not be ashamed of the testimony. The one comes before the other; before he can take up the testimony, a man needs to know how to behave himself in the
{2}
house of God. That should be the principle governing a true servant of God today.
The first few chapters present what marks the house of God; you cannot get any representation of that in christendom today. The truth is the agreement for walking with one another. The first obligation of the servant, and of everybody, is to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit. The servant shows other people what is right by practising it himself; the apostle said to Timothy, "Be thou an example of the believers". The servant takes the humblest place, "I am among you as he that serveth" the Lord said.
The servant knows what is right, and not only so, but he sets the example of what is right. Clergy and ministers take the place of servants, but there are a great number among them whom it would be very undesirable to copy. They preach one thing, but do not exactly practise what they preach. The servant should practise what is right and we should follow those who are servants. It is a very important point for everyone of us to take care what company we keep -- whom we follow.
In chapters 2 and 3 there is nothing which answers to what you get in christendom. Where can you find any allusion to clergy? Yet they are a very important item in christendom. The position of the church is intercessory, and the men are to "pray every where". The woman is not to usurp authority over the man (chapter 2). Then in chapter 3 there is no idea of gifts. The elder people should take oversight of people's souls and deacons should take care of their bodies.
Rem. We often find those who are not qualified according to the third chapter, acting in the position of bishop, etc.
F.E.R. But where are you to find the house of God? That is the great difficulty at the present day;
{3}
but if you cannot find the house of God in the concrete form, one ought to know how to behave oneself there. So long as the Spirit of God is abiding here, every one of us is under obligation to know how to behave himself in the house of God. All those who are baptized by the Spirit form the house of God.
The great value of these epistles is not simply to mark out the path of the servants, but they lay great stress upon individual fidelity when the church has failed. The great organizations around do not answer to the church of God at all. When you see that and stand apart from them, then it is you seek to know how a man should behave himself in the house of God. What marks those in the house of God is lowliness, meekness, forbearing one another in love, and so on.
The common idea of ruin is a broken down thing -- and all around us is that which is great in the eyes of men -- the mustard tree. Men have adapted christianity to the world as it is, but that is corruption and not outside of the system of this world. People come into the house of God through the figure of baptism -- it was never meant at all to be accommodated to this world. Just think of what christianity as adapted to this world will be in the end. It will be that all christianity is lost, the form and shadow only left. The harlot rides the beast. Then take Sardis -- what christianity is left there? The world has accommodated christianity to itself and in result all christianity is gone. The mystery of iniquity already works, but the end of it will be that the Lord will come in judgment -- He treads the winepress of the wrath of God.
Professing christianity has assumed the form of a great house. Your obligation is to depart from unrighteousness and to purge yourself from vessels to dishonour. Hence you will certainly have to leave
{4}
a great deal that is round about you in christendom. Wherever you get the refusal or non-admission of the rights of God in Christ, that is what I should call unrighteousness. In Corinthians we get "purge out", but we cannot purge out at the present day. We talk about putting out of fellowship, but now what it speaks to my mind is, that we say, I am not going to walk with that man. If a case turns up of a person who by his conduct shows that he is entirely unfit for christian company anywhere, under any circumstances, we put that person out; and that simply means to me that I will no longer walk with that man. In the existing state of things it is very much more a question of purging yourself from those who are going on unrighteously. 'Purging out' was connected with the power of the Spirit of God in the assembly. They put out the leaven; but now I purge myself from the leaven. The principle at the bottom is the same, but it is the altered condition of things that makes it necessary.
The idea has been abroad that the Spirit has a special gathering in these days, but the only gathering point to my mind is Christ. The eyes of a great many have been opened to discern the true state of things around, but as to any special gathering on the part of the Spirit of God, I do not believe in it a bit. If you stand apart from what is around and you give place to the Spirit of God, you begin to get light. It is an activity on the part of God to maintain truth in the church. It is an immense mercy to get your eyes opened, so as to have some discernment of the reality of things as they are in the eyes of God. There is another thing too -- you get the sense brought home to you of the presence of the Spirit of God. It is His working for the benefit of the whole church, for such a one is "serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work". These principles always hold good. Everything
{5}
in the early days was held together in the power of the Spirit. The only qualification that men had to carry out any function, was the Holy Spirit. Human organization has taken the place of the Holy Spirit, and in connection with human organization, you get the rule of man, and that is unrighteousness, it usurps the place of God.
Ques. Do you believe at all in a remnant?
F.E.R. No, I do not. I am very much afraid of any particular few people, arrogating to themselves the idea of a remnant. In Israel you get the idea of a remnant all through the prophets, but the remnant included *all* that was of God. There could be no remnant character to the church strictly speaking -- the church must be the complete thing.
I do not think we ought to have anything which in any way constitutes us a party. Take the House of Commons as an illustration. You must look upon it as a whole, but suppose you have got a few members who decline to belong to any one party and these people walk together, I do not think you could call them necessarily a party. It depends on whether they have some particular point or line of things which holds them together.
There are two things which come out in the house of God here: the mystery of piety (verse 16), and the warning of the Spirit (chapter 4). In the house of God you put everything together in regard to Christ. God has been "manifest in the flesh ... glory". That is the mystery. The initiated are able to put it together. It is only what is known in the house of God. It is a wonderful thing to think that "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit [resurrection], has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory". That is what is known to the initiated; it is not a
{6}
creed or a statement of doctrine, but it is a certainty known in regard to Christ.
Then you get the warning of the Spirit -- "The Spirit speaks expressly", and you get certain principles which attach to man. Asceticism is one thing, and then you get the importance which riches attach to man. In high churches and all that kind of thing, it is a peculiar kind of fleshly sanctity which gives importance to man. That is what comes out in chapter 4. Verse 16 of chapter 3 is your sheet anchor, your mainstay, and by it you have pretty good safeguard against what you get in chapter 4. People will hold one part of it often, but the great point is to put the whole together. That is the mystery of godliness, and that it is known in the house. The last clause, "received up in glory", carries you out of the world and you do not care to attach importance to man, as alluded to in chapter 4. It is amazing to me what an influence the clergy have over man.
It is a great thing to get a divinely given idea of the house of God; you cannot get it from christendom. It helps you to understand how a man should behave himself in the house of God. However small and limited your circle, you would endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
{7}
THE TESTIMONY
@2 Timothy 1: 1 - 18
F.E.R. The second epistle has a very different character from the first. In the first epistle the point is that a man should learn how to behave in the house of God; in the second epistle it is committing the testimony to Timothy unto the coming of the Lord. There is no doubt whatever that when things take the character which is presented in this epistle, the testimony refers to what is coming in. It carries you on to the appearing. You get something of the same principle in @Haggai 2: 9 -- they had to look on to the latter glory of the house. Of course the testimony always had its own proper place, but it comes more into prominence when things have assumed the character spoken of in this epistle. The testimony is the great interest of the people of God now, and the great point is not to be "ashamed of the testimony of our Lord ... power of God", verse 8. That thought runs through the epistle; in chapter 3 it is, "Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned"; and in chapter 4 he was to "preach the word" (verse 2). Also he says, "Watch thou make full proof of thy ministry". It is well to notice the first verse of chapter 4 too. The servant is looked upon as continuing until the appearing. The apostle passes off the scene, but Timothy represents the servant that continues until the appearing -- it is in that way the testimony is committed to him. In connection with it, the apostle contemplates four generations -- there was the apostle, Timothy, and he was to commit the testimony to faithful men, who should be able to teach others also, (chapter 2: 2).
Ques. What is the testimony?
F.E.R. That is a very hard question, but if you want a short answer, the testimony is the Christ.
{8}
I think it is of Christ and of all which shall be displayed in Christ -- Christ in relation to "all things". It is important to see that testimony always has reference to what is going to be displayed. There is nothing displayed at the present time but there is a great deal testified of it, but that which is testified of is going to be displayed. The appearing of the kingdom answers to the latter glory of the house. It is a very great comfort to have before your mind what is going to be displayed.
In the early days in the Acts of the Apostles, people were very much content with what was present. The Spirit ruled, and everything in the house of God took its character from the Spirit -- the disciples were filled with joy in the Holy Spirit -- and that kind of thing. You cannot get back to primitive christianity, and the testimony now comes into prominence, bringing before the mind what is going to be displayed. The best that can be done down here is most mean in comparison with the beginning, but the testimony is the latter glory of the house. People have to be in the testimony morally -- that comes out all through the epistle; "Be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus" -- the truth is to be held in "faith and love which is in Christ Jesus". Christ Jesus is really the testimony and all that will come out in the appearing of Christ in His glory is involved in the testimony now.
F.W.T. Was "the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth" a type of what Christ is in that way?
F.E.R. Exactly. He is the ark of the covenant, and on the ark of the covenant is the mercy-seat. It contemplates everything. The tabernacle was a type of what Christ was down here -- not exactly of what He is now, because the tabernacle could be taken down. What Christ was down here could be taken down, and was taken down, but there is
{9}
another truth in the Old Testament -- the tabernacle had to give way to the temple, and what was placed in the tabernacle was placed in the temple that Solomon built. The temple was permanent. Now you have got in Christ what is permanent. He says in @John 2: 19, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up he spoke of the temple of his body". I do not suppose God took account of the temple when Christ was here -- everything was covered by Christ for God. "All things" were really centred in and covered by one Man when Christ was here; that is the idea in my mind of the tabernacle. Everything was to be evolved from Christ -- that is what will come to pass. If you take earthly things, Israel will come out of Christ morally. Everything will be evolved from Christ.
Ques. Does that fit in with His being "Son over his [God's] house, whose house are *we*", and "He who has built all things is God"?
F.E.R. Yes. Moses was used as a ministering servant to set up a pattern of all things for a testimony of those things which should be seen after (@Hebrews 3). Now the "all things" have come into view. It is not altogether so much as Christ and the church, but a much wider idea; all the mystery of His will was covered by Christ.
In order to complete the figure of the tabernacle you must take in the priesthood. The great point was that the priest should 'touch' the mercy-seat; you could not get anything perfect until the priest could touch the mercy-seat. To have done that under the law would have meant death for the priest; but now, when you come to the reality of things, the High Priest has gone in and touched the mercy-seat. Hence you have got perfection, and the effect is that the approach is equal to the revelation. The ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat is more connected with coming out -- God has found a point in which
{10}
He can address Himself to man. On the ground of redemption God addresses Himself to man in Christ. But now, Man has gone in in Christ and touched the mercy-seat -- and what that means is, you have got perfection.
The mystery of the gospel (@Romans 16: 25; @Ephesians 1: 9, 10) is all that was centred in Christ, of which the tabernacle was figurative, and so is as much a subject of the Old Testament as of the New. The introduction of Christ really means this -- man has to go out of one door, but he can get in at another. Man has been terminated in the cross of Christ, but then he comes in by another door, and that is by the Spirit. The means by which God is going to regenerate the world is by Christ, but then men will not have Christ.
You get different thoughts connected with the table of shewbread and the candlestick; and in the outer court of the tabernacle there was the laver and the burnt offering, and they are very important elements in the world to come. The laver implied cleansing from the pollutions of the world, and the altar of burnt offering meant a place of acceptance. They are the first principles of the world to come. Everything is to be headed up in Christ. There are two very important points in connection with Christ: He is at the right hand of God, ascended far above all heavens to fill all things, on the ground of redemption -- and He is the giver of the Spirit. Man can come in on the ground of redemption, and receive the gift of the Spirit. Everything will be taken up on the ground of redemption; "By the grace of God he should taste death for every thing", and at the same time all is subdued in the power of the Spirit -- the tabernacle was anointed with oil.
The object of the testimony is to attach people to Christ -- to enable people to apprehend what Christ is as the divinely appointed centre, in the
{11}
value of redemption. "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me"; that is brought about in the soul by redemption and the gift of the Spirit. God makes known His rights in mercy -- that is redemption, and those rights come Out in Christ -- the point of attraction. If men are attached to Christ, they are brought into relation to the world to come, because that is centred in Christ. The testimony is spoken of as the "testimony of our Lord" -- it is His testimony. When the church has failed as a vessel of testimony, this test comes into peculiar prominence.
Ques. What is the "form of sound words" they were to hold fast?
F.E.R. It is "Have an outline of sound words" -- every part of truth may be fitted into its place in a person's mind. It is to be held fast in the power of the Holy Spirit. If people have things in a disorderly fashion in their minds, they will never be able to use them much. Things should be put together in an orderly way by the Spirit of God in people's minds. You want to see every part of Scripture in relation to every other part of Scripture. The whole gives an outline of the testimony of the Christ in relation to all things.
In every prophet Jehovah is presented in some particular aspect. The same thing is true in the gospels and in the epistles. Then the sum total of all these aspects makes up the completeness. Take Romans -- there you get the mercy seat, God declared His righteousness. In 1 Corinthians Christ is presented as the wisdom and the power of God, because the purpose of God is to overthrow all that existed and predominated in the mind of man, and to establish thoughts of Himself. In Colossians the great point is Christ as Head. In Ephesians Christ is ascended far above all heavens that He might fill all things. That really was presented in the ark of
{12}
the covenant, and the mercy-seat -- the glory of God filled the tabernacle. In 2 Corinthians He is the Yea and Amen. In Galatians He is the true Isaac, the vessel of Abraham's blessing to the gentiles. In 1 Thessalonians He is the harvestman, He gathers up the harvest. In 2 Thessalonians He treads the vintage. In all of the epistles you have the complete testimony of the Christ. No prophecy is of any private interpretation, it forms a part of the whole. So every epistle has to be viewed in relation to the other epistles.
Christ presents Himself to man in the value of redemption and as the giver of the Spirit. If we have been attracted to Christ and attached to Him by the Spirit, we have been taken out of the world, because we belong to the world of which Christ is the centre, and that is what gives force to the expression in this epistle, "in Christ Jesus". Salvation is "in Christ Jesus". God has called us to a holy calling, given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. Then Christ has annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light by the gospel, because in that scheme and system of which Christ is the Head, life and incorruptibility will be seen.
Rem. The testimony then is only administered by the Lord Himself here on earth by the power of the Spirit?
F.E.R. That is it; and the point is that we should not be ashamed of it. The great point is to maintain fidelity to the Lord, and not to be ashamed of the testimony. You want to lop off everything that is inconsistent with the testimony. I think very few christians have much apprehension of the scheme of divine purpose which is in Christ Jesus. It is an immense thing when it lays hold of one. I like to call it a universe because it takes in heaven and earth. I think people have missed the mind of God in the prophets in a way, because they have
{13}
not seen that the prophets take in heaven as well as the earth. He gathers up all things in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth. The tendency is to connect Christ and christianity with the present course of things. Hence it has tended to blind people to the idea of a world of which Christ is the Head, which involves the breaking up of this world, "Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth".
It is most important to apprehend that Christ has no relation to the present course of things down here -- He is the Head and beginning of God's world. The great point is to present Christ, according to what He is. To present Him as Saviour is only a limited way, because He is only Saviour to them that look for Him. In the gospel you present God in the light of a Saviour God who is favourable to all men, and you present the Mediator. The truth in the Mediator is that God and man have been brought together in Christ, and the only thing left for man is to come into attachment to Christ. The title of Saviour in regard to Christ looks on to Christ, on to the salvation of the body. "God has not set us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ", @1 Thessalonians 5: 9.
There is no greater proof of Christ being God than the fact that He has accomplished redemption, because no one has the right of redemption but the One to whom the inheritance belongs. Had not Christ been Creator of all, He would not have been competent to accomplish redemption. If I could create a thing, that thing belongs to me; God created and He alone has the right of redemption, and He took up the right of redemption. That is what Christ came to establish -- the rights of God in mercy.
Christ is the appointed vessel and seat of all for man, and man gets nothing whatsoever except in Christ. God may give providential mercies, but man
{14}
can get nothing for his soul except what is in Christ. Christ is the last Adam, and the only vessel of blessing, and He is the giver of the Spirit. A man is put in Christ by the Spirit and then he has everything in Christ. The beginning of it is faith in Christ, and the one who believes receives the Spirit, and is brought into attachment to Christ. Then such an one has redemption, sonship, and everything in Christ. I only know of one Christ and evidently salvation must be in Him, and it is only in Christ you can be outside this world. In another sense we are looking for salvation in the coming of the Lord; then we shall be absolutely outside of this world. At the present time we can be morally outside of it by the power of the Spirit.
{15}
POWER WENT OUT FROM HIM AND HEALED ALL
@Luke 5: 13 - 26
We have in this passage two striking instances of the ministry of the Lord here; both simple and intelligible. In the one it is the dealing with a case of leprosy; and in the other with a case of palsy. Now it is just these that I want to put together, for in a way they are descriptive of the condition of men in the world today -- and I do not think one will have much difficulty in making that plain. Men in this world are universally defiled -- the world itself is full of defilement; and we are so accustomed to the defiling influence of things in this world, that we are scarcely conscious that they are defiling. But no one can come in contact with things as they are around us without being defiled. Now the Lord came in contact with these things here, but the consequence of *His* coming in contact with them is that in result they are removed. The effect of sin having entered into the world has been to bring about the defilement of man; no one can doubt the defiling influence that idolatry has had upon men; but then the Jew was defiled too. The leper in this passage is a picture, I take it, of Israel: and it shows that Israel had not escaped the defilement of the world, the taint of idolatry was upon them too, many things had been done in Israel which were every bit as bad as had been done in heathendom. They were defiled by that which had been abroad in the world; they had touched idolatry, and were defiled by it. It is impossible for men, being what they are, to escape defilement in a world that is defiled, and the fact is, that whatever defilement you find in the world, you find the answer to it in your own heart. The purest man in the world is not free of the contamination that is in the world; and the effect of the fall has
{16}
been not only to make a man liable to contamination, but that he has the power to contaminate his fellows. I do not question that there are different degrees of defilement, but every man is defiled, and liable to defilement, from what is around him. In a great town like this, it is hardly possible to walk down a street without being defiled; the pictures on the walls are defiling; and the literature which is commonly read -- the newspapers, and much else, all tend to contamination. But men would not be contaminated if there were nothing in man's mind and heart to answer to the contamination. "Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts" -- these things come out of the heart of man. If the principle and taint of evil were not there, men would not be contaminated by what they see. A holy angel would not be contaminated, because there is nothing in him to answer to it. No; it is we who are contaminated.
But in the case of the paralytic we have another thing, and that is weakness; he was carried on his bed and let down into the midst where Jesus was -- he could not walk, he had no power. There was no power of life in him -- that is the idea in the case of the paralytic. What a pitiable object in the world must have been that poor leprous, defiled man. The leper had to be kept outside the city, or the camp, as the case might be; he was unclean. But then to my mind the paralytic was as pitiable an object as the leper -- and that is the condition of every man by reason of sin; he is weak in regard of God. There may be a certain consent in his mind to good things, many a time have we all consented to the thing which is good, and have found our powerlessness to carry it out. You see this in a child -- a child will often consent to what is proper and good, but fail to carry it out. The weakness is not in the absence of consent of man's mind to what is right,
{17}
but in his failure to carry Out what he knows to be right. That is the state of man morally in the world, he is paralyzed, and weak -- and it is not exceptional but universal. The picture here is probably in regard to Israel, but what is true in regard of Israel is universally true. God saw fit to test Israel in a peculiar way in His wisdom, but the condition of that people illustrated the condition of everybody under His eye. I think you will see that these two things mark men here in the world, looked at morally, defilement and weakness. Now I want to show the reason of it, and how it was that such a state of things went on for so long; and then, on the other hand, the answer to it all.
It is a great thing that God has presented *His* answer to it, and there could be no other answer to it than the one which He has given. Who can make a clean thing out of an unclean? No one; you want something different. Can the leopard change his spots? No; they are part of the leopard's being and so defilement and weakness are part of the moral being of man, and you cannot eradicate them; if you would attempt to eradicate them, you would eradicate the man, and indeed the man *must* go to whom they belong, the taint is in the spring of man's being, he is defiled and weak.
This state of things existed when Christ came into the world, but in Christ, God made known His way of meeting it, and that is in the introduction of another Man. In the presence of that Man here, the defilement and weakness must both pass away. And you get that pictured here (verses 13, 14, 18 - 25).
It is evident enough that a revolution took place in regard of the leper and the paralytic, and the way of it was either the touch or the word of Christ; they were both brought into contact with Jesus, the leper by the touch of Jesus, and the paralytic by the word of Jesus, and the effect in each case was
{18}
the removal of what was there, the defilement or the weakness. The leper was cleansed, and the paralytic took up his bed and walked. Now that is the effect of the introduction of that Man into the world; a Man, who had personally no part in the contamination or the weakness -- He was apart from all that was either defiling or weak, but was brought into contact with it, and with this effect, that both the defilement and the weakness departed from before Him. It must have been a wonderful experience to this poor leper to be cleansed; he could not understand the meaning of it spiritually, perhaps, but what a moment it must have been to him when at the touch of Jesus he finds himself relieved of his leprosy. And it must have been an unparalleled experience to the paralytic, accustomed to his weakness and helplessness, to be made to take up his bed and walk; to either one or the other it must have been an unparalleled experience, and it was evidently not due to anything in themselves, but to another Man, to One who had come into contact with the defilement and weakness of men, though, as I said before, Himself personally apart from it all. But He put Himself in contact with it, so to speak, He touched the leper, and spoke to the paralytic -- "Thy sins are forgiven thee", and then in confirmation said, "take up thy couch, and go". Now I carry the thought on to the future; that One to whom I have referred, who had come into the world, is rejected of men, but He has accomplished the will of God, and is the Sun of righteousness, at the right hand of God; He is not yet manifest, but there is a bright hope before us, and that is of His coming in glory. We get that constantly presented in Scripture; there were people who looked for redemption in Israel at the time when Christ first appeared; they had a good hope -- but now we have a better hope, the hope of the appearing of the glory
{19}
of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ -- it is a better hope than that first hope. When He comes again into the world what took place here will come out in a much greater way. What marks Israel at this present time is defilement and weakness; they are in a sense dead. In every part of the world the Jews are marked by defilement, they have been contaminated by the covetous principles that obtain in the world, and have no strength at all; they cannot recover their privileges, and are spiritually helpless. The secret of it is in that they have rejected the Man who came into the world, and until they receive that Man, they will remain as they are. When Christ comes again in glory, He will be the answer to their defilement and their weakness; the reproach under which they are will be taken away, and they will be raised up again from the dust of the earth. That is what will come to pass in the coming of Christ again into the world, and it is foreshadowed in this chapter. What a day it will be when there is the introduction into the world of a Man entirely apart from man's defilement and weakness; and who in putting Himself in contact with men down here in the world, causes their defilement and weakness to pass away. That will be the effect of the introduction into this world of Christ in glory. It will be a Man born into the world -- a new Man, whose coming will impart an entirely and totally new character to everything here. Not only will His presence relieve man of his contamination and weakness, but at the same time He will give a wholly new character to the world: there will be no question of contamination or of weakness in the day of the glory of the Lord.
Now the "grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared, teaching us that, having denied impiety and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and justly, and piously in the present
{20}
course of things, awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ". We receive in the Lord Jesus Christ a better, a blessed hope, and we look for Him. I do not know anything much more beautiful than the beginning of this gospel of Luke, where you find godly men and women cherishing hopes, and you see them fulfilled. Simeon was delighted as He held the child Jesus in his arms; and Anna, too, spoke of Him to all that looked for redemption in Israel. And christians have a hope, they look for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory. When Christ comes again He will be displayed as the Sun of righteousness, who brings the answer in His own Person to the contamination and weakness that mark men at the present time. All that marks Israel will give way before the touch of Christ; and so, too, with the nations, He will in a sense touch them, and their leprosy, their weakness, will pass away. It will be the great day of the restitution of all things, when Israel will come again into their own land, on the ground of the promises made to the fathers. And at the same time the gentiles will be placed in connection with God's people, and a totally new character be given to the world, by the introduction into it of the Man of God's counsel.
Now I want to touch upon what is true in the meantime, for after all it is that which concerns you and me. I think it is most important to get a view of God's ways, and to have the coming of the Lord clearly in view -- and what will be effected at His second advent. I feel one is justified in seeking to bring before men the better hope, the coming of Christ in glory. But now I would point out to you where Christ is, and what is the reason of His being there, and what it means to you and to me.
What marks the present time is not Christ in the world to touch the leper, but we touch Him where
{21}
He IS. The leper did not touch Christ, but He touched him; and when Christ went to raise the daughter of the ruler, He took her by the hand as she was lying dead, He touched her. That was true when Christ came into the world, and is a figure of what will be when He comes again. He will touch defiled and dead Israel, and they will be raised from their death and defilement. But now, as I was saying, it is not a question of His touching us but of our touching Him, like the woman with the issue of blood, who said, "If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole". That is what marks the present time -- we, by faith, touch Christ. And in touching Christ we touch God; it is impossible to touch Christ without touching God. It is a wonderful thing to touch God; and if you touch God you touch Him for blessing. If it were a question of judgment -- of God dealing with men according to their deserts -- you could not touch Him, but it is God putting Himself within the reach of men, so that they may touch Him, and in touching Him be relieved of all that disqualifies them for Himself. If a man touches Christ, it is to touch the virtue that is in Christ. When the woman touched the hem of His garment He said, "Who touched me? ... for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me"; and we read elsewhere that many touched Him, and there went virtue out of Him and healed them all.
God has in the death of Christ removed the man that was defiled and weak. His dealing with man was by removing man, so as to put another Man in his place. That is what I want to make plain. We get two things spoken of in connection with the death of Christ; there is the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new. The old man, that is what describes us all, is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and that is true of every one in the world. A person of great refinement,
{22}
and it may be of great attainments and knowledge, is no more free of the charge than other men; the springs of that man's being are defiled; all may be covered up by worldly polish, and refinement, and proprieties, by education and training, but if you get beneath the surface you will find the springs are tainted.
Now in the death of Christ that man has been removed from before God, and the contamination and weakness have passed away with him: they may not have passed away yet in our experience, but from the eye of God they are passed away for ever. "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh". The Lord Jesus entered into every liability under which man was, the wrath, and the death, and the curse -- everything that lay upon man, but having taken everything that lay upon man by the just judgment of God, He died: that man was terminated; Christ was the victim, and the victim was never revived. In the Lord Jesus Christ we see both the Priest and the victim. The Priest was revived, but the victim never, and the old man was terminated with Him. Now, beloved friends, everything depends on that -- the victim is gone, the lawless man, the defiled and weak man has been terminated in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ. Wrath and the curse and death have been brought to an end in His death. But Christ has been revived from among the dead in order that He might take the place of that man which has been removed in His death. He stands in relation to all men, in a place of contact for all men, as revived from the dead. He came after the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, but He was also the offering Priest -- He was God's Son. A priest in Israel never offered himself, he could not, he offered a victim; nowhere do you get a type under the law which combines in one both the victim and the
{23}
priest. But that is what Christ was, He was the Priest; but He died as the victim in order that man after the flesh might never be revived. The apostle Paul says, "Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more". But as offering Priest He is revived, and revived in the value of that work which He has accomplished, in the value of that righteousness which He has effected. Christ raised up from the dead goes to the right hand of God, and from that place imparts the gift of the Holy Spirit. One man has been removed that another Man might take his place. Christ, the Man whom God has revived from the dead, is the last Adam, and the second Man, and He stands thus in relation to all men.
Now I can understand how right that is -- if He gave Himself a ransom for all, then it is right that He should have a voice to all. He is the Mediator between God and men, and is presented to every man for faith, and is thus the test of every man. That is what Christ is, as Head of every man. All the gifts for men are in Christ, and have been communicated to men by Christ. All were dead, but He died for all, and hence it is as raised from the dead, as the Mediator, He is set in relation to every man upon earth. There is one thing in regard of Christ, and that is that all preaching centres in one name. I may preach to you for an hour, but all the preaching centres in a name, and the value of that name. The name presents the Head of every man, the Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus. The exalted Christ, the Christ who died, and is raised, and is coming again in glory, that is our blessed hope. It is in that name that all preaching centres; it is in the presentation of the virtue that is in that name, made available for man, and available for *every* man upon earth, so that every man is tested and proved by that name. On
{24}
the one hand, if that name is refused, man avows himself to be lawless. He will not be subject to the Man that God has presented for faith; he disdains the name of Jesus, he avows himself to be disregardful of God. But if that name is accepted, then Christ communicates living water to the one who believes. The practical effect of Christ being the Mediator between God and men is that He is set of God in relation to all men, with the effect that the man who refuses His name is avowedly lawless and defiant of God, his sin is proved; but on the other hand, the one who accepts that name receives from Christ the gift of living water, so that he may be livingly connected with Christ. Christ is there for the touch of faith: He Himself will touch man in the time to come, He will touch Israel; and the receiving of Israel hereafter will be life from the dead for the nations.
Now my point is, that the One who is coming again is now at the right hand of God; I have given you His history as coming into the world full of grace and truth, and entering into all that lay upon men by the judgment of God. He gave Himself a ransom for all, and is gone up into the highest place of exaltation, and from that point is coming again. Meanwhile testimony has come from Him there, the Holy Spirit has come so that we might know the reality of His being there; He is borne witness to by the Spirit, so that man may touch Him by faith, and derive from Him the virtue that is in Him. There is in His name the forgiveness of sins; He has obtained it in the accomplishment of redemption, and there is the witness of it now by the Spirit. "Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins".
But that is not all. The greatest virtue that is in Him is living water; He will give of the fountain of the water of life to those who believe in Him, and
{25}
no one else than those who believe would care a bit about it. But if you bow to Christ -- if you touch Him by faith; or, let me put it another way, if you believe on His name, and it is the name of a Man who is at the right hand of God, of which we know by the Holy Spirit come down, that Man will impart to you the gift of living water. It is no more wonderful for a Man to be in heaven, than for God to be down here upon earth, and it is the Spirit of God that is witness that Christ is at the right hand of God; the Holy Spirit has come down to report His glory, and the virtue of His name, that man may receive the gift of living water. The Lord said to the woman of Samaria, "Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again", it satisfies but for a moment, but "whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever", you will never drink but once of *that* water. It is in the believer a well of living water, springing up to eternal life. The first thing is that thirst is quenched for ever; the believer is content with the water that Christ gives him; it is drunk once and for all, and one is never to thirst again. But then it goes further, it shall be in him a well of water springing up to everlasting life; it springs up in the appreciation of Christ.
Now I would impress upon you, first, that the defiled and weak man has been removed in the death of Christ, and there abides for God, and for you, "ONE MAN"; and when you have known the fountain of living water that springs up in the appreciation of that one Man, you are consciously apart in the eye of God from the defilement and weakness that was connected with the other man. It all lies in the appreciation of Christ, the result of the springing up of the water that Christ gives. It was a wonderful word that Christ spoke to this woman of Samaria, a word she poorly understood,
{26}
but I do not doubt the moment came when she did understand it. And perhaps it is so now; it may be that people hardly understand one word; they hear these things, yet as to intelligent apprehension of what they hear, for the moment they have none. What I have been speaking of to you tonight may be Greek to you, and yet I have only sought to show you that there is an actual living Man tonight at the right hand of God, and we know this by the witness of the Holy Spirit, who has come down here to testify to Him. That witness has been in the world for well-nigh two thousand years, it has been maintained by the Spirit of God. The Spirit has maintained the testimony of the virtue that is in His name, so that, in our consciousness, there might take place what took place for God in the death of Christ, the removal of the man that was defiled and weak, so that the Man who has gone to God might fill his place -- the Man, I say, who came from God, and who is gone to God, and who abides for God, that is the Man who comes full into view by the springing up of the living water. But that is not the beginning; the beginning is the touch of faith, the believing on His name. We often believe in the name of some great person in this world; now I want you to believe simply on the name of the One who is at the right hand of God. Just as the woman who touched the hem of His garment got virtue from Him, so I want you to touch Him that you might get virtue too from Him, the gift of living water, so that you may never thirst. The woman of Samaria had tried hard enough to please herself but she was still athirst, and the Lord meets this in divine grace.
May God grant that you may believe on Christ's name, so that each one may prove the value and the virtue that is in His name.
{27}
UNITY: HOW IT IS PROMOTED
@Ephesians 4: 1 - 16
Scripture attaches great importance to unity. This cannot be disputed; almost the very first idea presented in Scripture is union, and that leads to unity. It is the very first witness to unity in Scripture, that God took the woman from man, and they became one.
In the Old Testament you get the unity of the Godhead. In the New Testament you get the revelation of divine Persons, but then they are one. Then, again, you get a witness to unity in Israel -- there were twelve tribes, but they were all one. The twelve loaves on the table of shewbread proved that; when they divided, God did not approve of the division. You get plenty of prophecies of the unity of Israel -- we get it alluded to in @Psalm 133: 1: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity". Then when you get that, you get the blessing of eternal life (verse 3). In the New Testament all the writers attach great importance to unity. Paul, Peter, and John, all do. So, too, does the Lord Himself. He prays "that they may be all one". Here in @Ephesians 4 the apostle is exhorting to unity. So long as will exists, you cannot get unity. When all are governed by one will, then you get unity; it will be so with Israel. When they are united under one Head, they will be really united. "Ephraim will not envy Judah, and Judah will not trouble Ephraim", @Isaiah 11: 13. So, too, in regard of christians -- you get it brought about when all are governed by one will. It is in the house of God that unity is to exist; we are exhorted to "keep the unity of the Spirit", and that unity will exist when individual will is set aside and all are governed by the will of God. We find
{28}
great practical difficulty in walking together in unity, and the difficulty is, people are not all governed by one will. The only possible assurance or way of unity is by all being subject to the will of God. The unity of the saints was to be the witness that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. In early days there was a witness to unity, and there was thus a witness to the truth that the Father sent the Son, etc. Now the unity of the Spirit is broken, and it cannot be put right again. If I were asked why I am not connected with any section of christendom, I should say I could not be identified with what is a denial of the unity of the Spirit. The unity of the Spirit is not practicable in christendom -- that is justification for standing apart from all the organizations around. We cannot expect unity to be re-established, but we are under the obligation to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit, and it is a great thing to seek individually to be controlled by the will of God. There are three Persons in the Godhead, but only one will. Unity is what tests us; it tested Israel -- ten tribes split off from two. The great practical test for us is, Can we go on together? And the answer is, Can we go on, being governed by the will of God and not by our own? Now God has but one mind in regard to men. Christ is the mercy-seat -- that is one point of view, but we are entitled to meditate upon what Christ is to the saints. That is another point of view, and the justification for looking at both is that Christ bought the field; but then He bought the field for the sake of the treasure. In the passage I read, we get what the saints are to Christ -- the treasure -- and what Christ is to them. What marks the present time is that all men belong to Christ. He bought the field, but then He bought the field for the sake of the treasure. These two
{29}
things have to be held together: Christ as God's testimony to men, yet what the saints are as Christ's treasure. I want to bring before you what the treasure is in regard of Christ. Now look at the passage (verses 11, 12): "*He* has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ"; and again (verses 14 - 16), "That we may be no longer babes ... may grow up to him in all things ... works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love". Certain things act and react. It is true in chemical things, and so it is in moral things. Two things should mark all of us, and these are intelligence and affection; they are agents, acting and reacting. Intelligence will lead to enlarged affection, and affection tends to intelligence. In Mary of Bethany, her affection became the means of intelligence. It was so with John. Did you ever think that John was a Galilean fisherman? And yet his writings are very profound and abstract. The key to his intelligence was affection -- nothing can be more important than affection, and it is equally important that christians should gain intelligence, "the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (@Ephesians 4: 13), that is intelligence. Then the "self-building up in love". These are the two.
The gifts are given for enlightening and intelligence, and these tend to expansion of affection, and in that way they work together -- we must not despise intelligence. Gifts are given for that end; they will not bring about affection, but intelligence leads to exercise, and that tends to the expansion of affection. Now I want to speak of gifts. Gifts are the expression of the care of Christ for the saints; they are given for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body. Gifts were never given
{30}
to create a clergy, nor to distinguish those who have them. I admit they do distinguish them, but they were never given to that end. They were given for the work of the ministry. The apostles had no idea of being distinguished by their gifts, nor yet to keep what they had to themselves. John communicated all he knew, that the saints should have fellowship with them, and that the saints should be enlightened. We have the benefit of it at the present day. That is very important in the face of all that exists in christendom. I touch on the end in view: "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (verse 13). That is the object for which they were given. Here we get the unity again -- the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God. Unity is inherent in the knowledge of the faith and of the Son of God, and it is the only unity worth anything morally. What I understand by the faith is the revelation of God. We only know God by faith, because God has not come out yet publicly -- we only know God by testimony and revelation. We are in the light of the revelation of God. Grace and truth are in the thought of God for man -- law never was. Grace and truth are by Jesus Christ. No one can walk in the light as God is in the light, save by faith. It is the unity, too, of the knowledge of the Son of God. That point is of very great moment. When we speak of the Son of God, it is interesting to see the different connections in which the different apostles had to say to the Son of God. Peter *confessed* Him as the Son of God. John *witnessed* to Him -- all his writings are in connection with the Son of God; and Paul *preached* Him. The Son of God is the last Adam, the Centre and Head of God's universe, and the divine Source of all blessing
{31}
for man. Eternal life is given to us in God's Son. That is what I understand by the Son of God. How important that we should have a clear knowledge of the Son of God. Now the gifts are all given to that end: "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man" (@Ephesians 4: 13). A perfect man is where there is no defect, "the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ". The fulness of Christ is the church. How far have we all arrived in these things? The unity of the faith -- the full light of revelation -- walking in the light as He is in the light; then, too, the clear knowledge of the Son of God, in the light of what the Son of God is, according to divine counsel, Head and Centre of divine counsel. These are things which are to occupy the attention of the saints, and not the frivolous things of this world. Unity becomes a very great test. If people go on and increase in the faith, and in the knowledge of the Son of God, people will be found together in unity, for unity is inherent in these two things. That, then, is the great object of gifts. Do not wait for, or anticipate, any great revolution down here. The church has ceased to be what God intended it to be (Revelation proves that); but as an individual I seek to walk in the light of divine revelation, and to increase in the knowledge of the Son of God; and the effect would be to promote unity. The circle might be limited. I would scout the unity of 'brethren'. I want no unity save what is inherent in the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God. I repudiate every other kind of unity. The result is, going on in that way you come to the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ. Now pass on to the next point (verse 16), "Works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love". Take a company -- an association
{32}
of any kind on earth -- take the House of Commons for instance. The head should be the perfect expression of what every member of the company ought to be. In human things that cannot be realised. The Speaker of the House of Commons may be a very clever man, he has the intelligence -- but he is not perfect. Now in divine things we have a perfect Head, "may grow up to him in all things", @Ephesians 4: 15. When He exhorted them to love one another, He added, "as *I have loved* you", @John 13: 34. He was the Head, the intelligence, and He never exhorts us to anything that He is not towards us. All has been expressed in Himself. He is the intelligence. We are to grow up to Him in all things, not only in point of intelligence, but in point of nature. Our love to Christ is proved in that we love one another. The world took account of the disciples as having been with Jesus. The Lord loves us perfectly, and He exhorts us to love one another. He is the Guide of our circle, and has the ordering of things in every possible way. We are to grow up in the divine nature. I suggest to you the importance of cultivating our relations one toward another. The way in which we cultivate our relation towards Christ, is to cultivate our relations one towards another down here. "United together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding", @Colossians 2: 2.
One word more, (@Ephesians 4: 16). It is but to look to *find*. Some people say they never find affection for the saints, but the point is every part supplies. But where do you get supplies? It is by coming under the influence of Christ. There is no one to whom He is not Husband. Christ is law to us. He would make us conscious of His love in many a way. No member in the House of Commons can speak until he catches the eye of the Speaker. Now
{33}
we have the eye of Christ. The way to supply (which is an obligation) is to come under the influence of Christ, who is the perfect expression of what we should be. Then we shall be bent upon supplying, and when we supply, then we *find*. Then there is effectual working in *every part* -- it is the supply of affection. The truth is when people come under the affection (or influence) of Christ they get a surplus and excess, so that you are able to supply and convey affection to the body. So you get "works for itself the increase" in every part. Do you get so little of Christ, that you have nothing to spare? There is enough for every part, and then you can supply to the body, and thus every member has enough for itself, and then has something to spare. In that way there is self-building up in love; that is the way the thing works. The treasure belongs to Christ, and is very important in the eye of Christ. He has given gifts for the expansion of the intelligence, and He is, too, the Head and intelligence of the body, so that every member may be content and happy, and have a surplus for the self-edifying of itself in love.
May the Lord give us to be exercised in the light of the truth, and to go on in the energy of the Spirit of God, and that notwithstanding the fact that the body will not be together again in unity in an outward way.
{34}
THE BODY DESCRIPTIVE OF THE HEAD
@Colossians 1: 18 - 29; @Romans 16: 25, 26
We have had a good bit to say about the body of Christ this afternoon, and the thought before me tonight is to say something about the Head; you cannot understand the truth of the body except in connection with the Head. I want to say a little as to the purpose the body serves towards the Head, and how the body is at the direction of the Head. You could not understand nor enter into the truth of the body apart from that. I take myself, or you, as an example. Your body is directed by your head. And we always connect with it the idea that the body is at the disposal of the head. My members do not move of their own accord; all is traced from the head. Any thoughtful person can see that the body is at the disposal of the head.
Now I want to speak a little about the Head, but in the first place I must show you how the body is formed, and the place which Christ has in relation to it as Head, and then I want to show you the purpose the body serves for the Head. And nothing can alter this purpose. Not all the failure of the church, though tending to obscure it, can alter it, because the failure cannot alter or do away with the body. The whole body is here on the earth as really as ever it was. There may be very few in the light of it, but that does not alter the fact. The body is here, and it is a great thing to get light -- the divine mind, as to the body. It will help you greatly to understand the ruin around you, the character of the things in christendom, and to enter more intelligently into the fellowship in which it has pleased God to place us. What is the great gain of knowing the truth of the body? We become
{35}
more intelligent for the Lord, and about the fellowship to which the Lord has called us. And I defy any one to understand the true character of christendom in the present day if he is not brought into the true idea of the body, and the purpose it is intended to serve.
I feel the subject is most important, and I have a very deep sense of how powerless one is to handle it. It is a subject spoken of as the mystery of the gospel, and therefore it is evidently a deep subject, though a mystery which has been made manifest. The apostle was exceedingly anxious to make manifest the mystery of the gospel. One remark more. In the very nature of the expressions employed in Scripture, the truth of the body must be hid in the gospel. If it is the mystery of the gospel, it is as evident as possible that the truth of the body must be involved in the gospel, and it must be made manifest from the gospel. In @Ephesians 6: 19 you get the expression: "That I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel". We have become much accustomed to speak of the two ministries, the ministry of the gospel, and the ministry of the church. And it is true the apostle does speak of himself as minister -- not *a* minister -- of the gospel and of the church; but you must remember the truth of the body lies in the gospel. It is the mystery of the gospel.
Now further, we get the recognition of the truth of the body in @Romans 12: 4, 5: "For as we have many members in one body". Now that passage makes it perfectly certain to my mind that you must have in Romans a doctrinal basis for the body. Because when the apostle comes to the hortatory part that we have in this chapter 12 he makes this statement as to the one body. There is no previous allusion to the subject in the epistle; for neither the truth of the body nor of the Head is taught in
{36}
Romans. But nevertheless what is certain to me is, you must have in Romans a sufficient doctrinal basis for the body. And it lies in this, that by the very fact of the reception of the Spirit we are of necessity constituted one body, and Romans teaches the communication of the Spirit in chapter 5, where it says, "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us". But the Holy Spirit is one, and therefore the same Holy Spirit resides in all the saints, and the love of God is shed abroad in the hearts of all saints by the one Spirit.
And again, when I come to chapter 8 I read, "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you". There is only one Spirit of God. So later on, verse 15; there is only one spirit of sonship. Every believer participates in the same Spirit; all are baptised "by one Spirit ... into one body". One Spirit brought the love of God into our hearts; we are all in the one Spirit if the Spirit of God dwell in us. There is only one Spirit of God's Son, and that is the Spirit by which all believers cry, "Abba, Father". That is the truth of the Spirit in the believer, and therefore I understand you get the truth of the presence of the Spirit recognized, and although the truth of the body is not taught, the body is involved inasmuch as you get the same Spirit in all the saints. You must have one body because one Spirit.
Now I think it must be plain to every one here tonight that in the very fact of its being taught in Romans that we all receive the Spirit we are necessarily constituted into one body; thus the apostle says, "We, being many, are one body in Christ". Not one body in Adam, not one body in our responsible life down here, for the body involves new creation. There is thus a certain doctrinal basis in Romans for the truth of the body, and therefore he
{37}
brings it in to enforce his exhortation in chapter 12. The believer's responsibility *is* brought in there, not in connection with the body, but "having then gifts". A man is to wait on his gift. I want to make this point clear, that the truth of the body is the mystery of the gospel, and that therefore of necessity the truth of the body must lie hid in the gospel, but it is *made manifest to the saints*, for the apostle's great anxiety was to make it manifest. It was hid there -- that is, in the gospel, and he was conscious it was.
Now as to the formation of the body. We look at the body before we look at the Head. Let me say one word which may perhaps cut across the thought of some here as to the body of Christ. The one body is the same evidently as the body of Christ. These are not two different thoughts in Scripture. In @1 Corinthians 12 we read (verse 13), "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body", and in the same chapter (verse 27), "Now ye are the body of Christ", because the one body is the body of Christ.
What I want to show you now is this, that the truth of union is not taught in connection with the body. What is taught in connection with the body is *unity*, not union. And the truth of unity is involved, I think, in connection with the body in these scriptures, "There is one body, and one Spirit", and again, "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body". Thus the teaching of the Spirit of God, in connection with the Spirit and the body, is not to show union but unity. By the very fact of the reception of the Spirit the saints have been formed into one body. We find in the Acts, in the early part of the church's history, the saints were gathered together by the testimony of the resurrection of Christ. Then they received the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the presence of the Holy
{38}
Spirit constituted them the house of God. But the truth of the body had not yet come out, and the first intimation was in what Jesus said to Saul, "Why persecutest thou me?" What that means was this, that Christ was in the saints. Now when the truth of the body came out, we see it existed by the very fact of the baptism of the Spirit. There was never but one baptism of the Spirit, that on the day of Pentecost, and then the saints were formed into one body, and that was unity. You cannot have a stronger idea presented to you of unity than the body. What is a body without unity? We have many members in one body. What would my body be without unity? If I get any failure in the unity of my body it is a proof that there is paralysis. Every member is depressed, a certain proof that something is out of gear, the nervous system is gone to the bad. You cannot have a stronger idea of unity than this scripture presents, that "we, being many, are one body".
The next point is -- the body having been formed by the Spirit, Christ is given the place of Head of the body, that is, Head in the sense of Chief.
Suppose we take the figure of the human body in connection with the head, the moral idea connected with head is direction, and Christ in taking the place of Head of the body takes the place of Chief. I will give you a passage of Scripture for it, @Ephesians 1: 20 - 23: "Which he wrought in Christ". It is the fulfilment of the prophecy in @Psalm 8. The Son of man set over everything. Then the additional truth, He "hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church". He is given as Head to the church which is His body. Thus the church is formed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and Christ is given to be Head over all, and Head to the church which is *His* body. But I cannot dwell on this.
{39}
In @Colossians 1: 18 we read, "And he is the head of the body, the church". That is the first statement we have of His headship. I put Colossians before Ephesians, because in moral order it comes first. In chapter 2 we read, "from which" -- that is the Head -- "all the body ..." I take it slowly as I want the points to be clear as I go on.
Bear in mind first how the body is formed. The body is the mystery of the gospel remember, because I do not want you to think that the gospel is one thing and the mystery another. It is the mystery of the gospel, because the body is hid in the gospel, and the gospel goes on to the communication of the Spirit, and no believer is in the good of the gospel till he has received the Spirit. The great end of the gospel is that God may be revealed in the heart of the believer, but that cannot be until the Spirit is received. Love is not known else. "The love of God is shed abroad ... by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us". And I say unhesitatingly, no person is in the good of the gospel until he has received the Holy Spirit. God's end in the gospel is that He may be revealed in the heart of man; man's idea is that God's object is to save him, but the gospel brings you to the Spirit; and the moment the Spirit is received the body is formed. And why? Because *Christ* is in you. Now the body is formed by the baptism of the Spirit, and having been thus formed, Christ is in the place of Head. He is looked at there as Man, and the place given to Him of God, and it is regarded as being the highest place of His exaltation, "Head over all things to the church". Now, mark this, that the truth of union is not taught in connection with the body, union brings in the thought of the bride. The idea of union is that the church will share in the glory and exaltation of the Head. Just as a woman who marries a man superior in position to herself
{40}
shares his position, so in regard to the church and Christ. And that is taught in @Ephesians 2: 5 - 7, "Even when we were dead in sins ..." It is to satisfy the love of God. It is not to satisfy the heart of the church, but the heart of God.
So far we have the idea of the body, and the truth taught in connection with the unity. Now we will go a little into detail. And what I venture to say first is this, you do not find the truth of the Head until you come to Colossians. You get the truth of the body both in Romans and Corinthians. In Romans it is to check independency and in Corinthians to check clericalism. If I recognize the truth that I am a member of the body I cannot be independent. If a man is set in a position not dependent on anybody else he can take the ground of independency. A man might say, I am not concerned about anybody else. But if he is a member of the body of Christ he is so far dependent. No one of us can be exclusively individual. Many christians are too individual. They are taken up far too much with what is connected with their individual paths, "We, being many, are one body". You may carry independency too far as to the individuality of the saints. I admit each has his individual path, but we must not use our individuality to the extent of forgetting that we are members one of another. You may find saints coming to the meetings on the Lord's day morning, and you do not see much of them for the rest of the week. They forget we are members one of another. So the truth of the body is brought in in Romans as an antidote to independency. He is not to think too highly of himself, but as God has given him a place in the body. But Christ is not seen as Head of the body in Romans. The character in which He is presented there is as Lord. And that is a different idea to that of the Head; He is Lord in the house -- the
{41}
church looked at in that aspect; but Christ is not Lord to the body, He is Head to the body, and that is a different association of ideas entirely. My head is not lord of my body. The body is dependent on the head, but the head is not its lord. Christ is Lord in the house, and if He sees fit He can assert His lordship there. You will find that in @1 Corinthians 10 and 11.
Now look at @1 Corinthians 12: 12: "For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ". See also verse 27: "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular". Speaking of all the saints at Corinth they were the body of Christ. Now what I want to show is, that the thought of the body is brought in there, not as a check to independency, but as an antidote to clericalism. The principle of clericalism is, the head can say to the feet, I have no need of you. The antidote is, the head *cannot* say to the feet, I have no need of you. The feet belong to the body, and are for the assembly. Even the most obscure member is necessary, for it may be the vessel for the manifestation of the Spirit. You cannot limit the Spirit to the more conspicuous members. An eye is more conspicuous, but in the assembly you cannot limit the Spirit. The truth of the body is introduced in connection with the assembly come together, as an antidote to clericalism. There is one body, and the manifestations of the Spirit come out in the various members, all by the same Spirit. You cannot therefore have such a thing as clericalism in the assembly. I have great sympathy with two or three coming together for prayer, but that is not the assembly. They are come together for a specific object according to @Matthew 18: 19, 20. But that is not the assembly. When you come to the assembly you must leave the
{42}
Spirit free. You could not say we come to the assembly for prayer, even in regard to the things of the assembly, you would so far fetter the Spirit. I would be glad to associate in that way with two or three, or two or three hundred, coming together for prayer; but that is not the assembly, you cannot fetter the Spirit in the assembly. There He uses the members as He pleases. Thus you may get prayer or praise or thanksgiving or worship or ministry, but you cannot fetter the Spirit in the assembly, properly speaking. In @Matthew 18 it is an agreement to ask for some particular thing in Christ's name. That is quite right. But in the assembly, room must be given to the Spirit to act as He will; and the Spirit uses whatever member He pleases. So there must be no clericalism in the assembly. And I could not go to a so-called church or chapel where the service is all performed by the minister. It is a complete denial of the truth of the assembly. Many persons perhaps are sitting in the congregation whom the Spirit might use.
Neither Romans nor Corinthians give us the *Head*. In Corinthians Christ is almost invariably presented as Lord. On account of the state of the assembly there the apostle could not unfold to them the truth of the Head. It used to be said that Christ was never brought in as Lord to the assembly except when evil was there. There was disorder and confusion of all kinds in the Corinthian assembly, hence Christ was brought in as Lord. But my great point is to come to the thought of the Head. I have shown how the truth of the body is brought in, but now I come to the *purpose* which the body serves for the Head. That comes out in Colossians; and exceedingly important it is that you should see how it works out -- the wonderful idea of the Head being connected with the
{43}
body. And we can only learn that, when we see that Christ being Head to the body His body is the complement. The body is a vessel descriptive of Himself, just as my body is descriptive of my intelligence, and my intelligence is seen through my body. That is what the church is to Christ. It is the fulness of Him.
There is not to be a quality lacking in the vessel set down here in the world in order that it might be descriptive of the Head. You have the wonderful truth of the Head in glory, and a body here to be descriptive of the Head in glory. That is what is brought out in Colossians -- the connection of the Head with the body. And can you conceive anything more wonderful? Look at the travesty of the thing around us! Take popery, it sets up a human imitation. A remarkable thing about the Roman Catholic church is that it is the only real imitation of the body. A state church is not. That does not profess to be universal, the Romish church does. But what *they* have done is this, they have transferred the privileges of the body to the house. They have set up a body of professors, and attached to the house the privileges which properly belong to the body. I might go as far as this, and say, it is a diabolical imitation of the real thing. The real thing is a Head in heaven, exalted to be Head over all things, but having a body here on earth to be morally descriptive of Himself in the scene from which He has been rejected. If I may use the expression, it is the perpetuation of Christ here: that is the true character of the body -- the continuance, the perpetuation of Christ here in this scene whence He has been rejected.
Now I want to work this in with another passage from @1 John 5: 9; and we shall see how one scripture writer supports another, "This is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son". What is the
{44}
witness? See verses 10, 11. "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself ... And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son". What that teaches us is this, he looks at the saints, and he says, God has given to the saints eternal life, and mark this -- "*this life is in his Son*". Every saint disclaims the thought that that life is in himself, but what he maintains is this -- "God has given to us eternal life; and this life is *in his Son*". Thus you have a body of saints on earth, brought into the blessing of eternal life, all disclaiming the idea of eternal life in themselves, but maintaining that it is in God's Son, and that is the witness here. Thus He has given a living witness to Christ in glory. The first four chapters of this epistle are taken up with the subject of eternal life as manifested in Christ down here; the apostles witness of this, but in chapter 5 it is the *Holy Spirit* witnessing to Christ in glory, for they never saw Him there; they had seen Him down here in resurrection, but the witness is to Christ in glory.
God has given to us eternal life, but we should not say eternal life is in us. We are *in* eternal life, and eternal life is in God's Son, and that is the witness here. Now I think it is the same thing as to the body. The body is the vessel in which Christ in glory is described in this scene from which He has been rejected. And I could not conceive anything more wonderful. The world succeeded in casting Christ out, but God has ordained that there should be a vessel here in which should be described the very Christ whom the world has cast out.
That is what the body is for. It is an unvarying principle in Scripture that anything God has established on earth always abides. The world cannot get rid of it. And if God has set Christ here on the earth, not all the power of man can put Him out.
{45}
So He is represented here again in His body; and the church remains till He comes again in glory. So as to the temple which God has set up. At one time it may be a material temple, and now one of living stones, but the temple is here until the material temple is re-established again at Jerusalem. So as to everything else. Once God has established a thing on earth, not all the power of earth and hell combined can disestablish it. Man cannot defeat God. You may get the thing in a new character but the thing abides. So as to Christ, the wicked Jew crucified and killed Him, but the Holy Spirit comes down and forms the body here. And Christ is given to be Head of His body, and the body is to be descriptive of that Man whom the world has rejected.
God has given unto us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. It is perfectly wonderful, and if you accept the idea you will understand the terrible defection and departure of christendom from the thought of God in regard to the church, and how very poorly we have entered into the idea that the body is to be descriptive of Christ in the very scene where He has been rejected.
Turn to @Colossians 1: 24. There is *His* body, not simply the *one* body. To the Romans and Corinthians he had taught the *one* body. Now it is "His body, which is the assembly" -- because he has spoken of the Head -- "of which *I* became minister" -- not a minister -- (see verses 25, 26); so that saints are to know it -- it has been made manifest to them, and only to the saints (verse 27), Christ in the gentiles, the hope of glory. That is what has come to pass. You have this great fact, that the gentiles have become a vessel in whom Christ is, and He is the hope of glory. That is what God has gained!
You might say when Christ was here personally He was the hope of glory. He was doubtless the pledge of all the fulfilment of the purposes of God.
{46}
But now the wonderful thing is that Christ is in the gentiles -- Christ in the saints in the pledge of the fulfilment of all God's purposes and counsels -- Christ in the gentiles, the hope of glory. Now to come to what this mystery means. If I speak of the saints being in Christ, that is not a mystery. "God has given to us eternal life". That is our position before God, and we have the witness in ourselves. But the mystery is another thought altogether, the mystery is Christ in the saints. Do you ask, how does it come out? It comes out in this, you have all the character of Christ, not as in the flesh, but in moral suitability down here, reproduced in the saints. Not Christ known after the flesh, but all the moral characteristics of Christ in suitability to the scene down here reproduced in the saints, because they are His body. That is the relation in which He stands to the saints, as Head of the body.
Therefore the meekness and gentleness and lowliness -- all the sensibilities of Christ and the peace of Christ, are all to be reproduced and displayed here, because the church is His body and the vessel which is to be descriptive of Himself in the very scene where He has been rejected. That is what the body is. It gets everything from the Head, and therefore if not practically subject to the Head you cannot get the character of the Head in the body. We are not saved to be simply saved sinners, but to be members of the vessel in which Christ is to be displayed in the scene whence He has been cast out, a moral representation of Christ. That is the idea of the body, and that is the hope of glory. Think of it, that in the very scene where Satan is god and prince, God will now have such a presentation of Christ, as the pledge that He will accomplish all His purposes to put everything under Christ. And I am perfectly certain that we shall reign with Him; that is the hope of glory. I cannot conceive
{47}
anything more wonderful! I have been at it in a certain way for many years, but I am only now beginning to see the thing in its reality. When God came in perfect grace to the world the Jew rejected Christ and cast Him out, did violence in every way to God. But Christ is not to be cast out, but perpetuated here, and He is now to be described in the body. Therefore the body being composed of those who believe in Christ, they confessing Him as Lord, He is given as the Head, and the body is subjected to Him, and now in the body the grace of Christ, all the moral characteristics of Christ are produced *in this scene*. Not what He is at the right hand of God, but in moral suitability to the scene where we are. It is not the reigning time, therefore you get meekness and lowliness and forbearing one another in love, and "to all these add love, which is the bond of perfectness". There is also to be wisdom and such like -- all to be descriptive of the Head.
Now all this is brought to us in Scripture as light, not in the way of ecclesiastical formation. There is no such idea connected with the body. It is brought to those who were in the fellowship, as calling on the Lord -- given as light that we may understand the fellowship into which we are called. We are now called to special fellowship, called to "follow righteousness, faith ...", @2 Timothy 2: 22. And if you see the divine idea of the body it will greatly help you to carry out the fellowship; it will greatly accentuate our fellowship, because the more distinctly we understand the relation in which we stand to Christ the more the character of our fellowship will be affected.
As to the body, it is Christ's body, "the fulness of him". In certain epistles it involves the privileges of the saints, but in Colossians we learn what the saints are to Christ.
{48}
If you do not understand what you are in Christ you could not apprehend the truth of the body. Here in Colossians the Spirit of God turns completely round; after showing the saints what they are *in* Christ, He shows what they are *for* Christ, a vessel for Christ. The Christ displayed as a witness down here. And you cannot have a greater benefit than the light of it. It is a great thing to get the truth of the Head, the intelligence of the Head as displayed in the body.
May God give us to understand it. I know I am a poor hand to explain it, but I am always thankful beyond measure when I get a fresh idea of the greatness and wisdom of God. There is one thing which will strike you in regard to Scripture -- the resources of God are boundless. You see instances where you might think God would be baffled, but there, too, you see boundless resources.
The wisdom of God is Christ. And it is that by which God baffles every combination of men. And look what the combination had come to: "This is your hour, and the power of darkness". But 'No' (God says), 'you are not going to have it all your own way. You may cast Him out, but His body shall be maintained in divine power till He comes again'. There is no reason to fear, beloved friends; the power of the enemy *is* very great in this scene, but however great may be the power of men and of the devil, yet God will have the last word always. Why, when Christ was on earth if He came into controversy with men He always had the last word. And so God will. May God give you to understand it better than I can unfold it. My great object is to show you that the truth of the body is *moral* not ecclesiastical. And what I mean by moral is, when Christ is reproduced in the saints. That is not ecclesiastical, but moral. May God give us to see
{49}
it and to get more light on it, that we may be greatly helped in the practical carrying out of our fellowship here. And that is, that we "follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart".
{50}
THE LAST ADAM
@1 Corinthians 15: 45 - 58; @Revelation 3: 14
There is something remarkable in the way in which the Lord speaks of Himself to the church of Laodicea -- "These things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness". That looks at Him as the end, the "Amen" is the confirmation of everything. The thought of the "faithful and true witness" is in contrast to every other witness. The Lord said to Israel, "Ye are my witnesses", but they were not true witnesses. Instead of being witnesses of God against idolatry, they became idolaters. So also has the church failed in its witness; and the Lord had to warn them that He would take their candlestick out of its place except they repented (Chapter 2: 5). And the end of it is, He will spue it out of His mouth because it is an unfaithful witness. Then He comes in as the true Witness; and "the beginning of the creation of God". It is remarkable to find One who is both the beginning and the end. The roof has relation to the foundation of a house. Christ is the climax, and at the same time He is the beginning of the creation of God. Historically He was not exactly the beginning, for, as we read in @1 Corinthians 15, "But that which is spiritual was not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual". But the point is this, that the spiritual is really the first morally.
Now I want to speak a little of Christ as the last Adam. One thing is clear, everything for God and everything for man is bound up with the manifestation of the last Adam. Christ must of necessity be the last Adam on the basis of redemption, and the reason for that is very simple. If He were not the last Adam on that ground He could not be a life-giving
{51}
Spirit. "The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit". That means a very great deal, it involves redemption. He could not impart living water except on the ground of redemption. Therefore it is that which led me to remark that everything for the glory of God and the blessing of man is bound up with the manifestation of Christ as the last Adam. *We* have got the *testimony* of Him as the last Adam, but all the ways of God really wait for the *manifestation* of Him as such. Christ has never yet been seen as the last Adam, but we in the light of the Spirit can apprehend that He is the last Adam; everything waits for His manifestation. I have no doubt that while here upon earth the Lord Jesus gave testimony that He was the last Adam, but I do not think it was understood. One testimony of it was in the resurrection of Lazarus. It was on that ground, too, that the Lord spoke to the woman in @John 4 -- "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water". He spoke there as the last Adam, because the last Adam is a life-giving spirit. The way He is a life-giving Spirit is as the Giver of living water.
In connection with Lazarus in @John 11, the Lord Jesus said to Martha, "Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" The glory of God was all bound up in the last Adam. Again, He said, "I am the resurrection, and the life", and He proved it as the last Adam. He said further, "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die". In the revelation of Christ as the last Adam, no one will die who believes and is living then.
I only refer to these things to show that while the Lord was here upon earth there was witness borne to Him as the last Adam, though He was not
{52}
manifested nor apprehended as such; that waited for the gift of the Spirit.
In @John 17 He says, "As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him". That is a witness to Him as the last Adam, and in @John 20 the Lord breathed on His disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit". He was there acting as a life-giving Spirit. Never had the Lord done such a thing as that in His pathway down here. It was when redemption was accomplished that He did so, and it was the witness to His being the last Adam. Then when He ascended, He said, "I ascend unto my Father and your Father". The glory of God and the consummation of our blessing depends on the revelation of Christ as the last Adam; that has not yet come to pass, but we have the testimony of it by the Spirit. When He is revealed everything will be changed. There will be the revelation of God's glory in connection with Him. He comes out as the Beginning of the creation of God, the Root of David. All the universe will be filled with the glory of God, as the tabernacle was filled with God's glory, and at the same time there will be the consummation of man's blessing. Then will the power of death be annulled. Those who are living will be changed, and resurrection will take place, as we read in @1 Corinthians 15: 54, "When this corruptible shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word written: Death has been swallowed up in victory". Christ has annulled death; life and incorruptibility are brought to light, though they are not yet established, but in the coming of the Lord, then it will be seen that death *is* annulled and life and incorruptibility will prevail.
It is a great thing for us to be by the Spirit in the light of the last Adam. Our testimony is bound up
{53}
with the last Adam; He is the great subject of testimony. Testimony refers to that which is going to be displayed. The last Adam is not always going to be hid where He is now. Christ will *appear* as the last Adam, that is, as a life-giving spirit. It will be a great day for all upon earth. It will mean the revival of Israel: "many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake" -- He will prove Himself to be the last Adam in regard to them, it will be a resurrection from the dead for them nationally, and even the nations will be revived in the resurrection of Israel.
But Christ is also "the beginning of the creation of God"; the whole creation of God is going to be established on the ground of resurrection, because Christ is in resurrection. We are said to be "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead", @Colossians 2: 12. That is a remarkable expression. The "operation of God" gives us the thought that God will place everything on that ground, that everything may be in accord with Christ.
Now there is another point that comes out in @1 Corinthians 15: 46 - 49: "Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven ["out of heaven", New Trans.]. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly".
Here we get another thought in connection with Christ -- not exactly the last Adam, but a thought very much akin to it, and that is the second Man. The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second Man is out of heaven. He has got to be displayed
{54}
from heaven, that is a very important point to remember. Morally He *is* out of heaven, but also He *comes* from out of heaven. He is going to be revealed out of heaven, and everything awaits that moment. The apostle goes on to say, "As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly". We all naturally derive our moral constitution from the earth. No child is beyond his parents. A child may be more or less clever than his parents, but he gets his moral constitution from his parents. His mind and his feelings are all of the same character as those of his parents. "As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy" is true of every one; our moral constitution is gained from our parents. But now we have another point, "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly". The second Man is out of heaven, He is heavenly; and the point in regard of us is that *we* are heavenly, for we are really begotten of the testimony of the heavenly One. Every christian has derived his spiritual condition from the testimony. The apostle said of the Corinthians that he had begotten them in Christ Jesus through the gospel. Our spiritual constitution is according to the heavenly, "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly". Of course, things may be very feebly developed in most of us, but if you take the christian who is begotten of the testimony of God he is in apprehension, mind, and sensibilities really according to the heavenly. The christian does not look at things according to the natural man and as man regards them, but his sensibilities, discernment, apprehension, conscience and everything about him partakes of the heavenly.
What do you think is the great witness to Christ here in this world? Some would say, and rightly so, the Holy Spirit; but He is not seen;
{55}
Christ's body is the real witness to Him. His body is what is of Himself. The great point in the epistle to the Colossians is that the christian circle is characterized by Christ. The real power and secret of it is, "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly". A christian is a kind of complex being. We have not yet done with the earth. We get aches and pains and all kinds of things which remind us that we have not yet done with the earth. But at the same time it is equally true that "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly", and there are those down here whose spiritual constitution has been begotten of the testimony of Christ, and that constitution really answers to Christ. If you ask me what christianity really is, I should say it is Christ formed in the saints by the Spirit. It is not holding a certain system of doctrine. Christianity is vital, it is Christ living in the saints by the power of the Spirit. The saints are morally in that way according to the heavenly. I cannot conceive of anything more wonderful than to be able to say that the spiritual constitution of the believer is really derived from the heavenly, so that it can really be said, "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly". John says in the third chapter of his epistle, "It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is". In other words, to take the expression we get in this chapter, "As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly". The heavenly has not yet been brought upon the scene, but what I want to point out is that the heavenly is really the beginning of the creation of God, although there is a long gap between the formation of the earthy and the revelation of the heavenly.
{56}
If you look at the worthies in Scripture previous to the coming of Christ you will find that they all bear some trait of Christ. It is not at all difficult to prove it. Read @Hebrews 11: 1 - 9 and 17 - 20. I only just touch on these cases to show before Christ came there was a witness of Him. That is a very great point with all these men. They were not all alike, but they each bore some remarkable witness of Christ. Take Abel; he offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain. What made it more excellent? Because he was in the mind of God. He had the recognition of what lay upon man by the judgment of God. He came to God with an offering that recognized that man was under death. The result of it was that God bore witness of his offering. We see that in perfection in Christ. All His life here He was speaking of the Son of man suffering. He was ever in the mind of God as to what lay upon man, and He ordered His ways with reference to the mind of God; and we get in Him the other side also, even that God bore witness of the offering. He bore witness of the offering of Christ by raising Him from the dead. In that way Abel comes before us as bearing that particular trait of Christ.
Now the point with Enoch is that he walked with God. There was no moral divergence between himself and God. He believed that God is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. That, too, is a trait of Christ. Christ expected no kind of reward from man. Of necessity He walked with God -- He fulfilled all righteousness. When He came to John the baptist to be baptised He said, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". He walked in the sense of God as a Rewarder. You get the idea of it in @Psalm 16, "The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance ... I have set the Lord always before me". (verses 5, 8.) He walked with God, and He says, "because he is at
{57}
my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope" (verses 8, 9). He was going to get the reward, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore" (verses 10, 11). Enoch walked with God and by faith he was translated to the scene above. Christ could not be translated in the same way because He had the work of redemption to accomplish, but at the same time He waited to be taken to the right hand of God; His flesh did not see corruption. He walked with God and in the consciousness that God would reward Him. This psalm is a proof of it.
Then look at Noah. He was a man of testimony, a preacher of righteousness, and one point with him was that "he condemned the world". He prepared an ark for the saving of his house, and if he did that it was evident that some catastrophe was coming upon the world. In that way, therefore, he condemned the world; but at the same time he was a preacher of righteousness. The fact is we are told it was Christ who preached in Noah. Christ all His life long was preparing an ark to the saving of His house. We are His house. The place of salvation was completely prepared when the Holy Spirit descended. If the Lord was preparing a place of salvation for His people outside the world, of necessity He condemned the world. Continually you get the condemnation of the world in the testimony of the Lord Jesus, not simply by word but by that which He was occupied with down here. He was going back to the Father in virtue of redemption and He was to send the Spirit so that there might be a place of salvation for those who were Christ's house.
{58}
Now I take up the case of Abraham. He left country and kindred and father's house and went out at the call of God. Do you remember what the Lord Jesus said in @Psalm 69: 7 - 9? "Because for thy sake I have borne reproach ..." I think that it is a remarkable utterance on the part of the Lord. Christ left kindred and country and father's house for the will of God. In @John 7 you find His brethren did not believe in Him. He became an alien and a stranger. His friends sought to take Him, but He disowned them in a way. He said, "Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? ... whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother". He was the true depository of the promises of God, and for the zeal of God's house He became a stranger to His brethren and an alien to His mother's children. In this way the course of the Lord was anticipated on the part of Abraham. One thing more in regard to Abraham. He offered up Isaac in the faith of resurrection. We get the same things in @Psalm 16, in regard to the Lord. He offered up Himself in the faith of resurrection. All the promises of God were bound up in Christ; He was the true Isaac, but He gives up all, in faith that all would be restored to Him in resurrection.
Then "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come". So the Lord could bless the disciples in regard of things to come -- He told them that the Spirit would show them things to come.
The great point of interest in @Hebrews 11 to my mind is that wherever you get a man of faith he bore some trait of Christ; and if any one of those men had been placed in the room of any of the others his faith would have come out in the same way; the principle that governed them all was faith.
Christ said, I am "the beginning of the creation
{59}
of God", and it is in that connection that I have shown that every one acting in faith bore some trait of Him. They really got their faith from Christ. Do you know what light is? It is the blending of certain colours. Now in all these men to whom I have alluded there is some colour of Christ, but when you come to Christ Himself there is no colour, there is *perfect light*, for *every one* of these traits of faith are in Him.
Christ the last Adam is the Sun of righteousness. Adam was not a sun. Christ is the Sun of righteousness who will arise with healing in His wings. He will bring in the kingdom, and the influences which will affect man down here upon earth will result in fertility and fruit-bearing on the part of man. Do not take your notion of His throne and kingdom from human thrones and kingdoms. Divest your minds of human ideas. The kingdom of God in Scripture means the moral influence of God affecting man down here upon earth, just as the sun by light and warmth so affects the earth that it becomes fertile. We get one very important point in regard to that in @1 Corinthians 15: 50. The kingdom of God comes in with the last Adam. The kingdom of God is wholly and entirely dependent on the Sun of righteousness. The Sun of righteousness will arise with healing in His wings, and the introduction of the last Adam in that light will have the effect of bringing in the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God cannot be evolved out of flesh and blood. It has to come in by the Sun of righteousness.
In connection with that we get the dispossession of death. The moral influence of God affecting man must be accompanied with the practical setting aside of death. That is one very great thing connected with the last Adam. He is a life-giving spirit. "By man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead". I may go further, by man came death,
{60}
by man will come the dispossession of death. Death will be swallowed up in victory. That refers to earth, it is a quotation from the prophet Isaiah, and you will see there that it is manifestly connected with earth. He will swallow up death in victory, and He will make a feast of fat things for His people. The reproach of His people will be taken away and a time of blessing will come upon the earth. Sin and death will reign no more, but there will be the result recorded in the end of @Romans 5, "as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord". All that is consequent upon the Sun of righteousness arising with all His healing influences, and the Sun of righteousness is Christ -- the last Adam -- a life-giving spirit.
It is a very important point to my mind that the saints are going to rule with Christ. And how? By heavenly influence. I firmly believe that the great vessel of influence in the world to come -- the vessel by which the influence of Christ will affect the whole universe is the church. Christ is going to reign supreme and He is going to reign by influence, just as the sun reigns by influence. "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him". If you suffer with Him you will have a corresponding influence when He reigns. We are looking now for the revelation of Christ as the last Adam. "As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly". It is a great thing to get an idea of Christ as the Beginning of the creation of God, and it is a great thing to look for the advent of the last Adam, the second Man who is out of heaven.

THE OFFERING PRIEST
@Luke 1: 5 - 20; @Luke 4: 18, 19; @Luke 23: 27 - 46; @Luke 24: 46 - 53; @Romans 15: 15 - 19
I daresay you will hardly understand my purpose in reading these scriptures, but they have a connection in my mind and in them we really trace the course of Christ. It is intimately connected of course with the way in which Christ is presented in this particular gospel. In Matthew the kingdom of heaven is established in Christ; He is the Sun of righteousness in heaven. In the gospel of John He is presented more in the light of the Ark of the Covenant and the Mercy Seat; but in the gospel of Luke we have Him taken from among men; His genealogy is traced right back from Adam. The point of the gospel is Man taken from among men and eventually going up to God. Morally down here He was the Priest. There is one parable in chapter 10, that of the good Samaritan, which indicates it. The priest and the Levite failed, neither of them could deal with the man that was half dead, and Christ, the Neighbour, undertakes priestly service with regard to the man. He comes in to fill not simply the place of the Levite but the place of the priest. His service was priestly. He poured in oil and wine, set him on His own beast, brought him to an inn and took care of him so long as he was in circumstances to need care. The priest and the Levite were unprofitable, they could do nothing with the man, but all was fulfilled in Christ.
For us that is the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God. "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". We draw nigh as priests, but we are priests on account of our relation to the High Priest, like the
{62}
sons of Aaron who drew nigh because they were kindred to the high priest.
Now I want to mark the transition from Aaron to Christ and also to show the consequence of it which comes out at the close of the gospel. You get the consequence of it, too, coming out in Paul. The priestly service began with the Lord but it comes out in a remarkable way in the apostle Paul. He says, "For me to be minister of Christ Jesus to the nations" -- he was ministering in priestly service in order that "the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit", @Romans 15: 16.
In @Luke 1 you get taken up every thread of piety that existed among the Jews. It is the more remarkable because this gospel was written by a gentile. The priest Zacharias and his wife were God-fearing people, "walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless". They were of the priestly line. Zacharias gets the announcement of the birth of a son, but he is not up to the announcement, and the result of it is that for the time being he comes under the judgment of God. This sets forth really that the line of Aaron failed, and failed in a very good representative. The angel told him that he should be dumb until what was spoken was fulfilled. It indicates the position of the line of Aaron to the present day. How can a dumb man speak the praises of God? It forms a kind of landmark. That order of things was about to come to an end. It could not possibly be otherwise because the mind of God was contemplating at that moment the birth of Christ. John the baptist comes before us not as priest, though he was the son of a priest, but as a prophet. The priesthood broke down in the Aaronic line because the true priest was just about to come into the scene.
{63}
Now look at chapter 4: 16 - 19. We get here what was essential in the case of priesthood. No man could exercise priestly function unless he was anointed with the holy oil. So the Lord says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised". There was an end in view in the Lord's priestly service down here and that was that there might be a company to offer up to God. You get the idea of it in @Leviticus 23, 15 - 17, where on the day of Pentecost there was the offering of the two wave loaves. There was leaven allowed in the two wave loaves, but they were presented to God in the sanctification of the Spirit. That was a type of the result of the priestly service of the Lord Jesus when He was here -- even that there might be the offering up of an acceptable sacrifice to God on the part of God's people down here.
I can understand people making dispensational difficulties about it and saying that Christ was not a priest till He went to the right hand of God; but in anticipation of that I cannot question that Christ did a great deal of priestly work down here. See what He said to Peter before his fall, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not". That was priestly work. Christ when He was here was the anointed vessel to bring about a certain result and that was that there should be an offering up to God, a company acceptable to Him, and that was priestly work.
Now pass on to another point in connection with the death of Christ -- chapter 23: 28, 34, 43, 46. There is a very great contrast between the way in which the death of Christ is presented in this gospel and in the gospels of Matthew and Mark. In the two latter you have Him as the Victim -- He is
{64}
viewed as suffering vicariously; but in the gospel of Luke what is prominent is the *offering Priest*. It is as evident as possible that the only victim which He could offer was Himself, and moreover no one could offer the Victim but Himself. There again we get the Spirit brought in, He "by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God". What marks the offering Priest is evidently the eternal Spirit, which indicates that the mind of the offering Priest was in perfect accord with the mind of God. You get all the detail of that brought out in Luke. When the Lord was going to the cross He is not concerned about Himself; He says to the women, "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves" (chapter 23: 28). Then for those who crucified Him he takes the intercessory place. "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (verse 34). He was entirely in the gracious mind of God. You get the same thing coming out in connection with the thief, "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise". The mind of God was perfect unalloyed grace. Then, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit". You could not have a more wonderful relation given than in that passage in Luke. There is the presentation to us of perfection -- not exactly in the victim, though of course there was that, but in the One who offered Himself by the eternal Spirit without spot to God. The victim was ended in death, but what abides to us is the Priest, and that is a point of the greatest moment to us. The victim represents man after the flesh, which Christ ended in His death, and God will never revive him. The offering Priest abides still and is exactly the same as what He was when He offered Himself without spot to God.
I think you and I want to have a greater sense of the perfectness of the offering Priest. A great
{65}
many people have a sense of the perfectness of the victim. The victim *was* perfect, but the victim in that sense has passed away. Christ is no longer known after the flesh; that has been terminated in His death; but as the offering Priest He abides: He is the same yesterday, today and for ever.
I would call your attention now to verses 46 - 53 of chapter 24, and in connection with that @Psalm 68: 18; @Ephesians 4: 7 - 10. We have in this last passage in Luke the accomplishment of @Psalm 68. In the act of blessing the disciples He was parted from them and carried up into heaven. Blessing the disciples was a priestly act. Whenever you find blessing going on in the Old Testament it is priestly. You get Abraham blessing Isaac, Isaac blessing Jacob, Jacob blessing his twelve sons. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were not ordained priests, but all the family of the priests spring out of Abraham. What do you think enabled them to bless? They were in the secret of God. I do not hesitate to say that it is the priest who knows the mind of God, because he has access to God, and because he knows the mind of God he blesses. Melchisedec was able to bless Abraham, because he was the priest of the Most High God; he was in the mind of God. In this passage (verses 50, 51) we have the Lord blessing. He had been offering Priest, He was qualified, He had made atonement for the sins of the people. He was not only *qualified*, but the point to my mind is that He was *capable*. All that transpired in connection with the offering of Christ proved how perfectly He was in the secret of God's mind. Therefore you can well understand that when He was being parted from them He was blessing them. It was a priestly act; He was the true Priest after the order of Melchisedec, and in the act of blessing He was parted from them. He says, "Behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you". Of necessity therefore
{66}
He must ascend, as you get in @Psalm 68. In @Ephesians 4: 10 there is a very important point, the One who descended is the same also that ascended. He came down here to do the will of God, but He ascended up as Priest that He might communicate the gift of the Spirit. The sending of the promise of the Father was on the line of blessing. That and His blessing the disciples were both priestly acts.
It all opens up to us the transition from Aaron to Christ. The announcement of the heavenly host (chapter 2) was, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men", because a Man was taken from among men. Then you get the anointing of the Spirit (chapter 4) in order that He might carry out the ministration of divine mercy upon earth. Then you have the very many traits of the perfectness of the offering Priest coming out in the death of Christ, and then in resurrection you have Him carrying out the true Melchisedec function of blessing and sending the promise of Father from on high.
From the first moment priesthood is presented in Scripture the thought of blessing is included in it. One thing on which Christ is bent at the present time in His service to us is to make us conscious of blessing, and if people are not conscious of blessing they do not get all the good of the service of the Priest. Christ would maintain us in the consciousness of blessing.
The disciples were no longer under malediction. Grace had abounded over guilt, blessing over cursing. All had been changed by redemption, and the function of the Lord is to make them conscious of blessing, and so the Lord would serve *us*. What I understand by blessing is the consciousness of divine favour. Christ has become Priest to that end. He was going to the right hand of God in order
{67}
that He might communicate the promise of the Father -- the power from on high. The power from on high came upon the apostle Paul, and he says that he was Jesus Christ's minister to the gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, "that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit", @Romans 15: 16.
It is a great thing for us to be in the good of it all. Christ would maintain us in the consciousness of blessing and nearness to God. The promise of the Father abides; it has never been removed. The attitude in which Christ left the earth is the attitude of Christ still, so that we can be maintained in the good of the blessing. Christianity is a living thing. It is not a belief of doctrines; you get nothing by faith, though you have nothing without faith, but everything you get is *communicated* to you in the power of the Spirit. Hence it is that christianity in every part of it is vital and experimental.
{68}
(1) THE SERVICE OF CHRIST
@Luke 10: 21 - 42
I want to bring before you the service of Christ. Everyone has some idea of it, but I do not think many quite discern its character. I distinguish between the priestly service of Christ, and the revelation to us in Him of God. The two things come out in one Person, and it is the fact of everything coming out in one Person that brings in perfection. In times gone by, to represent anything like completeness, two had to be taken into account. For instance, in Israel there was Moses the apostle and Aaron the priest. In the prophets we get Elijah and Elisha; and so on throughout the Old Testament. But when we come to Christ we get completeness. To take the figure I have employed, of Moses and Aaron: in Christ we get both; He is the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, and therefore we get completeness. What has come to pass in Christ, and what brings in perfection, is the fact that approach is equal to revelation. You get revelation by the apostle, and approach in the priest, and in Christ the approach is as perfect as the revelation. It was very different with Israel. Moses was the mediator; the communications of God were all by him, and he was faithful in the setting up of the tabernacle. But Aaron failed at the outset, and made the golden calf; therefore you do not get perfection. The approach which was typified in Aaron was not equal to the faithfulness of Moses; hence in that system there was imperfection.
{69}
Now it is important for us to apprehend that in connection with Christ, perfection has come in; the priest is equal to the apostle. You can understand that, because Christ is both. I wish to bring before you that we have the service of Christ in both lights. In this gospel (Luke) and the following one Christ comes before us in two different lights; but we need to put the two together, each is essential. In John, Christ speaks of His body as the temple; the Jews had defiled God's temple, and the Lord says, "Destroy *this* temple, and in three days I will raise it up". His body was the temple, and what followed upon that was, the oracles of God were there. When the Lord Jesus was here upon earth, the disciples had not much idea of going to the high priest to get the oracles of God. They had the sense that the oracles were there in Christ. But in Luke, Christ is presented as the anointed Man, who, in result, is the Priest. He is the anointed Man with knowledge, and, in result, going up on man's behalf to God. At the close of the gospel Christ is not looked at quite in the light of the victim, but as the offering Priest. In Matthew and Mark we see Him more as the victim; in Luke He is the offering Priest; and we get the perfection of the Offerer. We have not there the record of His being forsaken of God; and in the last chapter, in the act of blessing His disciples, He is parted from them and taken up into heaven, in order that He might communicate the promise of the Father. He goes up to God on behalf of man in the value of His offering. That is all priestly. The Apostle is to make God and His mind known; the Priest is what Christ is on man's behalf.
I call your attention to a passage in @Luke 4: 16 - 19. I wish to contrast that with what you get in John. It is not in Luke a question of revelation; the point is not of the temple, nor the oracles of
{70}
God; but of the Man anointed with the Spirit, who has come close to man with the object of announcing the truth and bringing it home to man -- to preach glad tiding to the poor, to serve the poor; I have no doubt there is in that the thought of the priest. The priest's lips kept knowledge, and the law was sought at his mouth, and here was one with knowledge, the anointed Man, come close to man in order to bring to him the knowledge of God. It is not difficult to distinguish between the two things; they are combined in Christ; He was the Temple where God dwelt, and He was the anointed Man, diffusing the light, bringing close to man, by priestly service, the knowledge which was proper to Him.
I think the same thing is in a sense true in regard to the church; the church is the temple of God. The apostle says to the Corinthians, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?" The Spirit of God dwells in the church; it being the temple of God, the oracles of God are there. Whatever light there is of God is in the church by the Spirit. But there is another truth connected with the church: the church is the body of Christ, where gifts are set, where there is the word of wisdom and knowledge, in order that the light may be diffused, may be brought to man in the way of service. In @1 Corinthians 3, the apostle says, "Ye are the temple of God", and in chapter 12, "Ye are the body of Christ". That is what we are called to down here. Service is more than levitical; rightly understood, it is priestly. The service of the Lord Jesus was not simply levitical: it was priestly, and had in view the offering up of a remnant of the people. That came to pass on the day of Pentecost; a remnant was offered as a result of the service of the Lord Jesus here on earth.
{71}
Now I want to touch upon the priestly service of Christ in regard to man. The objection may be raised that Christ is only Priest on behalf of His people; but at the same time there is a light in which Christ can have to say to all men. If He gave Himself a ransom for all, to bring home to man the knowledge that is His own, this ministry is priestly service on the part of the Lord.
First I will say a word in regard to the tabernacle of testimony. All the detail of the tabernacle was given to Moses, and Moses had to set it up according to the fashion shown to him. The first things about which God spoke to Moses were the ark and the mercy seat; I go no farther than that. Evidently the ark and the mercy seat were connected with the revelation of God. Everything was thus set forth in the way of figurative representation. The time was coming when God would put Himself in communication with man by the mercy seat; all was connected with revelation. But then, in connection with the tabernacle of testimony there was the priest; people often take up the tabernacle of testimony and the detail of it, but the priest was an essential part. Suppose there had been no injunctions about the priest, what good would it all have been to man? There would have been no approach to God. The furniture of the tabernacle was connected with God's way of approach to man; but that would not be of much value to man unless there were with it the thought of man's approach to God, and you get that in connection with Aaron and his sons. When God gave directions as to the tabernacle and its furniture, He gave directions for Aaron and the garments of Aaron; in order to make a system complete, you must have not only revelation, but also approach to God, and that was set forth in Aaron.
{72}
All that was typical; now we have come to the reality of things, and what is brought to our view is not simply revelation, but that the approach is equal to the revelation. You cannot understand approach except in Christ. You must remember that He has gone in as Priest; and, as to its application to us, we are taught that "through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father"; it is through Him, the One who has gone in. This is brought out at the end of the gospel of Luke. The Lord in resurrection brings home to the disciples the reality of His being Man, and after He had commissioned them, a cloud received Him out of their sight and He went up on high, in order to communicate the gift of the Holy Spirit. All that has been fulfilled; the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat are no longer typical. We have the temple and the oracles of God; God's mind is declared in Christ, and, on the other hand, approach to God is perfect, because Christ is the Priest.
Now in Luke I think we see priestly service on the part of Christ. I want to show you the way in which Christ waits upon man, to bring home to man the knowledge of God. We are in a world where we have to meet a great many things; the conditions of man's life are complex; we have to meet vicissitudes, disappointments, trials, sorrows, bereavements, weakness, and many other things. Now, if you are to pass through these things, what is going to be your stay in them? I only know of one thing that is available, and available in everything, and that is, the knowledge of God. Hence one can see the grace connected with the priestly service of Christ, who waits upon man, in order to bring home to man the knowledge of God, so that, whatever we have to meet down here, we always have a stay -- and that is God. It is not
{73}
only (I venture to say) that Christ has revealed God; the point is that, having revealed Him, He attends upon man, to bring home to him the knowledge of God, in such a way that it should be the stay of man in every circumstance.
I dare say you will remember that there is a succession of parables in Luke peculiar to that gospel. I refer to one in chapter 7: 41 - 43. I read one also in chapter 10, then I turn to @Luke 14: 15, and following. The final one is in chapter 15. Now we see in each of these Christ waiting upon man, to bring home to him the knowledge of God, because that knowledge is to be the stay of man down here. I may remark in regard to these parables that they are not found in the other gospels; they are peculiar to Luke, and connect themselves with the particular way in which Christ is presented in that gospel. I may say another thing: as you increase in the knowledge of God, you increase in the sense of blessing. If your knowledge is elementary, you will not have any very great sense of blessing. God is intent on blessing, He is called in Scripture "the blessed God"; hence the more we increase in the knowledge of God, the more we increase in blessing. What I understand by blessing is, God brought near to man, so that man may be conscious of being in the favour of God.
I take up two of these parables now, the one in the seventh and the other in the tenth chapter. They are progressive; I will first touch on the four and note the progress.
The first unfolds to us the attitude of God toward all men.
In the second there is an advance on that, and that is the resources of man in the knowledge of God.
In the third, the supper, man is called to have a part in a great divine celebration; therefore in
{74}
connection with the supper you get the thought of joy.
In the fourth, chapter 15, is the climax. The prodigal is brought back to the Father's table, to be conscious that the Father has complete complacency in him. What a wonderful thing it would be for us if we were conscious of being with the Father in such a way as to know that He has entire complacency in us, and that there is nothing to interfere with the complacency. That is what is presented to us in the thought of the prodigal. He is at the Father's table, they began to be merry, he is conscious of the Father's complacency in him, and that nothing interferes with it. I think you will be prepared to allow that there is progress in what is unfolded in these parables. The first thing that Christ sets Himself to bring home to man is the attitude of God toward man. That comes out in the parable of the creditor and the two debtors. The mind of the creditor was alike in regard to the two debtors. The two debtors represent all men. In that particular case they were intended to represent the woman and Simon, and the parable brings out that the mind of the creditor was alike to both. That is a great lesson to be brought home to man. The Lord had a very inapt pupil, for Simon was the one for whose benefit the parable was spoken. We do not hear much more about him; but, so far as we can tell, he was sceptical about Christ. He was not very sure whether, after all, Christ was a prophet. What marked the Lord was priestly grace, and therefore He could attend on Simon and bring the truth before him. It was a reproach to Simon, but we see the grace of the Lord who could utter such a parable for such a man. Christ was attendant upon man, in priestly grace, His lips keeping knowledge, to bring home to man what at that particular point was the attitude of
{75}
God toward all men. It is a lesson which the Lord would bring home to all of us. I cannot conceive anything more important than to apprehend what God's attitude is, without reserve, at this present time, not only toward the repentant, but toward all men. The secret of it is that Christ has given Himself a ransom for all, and thus every man comes into the view of God, and God is propitious toward every man. Christ is the propitiation; that is the light in which God is presented at the present time.
I pass on to the second parable, @Luke 10. The priest and Levite pass by the half-dead man on the other side, because they had to make room for the real Priest. They were the official men. Experience has taught me to distrust officialism. The moment you find officialism in divine things there is danger. In Judaism there was officialism; but it broke down, and I do not think God intends to repeat that. They passed by on the other side, but they made room for the one who was really the priest. The priest's lips are full of knowledge. Here again, the Lord had a very inapt pupil: the pupil was the lawyer. The lawyer was tempting Christ; there was nothing encouraging about the pupil, yet Christ attended on the lawyer. Lawyers and Pharisees were not very hopeful; but the Lord sought to bring home the truth to the lawyer. The question here is not of God's attitude toward all men, but of God found as a resource for man down here. There are few people who have not moral wants; what is going to heal them? The knowledge of God. What is going to carry you along? The knowledge of God. What is going to comfort you? Because you will certainly now and then need comfort. I know only one thing, and that is, the knowledge of God. Whether it is support or comfort in the pathway here through the wilderness, Christ supplies all,
{76}
and supplies all by the knowledge of God. The apostle John said to the babes, "Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things". The man that fell among thieves found everything by the Samaritan, and Christ is waiting upon man to bring home to him the knowledge of God, in such a way that it will suffice him in every circumstance and exigency in which he may be down here.
How important the knowledge of God is to us! How important that we should be set upon it! Christ is set upon it; He will serve you in that way. We do not want to be sceptical like Simon, or like the lawyer, tempting Christ. There needs readiness on our part, and we have to look to God for grace that the one thing we are athirst for is the knowledge of God. What we really want to know is divine love in its application to us in our pathway here. That is the first element in the knowledge of God. It is not the knowledge of God in the highest sense, but in the most important sense in regard to us. It is the apprehension of divine love in connection with our responsible life. I dare say I have before pointed out how this comes out in @1 John 4. The apostle takes up the love of God in its application to saints all along their responsible pathway (verses 7 - 12, 16 - 19). It does not talk about the love of God to us in heaven, as in Ephesians, where God has set the saints in heavenly places; it does not go beyond our responsible pathway here, closing up with the day of judgment, and in that connection you get the love of God. It runs parallel with what the apostle Paul says at the close of @Romans 8. It is very wonderful to see the application of divine love to us, even in the way of discipline. It comes out in that way; God has to discover to us something in ourselves which has an undue place in the heart; some idol perhaps; and love is in the way of discipline. But it is also in
{77}
view of the day of judgment; because "as he (Christ) is, so are we in this world". Not in heaven, but as in this world; it is divine love in its application to us down here. What can be so important to us as the knowledge of God? I mean the knowledge of God in that which He is toward His people here upon earth. I think we may also know God in another light; we are privileged to be led into the knowledge of God in the counsels of His love. It is a great point to be with God, to get an insight into His things. When I speak of God's things, I refer to what the Lord said in @John 16. "All things that the Father hath are mine". The Spirit of God would lead us into the land of promise, and give us an apprehension of all the things of which Christ is the centre. God has made known to us the mystery of His will, and the Spirit of God would lead us into the knowledge of God and of the counsels of His love.
One point more. It is a point of the greatest interest for the soul to be entering into God's things. You will not enter into God's things if you do not see how God enters into your things. Unless you apprehend God's love to you down here, it is futile to expect to be led into the range of God's things; but if you are led into that great circle of interests, that universe which is centred in Christ, you have to learn the capability of God to fill it all. The universe would be no good unless it were filled. Our physical universe would not be of much account unless the sun filled it all. Hence there is fertility and life. God has a universe; a vast system consisting of all things, and all centred in Christ. But it is a very blessed thought that with God there is the capability to fill it. I would not care about the thought of a universe unless I knew how it is to be filled. God has not only devised and brought to pass a universe, but He is capable of
{78}
filling it. Christ is to fill the universe of God (like the sun fills our universe) with the light and knowledge of God.
I think there ought to be with us a readiness to be led on in the knowledge of God. Grace and peace will be multiplied to us in it. Christ is waiting upon man in priestly service; there is wonderful grace about Him, though we may be dull and inattentive pupils; yet He is waiting upon us. It is a great thing to know that you have a support and a source of comfort in whatever you may be exposed to here. If you lose the dearest relative, you still have a stay and support in the knowledge of God. Christ takes care of us, and the proof of it is in bringing home to us the resource that we have in the knowledge of God. It is a great thing to be led on in the apprehension of love in the details of its application towards us. And the Spirit will lead you further into those things which are centred in Christ.
If the enemy is coming in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a banner against him. Where is it to be lifted up? In the saints. The gates of hell cannot prevail against the knowledge of God by the Spirit. That is the thing which is impregnable. You never had a single bit of knowledge of God except by the Spirit; but the gates of hell will not prevail against the knowledge of God. I desire that we might be led into it by the grace of Christ, so as to have more sense of its applicability to us in our circumstances here. Thus we shall be proof against the assaults of the enemy.

(2) THE CELEBRATION OF GRACE
@Luke 14: 15 - 24; @Luke 15: 11 - 32
There are certain parables which are peculiar to this gospel, just as there are those which are peculiar to Matthew; if you were to transplant any of these parables to another gospel, you would find that they would not fit in. If you were to take the parables in Matthew and attempt to transplant them into this gospel, they would not fit, though they have their place there just as these have here. I allude particularly to the four parables I have mentioned on a previous occasion, in which it is not difficult to apprehend a progress in the unfolding of the truth. One was the parable of the creditor and the two debtors, in the seventh chapter; then the parable of the good Samaritan in the tenth chapter; now we have the parable of the supper in the fourteenth, and still another in the fifteenth; that is the succession of parables peculiar to Luke. My point was to view these parables in the light in which Christ is presented to us in Luke. Luke specially presents to us the service of Christ as the anointed Man. I illustrated that in the parable of the good Samaritan. The priest and the Levite, official representatives of the old covenant, passed by on the other side; but they passed by to make room for the true Priest, the anointed Man. I quite admit that Christ would not be a priest if He were upon earth; but I have no doubt that many things which the Lord did when He was on earth were anticipative of what He is doing at the present time; they illustrate it. We have to take into account where Christ now is, at the right hand of God, a
{80}
Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. Many things brought before us in this gospel will help us to understand the character of the service which Christ carries on in regard to us now. When you read the gospels, you should read them in the light of where Christ is now. It is not that they present Him where He is now; but if you read them in that light, it will help you to understand them. In Luke we get Christ a real Babe, born into the world, made of a woman -- a Child, then a Man; then we have His death and resurrection; but all is leading on to what is brought out in the last chapter, Christ going up to heaven and communicating the promise of the Father. It is in the light of priestly service that Christ is presented in the gospel of Luke. Even in the account given to us of the sufferings of Christ, what comes before us is the offering priest rather than the victim.
Now the point in these parables is that we get the instruction of Christ; the anointed Man is the Instructor. I referred to a passage in @Malachi 2: 7, "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth": you never get that verified except in Christ. Throughout this gospel you have the Lord as the anointed Man, waiting upon man, to bring home to him that which He knew. The knowledge of God was perfect there: in fact, He was God; but looking at the Lord as Man, the knowledge of God was perfect, and He was attending upon men to lead them into the knowledge of the suitability of God to man down here. When a man is awakened to know anything, the first principle and element of the knowledge of God is to apprehend the attitude of God toward man; that is, not imputing trespasses, not calling men to a reckoning; His disposition toward man is forgiveness. You get that coming out at the close of this gospel: "Thus it behoved Christ to suffer,
{81}
and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations". That could never have been preached had it not been in the pleasure of God. Then in the parable of the good Samaritan we saw the true Priest, leading man into the knowledge of God, in the suitability of God to man, in his need down here. He poured in the oil and the wine, set him on his own beast, and took care of him so long as he needed care. That is what the knowledge of God means to us. It is the one thing that we have; our mainstay, and if you have not that, you have not very much. A christian is to find his comfort, his stay and support, in the knowledge of the way in which God can adapt Himself to man in man's weakness down here. It is a wonderful thing to think that God will care for a man's soul -- for his body, too, for the matter of that -- but for his soul so long as he is in need of care.
Now I pass on to the two remaining parables; they complete the series. My point is that we still have the Lord before us as Instructor. Teaching properly belongs to the priest; I do not think anyone could teach if he were not a priest. Suppose I had the capacity to teach: where did I get it from? No one can teach a christian except as he himself knows God; and if I know God, that is priestly. The fact of knowing God and having access to Him is priestly, and that is one's only capability to teach. I often feel half-afraid to take the place of teacher, feeling that one's knowledge of God is so limited that one is very little able to teach others.
People have thought they could be teachers because they had a great acquaintance with Scripture. It is not the amount of Scripture which can be stored up in the mind, which makes a man capable of teaching others. No man is capable of teaching beyond what he is as priest. We get that initiated in the
{82}
Lord Himself. He was the anointed Man, ever with God, and therefore competent to teach man; and the substance of what He taught was the knowledge of God.
Now these two parables, that of the supper and that of the prodigal, give to us another side of the truth. It is not giving man the knowledge of God in its suitability to him, but His thought and purpose here is to lead man into God's things. It is one thing to understand how suitable God is in His grace to me here; it is another thing for God to instruct me in His things, the things in which He can delight; that is the point we get now. We see that in the parable of the supper. I call your attention to the terms of the invitation: "Come; for all things are now ready". They are all ready on the part of God. It is not God attending to man's wants, it is an invitation to man to come into God's things. The One who provides the supper says, "Come; for all things are now ready". And what do you think they are ready for? So far as I understand it, they are all ready, morally, for the great day of display. The day of display has not yet come; it may not come just yet, but it will come; and the point of the present moment is that all things are ready. In Old Testament times this could not have been said, and for two reasons; the first, that the ground was not there. There was not the ground of resurrection; redemption was not accomplished. Then another reason was that the Man had not yet come who could bear the burden of all things, who should be the Centre on which all might hang; then, in order that others might have part in that, there must be redemption as the basis, and in connection with redemption, the ground of resurrection. Christianity brings into view a Man, the anointed Man, and at the same time redemption accomplished; the ground of
{83}
resurrection is there. All things are ready on the part of God. The apostle could say to the Hebrews, "Ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God". Everything for God is established in Christ, in One who is capable of upholding the pillars of the universe. Everything in the world is out of course; all is lawless; but Christ bears up the pillars of the moral universe; the Man is there on whom all this depends. If He were not great enough for that, things could not hold together. "All things subsist together by him"; in Him all are held together. But it is extremely important that He has brought in resurrection as a footing on which man can be with God.
Did you ever consider what the supper meant? Evidently a supper is for the honour of the one who gives it. If I give a supper or a dinner I give it on my own account; it is an occasion for me. So it is in regard of God. He invites the guests, and they come in, but it is an occasion for God, and therefore He will have His house filled. If a man makes a supper, and has laid his table and provided seats for a certain number of guests, he does not care to see half the seats unoccupied; he would like to see his table filled. "Compel them to come in": there was a deficiency, because there were those who had been bidden but would not come, who had some engagement more important in their own eyes; they made a gap in the company; but God wants His house filled. I understand the supper to be the celebration of righteousness, and therefore it appears to me that the thought of resurrection must enter into the supper, because resurrection is the real celebration of righteousness. I think Christ would lead us, by the Spirit, into the apprehension of the force of resurrection, that is, of His resurrection. If you get an apprehension of the power and meaning of the resurrection of
{84}
Christ, you can understand what it is to be at the great supper, and you will see that the supper is the celebration of righteousness. I refer to two scriptures, @Philippians 3: 9, 10, @Colossians 2: 11, 12. In the one passage we get the power of His resurrection spoken of, and in the other, the operation of God who raised Him from the dead. Evidently the resurrection of Christ is a point of the greatest possible moment on the part of God. "The power of his resurrection" is a remarkable expression, and again the "operation of God". It is the energetic working of the power of God that raised Him from the dead. So the apostle prays in @Ephesians 1, that the saints might know "the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead". All these passages confirm me in putting forth the thought that the resurrection is the celebration of righteousness. The truth is that righteousness was accomplished in the death of Christ. What I understand by righteousness is redemption. Every right of God was taken up in the death of Christ and maintained; the right of mercy was declared, every liability under which man lay was met by redemption, and so the death of Christ was the accomplishment of righteousness. But we have not only the accomplishment of righteousness, but the celebration of righteousness. Righteousness is established and celebrated in a Man. Hence the expression used prophetically in regard to Christ, "Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings"; righteousness involves healing.
That is what I think the great supper means; it is man coming in mind to that great celebration, and entering into it. At the beginning of Genesis God ordered a world out of nothing; but we apprehend
{85}
in the resurrection of Christ the power and ability of God to bring to pass a universe out of death. The morning of the resurrection was the greatest that ever was; it was, morally, a morning without clouds. Everything had been dark in the death of Christ; all evil had culminated there; but the morning of His resurrection was the brightest possible morning, because, in principle, God there brought a universe out of death. That is what I understand by the operation of God that raised Him from the dead. We are accustomed to look at the resurrection of Christ as a simple fact; but we want to see the import of it. At the great supper we learn the import of the fact. Hundreds can repeat as a creed, 'I believe in the resurrection of the dead'; but the point is to apprehend the import of the resurrection of Christ, that is, the ability of God to bring a universe out of death. In the world to come everything is brought out of death. The Old Testament saints, Israel, the church, are all in one way or another brought out of death. The dry bones, in Ezekiel's vision, are breathed upon and made to live; so with the nations it is life from the dead, everything is put on the ground of resurrection. That is the ground on which God establishes everything in the world to come. I will illustrate it in Elijah and Elisha. The two prophets came close together: one preceded the other. In Elijah, Israel in a sense died; he went through Jordan, and in his passing away, Israel, according to their existence under law, died. But Elisha comes back into Israel through Jordan, the right way, into the land, to Jericho. Elisha represents the revival of Israel in Christ; hence, in connection with Elisha, you will find the power of resurrection. I refer to one incident in connection with his ministry, the case of the Shunamite. God gave her a child on account of her attention to the prophet. But the
{86}
child dies; then the prophet comes in, and the effect is, the child is revived. The child was revived through Elisha having been identified with its death. The child probably points on to what will come to pass in the revival of Israel in connection with the One of whom Elisha was the type. Even in that day there was the thought of the power of God to revive Israel, and to place it on the footing of resurrection. Nationally they are buried in the dust of the earth at the present time, but the Lord will revive Israel, as He revived the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue.
It would be a great thing if we were true to our baptism, and had ceased to live in spirit in the course of this world, and were really in mind risen with Christ. But, in the first instance, we want to get the good of the great supper, to learn the power of God's operation, His capability to bring to pass a universe of bliss -- the womb of which is the death of Christ, and the pledge and beginning of it the resurrection of Christ. All, as far as man goes, was lost in the death of Christ, but in His resurrection everything is revived. Christians may go on a long time in this world, and have their part in the life of the world, but as sure as possible they have to come to the truth of their baptism. Then you can go a point farther; you learn that you are risen with Him.
I pass on to chapter 15, verses 21 - 23. What this parable brings before us is the complacency of the Father in the prodigal. It is not so much a question of what the prodigal got; the point is what the Father got; just as in the supper, the supper was for the man who made it. The Father had complete complacency in the prodigal. He says, "Let us eat, and be merry". I lay great stress upon what was put upon the prodigal. It has been said, and truly enough, that what was put upon
{87}
the prodigal formed no portion of his first inheritance. I regard that as being a most important point. What he got never belonged to man as man. What the elder brother claimed, in a way, belonged to man as man, but what the prodigal got did not. The prodigal had had his inheritance; he had no claim to anything; but he comes back to the Father, and gets what formed no part of his first inheritance. The great point is, these things were with the Father; the ring, the shoes, the best robe. The Father could not have commanded the servants to put these things on the son if they had not been there. The prodigal was there; he had repented, so that he was not there unsuitably; but the point was, that he might be there with nothing unsuitable for the Father's eye. I think @Ephesians 1: 5, 6 gives you the idea. "Having marked us out beforehand for adoption [sonship] through Jesus Christ to himself". Sonship formed no part of our first outfit. Then it adds, "Wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved". It is evident that the Beloved was ever with God. The best robe was ever with the Father, and now He has made us accepted in the Beloved. The reason we are made accepted in the Beloved is that we may be under the eye of God for His pleasure, and that we may be the witnesses of the riches of His grace. The parable of the prodigal is the climax of these parables; you cannot get beyond it; you could not have a greater place with the Father than to be made accepted in the Beloved, and it brings to pass the great testimony of God, the riches of His grace. It is a great thing to be made accepted in the Beloved; but one could not talk about it unless conscious of it. The best robe, the ring, the shoes, were put upon the prodigal; he was conscious of what was conferred upon him by the Father. I quite admit it is the thought of God for every christian that he should
{88}
be accepted in the Beloved; but I really could not speak of that being true of anyone unless there is a corresponding work of God in that person. You may depend upon it the principle is true, that what is true of you in the ways of God is true in you; and if this were not the case, there would be a measure of unreality with people. They would claim -- and have claimed -- a great many things as true of them which are not true in them. I do not think it can be God's way to sanction or promote unreality in any way. What is true of you is by a corresponding work of God made true in you. If you are accepted in the Beloved, there is a corresponding consciousness wrought in you by the Spirit of God. Now that is what I understand by having on the best robe. You cannot have it on without knowing it. The work of the Spirit in you makes you conscious that God has brought you before Himself in such a fashion as that He can have complacency in you. That is what I should call the climax of grace. It is not only to know the power of the resurrection of Christ, but the knowledge of acceptability in the Beloved in the eye of God, in the One who was ever with the Father, but who became Man, and died, and rose, and who has become a covering to us, that we may be before God for His complacency.
I do not think that we are made accepted in the Beloved simply by faith. You have on the best robe, the ring, and the shoes by the Spirit, and are there inside in order that the eye of God may be upon you in complete and entire complacency. In the ages to come the church will be the witness to the universe of the exceeding riches of God's grace.
I press upon all that Christ is the Teacher. He has given us an unction, that we may know all things; He is the priestly Teacher, to lead us into
{89}
the knowledge of God, and of those resources which God ever had with Him, which have now become a covering for man. You may depend upon it that the teaching of Christ is effective teaching. If He makes good the great supper, it is that you may understand the character of the celebration, the character and power of Christ's resurrection. No one can make any progress unless they appreciate the meaning and power of the resurrection of Christ, and see how God could bring a universe of bliss out of the death of Christ.
The parable of the prodigal is most beautiful; but it is much more beautiful when you look at it on the divine side. We can take it home to ourselves; though, as a matter of fact, it was spoken to a company of Pharisees. Most of the parables were spoken to unbelieving people, tempters, or emotional people; but the point is that Christ is the Expositor, and by the teaching of Christ we can understand the parables which He spoke.
{90}
(3) CHRIST'S PRESENT ATTITUDE
@Luke 24: 36 - 53
The facts recorded in this chapter happened well nigh two thousand years ago; that is a long time in the way in which we reckon, but we sometimes forget that God does not count time: "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day". But any way, the lapse of time has in no wise altered the attitude of the Lord. The point on which I purpose dwelling, the Lord helping me, is the attitude which Christ took here in regard to the disciples; it is still His attitude towards His people down here. I speak of His attitude, and of the proof of it, for the Lord is not only occupying a certain attitude towards His people, but is giving proof of it.
I take up the subject in connection with what I have had to say previously in regard to this gospel, as to the way in which Christ is presented in Luke. He is, I judge, presented in a priestly way all through this gospel; attending upon man, in priestly grace, to bring home to him the knowledge of God. We see this in the case of the thief on the cross. The Lord was Himself suffering, and in the company of the thief; but He took occasion of it to attend on the thief, to bring the knowledge of God's grace home to him.
Now we have the same thing in a remarkable way in the close of this chapter, in the position which the Lord takes up in regard to His disciples. He was their Instructor and the Expositor of Scripture. I quoted a passage from Malachi, "The
{91}
priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth". That is what came to pass here; they sought the law at *His* mouth, and they got it. The law was the Scriptures, "He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself". The Lord goes farther; He showed them what behoved, that is, what was morally appropriate; "Thus it behoved Christ to suffer"; it was in order that He might have a name. Then He speaks of what He purposed doing; He was going on high to send the promise of the Father. Then at the close He lifted up His hands and blessed them, and in that act He was parted from them. I do not think the attitude of the Lord is limited to the disciples, for it was in the act of blessing them that He was parted from them; the blessing was, in a sense, not finished. Simeon had blessed the parents of Jesus; now we have Christ Himself blessing those whom He had gathered round Himself in the course of His ministry. Blessing is a great thought in Scripture; it is a difficult word to attempt to explain. You will certainly not get the idea by looking the word up in the dictionary. The thought of God from the outset was blessing; we get it time after time in the Old Testament; "Blessing I will bless thee". Then the blessing of God is confirmed in Isaac, i.e., in Christ risen, and we read in Galatians, "That the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith". You will find that blessing is pretty much connected with the priest. The first time we read of the priest in Scripture, it is in connection with blessing. He took tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises. The same thought is seen with Moses and Aaron; when they came out of the tabernacle they blessed the people. Blessing is the proper function of the
{92}
priest. In the great time of blessing which is to come, we are told that the counsel of peace shall be between them both, the king and the priest (@Zechariah 6: 13). You cannot get blessing without the priest. In a sense, you will not get it without the king, for the authority of God must be established; but you certainly will not without the priest.
The first thing the Lord does here is to assure the disciples of the reality of Himself as a risen Man; He took pains that way (verses 36 - 43). Nothing can be of greater moment than that, for if there is no resurrection, there is no triumph of God over death. Death is the penalty which has come in upon man by sin, resurrection is the triumph of God's power over death in virtue of redemption: hence resurrection is a point of cardinal importance. The apostle takes it up doctrinally in @1 Corinthians 15, "By man came also the resurrection of the dead"; it has been brought to pass in the last Adam, the Head of every man. Here the Lord shows to them the reality of resurrection, in that He was actually in a body, even capable of eating and drinking. If we have not the resurrection, we had better give up the faith altogether, because the triumph of God over what has come in upon man by reason of sin cannot be witnessed to otherwise than by resurrection from the dead.
After that the Lord takes the place of Expositor (verses 44, 45). In that we get a wonderful expression of the grace of the Lord. He opened their understanding: He did it more abundantly when He went on high. A christian is one who has an unction from the Holy One, and knows all things: not of himself, nor by natural power. The Lord, in a sense, took the place of the unction here. Christ is the key to the Scriptures; no one will ever understand them except in the faith of Christ. People often go to the Scriptures to find Christ, instead of,
{93}
by the Spirit, bringing Christ to the Scriptures. You want the key; the Lord gave it to the disciples, He opened their understanding. The Scriptures testify of Christ; that is the divinely given evidence of all Scripture. I do not suppose anyone would be disposed to look for evidence outside Scripture: if you do, you are on doubtful ground. You do not go outside the sun to find evidence that it shines; the sun carries its own evidence. The same thing is true in regard to Scripture; in Scripture the Sun of righteousness shines, and we know it is Scripture because of that. You may divide Scripture up, as the Lord did; and in every part of it you will find the testimony of Christ. If you take the books of Moses, you have the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat; they did not come in until after the defection of Israel. In the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat God showed how, in spite of a broken law and the defection of the people, He would put Himself into contact with man in the rights of mercy. I believe that the twenty-fifth chapter of Exodus is the most important chapter in the whole Pentateuch. God gave to Israel the tabernacle of testimony, and the beginning of the detail furnished was the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat. Then in the historical books there are two great points: one I understand to be David; David slew the giant, and established the ark in mount Zion. David did many other things; but nothing to equal these. If you look at David as a type of Christ, you can see the application. Christ is the true David; He has slain the giant, and in Him the ark is brought to Mount Zion. When Israel or man had forfeited all in the crucifixion of Christ, God gives Christ back to man in sovereign mercy, on the ground of redemption. Then, too, in the historical books we get Elijah and Elisha; they practically teach the same thing. Everything that
{94}
would in any sense serve Israel has to come to them in that which is foreshadowed in Elisha, a risen Christ and the power of the Spirit. In the Psalms also there is a complete testimony to Christ. You get Christ incarnate, suffering, exalted, Priest for ever, and coming again into the world. It is a very complete witness running through the Psalms like a golden thread, beginning with His incarnation in @Psalm 2, and ending with His coming again into the world, and the people saying, "Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord" (@Psalm 118: 26). In the prophets we get the principle: "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy". Jesus means Jehovah saving. I believe it to be exceedingly valuable to apprehend how, in every part of Scripture, the great subject is the testimony of Christ. Do not be too much taken up with detail; the point is to seize the great principle, and the principle throughout Scripture is the testimony of Christ.
I have said enough to show that Christ binds every part of Scripture together. We have not a number of books brought together in a kind of heterogeneous mass. The books are divided into classes; and if you take up the classes severally, you will find the same thing to be the pervading feature in each, viz., the testimony of Christ. Scripture is irrefutable. Critics may deal with the letter, but they have no understanding of the spirit. They do not know the first principle, that is, that the testimony of Christ is the spirit of Scripture; if they did, I do not think they would be carping at the letter and the detail in the way they do. There is an effort abroad now to invalidate the Old Testament; but the greatest witness to the Old Testament is the Lord Himself, and if you touch the Old Testament scriptures, you touch Christ. The testimony of Christ is just as much the pervading feature in the Old Testament as it is in the New.
{95}
When the Lord spoke of "the scriptures", of course He referred to the Old Testament Scriptures.
I pass on to verses 46 - 48. The *first* consideration with God was man, not Israel. Israel thought that they were every consideration with God; but the truth comes out in Christ risen that He is the last Adam: that puts Him in relation, in a sense, to every man. The first Adam is dead long since; he is not head of anybody, he lost his place of headship morally when he fell; hence there really never was but one Head. In order that the Christ might take the place of the last Adam in regard to man, it behoved Him to suffer and to rise again, so that, in the name of the last Adam, the One who stands in relation to every man, repentance and forgiveness of sins might be proclaimed. His suffering and death had acquired for Himself as last Adam repentance and forgiveness of sins in regard to man; hence they were to be preached in His name. It is not simply that they were to be preached; the important expression in the passage is, "In his name". He had a name in relation to men, a new name which He had acquired by redemption. In Christ God is propitious toward the whole world. There is nothing which Christ has accomplished which He did not accomplish in a sense for Himself. He accomplished righteousness, that He might be the Sun of righteousness; He acquired forgiveness and repentance, in regard to man, that He might be the last Adam, the Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus. It would not have been possible for Christ to take up the position of last Adam, had He not acquired repentance and forgiveness in regard to man. Now they are at the service of every man upon earth, they have been acquired by the One who is Head of every man. The anointed Man did not belong simply to the Jew; the proper idea connected with the Messiah
{96}
is that He is Head of every man. One difference between Christ and us is this: He was anointed in order to accomplish redemption; we are anointed in virtue of redemption.
We come to the next point, verse 49: in this we see the effect of redemption, of His being the last Adam; no one would doubt that the reference is to the Spirit of God. It was not only that Christ had acquired repentance and forgiveness of sins; but, having acquired them, He was the One who could send the promise of the Father. I have little doubt that all the ways of grace in regard to man are in view of man receiving the gift of the Spirit. I do not think that forgiveness is the end and purpose of God's ways; but that man may receive the Spirit, and thus be brought into attachment to Christ. All God's ways and counsels centre in Christ. He is the One in whom God has purposed to gather together in one all things. The giving of the Holy Spirit was on the day of Pentecost, and the disciples were brought by it into attachment. The bond was established between them and Christ; they no longer belonged to this world. One brought into attachment to Christ belongs to Christ, and to the world of which Christ is the Centre. The great mistake which has been made in christendom generally is to connect Christ with *this* world. Christ and christianity have been captured, and made to do service to the world as it is. That never was the purpose of God. Whoever received the Spirit and was brought into attachment to Christ was delivered from the present course of things, because such were brought into that world which is centred in Him. To that end the Lord was going up on high, to send the promise of the Father. The point was that the testimony might go out from thence. Heaven was the real source of the testimony, and the substance of the testimony was Christ exalted
{97}
on high in the value of redemption. What a testimony that is! God has borne witness to His work, like He bore witness to the sacrifice of Abel. There is a Man exalted on high in the virtue of redemption; that is the witness which is gone out into all the world. Any man is accepted of God in the faith of that Man and of what that Man has accomplished. The disciples had no natural qualification for the work which the Lord entrusted to them; they were to wait for power from on high.
In verses 50 and 51 we have the climax. It is remarkable that the Lord did not first bless them and then say that He would send the promise of the Father upon them. That seems the more natural course. He speaks about sending the promise of the Father, and then He blesses them. It is important to my mind, because in moral order the blessing follows upon the promise of the Father. The mind of Christ toward them was blessing, and in blessing them He was parted from them. Christ has gone up on high; the Comforter has been given. Attachment to Christ is brought about; we are married to Him, and the attitude of Christ towards His people here is still blessing. The predominant thought in Luke's gospel is of Christ as Priest. He is Priest after the order of Melchisedec, which is blessing. You may say, Is there nothing else connected with priesthood? Yes, surely; He sympathizes; He succours the tempted; He saves to the uttermost; He makes intercession. There are many things He does; but I do not think that even all these things come up to the height of His priesthood; He is a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec, and what is properly priestly is the blessing of the people. The time will come when people will not want care or sympathy, when the universe will be filled with the knowledge of God; when people will not need to be saved to the
{98}
uttermost. That is peculiar to the present time, and will be peculiar to Israel in their time of trouble. But hereafter priesthood will be after the character of Melchisedec, that is, in blessing. That is the true character of priestly service, and it is the attitude of Christ. I think I can prove this; it seems to me that throughout Scripture the sign and proof of divine blessing to a people down here is that God gives rain, and consequent prosperity. One point in regard to the land of Canaan was that it received rain from heaven. So, too, in the world generally, we get rain and fruitful seasons. The deprivation of rain was a mark of disfavour, whilst the presence of rain was a sign of the blessing of God (@Hebrews 6: 7, 8). I take it that spiritual rain comes by the grace of Christ; it is the effect of His blessing. Sunshine is of all importance, but we want rain so long as we are down here. The earth could not do without sunshine, but it is often in want of rain. God sent a plentiful rain for refreshment upon His inheritance when it was weary. Refreshment is a sign and proof of the blessing of Christ, and the object of it is that the earth (we are the earth in that sense) may drink it in, and receive blessing from God. It is priestly service on the part of Christ, so that we may be according to God, sensible of the favour that comes to us, so that we may show fertility. On the other hand, you may get idle ground nigh unto cursing; that is possible. Mere professing christendom will come under that; they do not answer to the care of Christ, and their end is to be burned.
It is a great thing to apprehend the attitude of Christ to His people. Christ is indispensable to us. We want care and sympathy, and the Lord knows how to succour the tempted; many things come to us which cause exercise; we need to be kept here; we need One at the right hand of God to make
{99}
intercession for us; but it is very blessed to take in the idea of the proper priestly attitude of Christ in regard to His people. Everything that the Lord did in regard to man upon earth, He does in some sense now. He is the same yesterday, and today, and forever. If when upon earth He laid Himself out to attend on man, to bring home to him the knowledge of God, the same thing is true in regard to Him now at the right hand of God. He is in the attitude of blessing; He never gives it up, and the proof of it is that rain comes; by rain I mean the ministry which comes to the Lord's people in the way of refreshment, the object of which is that we may be fruitful, that the ground may respond to the care which is exercised in regard to it.
It is a great thing to be in the region of realities, to live in the region of the Spirit. People move in a way a good deal out of the region of the Spirit, and are exposed to many dangers. It is a great thing to keep within the Spirit's region; it is a safe place for saints to abide in: the region of the Spirit is instinct with life; there is no death there. The moment you move outside that region there is moral death in every direction. People say, where am I to find the region of the Spirit? I think it is to be found; it certainly existed at the beginning, and in that region life prevailed, not death. It is a great thing for us to be found there, because there we live in realities. The greatest of realities is what Christ is towards His people down here, in the attitude of blessing, which He never gives up. When the Lord comes again for His people He will come in the attitude of blessing. We look for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. He will come in the attitude of blessing, to give us the climax of all; "I will come again, and receive you unto myself". It is a great thing for the heart to be familiar with blessing; there is plenty in this world
{100}
that is not blessing at all. There is no service which the Lord carried out when He was upon earth that He does not still carry out in regard to His people; He is unchangeably the same.
{101}
(4) THE SURE MERCIES OF DAVID
@2 Samuel 23: 1 - 7; @Acts 17: 31; @Hebrews 1: 7 - 9
The last words of a great man are generally of moment. He cannot have much before him in connection with this world; and is in measure free from being swayed and prejudiced by motives connected with worldly advantage. When a man comes towards the close of his life, he reviews his pathway, and you can therefore attach importance to his last words. Here we get the last words of a very distinguished man. He was raised up of God; God took him from the sheepfold and raised him up on high, set him in a distinguished place in the political firmament. God had a garden here upon earth, which consisted of a number of nations, in the midst of which God ruled. Israel was by far the most distinguished nation, and David the most distinguished man. He was the anointed of God, and ruled by divine right. Then he was the sweet psalmist of Israel; and Scripture gives us his last words. I think that we may fairly attach importance to them; they are pregnant with meaning, and well worthy of consideration. The interesting part is that, while he has to admit the failure of his own house, "Although my house be not so with God", yet his refuge was in the fidelity of God. This is a great thing for us; most of us would be prepared to admit that our houses are not perfect with God; we could not find unalloyed satisfaction in our houses; still, there is a refuge for those who are in the fear of God; we can count on His fidelity: "He hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure".
{102}
I point out one thing in regard to David. In the historical books of Scripture David is the central point. The ordinary links of the people with God had previously broken down. The priesthood had failed; Eli had died; the ark had been taken by the Philistines. Then it is that David is raised up of God. He was "the beloved"; that is the meaning of his name; he formed a fresh link of the people with God on the ground of sovereign mercy. That is excessively important. The kingdom properly comes in with David; Saul was set aside from the outset. The kingdom really means the intervention of God in the rights of mercy. I do not think people sufficiently connect the idea of mercy with the kingdom; but that is what the kingdom is to us, and its purposes and intention is the bringing of man under the moral sway of God. Nothing else than mercy would do this. If man is to be brought under the moral sway of God, it must be through the expression of God's rights in mercy. There could be no kingdom of God except in mercy, and so it must be based on redemption. Men are all under death, under the curse of God; and unless redemption had come in for a foundation, there could be no kingdom of God at all. You will see how that comes out in connection with Christ.
I say one thing in regard to David: he was the expression of the mercy of God. He was raised up in a very special way. At the beginning of his history in connection with the people he adventured himself against the giant Goliath, and killed him. It was the intervention of God in mercy on behalf of His people. But there is another very important point connected with David; he was raised up of God to bring the ark to Mount Zion. God would not allow the ark to remain among the Philistines; He smote them in the hinder parts and put them to a perpetual shame; and David brought the ark to
{103}
Zion. Zion was the place where God saw fit to dwell. They celebrated the establishment of the ark with the song, "His mercy endureth for ever". I think all ought to be able to see that the kingdom was the expression of God's rights of mercy in regard to the people. God retired into His rights and raised up the kingdom in David, to bring the people under the moral sway of God thus made known. Nothing very much was effected in that day; yet the kingdom went on for many years.
Another thing marked David; he appreciated the mercy of which he was the expression. That he was the expression of God's mercy there can be no doubt, he came in when there was no help for the people except in the mercy of God; but in the history of David it is evident that he appreciated the mercy of which he was the expression. I refer to these things because they make it evident that David looked on, and the kingdom looked on, to One who was much greater than David. The ways of God did not terminate with David; and the promise to David, to which God pledged Himself, was that of his seed He would raise up One to sit upon his throne. You have to read @Psalm 89 to get the idea of the sure mercies of David. The sure mercies of David have pledged God to the restoration of Israel in the world to come. You will find that the prophets go on the ground of the sure mercies of David.
The utterance that we get here on the part of David is evidently prophetic; he was just about to pass away, and he reviewed his course. I have heard it said that when a man is drowning, in a moment all his life passes before his view. So it was with David, and the effect of it was that David could not find satisfaction in himself or in his house. David speaks here prophetically, by the Spirit of Jehovah, of the ruler among men. In a
{104}
certain sense David himself had been a ruler among men; but he had not fulfilled what was spoken of here. "He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God". As a matter of fact, David on more than one occasion proved himself lawless. David was really a man of faith and beloved of God; but when he came to the zenith of his power he proved that there was lawlessness with him. David was brighter in the day of adversity than in the day of prosperity. In adversity he shines, in prosperity he fails. Now he that rules among men must be just, or righteous, ruling in the fear of God. He should be as the light of the morning when the sun rises, a morning without clouds. One cannot doubt for a moment that this points to the Sun of righteousness. What do you think will bring in the morning without clouds? I think the Sun will do it. In the physical world we see the beneficent effect of sunshine on the earth after rain. This scripture looks on to the time when the Sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in His wings. Before that the earth will come under very pernicious influences morally; there will be the combination here of all the influences of evil; then the Sun of righteousness will rise and disperse all.
The moment the Lord Jesus came into this world He presented the kingdom of God, for He presented the rights of God in mercy. The law of God was in His heart, but He presented the rights of mercy, that men might be brought under the moral sway of God. You remember Mary Magdalene; the Lord cast seven devils out of her in the rights of mercy. She had no particular claim on God for that, but the Lord exercised the rights of mercy, with the effect that she was brought into the kingdom, the moral sway of God. So with the woman in the synagogue who had been bound eighteen years; the Lord released her; He exercised the rights of
{105}
mercy, and the woman was brought under the moral sway of God. In the case of the ten lepers: they were all cleansed, but nine of them never came into the kingdom; still God secured His tithe; the tenth came back and glorified God, he was subdued by the mercy of God. You must remember that the kingdom is God's assertion of Himself in the rights of mercy.
Now I say farther in regard to that, Christ appreciated the mercy which He expressed. He delighted in mercy, and in the exercise of it. The Lord never conferred any benefit grudgingly. He Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses. It has been said by a very intelligent servant of God that Christ bore in His spirit what He took away by His power; and if He felt the ills under which men suffered, do you not think that He appreciated God's mercy towards man? I am sure everybody would be prepared to allow that.
When we pass on we find that, in the mercy of God, the Lord laid the foundations of the kingdom in redemption. The mercy of God must rest on redemption, because man lay under liabilities to God, and they, of necessity, had to be met. Redemption came in; Christ by the grace of God tasted death for everything. Now God has appointed a day in the which He will judge, not only Israel, but the world, in righteousness. The ruler among men must be righteous. God is going to govern the world in righteousness, in the rights of mercy; and He has given assurance of it in the resurrection of the Man whom He has appointed. This is a wonderful thought to my mind; it shows me that God will establish the kingdom on the basis of resurrection, so that man may have a footing there. If the kingdom were established on the old ground of nature, death would be there, and the curse. God has been pleased to establish the kingdom on
{106}
the basis of resurrection, through redemption, in order that man may have a place there, and so He has given assurance of the kingdom to all men, in that He has raised Jesus from the dead.
We have come now to the truth of things, the Sun of righteousness and the kingdom. As to the character of it, I quote a verse in @Hebrews 1, "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity" (lawlessness). Christ proved Himself to be just. He delighted in righteousness; He loved every acknowledgment of the rights of God, whether it were in law or in mercy.
Now I trust you will be able to see how far the prophecy of David has been fulfilled. David looked forward to One not only positionally greater, but morally greater than himself; One who could be said to be righteous, the Sun of righteousness, rising with healing in His wings, bringing in the morning without clouds. The expression is beautiful. I want you to contemplate Christ in that light. We have come into the kingdom, under the moral sway of God; it has been established in the hearts of believers in the power of the Holy Spirit, so that the scripture can say, "The kingdom of God is ... righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit".
I turn to verses 4 and 5, the sure and everlasting covenant. Christ was the sure and everlasting covenant which God made with David; the sure mercies of David meant Christ. In @Acts 13 the apostle Paul quotes that expression in confirmation of the truth of a risen Christ. In the case of David, and of the Lord Himself, there was the appreciation of the mercy which they expressed. Christ was the perfect expression of the mercy of God. When the Syrophenician woman appealed to the Lord on
{107}
the ground of mercy, she got what she desired; so with the blind men: the Lord gave them their sight. On the other hand, He was the covenant of God. The sun in the heavens is a kind of covenant between God and man; at all events, a rainbow is, and the recurrence of day and night. But, after all, the great pledge of God's mercy and goodness toward man is a risen Christ. It is in principle very much like the bringing back of the ark. Israel had forfeited everything by their folly in taking the ark into battle; then God gave the ark back to them in the sovereignty of mercy. God had established a covenant with man in the fact of Christ having become man; but man broke the covenant; they crucified Christ, and now God gives Christ back to man in resurrection, on the ground of redemption.
It is a great point to apprehend that everything is assured; we have not only got the perfect expression of God's righteousness and mercy, but the appreciation of that righteousness and mercy in a man; Christ is perfect in His appreciation of all that which He has Himself expressed. I believe that to be the security of the universe. God has secured a Man in whom everything is effected. That is the covenant, "ordered in all things, and sure". I can say, my house is not so with God; there are many things we have to deplore, looking back on our own path; yet, after all, God has ordered and established with us a covenant, ordered in all things, and sure. I can turn my eyes away from my imperfections, and those of my house, not only to the revelations of God, but to that Man in whom the appreciation of mercy is perfect. We can say much more than David, that Man has been pleased to give us living water, in order to conform us to Himself. What is all our desire? It is Christ. I am sure no one can look upon himself with anything like unalloyed satisfaction. But if I look at Christ, He
{108}
is the Mediator between God and men, perfect in the appreciation of the mercy of God, and having the capability and power, in virtue of redemption, of communicating living water to conform us to Himself.
I turn to @Revelation 22: 16, 17. That passage is extremely beautiful in connection with what I have said in regard to David. The Lord says, "I am the root and the offspring of David". David saw Him as his offspring; but now the truth comes out that He is the root of David. He was the root of David morally. Then He says, "And the bright and morning star". He does not say, I am the Sun of righteousness, because He has not yet come out in that light. Then He says, whosoever is athirst, let him come, and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. The ruler among men must be just; He is the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning Star; He will appear as the Sun of righteousness, and bring in the morning without clouds; but in the meantime He imparts living water, to conform us to Himself. I do not think anybody need be disappointed at being a failure. I little dreamt forty or fifty years ago what a failure I would find myself to be. If people get disappointed in themselves, it only proves that they do not know themselves. God never expected to find anything in you. What He works in you is the appreciation of Christ. I can esteem Him as the everlasting Covenant, the One who came to express the mercy of God, and who appreciated the mercy that He expressed; and He has given living water, to conform us to Himself. Now we have another spring; we have the nether as well as the upper spring, that is the covenant ordered in all things, and sure; Christ cannot fail. There is not only grace with Christ, but power. He has power to subdue all things to Himself. Christ can touch a
{109}
man like Saul of Tarsus, and he gives in, in a moment, like Jacob. Then Saul could not find much satisfaction in himself; but Christ subdued him, brought him into the kingdom, and communicated to him living water: Saul was conformed to Christ, he says, "For me to live is Christ". I think people have not sufficiently contemplated Christ on two sides. They have apprehended Him as the expression of the mercy of God, but have failed to appreciate Him as delighting in the mercy which He expressed.
I refer for a moment to verses 6 and 7. The truth is that there are the sons of Belial. There are those who are irreconcilable. I do not expect that all men are going to believe the gospel. What then? The irreconcilables, when they prove themselves such in the apostasy and the setting up of Antichrist, will be thrust away and come under the judgment of God; they will be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord. That is what David prophesied. He was the sweet psalmist of Israel, yet he could speak of very solemn things. You will find many a bitter word in the Psalms, because there are those upon earth who are sons of Belial, and irreconcilable to God. All will come out in due season.
Now I think we ought to have profound delight in the thought of the Sun of righteousness. Think of God bringing to an end the terrible confusion and lawlessness in this world. All the noxious and poisonous influences which affect men in the world will be dispelled by the advent of Christ. He is just, and will rule in the fear of the Lord; and the fear of the Lord will be the great ruling principle in that day; when men universally will be brought under the influence of the mercy of God. We can look forward to that day. But it is equally a comfort to think that, in the consciousness of our
{110}
failure, we can fall back upon the certainty of God's covenant. If you ask me where that covenant is, I point you to Christ as Man. He knows perfectly well all our infirmity. He came in contact with all kinds of people; but He never made anything of their failures; one was as good as another to Him, or as bad. It was just a question of those who were subdued by the mercy which He expressed; then He could give to them living water, to conform them to Himself. What came out in those who immediately surrounded the Lord -- Peter, and many another -- was weakness, lack of intelligence, and faithlessness. Peter thought he had some good in himself; he would not deny the Lord, though all the others might. He had no power of faithfulness, and the Lord knew it. Then the Lord communicated to Peter the living water, to conform him to Himself. It is such a comfort to think that Christ expects nothing in us. He is going to work everything in us. He will not have a bit of you and a bit of Himself; He is going to displace you morally, and conform you to Himself.
It is a great thing to apprehend Christ as the covenant that cannot fail, ordered in all things, and sure. This hope was the comfort and stay of David when he was about to pass away, and the same is really much more true in regard to us, because the covenant has come in; hence we understand its terms better than David could.
{111}
THE NEW MAN
@Colossians 3: 8 - 17
What I want, beloved brethren, is to speak a word of a practical character (though I know I am not a good hand at that). I desire to bring before our souls for a moment, by the Lord's help, the testimony of the saints here. I do not mean our individual testimony, but what I might call our corporate testimony. What I mean by this is, the front which saints ought to present down here; or to put it in words which will be better understood, the way in which the saints are looked at corporately, as a vessel for the display of Christ here, the expression of the heavenly Man. It is what comes to us here as the new man. And I think we have the realisation of the Lord's prayer in @John 17: 21: "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".
Before I speak of this I would say a word about the contrast in these different epistles, Romans, Colossians and Ephesians, because I think we have been, perhaps, a little too much inclined to regard them simply as stepping-stones from one to another: for example, Romans to Colossians, and Colossians to Ephesians. I do not doubt for a moment there is a measure of truth in that. I have no doubt we apprehend truth in that way. I question if a person who did not know Romans would understand much of Colossians; or if one who did not know something of Colossians would understand much of Ephesians. But it is important to remember that each epistle presents christians in a different aspect. If we apprehend what has come out in one, it does not shut out what has come out in another.
{112}
This afternoon we had the christian presented in two aspects very distinctly: as "in Christ", and in his actual condition down here. If we look at the christian in Romans, we see him in his individuality. You do not get the "one new man" in Romans. The body is only brought in incidentally. The christian is a justified man in the place where he was a guilty man; he is in the Spirit, not in the flesh, or a debtor to it; it is a christian in his individual pathway through the wilderness. We do not get into the land in Romans. When I pass on to Colossians I come to another aspect. It is more corporate. In the passage read, I find the truth of one body. "To the which also ye have been called in one body" (verse 15). I have no doubt the reason is because this part of the epistle shows to us the testimony which is to be presented in saints down here corporately. That no one christian is adequate for the expression of Christ I should think every one would allow. The Lord when He comes is "to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe". In *all* His saints. In that day the saints will be the vessel for the display of the glory and beauty of the heavenly Man.
The great point in Colossians is Christ in us; not we in Christ, but Christ in us; because it is more a question of character. "Christ in you, the hope of glory". Then speaking about the new man, he says, "Christ is all, and in all". Anyone, I think, would see that this is quite distinct from Romans -- the individual saint indwelt by the Spirit of God, guided by the Spirit of God through the wilderness. Here we have the proper testimony of saints as one body; the beauty and excellency of Christ as the heavenly Man is to come out here in the one body. As "the elect of God, holy and beloved", they are to put on bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering.
{113}
Above all they are to put on love, which is the bond of perfectness; the peace of Christ is to rule in their hearts; the word of Christ to dwell in them richly. Christ characterises them.
I just pass on for a moment to look at Ephesians. There I find another truth which does not shut out either of what we have seen. Christians are there viewed distinctly in Christ according to the full height of the privilege. I do not mean that it is not touched in Romans and Colossians, but in Ephesians it is distinctly new creation. "Chosen us in him before the foundation of the world"; "His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works". It was really the beginning, God's start with us. We may not apprehend it that way, but God began that way, and we are a new creation in Christ. That does not shut out the teaching of the other two epistles, clearly; the saints remain in their individuality down here, and the testimony and service which come out in the saints in Colossians abide. The truth in Ephesians fills out the others; and more -- if the truth of Ephesians is apprehended, that is, that there is a new creation in Christ, the truth of Colossians and Romans is better understood -- we can see better what it is for Christ to be in the saints, and are better able to reckon ourselves dead indeed unto sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
I have just said this because I think there is a little danger of looking at the epistles simply as stepping-stones, though I have no doubt we learn in order. When we get to Ephesians we really get to where God started from; when we were dead in trespasses and sins, He quickened us together with Christ. That sheds immensely greater light on what we get in the other epistles; but Colossians continues as long as we are down here; there is to be the testimony of the new man, and at the same
{114}
time we have to be guided through the wilderness in the power of the Holy Spirit. It is a wonderful thing to be a justified man where one was a guilty man, and to have Christ as the spring of life, no other spring but Christ.
I desire to refer to the exhortations that come out here, and to add one word as to deliverance; we know so little of it. I hesitate to speak of it because one knows it so little, but it is a point of so much moment, we cannot advance in divine things without it. Deliverance is not that which is realised all at once. I do not say it is not ours, but I do not think it is realised all at once in our experience. In Colossians we find the deliverance is very complete. We do not get deliverance in Ephesians. The truth unfolded there does not leave room for it; it is not a question of experience, but of new creation. You can hardly find room in new creation for that which is experimental in the way of deliverance. But when we come, as in Colossians, to the collective testimony of the saints here, it becomes a very important point. So it is in Romans. How can I walk here as reckoning myself alive to God if I do not know that I am dead to sin? I have to accept that I am dead to sin; thank God I am! Sin does not come in between the believer and God. It has been completely put out on the cross, or how could I go on with God? You cannot put "alive to God in Christ Jesus" and "sin" together. There must be the other side of it -- that you are dead to sin.
We had alluded to this afternoon a point of importance: the difference between deliverance and liberty. Deliverance from sin is by the word and is effected at the outset. Liberty lies more in the power of the Holy Spirit, and is a law. The idea of deliverance is, I think, very much enlarged in Colossians. I will tell you why: the new man is brought
{115}
in; the point is testimony, and the testimony is that of the new man; therefore deliverance is very full indeed. What we get in Colossians goes even to this: 'We have put off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ; we are dead to the world'; that goes a very long way. The death of Christ is very absolute here. With Him it was actual death, and a complete bringing to an end of all that we are morally, good or bad. I do not talk about good in respect of God, but there may be certain things estimable in man down here. In the death of Christ all that we are was brought to an end, morally, before God. There is the ground of deliverance; we could not have it otherwise. It is not a deliverance I have to work out, and in a certain sense it does not depend upon my realisation of it, though it is no good to me if I do not realise it. It lies in the death of Christ; all the springs of my being were judged in the cross of Christ; so that the old man and flesh does not come in now between God and me. It is not merely sin, but the christian has put off the body of the flesh, that which fitted me for the course of things down here. In Colossians it is taken up more as the religious course of things. What have I to fit me for the course of man in the world? The life of the flesh: and every christian professes to have put off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, "buried with him in baptism". What I avow is this -- that I have no life for the world morally (not actually of course); I am entitled to avow it because of what has taken place in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ. A great privilege it is to know that nothing whatever stands between God and me. I am before God according to His quickening power, everything removed that stood between Him and me.
This is brought before us to pave the way for the proper testimony of christians here, the corporate
{116}
testimony. The saints are to be the expression of Christ here; it is an important point to regard. It is, as I have said, a very different thing from going through the wilderness in the power of the Spirit of God, which I find in Romans. In @Colossians 3 there is something morally outside this world. When you come to talk about the new man you must remember you have something outside the course of this world altogether. The body of Christ is outside this world; it is here, but as to its nature, by the very fact of being united to the Head, it is outside the course of this world. And so the new man; it is a new creation, not suitable for the scene here. I have put off the body of the flesh that fitted me for this world, its philosophy, religiousness, and so on; and now I come into the presence of something which, in its nature, is outside this world -- the new man. We find it very difficult to understand its place and character in this way: christianity is so mixed up with the world. Real christians have got so mixed up with the world that there is great difficulty in distinguishing the new man. It is "renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him". That is the first characteristic of what we have put on. The word there, "renewed in knowledge", means that account is taken of a completely new order of objects. The word in the original is very strong. Suppose we were placed in heaven, and had to look at everything and everyone as it is before God, that is to say, morally, I think we should be taken aback to a very great extent, because we are so little accustomed to it. We judge of things according to appearance, according to what is external. This was the case with the Corinthians. But suppose we were in heaven, in the conscious presence of God, then everyone and everything has to be looked at as to what they are before God, and therefore, through
{117}
grace, the first may be last and the last first. The first in nature, last in grace. The new man is renewed in knowledge. Mark this! You begin to get a knowledge, a view of things according to the image of Him that created him; all is measured by Christ. Do you think the Lord, when here, judged things according to appearance? Do you think He took account of people as the world takes account? Nothing of the kind! He took a true estimate of everyone and everything according to God. "As I hear I judge". That was His principle. He was dependent. This then is the first characteristic -- "renewed in knowledge".
What is the next thing? "Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free". It is all outside this world, outside the wilderness. I find Jew and Greek down here; but in the new man it all vanishes. We have to take account of saints in that way, apart from all that distinguishes them in this world. When we look at saints in that light, as the vessel of testimony here, we have to leave aside all these artificial distinctions, and to view them apart from it all, because we look at them as before God. It is a tremendous lesson; the sooner we set ourselves to do it the better! We shall have to know it perfectly in heaven; everything will be seen there according to its true worth. The sooner we learn to judge of ourselves and one another, according to what we are by the grace of God, the better. When we get outside wilderness circumstances we learn to look at things as God sees them, and we see the first last, and the last first. Everything is overturned in the presence of God. Thank God we can learn it! It is a wonderful thing, with our judgment and thought of things formed by the world in which we have been brought up, to find all reversed when we look at things in
{118}
the presence of God. I can bear to see it all reversed in His presence. Christ is now "all", the Object, and "in all".
Now we get exhortations. "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye". It is Christ under the eye of God here. The first man, as I may say, is gone; every distinction in flesh all gone, and you have the saints now in your eye according to what they are in God's eye, Christ in them. You see them as the elect of God, holy and beloved. We naturally look at each other according to our peculiar eccentricities, and judge each other hardly oftentimes. We are to look at each other as "the elect of God, holy and beloved". Christ has passed out of this world, but He is here in the new man. The new man takes the place of Christ here in a way. The saints are here as the "elect of God, holy and beloved".
Then he speaks of what is suited to it. Christ is the standard of conduct, beloved brethren. All this truth never came out until Christ was entirely out of this scene, every link with the flesh broken. When He was raised from the dead, and at the right hand of God, this wonderful truth came out. I do not think this truth could have been borne before; I do not think we could bear it now, except by grace and the power of the Holy Spirit, to break away from everything here, and view the saints as they are before God holy and beloved; then to put on all these things, and above all, love, which is the bond of perfectness.
As I said before, no one saint is adequate to be the expression of Christ down here. One trait may come out in one saint, another in another; but we
{119}
need to be placed in relation one to another in order that the varied beauty of Christ may be reproduced. However we mar it, or spoil it, down here, it will come out in the day of the glory of Christ. He will be glorified in His saints, and admired in all them that believe. We want to look at each other apart from the eccentricities that distinguish us down here, and to see instead the saints as the vessel for the display of Christ. The more we know what the saints are before God -- a new creation -- the better we shall understand it.
This was what was before my mind; and I think it is a day when we need to have it brought before us, and our hearts recalled to it: to get outside individual peculiarity and see what the saints are as the vessel of God's testimony down here. Deliverance is a very important feature in it. Indeed, I do not think we can enter into the truth except as deliverance is ours. We have put off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ. Then the realisation of it is another matter. We have all of us taken the place of being dead to sin, dead to the world in the death of Christ; but the realisation is another thing. Thank God! it has all been wrought for us. It does not depend upon our realisation, it belongs to us. The great thing is to enter into it, so that we may bear our part in the testimony which God has been pleased to bring about on this earth for His Son, who has been rejected here on this earth.
{120}
CHRIST'S PRESENCE IN THE FATHER'S HOUSE MAKES A PLACE FOR US
@Hebrews 9: 24; @Hebrews 10: 1 - 22
Ques. What shall we read?
Rem. Well, I was thinking we might go on with Hebrews and have a little more about the priest gone in, in the end of @Hebrews 9. I suppose it is not exactly the priest here; it is not exactly priestly service, though it is He who is the Priest.
F.E.R. No; you get the priest again in chapter 10 as "great priest over the house of God", verse 21.
Ques. What distinction do you make between "heaven itself" (chapter 9) and the holiest (chapter 10)?
F.E.R. If you had not a place in heaven you could not enter the holiest. Christ has gone into heaven itself to appear in the presence of God for us. He is not only there, but He is there *for us*. If you have not a place in heaven by the will of God you could not enter the holiest, the idea in which is moral -- the place of privilege of saints on earth.
Ques. Does His place determine ours?
F.E.R. I think so. He has gone into heaven to appear in the presence of God for us.
Ques. Is His place now the place we shall have hereafter?
F.E.R. I think so, as in the Father's house.
Ques. Would you call that our standing?
F.E.R. No; it is more place. He goes up and takes that place for us. He is there for us, that gives us a place in heaven. It is His presence in the Father's house as man that makes a place for us. It is not the making a place in any material sense. It is more than title, because it is a place prepared for us.
{121}
Ques. Is it as Forerunner He prepares the place?
F.E.R. As Forerunner He has entered within the veil, it is more a moral idea; heaven is a place.
Rem. It was a question when the Lord left the earth whether He would return, the eleven only saw Him go into the cloud, they did not see any further. When the moment of His rejection came in the stoning of Stephen (@Acts 7) the heavens were opened, and Stephen looked up and saw the glory of God and Jesus, and the moment he saw Jesus (he looked *through* the cloud, for he says, "I see the heavens opened"), that is *home*; he knew where he was going; going home. That makes our place. Stephen saw Jesus there and that made a place for him. We know the Person who is there. The moment you see the glory of God and Jesus in it, it is home.
Ques. Would you say a word about the end of chapter 6?
F.E.R. The idea of the holiest is that which is within the veil.
Ques. Are we to understand that "within the veil" corresponds to the place in chapter 10? Is chapter 6 moral and not exactly the heavenly places?
F.E.R. Chapter 6 is not exactly the same as chapter 10. In chapter 6 Christ has entered within the veil and become a priest, to lead us into it. "Which (*hope*) we have as anchor of the soul" in chapter 6. When you come to chapter 10 *we* enter in.
Ques. In chapter 6 within the veil is connected with the hope. Does the hope apply to us?
F.E.R. Yes; for as a christian here on earth, whether you enter into your privileges or not, your hope is there. Even the Jew had fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope, but in chapter 10 we enter in; it is not the hope there, but a question of entering into privilege. You embrace your privilege. The Hebrews had not entered into privilege at all, because
{122}
they were still in the camp; but their hope entered there; the anchor of the soul sure and steadfast.
Ques. Can you tell us the meaning of within the veil?
F.E.R. You cannot understand the expression or what it is unless you apprehend what the sanctuary is. An Israelite knew what it meant, because he understood what the sanctuary was. "Within the veil" was the holiest of all, where the high priest went once a year. We have not, as they, a material sanctuary. I believe it is the presence of God; the revelation of Himself in that which is before Him for His glory. The sanctuary in its entirety is the full display of God. The sanctuary took in all, the holy place and the most holy.
Ques. The veil being rent, it has all a different character?
F.E.R. You must understand what the sanctuary is before you understand the rending of the veil. It is the full revelation of God through Christ's death.
Ques. Why do you say the veil rent is God coming out?
F.E.R. The veil is never seen as rent in Hebrews, you go through it. Indeed, you do not get the rending of the veil except in the three synoptic gospels. It was rent from the top to the bottom, that was God coming out; but that is not what we have in this part of the epistle to the Hebrews.
Ques. Why?
F.E.R. Because you must go in through death, and that is death effectuated in *you*, you have to appropriate the death of Christ for yourself. It is not here a rent veil, an opened way, but a way through, which depends on the appropriation of death in you. The way is there.
Ques. We must go in through it?
{123}
F.E.R. The great point is, Christ is gone in first. It is not simply God come out, but Christ has gone that way through death. He is the first to go in. He went in through death, and that is the way you go in, a new and living way. It is not merely by faith in His death, but that death is effectuated in *you*.
Rem. You cannot go in as a living man in flesh. You must appropriate His death.
F.E.R. You cannot bring in anything that the rending of the veil has set aside. To put it in other words, it is the soul's realisation of privilege, all is based on the virtue of the death of Christ, His perfect sacrifice. In my soul's appropriation of death I am on an entirely new footing before God.
Ques. Then in the gospels the rending of the veil would be God coming out, and in Hebrews we go in?
F.E.R. Yes; it is the end of man in flesh; it must be made good in us. It is the appropriation of Christ's death, as bringing man to nothing as in the flesh.
Ques. Is it not the place where every christian always is?
F.E.R. No; it is privilege. Access, if you like. In Hebrews it is not power but the *way* that we get in. It is the privilege of the saint here, the soul passing that way. It is the soul's appropriation of privilege, you go in to your privilege. Privilege indicates something conferred on you through the grace of God. The soul passes into it. Every christian has the privilege; it belongs to him, but he may not be enjoying it. You must not confound privilege with moral state.
Rem. The moral state is settled by the way you go on. Every christian has the privilege, but every christian does not take it up, he does not go in by the new and living way.
F.E.R. You must maintain the privilege, because that is on the divine side and our title.
Ques. What is the new and living way?
{124}
F.E.R. The way by which He passed through. He has died to sin and lives unto God. He is alive, a Person out of death. He has taken up a platform on which we can be with Him. I think @Romans 6: 10 explains it. No one could ever have been with Him after the flesh. He is the corn of wheat that has fallen into the ground and died, He has left the order of things connected with man in the flesh, and has taken up a place in resurrection, out of sin and alive to God, in which we can be with Him. We never could have had association with Him in the flesh.
Ques. What is "through the veil, that is to say, his flesh"?
F.E.R. That refers to the fact of His death.
Ques. I should like to know why you object to the veil rent in Hebrews?
F.E.R. Because if the way were perfectly open to man we should go in as we are, as alive in flesh; but we go in through the appropriation of Christ's death to what we are as in the flesh, and you do not go in except that way.
Rem. You must go in the same way that Christ went in, but you have to go *that* way, and you will not go in unless you do go that way.
Ques. Does it correspond to @John 6?
F.E.R. It is very much the same.
Ques. Is it right to say that Christ went in in virtue of His death?
F.E.R. He went in in the full value of His death. He took the ground up for us, that there might be a divine basis for His people to go in upon.
Ques. What particular part of @John 6 corresponds to it?
{125}
F.E.R. "He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood".
Ques. What is "my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world"?
F.E.R. It is His flesh given which is the ground for the life of the world. *We* appropriate His death to enter into our place as sons. The privilege of sonship is connected with entering the holiest. The enjoyment of the place of sonship and all privilege with God lies wholly and entirely in the Spirit, not in the flesh. Our companionship with Christ lies wholly in the Spirit, and we must for that appropriate the death of Christ to all that to which He has died.
Ques. "I am the way"?
F.E.R. Yes; He is the way.
Ques. Is this in @Hebrews 10 any allusion to the rending of the veil when the Lord died, or is it Aaron entering in within the holiest?
F.E.R. We have the priest entering in in chapter 9. The allusion in the expression "through the veil" is to the death of Christ; but, as J.N.D. said over and over again, you never get a rent veil in Hebrews. If it were rent on our side as it is on God's side we could go in as men in the flesh.
Rem. And Israel would enter in by-and-by and they will not.
F.E.R. The point is, there is a veil to go through. To come to the assembly -- we come into the assembly as christians (the Corinthians came together as christians), but when thus come together, then in the power of the Spirit of God we pass right away in spirit from all distinctions of the flesh (neither Jew or gentile, bond nor free) into the privilege of the sons of God. By the power of the Spirit of God we pass into the sense that we are all companions of Christ and sons of God. It must be by death, because it is only through death we can
{126}
get free of the distinctions of flesh. It is only death that can abolish them. When we come out of the assembly we resume our individual position here; these distinctions exist and must be recognized in their place. You may be a free man; you may have a bondman; but in the assembly, in the power of the Spirit of God and of spiritual affections, you pass out of all this into the place of enjoyment and privilege with God. You pass into a new scene where Christ is all and in all, and that is the sanctuary, where there are no distinctions whatever.
Ques. The veil will be up again in the millennium?
F.E.R. It has never, on our side, been taken down. You cannot alter the fulness of the revelation in which God has come out. The question of entering in, according to the full understanding of the revelation God has given, is another thing -- that is a question of apprehension.
Ques. The veil is not removed on our side?
F.E.R. No; but on God's side it is rent from top to bottom. He is fully come out. I do not know whether you could say it is removed on God's side, it is *rent* on God's side, so that God has come out; and in @Matthew 28 you see the full extent of it. The Lord gives the commission to go out and baptize all nations, "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit"; that is, because God has come Out in that way; but it does not mean that all nations will necessarily enter into the meaning and power of that revelation.
Rem. We want to get away from the material thought to the spiritual idea.
F.E.R. That is the great difficulty.
Ques. Is reconciliation connected with the idea of God coming out?
F.E.R. I think reconciliation is God Himself removing the distance between Himself and man.
{127}
It affects nothing for you as to your state. It is God coming out.
Rem. The rending of the veil has removed the distance.
F.E.R. Yes; in the work of Christ God on His own side has completely removed every barrier between Himself and man.
Ques. How far will this epistle affect the remnant by-and-by?
F.E.R. I think it is all a question of what God will give them according to their spiritual state. They will get the law written on the heart which fits them for earth; we get the spirit of sonship which fits us for heaven. Everything is dependent on the purpose of grace. God has called us in *this* privilege. He will call them in *another* -- we cannot go beyond what He calls us to.
Ques. Is not the remnant contemplated in Hebrews? Is not that why the veil is not rent?
F.E.R. I think the apostle goes beyond christianity, and brings in the thought of the world to come. When "the world to come" is established, *you* are completely through. It is not then a question of going through, you *are in*. Everything has been completely met for God; every demand of His glory completely satisfied; Christ "once in the consummation of the ages ... has been manifested for the putting away of sin by his sacrifice". Every claim of the glory of God in respect of sin has been met by the offering of Christ.
Ques. Is not the blood always for God?
F.E.R. The blood is first for God, but also for you.
Ques. What is the sevenfold sprinkling?
F.E.R. The sevenfold sprinkling is that everything has been met for God.
Ques. Are there not two sprinklings, on the mercy-seat and before it?
{128}
F.E.R. Yes; but I think it is all for God when it is a question of carrying the blood into the holiest, it is what is suited for the glory of God inside.
Ques. Will you say once more why you so insist on no rent veil in Hebrews?
F.E.R. Because you have to go *through* the veil, not an unrent veil, but through the veil; you have to go through by the way Christ made, and by that way alone you pass into privilege that cannot belong to you as a man on the earth.
Ques. May we say that as God has come out through death we have to go in through death?
F.E.R. Yes; you can only get free of your position as a living man on earth by death.
Ques. You get everything on the ground of death, as to title?
F.E.R. Yes; but you must go in by death if you are going to enter into privilege, which does not belong to you as a living man on earth, because it must put you away. It is only death that can put an end to you as a living man on earth -- but then it is Christ's death.
Ques. How do we appropriate death?
F.E.R. I think we are attracted. It is by attraction. The soul is attracted to Himself, and then we are willing to accept the way. You *will* be where Christ is, nothing short of that will satisfy you; that is what love claims; I *will* be where He is; that is what makes it a privilege to accept death. It is wrought by affection. Love claims to be where He is.
Rem. It is the known Person who attracts.
F.E.R. Yes; that is why the priesthood is brought in on your side first in Hebrews. He engages your heart and affections thus, then affection claims to be where Christ is.
{129}
Ques. Is it the same thought as in @John 6: 68, when the disciple says, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life"?
F.E.R. Exactly; it was plain there was no one else to go to. No one can minister anything to me but Christ, and I cannot get Christ anywhere else but where He is. The secret of Christ's love to us lies in our having been given to Him by the Father. The lines --
<blockquote>"Thou gav'st us, in eternal love, <br>To Him, to bring us home to Thee"</blockquote>
express the thought.
Rem. When we talk of having accepted death, we must remember it is not a kind of monkish effort; it is real affection and attraction to the Lord. I see it with Elijah and Elisha. "I will not leave thee" was always his answer; three times he says it, "I will not leave thee"; then he goes over Jordan with him.
F.E.R. When you come into the assembly you may for the moment think what a crooked person this or that is. You have partialities for some and prejudices toward others, but if your soul gets into the power of the Spirit of God, He carries you above all that, and all fleshly distinctions, to the place where Christ is all and in all. Assembly privilege is on the ground of death: you have gone out of life on earth, and are in the enjoyment of your privilege before God. He leads you into the enjoyment of the Father's love outside all this.
Ques. When you speak of being in the assembly, you do not merely mean sitting together with a company of saints?
F.E.R. Of course not! That leaves out the presence of Christ in the assembly, and it is Christ's presence in the assembly that leads us to Him, outside all here, that we may be His companions. It
{130}
is not going into the room, it is the power leading you in affection outside everything here into the holiest of all where He is. Of course we come together simply as christians.
Rem. You take that ground when you are there. You *begin* with the Lord's death, which abolishes all distinctions. Most people end with it.
Ques. Do not people sometimes think mere outward connection with the assembly is sufficient?
F.E.R. That would be leaving out the place Christ has there. The soul must realize its privilege of companionship with Christ before the Father.
Ques. What is the force of @Hebrews 10: 19, 20, "by the blood of Jesus, the new and living way"?
F.E.R. The blood is the ground -- the title on which you can be there consistently with God's glory. The new and living way is the way you have to go in. It is not the power that is presented in Hebrews that takes you in, but the way you go in. People have not a proper idea of the sanctuary. The sanctuary is God's blessed revelation of Himself, and of His satisfaction in His Son.
Ques. I suppose the best way to learn the holiest is to be there?
F.E.R. I think you must learn what the sanctuary is first.
Rem. I am not quite clear as to what the sanctuary is.
F.E.R. I think it is the delight of God in that which He has accomplished for His own glory in that Man. It is wonderful that His infinite and eternal satisfaction should be found in a Man! and One that is an adequate object for the love of God. You get the idea in the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat. That is the wonderful thing that has come to light, not simply what God is from all eternity but what He is as come out, that He has
{131}
found in a Man His infinite and eternal glory and satisfaction.
Ques. Would you say Christ Himself personally was the sanctuary of God, and if we are found there in our affections and heart we are there with God?
F.E.R. I think so; other things come out in connection with the sanctuary; you get the connection of Christ with Israel; therein was the table, the shewbread. He is not only the antitype of the holiest, but the antitype of the whole thing. The sanctuary is, as I understand it, the revelation, the light of God in Christ in that which He has accomplished for His own glory. It is not only God has come out, but He has gained for Himself an adequate object in Man. It is a wonderful thing that man could be an adequate object for God.
Ques. Do you mean that what is portrayed in the sanctuary is God's delight in man?
F.E.R. Yes; the eye of God could rest on the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat, and see a Man in whom was fulfilled all His counsels and purposes. We speak of the sanctuary in its application to us, but if you speak of the sanctuary in a broad way, you must go on and take in its application to Israel and all.
Ques. Does it include the thought of God's dwelling-place?
F.E.R. The sanctuary includes the holiest and the holy place. It is not only God's dwelling-place, but that He rests in infinite satisfaction in what He has accomplished for Himself, not only for us but for His own eternal satisfaction.
Ques. Does @2 Corinthians 3: 18 correspond with this?
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. If the veil had not been rent for God to come out, we could not have gone in.
{132}
F.E.R. Quite so; it involves it, but it is important to keep things as Scripture puts them. God must come out if we are to go in. It is of the very last importance to maintain that the veil is rent on the divine side, and that is equally true for the millennium as for now.
Ques. Did it signify the setting aside of the whole of the old system?
F.E.R. Yes; the first system of things could not exist at all with a rent veil; that system could only exist so long as God did not reveal Himself; the whole thing must go when God came out, it must all pass away.
Rem. God did come out in a certain way when Christ came into the world.
F.E.R. Yes; it was the beginning. The revelation of the Father in the Son was complete in His life here, but the revelation of the love of God came out in the death of Christ.
Ques. If the sanctuary included the holy place and the holiest, why was the veil put between the two?
Rem. You find a remarkable difference in Chronicles and Kings. In Chronicles you get the veil and the brazen altar. In Kings there is no veil and no brazen altar, but you get the oracle there. Israel itself, I believe, is much more in question in Chronicles; the outward display in Kings. Israel is the place on earth through which everything comes out from heaven. I do not think Israel goes in, but you get a company in the millennium morally near to heaven. The porch is specially dwelt upon in Kings. My own impression is that the porch figures the administration of what is heavenly to earth; it is not heaven or earth exactly, but the connection between the two. Though not in heaven, yet the one hundred and forty-four thousand (@Revelation 14) are morally beyond the earth, they sing the song of
{133}
heaven, and are thus a connecting link. You get in the first part of the sanctuary the holy place -- what is heavenly in its aspect earthward. You get the oracle in Kings, because Israel are the people who get God's mind from within.
F.E.R. The whole order of things then will be *coming out*, not our going in.
Rem. We have gone in, they do not *go in*, but they communicate the heavenly, they learn the heavenly song, though not in heaven. They are the people to whom God's mind is made known, and through whom the revelation comes out.
Ques. Will it not be true in that day that Christ Himself will have come out?
F.E.R. I doubt if Christ is ever seen apart from the church. It is in the church, the heavenly Jerusalem, He is known. He does not come out apart from the church; there He is displayed. The body is the vessel in which He is fully declared. "Every eye shall see him". It will all be made good, but I cannot tell you how. He comes to be glorified in His saints, and admired in all them that believe. It is there He is displayed, I believe. That is what I understand by the expression, "his body, the fulness of him that fills all in all". He is fully declared. I do not think Israel will ever have again the same thing that has been in the presence of the Lord, as He was among them. I believe Israel missed their opportunity when Christ came among them in humiliation, and my judgment is, they will never have what they missed, they will never get that opportunity again, they will have to learn everything in the church. The identification will be complete there.
Ques. I understand you to say that before getting into the holiest we have to learn Christ in the sanctuary. I do not quite get hold of that; will you say a little word about it?
{134}
F.E.R. I do not think I said you learn Christ in the sanctuary, but what I said was this -- you must learn the revelation of God, the way in which He has come out, before you can enter in. The high priest could not go in until the sanctuary existed. You must know Christ as Apostle before you know Him as Priest. Moses inaugurated the system and Aaron maintained the system that was inaugurated. The system is inaugurated by Christ as Son and Apostle. It is maintained by Christ as Priest. You must first apprehend Him as Apostle before you can be led in by the Priest. What He leads you to is the Father. It is the Father's delight in the Son, not only God's complacency in Man.
Ques. Is not the great intent of the Spirit in Hebrews to lead us into the holiest?
F.E.R. I think so. I came across a beautiful remark by J.N.D. which confirmed me in this thought and opened it out, that in the first part of Hebrews Christ comes to our side with sympathy and succour, in order to bring us to His own side; the great point is to lead you to God's side where He is at home and where He orders everything. Christ orders nothing in this world, He sympathizes with me down here and succours me, but He orders everything for God. In the beginning of chapter 8 the "summary" is "We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens; minister of the holy places".
Rem. We have nothing else but Christ.
F.E.R. No; and what can you want more? What can equal for a moment the fact that I am an object of the love of Christ and He takes me into His delight before God? You will not get to Him except by affection. Faith will not take you in, though you cannot get in without faith, because without faith you would not have light from God.
{135}
It is affection that takes you in. Power will take you in by-and-by, but nothing but affection will take you in now.
Ques. Is to "draw near with a true heart" response in affection?
F.E.R. I think so, but it is a *true* heart -- affection. Faith is light from God, but when it comes to the realisation of anything with God and with Christ it is always a question of the Spirit of God working in you by affection.
Rem. That is the value of the illustration so often put before us of Rebecca and the servant.
F.E.R. Yes, if you go into heavenly places, it is all by affection; you only go there by affection now. By-and-by the power of God will take you there; so too in regard to the sanctuary. If you are going to be led in in communion with Christ it is a question of affection, appreciating His affection. Affection goes in with Him, nothing short of that will satisfy it. That is why @1 Corinthians 13 comes in in connection with the assembly, because love is your measure; without it you are nothing. You may have everything, "all gifts", and be nothing. Your stature is measured by love and love abides when faith and hope shall cease.
Ques. What is the "veil ... upon their heart"?
F.E.R. They were all in that state; that with which the veil was connected was Israel, who were clinging to the first order of things; and God has set all aside in the person of Christ. They were doing their utmost to maintain the first order of things which God had set aside and they could not see clearly.
Ques. A christian may be in that state?
F.E.R. Yes, if you are clinging to "beggarly elements" you are in that state. Christendom is set up on the pattern of the first order.

GOD'S TESTIMONY
@Ephesians 1: 1 - 14; @2 Peter 1: 16 - 21
I feel in a sense the difficulty of presenting the subject which I have before me -- that is, the testimony -- and for the reason that many will regard it as a worn-out theme. The term has almost become hackneyed amongst us. But nevertheless I will venture to say a little about God's testimony, and will trace the line of that testimony through Scripture, and seek to show, if able, where that testimony now resides. And in connection with the subject I will say a word on the vessel of the testimony, and on the relation of the testimony to the vessel. Now, here are three pretty distinct points: the first, the testimony; then the vessel of the testimony, which in a certain sense is inseparable from it; and then what properly characterises the vessel of the testimony. That comes down, if not to practice, to what is very practical.
I have taken up the passage in Ephesians because it presents two thoughts. One is our calling, and the other our testimony. For the sake of brevity, I will say the calling of the church, or of the saints; and the testimony of the saints. These two thoughts appear. As regards the vessel of the testimony I would say, that if you do not understand the calling, the testimony must be defective. Depend upon it, we are not up to the height of the testimony if we do not apprehend the calling. If it be the case, as no doubt it is, that a great many people go forth gospel preaching with little or no knowledge of the calling, you may be sure that their preaching will be defective. Even though outward effects may be produced by it, the effects will not convince me that it is otherwise. It cannot but be defective from the lack in their own souls. I am
{137}
not speaking of those in fellowship with us, but of many who go out preaching.
I begin by tracing the testimony of God through Scripture, and it is very interesting to see one mind, one thread, running through the whole word of God. The apprehension of this cannot fail to have the effect of confirming our confidence in the word of God, so that we have the sense that whatever may fail, or however we fail, yet the word of God cannot fail. That is a point to which every one of our souls must come. You have in the word of God not only what is in itself infallible, but what cannot fail us.
The first point I take up in God's testimony is that seen in Abel, and I may remark that up to the church the testimony of God would appear to have been identified with individuals. I think that was so. The difficulty might be presented that Israel as a nation was here for the testimony of God; but I doubt if they really were that according to the purpose of God. They ought to have been a testimony, to have given by fruit-bearing, witness that they were a vine on earth; but when Christ came into the world, He says, "I am the true vine". Israel had the place of God's vine, but they were not the true vine. The Lord says, "I am the true vine" -- the genuine vine. Israel will, under Christ, come into the place hereafter, and will be a testimony here for God, but only in abiding in Christ. I make that remark in order to guard the particular point that in the Old Testament the testimony of God is bound up with individuals.
I am for the moment referring to the testimony before the flood. The beginning is in Abel. What he did bore witness to the ground of acceptance. That is the principle apparent in his testimony. He died on account of his testimony, but it is remarkable that "he being dead yet speaketh".
{138}
Now I pass on to the next point, namely, Enoch. The theme of his testimony was the Lord's coming, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads". At that early date, that was his witness. It was in view of what was a necessity for that that he walked with God, and that he was not, for God took him. If you had not the light of translation, you could not understand how the saints would come with the Lord. It is in principle the difference between 1 and 2 Thessalonians; in the first epistle the saints are caught up to meet the Lord in the air; in the second epistle they come with Him. That is what came out in Enoch, and the effect of it on him was that he walked with God; he was thus the vessel of the testimony. He did not make a conspicuous figure on earth; he was obscure, and he disappeared, for God took him. He was the witness for God in that day.
I pass on to Noah. Noah is not, as Enoch, a witness of the coming of the Lord, but of the coming judgment. I need hardly say that judgment must connect itself very intimately with the coming of the Lord. Noah was a preacher of righteousness, and what righteousness meant was expressed in warning men of coming judgment. The effect on him of his testimony was that he, believing God, did what God told him to do -- he prepared an ark for the saving of his house. You see thus the effect of the testimony upon the vessel of it. Abel died; Enoch was not, for God took him; Noah was a preacher of righteousness, and built an ark for the saving of his house. That carries us up to the flood. Morally all was in a line.
Now I come to later times, namely, to Abraham, and in him is marked a point of departure. It is not now simply a question of moral principles, as before the flood. In Abraham we come to another line, and it is indicated in that the *God of glory*
{139}
appeared unto our father Abraham. "The God of glory" and "the glory of God" are two expressions connected in Scripture. If you look at @Acts 7 you will see that Stephen in speaking began with the God of glory, and ends with the glory of God. The glory of God is the climax, the result of what the God of glory works. The glory of God is the climax reached in Christ. The God of glory marks the point of departure. It indicated that God was One that had His own purposes. His purposes are His glory, and in the accomplishment of His purposes His glory is displayed. That is what I understand to have been presented to Stephen. He looked up to heaven and "saw the glory of God, and Jesus".
But to return to Abraham. God gave the promises to Abraham. He promised to bless. In that way He anticipated the law and the curse. But another point comes out also in connection with Abraham, and that is, the title of God to dispose of the earth as He pleases. The world had become apostate; the spirit of antichrist was there; Babel was the proof that man had become apostate. In the face of this, God announces His purpose to dispose of the earth as He pleases. The earth does not belong to man. God has given it to man for enjoyment, but the earth is the Lord's and He will dispose of it to whom He will. God gave to Abraham the testimony of blessing -- he was to be the vessel of it, What was the effect upon him? He dwelt in a tent, but he looked for a city. He was a stranger and a pilgrim in this order of things, but he had a prospect -- he looked for a city that has foundations. He was a man of expectation. I never knew of a city in this world that had moral foundations. Rome had no foundations, or it would not have passed away. Its renown was largely built up on violence and tyranny. London has no foundations -- no moral ones. Abraham "waited for the city
{140}
which has foundations, of which God is the artificer and constructor". He looked for the heavenly city, the new Jerusalem, founded in righteousness, in which no hand of man has ever been employed. It is a wonderful thing to contemplate a structure, whether it be a house or a city, in which man has had no hand, whose builder and maker is God. It is a work which God does not entrust to any man. It is all of Himself. You get something akin to it in @Matthew 16, where the Lord says, "On this rock I will build my assembly". So with this city, the Builder (the Architect) and Artificer is God. That is what Abraham looked for. As has been often remarked, Abraham had an altar, a place of approach to God, and on the other hand he dwelt in a tent. He did not run in the current of the course of things in this world, but confessed that he was a stranger and a pilgrim on the earth, for he believed God and had His promises.
I do not profess, in what I have been saying, to be exhaustive, or assume to compass everything connected with Abraham, I only bring two or three prominent points before you.
The next thing I take up is the tabernacle, and here the vessel of testimony was Moses. The truth foreshadowed in the giving of the law and the setting up of the tabernacle was this -- that where the law was written God would dwell, that was what God indicated. I hope to be able to make clear that when the law is written in man's heart, then the way is prepared for God to dwell among men. For the time being the law was written on tables of stone. God was acting on the principle of testing, therefore the law was not yet written in man's heart. But in the ways of God the law will be written in man's heart. The point of departure here is Christ. He said, "Thy law is within my heart". Not that the law was written
{141}
there, I need hardly say, but it was within His heart, and the consequence of His coming is that the law will be written in Israel's heart; and when that is so, God will dwell with man. I do not doubt that this will be fulfilled in Israel in the future, when God consummates the new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. "Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts; and I will be to them for God, and *they* shall be to me for people"; but "I will be to them for God" must be consequent on the law being written in the heart. There are two things consequent on the law being written in the heart: one is, that man becomes the reflex of God -- Christ as man was the reflex of God, He was so perfectly, as we see in @Psalm 40 -- and the other is, that at the same time every one has individual knowledge of God. Consequent on that, God sets up His dwelling among men. I think that was foreshadowed in the direction to make a sanctuary which God gave to Moses. Moses had to set up God's dwelling -- place, and to make everything according to the pattern shewed him in the mount. Moses was the vessel of the testimony in that day, and what marked him was that he was faithful in God's house. He was not only a stranger and a pilgrim -- he could not very well help being that, for he was in the wilderness. It had been different with Abraham: he dwelt in the land, and being rich he could have been otherwise. But it is in connection with God's house that Moses is spoken of as faithful. He did not deviate one jot or tittle from the directions given to him in the mount. He had a due sense of the importance of God's house, and of what it was to have to do with it. I think it would be well if we had more sense of the importance of God's house and of having to do with God in regard to it; we would not depart
{142}
from the divine order and directions. Even in a day of the greatest confusion, faithfulness is the principle that ought to govern us -- Moses was faithful in God's house.
But to pass on. We have had the promises in Abraham, the writing of the law and the tabernacle in Moses. The next point, I think, is the throne. David was in this the vessel of testimony. Again it was an individual. The throne came in when everything had failed after the first order. Prophets had testified, Samuel had come upon the scene. There had been a king after the flesh in Saul. Then comes in as king the man after God's own heart -- the anointed of God; and the testimony of God is bound up with David. He was the witness, the reign of grace, when all had been lost under law. Now, there are two things that mark David: he was ever subject to God's word, and was unflinching in opposition to God's enemies. He stood in the truth, always subject to the prophet. He was not a wilful king that did his own will. It is on the ground of what was seen in David that the throne of God in this world rests. The enemies are subdued and set aside, and the throne is maintained in all faithfulness to God's word.
I will not now speak further of the testimony of God as presented in the Old Testament; we have had the promises with Abraham, the tabernacle with Moses, the throne with David. I come now to the point where all these testimonies meet and rest, and that is in the Lord Himself. I will refer for a moment to what Christ was after the flesh. These different testimonies were all centred there, not one was lacking. The promises were there, for He was Abraham's seed and the vessel of the promises; the tabernacle was there, for God dwelt there in a prophet who was like unto Moses; the throne was there -- or perhaps I should say,
{143}
the title to the throne -- in the true Son of David. That is how the Lord came into this scene and was presented to His people after the flesh. The consequence was this, that at the close of His course here the Lord rides into Jerusalem, claiming the throne. He enters Jerusalem as Zion's King, claiming the throne. "Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass". He rides into Jerusalem, claiming His inheritance. That was the testimony presented in Christ after the flesh, and that was rejected. They rejected the promises, they rejected the One in whom God dwelt, and they rejected the One who had divine title to the throne. Christ was the vessel of the testimony, and what marked the vessel of the testimony when you get every testimony centred there? It was the perfect solution of the whole question of good and evil. "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity". That was what marked the pathway of the Lord Jesus here in this world. It has been said (and truly) that the opposite will mark antichrist; he will love iniquity and hate righteousness; the result to Christ is -- "God, ... thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows". There was the unvarying resistance of sin and evil all through His pathway here. In His death He took the place of death to sin, but in His pathway it was not death to sin, but striving against sin. (@Hebrews 12: 4). He resisted sin in every form in which it presents itself, every kind of evil; the whole question of good and evil was completely gone through, the complete conflict with sin and the complete maintenance of good -- all that was due to God. What came to pass in the Lord down here, to put it in the language of scripture, was, that evil was overcome by good. It is most terrible to think that the Lord was rejected in spite of all
{144}
the good that came out in Him. All good from God was presented to man here, and yet the vessel of it was rejected. He resisted unto blood, striving against sin. That was the pathway of the Lord Jesus Christ down here.
Now the Lord Jesus Christ is no longer here. Other things had to come into view. Redemption had to be accomplished and Christ to be exalted to the right hand of God. The whole ground of action had to be changed. The man after the flesh, after the first order, had to be set aside, and the Man after another order had to come in. Man after the flesh was annulled, and in the resurrection of Christ man after another order was brought into view. God had to be glorified in man after the flesh; for that reason Christ came in flesh that He might glorify God. But there was another reason. The Man from heaven had to come into view when He had severed every connection with man after the flesh. Now what I say is this: The testimony is still here, but it is now no longer connected with an individual, but with a company on the ground of faith. The ground has changed. The One in whom the testimony was presented is rejected and is now on the right hand of God and is Head of the church, which is His body here. It is not individual testimony now. I understand that the church is left here in testimony to what belongs to Christ. It is no new testimony, that is to say, it is not of anything further that has to be accomplished, for every element of God's glory *is* secured in Christ at God's right hand. God has His way. Christ is the true ark of the testimony and the mercy-seat. The church is here, properly speaking, in witness by the Spirit of God to the glory of Christ. That is the position of the church, maintaining here in this world a testimony to the rights
{145}
and inheritance of Christ, and in which latter the church itself has its own proper part.
Now no one of us could do that if he did not first know the calling. In the passage I read (@Ephesians 1) you first get the calling. If you are not in the truth of the calling you cannot be in the full enjoyment of God's love, for that is the great point in the calling. "He has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love". Love is the very essence of sonship. The secret of sonship lies in the knowledge of God's love; we are in that position in the enjoyment of God's love, and responsive to that love, and no one can be of any account practically in regard of God's calling, except as he responds to His love, for He has chosen us to be before Him in love. We must be holy and without blame or we should not be suited to God, but the essence of sonship is love. God has made known His purpose as to us to that end, that we might be formed in the divine nature. Sonship is that we might be before God according to His nature. If God sees fit to have sons for Himself they are "before him". Testimony down here is not the point in this passage, but "*to himself*". The thought in sonship is "to himself". We need to be in the light of that, in order to be responsive to that love.
When you know the calling then you are fitted to be here in the testimony. The two points that come before us in this passage are: First, we have the forgiveness of sins. Secondly, we have intelligence of God's will, and the will of God is to head up in one all things in Christ. Everything that was presented in times gone by in type and shadow is now gathered up in Christ. God has made known that no purpose of His will has failed, however it may have appeared to fail. All is established
{146}
in Christ, gathered up in Him, and in Him we have obtained an inheritance; and in whatever Christ has taken up in the way of promise, or as regards the dwelling-place of God, or in connection with the throne, we -- the saints -- have part with Him. It is not the higher side of blessing; I fully own that the calling is that, because it presents what we are to God; the calling is the supreme thought; but the testimony of forgiveness of sins, and of inheritance is vastly important down here; to put it in the language of @Acts 7, we bear witness to "the glory of God, and Jesus". And we have the Spirit, the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession to the praise of His glory.
Just one word more, and that is this. We can understand that our testimony must be completely ineffective except as we are apart in spirit from the course of things here. If you are disposed to settle down here in a path of earthly ease, I do not see how you can be going on with the testimony of God. That is a danger which besets us all. If you fall into it you are not faithful in maintaining the witness of God's will, and that, you must remember, is part of the testimony. Even in the very first principle of the gospel to the gentiles it is, "that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance". Inheritance is in Christ; it does not refer to the present order of things; and if we have it in Him we are left here to be witnesses, not of our inheritance, but of His.
I do not think that our path here is exactly as was Christ's in conflict with sin. It is true that we have to walk as He walked, but as regards sin our place is of *death* to it. People I daresay will not leave us alone if we are in this path and walking as alive to God in Christ, they will be against us; but still our path is different from
{147}
Christ's, it is death to sin rather than of conflict with it. We get an indication of our path in Peter (@Matthew 14) when the Lord encouraged him to leave the boat to go to Himself on the water. I am here, but I do not set myself to attempt to stem the current of evil; but to walk in correspondence to Christ. I am not going to try to improve the world or anything of that kind. At the same time I am waiting here until the time comes to reign with Christ, and am here in the power of the Holy Spirit to witness to His inheritance.
I believe that to be our testimony, and I think it is of all moment to apprehend it, and to see that the testimony of God is now bound up with the church. It might be said, Where is the church? Where am I to find it? I must leave that, but I think it is important to see that the church was the special vessel of the testimony. When Christ was here it was individual; He was alone; though even then He associated twelve with Him. Now it is no longer individual. The church is the vessel of it. People say, 'Ah, but the church has failed'. It *has* failed as God's house on earth, but I think we ought still to be like Abraham, strangers and pilgrims here, and like Moses, faithful in God's house, and like David, true to God's word and unflinching in opposition to God's enemies. In the light of the glorified Man, walking in death to sin, and coming consciously nearer and nearer to the One who is the blessed expression of God's purpose in regard to us, getting more to the height of God's calling as chosen in Christ that we might be holy and without blame before God in love, predestinated unto sonship. I do not believe in the power of any testimony here save as we are fully in the light of sonship, since I do not think we shall be effective if we are not in the enjoyment of it.
{148}
I feel how imperfectly I have presented the subject to you, for the reason that I am so little up to it myself -- but it is a great thing to see the line of God's testimony right through Scripture, and to realise where at the present moment the testimony of God resides.
{149}
THE VOICE FROM HEAVEN
@Hebrews 12: 18 - 29
We have now to entertain the idea of One who is speaking from heaven. There is an allusion in this passage to what took place with regard to those who disregarded the one who spoke on earth -- Moses; and the point pressed upon us is, to be attentive to the One who is speaking from heaven. The great thing is that our hearts should be in connection with heaven. Christianity was established by a voice speaking from heaven -- Christ speaking by the Spirit. It came through apostles, but it was Christ speaking. When God spoke upon earth through Moses He spoke to men of things connected with man's responsibility; but when He speaks from heaven, He speaks of things which it is His purpose to establish, and I may say of things which He *has* established according to the Man whom He has brought in. That is the character of the communications now. In a sense, God still speaks, for the Spirit is here, and we have to regard the One speaking from heaven, and it is of great importance for us to be attentive to what is of interest to God, to regard what He has established.
God speaks of everything as about to be shaken. It is in the power of God to shake everything. A mountain may be shaken to its foundations and vomit out fire. Everything that is material may and will be shaken, but there is no shaking of what is moral, "We receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved". To get a true idea of stability you must connect it with what is moral. What is of God and of Christ cannot be shaken. It may be humble and insignificant in the eyes of men, but when everything passes away, that which is moral
{150}
abides. The character of the kingdom of God is "not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit". *That* cannot be moved. "Our God is a consuming fire"; He burns up that which is not of Himself, He consumes the dross, but He does not consume that which He has built. If He builds a kingdom, *that* cannot be moved.
Now I want to point out to you what it is that God has established. The coming of Christ has brought in everything. Before He came there was nothing established for God. In the Old Testament you do not find anything established for God, but now, Christ having come, we have come to that which God has established. It is the consequence of Christ having come in. He came to accomplish redemption that He might be the centre and sun of God's universe, just as our universe is centred in the sun. The foundations have been laid in redemption, and Christ is the blessed centre of the divine system. I want to show you of what that system consists. We read in verses 22 - 24: "But ye have come to mount Zion; and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, the universal gathering; and to the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven; and to God, judge of all; and to the spirits of just men made perfect; and to Jesus, mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel". Every one of these things is consequent on Christ having come in.
What I understand by mount Zion is a risen Christ. A mountain in Scripture is often used symbolically of a great power. The power of God is a risen Christ. Mount Zion took its character from the ark having been brought there by David after it had been taken captive by the Philistines and sent back. Mount Zion was nothing in itself, it is distinguished by what took place there. So
{151}
with the mount of transfiguration, it is called the "holy mount" on account of what occurred there. We have come to the true mount Zion, not the material. The true mount Zion is really seen in Christ risen. One world was lost in man and was ended in the death of Christ. The princes of this world crucified the Lord of glory, and now is the judgment of *this* world; but Christ raised from the dead is the sun and centre of *God's* world. That is what mount Zion means for *me*, and the practical effect is that I am delivered from the world and all in it and attached to God's world. Our interests are in that scene of which Christ is the centre. We are "married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God". Every hope connected with this world was lost in the death of Christ, but everything is established for the universe of God in the resurrection of Christ. Christ has taken up His place in God's world on the ground of redemption, and all men may come in because redemption has met all that man was. Men were under death and curse, but a door has been opened by which they can enter that scene of which Christ is the centre. There is now a bond between Christ and us in the Spirit. We may have bonds down here, but every such bond will be broken by death; but there is a bond which unites us to Christ which cannot be broken. He is to us the mount Zion that cannot be moved.
Next we come to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. The city could not be until Christ came. I look upon a city as being the centre of an empire. The first city started with the idea of an empire; at Babel man would build a "city and a tower". So Jerusalem was in a sense the centre of an empire; so also Babylon. When Babylon swallowed up all that existed it became a great centre. The heavenly Jerusalem is the centre of
{152}
an empire such as the world has never seen. It is the city of the living God. *We have come to it*. I understand it to mean all that subsists here by the power of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit came down at Pentecost, and in what He established you get the city of the living God; we get the good of it now. Men thought a good deal of Rome, as in the present day they think a good deal of London. They are much more struck by the cities of this world than by the city of the living God; in their eyes it is contemptible, but to us that city is the centre and seat of true imperialism -- divine imperialism. Let us hold to imperialism, but let it be that of the King of kings and Lord of lords. A city is dependent on a covenant; Jerusalem of old was dependent on and characterised by mount Sinai; the heavenly Jerusalem is formed and characterised by the new covenant. Jerusalem above is free, because dependent on the new covenant. There are three things connected with the heavenly city; God is known, appreciated and approached; "God is known in her palaces for a refuge". That is the value of the new covenant. There are cities in Germany which have a peculiar place of liberty and privilege; the heavenly Jerusalem is characterised by liberty, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty". There was no liberty under the old covenant because God was not known; where God is known liberty follows. The heavenly Jerusalem enjoys liberty and confers liberty on her children. Liberty depends on knowledge, it is reached in no other way. If a father going away for years on service leaves an infant, and the child grows up without knowing its father, it will not have liberty with its father when he returns. But with a child brought up in the presence of its father there is attachment and liberty of approach. The child has not the same liberty with a tutor, but it knows its
{153}
father's disposition towards it. The secret of liberty lies in the knowledge of God, and it is in the new covenant that God is known. Christians in systems do not enjoy liberty, they must leave their boats and come into the region of the Spirit to enjoy liberty. Liberty does not belong to those great worldly systems.
The heavenly Jerusalem was established in the power of the Spirit, and is enjoyed in the power of the Spirit. *We have come to it* that we might be characterised by the new covenant and have the enjoyment of liberty. We have the power to approach God which the knowledge of God confers. We are in the region of the Spirit; until Christ came there could not be the Spirit, but now Christ has been glorified and we have received the Spirit.
Now I come to the next point, "To myriads of angels". Until Christ came, where was the man on whom angels innumerable could attend? The heavenly host sang and praised God at Christ's birth; in His temptation angels waited on Him, and at the close of His course an angel strengthened Him. The angels waited for the *Man* -- the Son of man. Now the Son of man is *come*. In the world to come angels will ascend and descend on the Son of man; everything will be put under His feet, as we find in @Psalm 8. The angels now guard the city; they are ministers sent forth to minister for the heirs of salvation. They are sent to guard God's people; as they were attendant on the Lord when He was here, now they are attendant on those who are the Lord's here on earth. We do not know how much we are guarded by angels.
Then follows, "To the assembly of the firstborn, who are registered in heaven". That could not be before Christ came. *The* Firstborn had to be brought in first. Christ is the true Firstborn; He is the beginning of the creation of God -- He must
{154}
have the pre-eminence. In our physical universe the sun has the pre-eminence, so in God's universe Christ is pre-eminent. The church of the firstborn is in accord with Him, they are pre-eminent in the thought of God, their names are written in heaven. Properly speaking we belong to heaven -- we are raised up and made to sit in heavenly places in Christ (@Ephesians 2). Our ability to have to do with God is dependent on our apprehension that we belong to heaven. If I understand that it is the pleasure of God to have me in His own place I can approach Him. It was God's pleasure to have Israel in His land, not in the wilderness. It was God's land, so in regard to us, it is His pleasure to have us in His own habitation, "God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love wherewith he loved us, (we too being dead in offences,) has quickened us with the Christ, (ye are saved by grace,) and has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus". I love my children and would have them with me and feel it painful to be parted from them. I do not know a greater pleasure in a natural way than to have them return home after they have been absent, so it is "because of his great love wherewith he loved us" that He has made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ. Every believer expects to go to heaven. But why? Not because of their faith, or their deserts, but because the love of God will have them there. That is the thought connected with the church of the firstborn, and in apprehending that we have liberty to approach God now. But until Christ, the firstborn from the dead, had come in, you could not have the church of the firstborn, any more than you could have mount Zion, or the city of the living God.
Then we have "God, judge of all". God could not take up this position apart from Christ.
{155}
How could He put Himself in touch with His creation until Christ became man? God whom no man hath seen or can see. All was dependent on the incarnation and resurrection of Christ. Now it has come to pass that God is judge of all, and we can apprehend Him in that light. God takes that place in regard to creation. Judgment will return to righteousness and it will be a great day for the meek of the earth. "The meek shall possess the land, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of prosperity" (@Psalm 37: 11). Judgment has long been divorced from righteousness, but it will return to it, and the meek of the earth will follow it.
We have come to "the spirits of just men made perfect". This could not be apart from Christ. They had to be made perfect through redemption. The great cloud of witnesses in chapter 11 -- Enoch, Noah, David, Samuel -- are made perfect because Christ has come in; their fear of God could not make them perfect. These righteous men are now made perfect through redemption; their spirits are spoken of because they have not their bodies yet.
Then we have "Jesus, mediator of a new covenant". No one but Christ was competent for this, because He died for the transgressions that were under the first covenant, and the new covenant is really Himself. I have no doubt that Christ was the covenant the moment He became Man. He is the mediator of it by redemption; He is minister, too, of the holy places; He walks in the holy places. The holy places are the saints; He is concerned as to the saints, and ministers that He may present them in suitability to Himself, "having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless", that He may offer them up thus to God.
Then "the blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel". The blood of Abel defiled the earth,
{156}
and it has been defiled ever since. The earth looks beautiful outwardly, but looked at morally, 'Every prospect pleases, and only man is vile'. Man gives character to the earth; how much since Abel's day has the earth been defiled with moral abominations; but the blood of sprinkling is the divine answer to all the defilement.
Now God speaks to us of all these things, He is speaking from heaven. Nothing is displayed yet, but all has been established in the coming in of Christ, and is made known to us by the One who speaks from heaven. I pray you not to be inattentive to that voice. It is your obligation to pay attention to it. It is a great thing when Christ is dwelling in the heart by faith, it proves that you have listened to the voice that speaks from heaven, and have a divine apprehension of these things by the Spirit. There is nothing that God has not now in Christ. *We come to it* in the power of the Spirit in apprehension. God intends you to see all established in Christ, so that nothing can fail. These things should be the interest and food of our souls. May God grant that they may be.
{157}
THE SERVICE OF THE LIVING GOD
@Hebrews 9: 1 - 28
I would offer at the outset a word of apology, as my thought is to speak to you on a *subject*, and I do not very much approve of speaking on subjects to believers; for a Person -- Christ Himself -- is evidently the subject of all testimony. But what I want to speak of is important enough, and if I can carry my thought through, you will not think that I have introduced it without the idea of a Person.
My subject is worship. It is important for us to understand something about worship; all the ideas around us as to it are fundamentally wrong, and I will tell you why -- it is that people come together for what they *find* prepared for them. Now that is not a true thought, for in what is true the point is not what you find but what you yourself bring. It is a fundamental difference which most can appreciate. In a large part of my life my thought as to the service of God was of coming to what I found ordained and arranged. In result I found, like many others, that true worship must be dependent on what we bring, for apart from that there is nothing to be found; and moreover you must not trust in any one else to bring anything. People come to our meetings and they have a sort of confidence that somebody will bring something, but the point is what *you* bring. The true ground of service or worship is seen in this chapter. We often speak of preaching or teaching, which have men in view, as service, but that is not the way in which the word is employed here; it means the service of God. In verse 1 and again in verses 6, 13, 14, it is the same word -- to serve or worship the living God. In verse 6 the worship of old is seen to depend on the priests, but who is the "your" in
{158}
verse 14? It is the believer, the one who attempts to draw nigh. It is that contrast that I want to bring out. The priests went into the first tabernacle, but what about the people? They had no part in carrying on the service, they were lookers-on, all was carried on by the priests. It was in a way (I would say it reverently) ready-made service, the people could bring nothing to it at all, they only came near to what was already prepared. And yet the people were the great concern of God. Now you have to a large extent the counterpart of that in christendom. Whether in church or chapel, certain arrangements are made, and all is carried out according to them; there is a worldly sanctuary and the clergy or ministers go into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of God. People come to what they *find*, they are not exercised to *bring* anything at all. They may be invited to join in it, but it is carried on officially, and the people come to what they find -- prepared to accept such an arrangement. Now even in the simplest kind of meeting you may find the same thing prevailing. People come, in their own thought, to a ready-made meeting; the service will go on whether they bring or do not bring anything, they come to a service, and go back in that way to the first tabernacle. That is all fundamentally wrong; there is no such thing in the present day as anything prepared or official priests entering in; there are no official priests. If Christ were on earth, He even would not be a priest; and in regard to the common people, which we all are, we do not come to a ready-made service, our service can only be carried on by what we bring, and if we do not bring anything, there is no power to carry on any service; all is dependent on what we bring; the service will never be above what we bring, a very important principle, which I wish all would lay hold of.
{159}
I refer to the other error -- the expectation that someone else will bring something. Everyone should be concerned to bring what is necessary. What you can bring will have a very important influence on the meeting. I charge everyone here not to come to the meetings with the idea that you will find a ready-made service, for if you do you are going back to what God has rejected. You may depend upon it that the worship will be dependent on what we bring.
I will say a little as to the preparation: if you have got the preparation, you will bring something, and so the preparation is very important.
Perhaps you will look at verses 11 - 14. Did you ever consider what that passage means? What I understand it to signify is that Christ has formed a platform before God which is available for us. You may say that it is a difficult idea to entertain; but you *must* entertain it. When He was down here it was not so. He abode alone in His own personal perfection, and there was nothing to hinder His returning to heaven from whence He came. But having accomplished redemption, Christ has entered on a ground which is available for us -- a point of the last moment for you and me to apprehend. People may say, Where is the holy place? I believe it is a moral idea; it is the ground or footing which Christ has taken up, and which is available for us, because He has ordained eternal redemption. It is a great thing to see that He has entered on a footing that is available for us. He *did* associate people with Himself on earth, but as to the platform on which He was, He was evidently alone; but now He has entered in. It is not a question of heaven or earth, it is not a place, but a ground, or whatever word you like to use, available for us, and on that we can stand before God. You do not want to go to church or chapel for that, nor to the meeting.
{160}
If you do not find it outside the meeting you will not find it inside; it is the platform that He has found, and it is now the question of the individual apprehension in the soul of the place which Christ has taken. That is the first thing. I cannot talk of worship if that is not apprehended. It was not the mind of the Lord to return to heaven alone, He has found a ground available for us; you do not want a clergy or anything official, it is a question of the apprehension of each soul.
Now there are two points in the preparation -- appreciation and purgation. You cannot do without either, and they have to follow in that order; then you have your preparation complete and are qualified for the service of God. You may have an archbishop or a cardinal, but without this preparation he cannot serve God; and if there is appreciation and purgation, a bed-ridden woman may be as qualified to serve as any other. A child might serve the living God, for with a child there may be appreciation and purgation, and no one can serve the living God without them.
Now look at chapter 8: 6 - 13 and turn for a moment to @Luke 10: 38 - 42; 11: 1 - 4. I do not suppose you will see exactly the connection in my mind between these passages. I was saying that the first point as to qualification is to apprehend the platform on which Christ has entered.
But I am going to speak now about the preparation. The first thing is to appreciate Christ as the covenant; you cannot understand what it is to approach God if you do not. In your own thought of things your man has changed; you have become another man by your appreciation of the covenant. I will tell you what is essential to a covenant on the part of God -- that it should make known what God is in His disposition towards us, as a man's will makes known his disposition towards his heirs.
{161}
I might go through scripture and point to many covenants; the covenant after the flood made known the disposition of God towards man, and so with David, it made known God's disposition towards him, and the new covenant makes known His disposition now towards man. We only know God by his disposition towards us. Many of us here have children; my children know me by knowing my disposition towards them, that I would do the best I could for them. They cannot read my inmost heart, but they learn me by finding my disposition towards them.
But there is another point, and that is -- knowing that disposition I respond to it. My child learns from infancy what my mind is toward it, and knowing me thus it responds to it. Those are two principles which everyone ought to take in.
Now, in the new covenant the importance is that God is known in His disposition towards us, and then that we respond to that. If that passage (chapter 8: 11, 12) means anything it expresses the disposition of God, and thus He is made known. But in the preceding verse it is said, "This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people": that is the response to the knowledge of God. Things are stated in the inverse order to what is the case in their application to us, in that the knowledge comes first, and then the law of God is written in our hearts; that is the principle.
Now how is all that to be brought about? By the appreciation of Christ, for we cannot see the truth except in Christ. We cannot understand the disposition of God towards men except as we see it in Christ. Hence, as I understand it, Christ is the covenant, for on the one hand it is in Him that
{162}
God's disposition is set forth, and on the other, He is the perfect response as to all that man should be for God. He is the bond.
In @Luke 10: 38 - 42 we see how Mary appreciated Christ, and I think it was founded on this, that He made known God in His disposition towards her; I connect it with verse 22, "All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal him". The ground and character of her appreciation was that Christ revealed God to her. But in chapter 11: 1 - 3 we get another point. What suggested to the disciples that they should ask Him to teach them to pray? We might have done the same. I think they felt that Christ was everything a man should be for God and therefore that He could teach them to pray; He Himself could spend a night in prayer to God. When He was born there was good pleasure in men. Now if you have followed what I have said, you will see that we get two things in Christ. He declared God's disposition, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, it was declared in Himself. Those who came in contact with Him felt the grace of God, there can be no doubt about it. I refer to @Luke 7: 41 - 50 because it is evident to my mind that the woman in Simon's house apprehended that God was declared to her in Jesus; in the parable that the Lord propounded He exposed things as they were, but there was grace. He was the creditor, and she felt it; but He was the covenant to her; God was declared to her soul. But my point is, we want to appreciate Christ not only as declaring God, but as being the perfect response on man's part before God, so that you can ask Him to teach you to pray. He leads us into the response, we get the ability to pray from Christ. Christ is the covenant; we apprehend Him as the One who has
{163}
declared God; but who is also all that man should or would be for God. It is a true saying that people are pretty much what they appreciate, and if you appreciate Christ as having declared God's disposition, and as being all that a man could be for God, you have changed your man; you have set yourself aside and put on another man -- the new man which is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth. You could not understand the new man if you did not learn it in Christ. I discard the old man and appreciate the new, and am characterised by what I appreciate. If Christ is appreciated in my heart, God is known, and my delight is in the knowledge of God, I joy in God by our Lord Jesus Christ. We are to glory in knowing God, and we know Him by knowing His disposition. But then there is the other side; Christ teaches me to pray, I pray by His Spirit. I cannot conceive any more radical change in a person, it meant a change of husband, and if so, a change of man morally on my part. I am no longer in the flesh, for the Spirit of God dwells in me. Christ is available for everybody, and He is the covenant to me, and so the believer gets the appreciation of Christ, and if he comes to the meeting he brings his appreciation of Christ. Do not put this aside, and say, somebody else will bring it; take care that *you* bring it. It is not the exclusive portion of the learned or intelligent, but it is for the youngest and most illiterate. What is there in this Babylonish world that is really worth anything but the appreciation of Christ?
The second qualification for service is purgation. This is not known till you have the first -- appreciation. Many here might put it the opposite way, but I believe in the order I have indicated. The one who has appreciation of Christ has purgation, that is my conviction. When forgiveness of sins is preached and one receives the testimony in faith,
{164}
it is not that he believes that he *has got it*, but that it is there for him in Christ, and the Spirit is the seal of that faith. He appropriates it. But when he gets the Spirit he sees that Christ has sealed the covenant in His blood, and he has purgation. We get the covenant in Christ, and the seal of it in His blood, and that brings purgation of conscience so that we can serve the living God. It is what is brought before us in the Lord's supper. That all may be confirmed by scripture. (See @1 John 5: 6 - 8.) Christ "came by water and blood". In the order of presentation in the gospel the blood comes first, but when the Spirit bears witness to its application to us it comes last. No one can know the witness of the blood until he has the Spirit. The first thing is the appreciation of Christ in the soul as the covenant, then you get by the Spirit the sense of purgation, so that you can worship the living God. Two things are essential -- Christ known in the heart as declaring the disposition of God, and the seal of the covenant in His blood; hence you get purgation from dead works to serve the living God. Those are the qualifications at the service of the simplest and humblest believer. In coming to the meeting it is not a question of coming to *find* but to *bring*, and what we bring must of necessity be according to God. You want to understand in your soul the platform that Christ has established, and to have the appreciation of Christ as the covenant, and the sense by the Spirit of the blood of purgation.
I believe the question of worship is a very important one, for we may practically drop down to what is around and look for a worldly sanctuary and ordinances of service. It might have been right once, but it is not so now; *now* all depends on what we bring; each must bring something; do not trust your neighbour to bring it, bring it yourself.
{165}
THE WAY OF ENTRANCE INTO SPIRITUAL BLESSING
@John 5: 17 - 29
I would like to say a word as to the progress of the soul, and its entrance into the sense of spiritual blessing.
It is evident that we cannot at once enter into things in the measure in which God has presented them to us. If God speaks to us, He speaks of necessity from His own fulness; it is impossible that we can all at once take in all that God proposes to us; if that were the case we should in a sense be as great in understanding as God. I believe we are led on into the consciousness of blessing just in proportion as we are in the apprehension of Christ; that is, we enjoy it, the truth works within us just as there is the apprehension of what is true in Christ, for the Spirit in the believer answers to what Christ is at the right hand of God.
Now I have been struck with the sequence of the three chapters, @John 4, 5 and 6. I believe they speak on the side of our apprehension of the truth. The Lord had revealed in chapter 3 the proposition or thought of God, and therefore to my mind @John 3 is essentially a gospel chapter, it is the revelation of what God has proposed. Our entering into it I believe comes out in the succeeding chapters 4, 5 and 6, and culminates in chapter 7.
I will just touch for a moment on the point of these chapters, especially on what comes out in chapter 5. I think there are three forms of pressure from which the Lord proposes to deliver man in the three chapters. In chapter 4 the *deliverance is from sin*, in chapter 5 the *deliverance is from weakness*, and in chapter 6, in the satisfying the soul, if I might use the expression, the *deliverance*
{166}
*is from want* -- these are three great things for God in His grace to effect for man down here in the very scene of sin and weakness and want. I assert that man is delivered from sin, raised up out of weakness, and every need of his heart is satisfied and more than satisfied. I think everybody would admit that that is a great thing to be effected for man down here, and in it is the fulfilment of the thought in chapter 3, "that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life". I get it carried out experimentally in that way. It is noticeable that there is but little reference to the future except in chapter 6, where the Lord says, "I will raise him up at the last day".
I want to touch, *seriatim*, on the points I have indicated. Jesus is presented in chapter 4 as the Christ, for although the Father's name occurs in the chapter in connection with worship, the name of the Son does not appear, and it is as the Christ that He communicates to the believer the living water. We read in @Ephesians 1, "In whom having believed", that is, in the Christ, "ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise". It is a great thing to get hold of the truth of the Christ. In the Old Testament we find the thought of the anointed of God, the One who, rejected here of men, is to take the earth for His inheritance. I believe you have a larger range of thought opened out in Hebrews, that He is the heir of all things; that connects itself with what we have in @Ephesians 1, the mystery of God's will. To gather up in one all things in the Christ. He is the One who has to take all things, and in @John 4 it is He who communicates the living water; the water that He would give was to be in the believer a well of water springing up into everlasting life. This is what I would call initial and introductory. Sin has met its judgment in Christ. He has fulfilled the type of the brazen
{167}
serpent, the judgment of sin in the flesh, in order that the Spirit might dwell in the believer.
In connection with the truth of eternal life comes in the most important point of deliverance from sin. You will never gain deliverance from sin except by getting another object than self before the soul. You must of necessity be superseded in your own eyes, and this is only by the power of another object, another man before the soul. I know that plenty of people would tell me that you are dead to sin, but you will not die to it till you get another object before the soul, and that is the second Man, who has entered into the holiest for us, and in the apprehension of that really lies the secret of deliverance from sin.
In chapter 5 I get a point further; it is here more than the communication of the Spirit of life to be in the believer, for we get the man raised up. The Son quickens the body, but the point in the chapter is that He raises up the man, and a wonderful thing it is for a man to be raised up out of the weakness which sin has brought upon him. The point of the chapter is the raising of the man. I believe it is effected by the apprehension in the soul of the truth of the Son and what depends on this, for in this chapter it is not the Christ who is brought before us, but the Son -- He reveals the Father. I get here the truth of the Person; He is the Son, and therefore He is competent to reveal the Father, that is the wonderful thing that comes out in this chapter. He knows the Father, lies in His bosom, knows all that is there. The Father loves the Son and shews Him all things that Himself doeth. You have got now to a grand point, you are raised up into a new scene altogether, and the new scene presented to us is an unfolding beyond all that was ever revealed before. None but the Son can reveal the Father, it is not any amount of language that could reveal the
{168}
Father. He alone is competent here and therefore He says, "He that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me, has life eternal, and does not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life". You are really raised up by the introduction of the soul into a new scene. It is not only that the Christ has communicated unto me a great gift, but He is competent to reveal the Father. He says, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work". What things to open out to poor things like us; it is to me perfectly wonderful that down here He has raised man out of his weakness to enter into things that he never could have dreamt of -- the Father revealed in the Son. The secret of all that God is has come out. It is not simply what the Father can do, but it is the Father's heart that has come to light. The Father loves the Son and shews Him all these works of grace. The Son is as man dependent, but He is none the less the Son. He is as truly a divine Person as the Father, and can say, "He that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me"; and it is in this that we really enter into the place of children, are made conscious of being raised up in this very scene.
There is only a word more as to the third point, that is, deliverance from want. We have seen that there is the well of water springing up in the believer into eternal life, and that he has a revelation of new things to his soul. Now there is another thing; he has to be formed constitutionally; that is what I get in chapter 6, the effect of the living bread. The constitution of a child is formed by its food. The bread from heaven is the believer's food, and there is another character of food to that, eating the flesh of the Son of man and drinking His blood; that is, that I have to appropriate death to that system in which the flesh lives. But I am fed with living bread, "*he* also who eats me shall live also
{169}
on account of me". My spiritual constitution is formed as surely by the food on which I live as is that of a child. The believer apprehends in Christ the Man that is the object of heaven's delight. It is a great thing not only to be brought into these things, but to be in them constitutionally; we are, I fear, very small constitutionally, and I think it is because we are not fully nourished. "*He* also who eats me shall live also on account of me". The whole idea of the chapter is, I think, satisfaction. The blessed Son of God has become man, entered into that state that He might be everything to the believer, as He is everything to heaven; thus his soul is fed, and he is independent of all beside.
I only add that all this depends on the apprehension of what Christ is, and we have seen the order in which the soul has to apprehend it. You do not begin at the top, though God speaks from the top. I do not think that a soul in the first place takes in what are called in a familiar hymn 'the higher mysteries of Thy fame'. When God begins to work in the teaching of the Spirit we are led on in the apprehension of Christ so as to become more deeply conscious of the blessing which God has purposed for us; and anything to surpass what is presented to us in this chapter I cannot conceive. You are brought into all the light of heaven in what is presented in the Father and the Son, and in chapter 6 it is not only, as we have seen, that we are to be in it as under the power of the Spirit but also constitutionally.
I do not want to add more, I would rather others would seek to open it out for themselves.
I believe that God intends to bring us into all that He has revealed to us, but it is another thing how far we have taken it in. I think I can see the wonderful grace of God and the power of the Spirit in the way in which our souls are led on.
{170}
"THAT THE CHRIST MAY DWELL, THROUGH FAITH, IN YOUR HEARTS"
@Ephesians 3: 17
There are very few of us that do not hail with some measure of gladness the advent of a new year. The sun, the power, in a sense, of life, has reached its lowest point in the heavens, and hope and geniality in our minds accompany its rising again. We have seen the same thing repeated many times, yet we cannot resist the effect of the recurrence. Now we must all admit that, in the view of the church, Christ, the true sun, has gone down very low indeed, and all are suffering from the effects of this. There are dark days, and a great absence of geniality among those that ought to be filled with gladness. For them the sun is not high in the heavens. But it is in the power of God to give a reviving by His Spirit, for there is no thought more comforting than that the Spirit abides here still. And there is no limit to what the Spirit can effect for Christ in the saints.
The form that the reviving would take would be, I judge, in the Spirit producing in the hearts of saints a deep sense not only of that which Christ is personally, but of that which He is officially, of the place which He fills as the Centre and Head of the counsels of God. This brings Him into view as the "Sun of righteousness", the life of the world to come. And the view of Christ in this way can hardly fail to revive hope in the hearts of saints even in the darkest day. It is in this light that I desire to present Christ.
We have been very much disposed to put the coming again of Christ *in contrast* to His first coming, and in a sense the contrast is very great; but looked at in a moral point of view, the second
{171}
coming is the complement of the first. What was then set forth in testimony will be established in power. One simple thought will be sufficient to establish this: He testified the righteousness and faithfulness of God in the great congregation; when He comes again it will be to establish that righteousness and faithfulness in the world, and not alone in Israel. So too the works of mercy that the Lord did in the way of witness were the powers of the world to come. Again the holiest of all, the kingdom of God and eternal life were all here in His Person, and available for man had man not been blind, and all these will be established in His second coming. The great salvation began to be spoken by the Lord and will be accomplished in power in His second coming. We see in this way how the first coming is the pledge and sample of what marks His coming again.
In the first coming of Christ it is extremely interesting to see that everything that had been here for God, and had in a sense lapsed through sin, is renewed, it comes again into view. Man comes into view in the Son of man. The law is seen in the perfection of it in Christ; not in the detail of its requirements, but in the great moral principles that were, so to say, the soul of it. Israel came again into view, not in a small remnant of Jews that in the providence of God had been brought back to Canaan under gentile domination, but in the perfection of the whole, in God's Son that was called out of Egypt, and was in spirit outside of all domination, whether of Satan or man. The word of God that had ceased for many a long year is revived in the power of the Spirit, in glad tidings to the poor. The temple of God comes into view, not in a house that had become corrupt through the covetousness of man, but in One who was marked by unsullied holiness.
{172}
All this was of the deepest interest for God, and is of the greatest moment to us, for nothing can be more important to us than to realise the impossibility of anything that God has ordained ending in absolute failure. Satan is not going to achieve a victory over God. Thus Christ is the great answer on the part of God to all that has come in by sin. And it is profitable for us to study the gospels in this light.
But another consideration comes in, and that is that men with whom Christ had connected Himself (not morally, but in the fact of incarnation) were under liabilities in regard of God, and under the power of evil, in abject bondage. And yet they were the objects of the sovereign mercy of God, whether Jew or gentile. Hence these liabilities had to be met by redemption; Christ came in the grace of God, was made a little lower than angels that He might taste death for everything. And here we meet a most momentous fact, that all that had been revived for God in the incarnation of Christ was laid down, as after the flesh, in death. And it could not be otherwise if men were to have any part in blessing.
But the resurrection morning broke, and all comes into light again in One who, having charged Himself by the will of God with all that under which man lay, is now revealed in respect of man as a quickening Spirit, with power to subdue all things to Himself! Surely this is great ground of rejoicing. If heavenly hosts celebrated the birth of Christ into this world with rejoicing, should not the resurrection of Christ be hailed with acclamation by man, the subject of God's mercy? If man did not rejoice, the stones would cry out.
But we can see still a point further by the power of the Holy Spirit that has come down from heaven. The One that descended into the lower parts of the earth has ascended far above all heavens, that He
{173}
may fill all things. He has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to Him. We are at liberty to behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face. He is the Mediator of the new covenant, the establishment of which will fill the world with blessing by the knowledge of God. It is in this way that Christ is now before the eyes of His people, the pledge of the reconciliation of all things to God in Himself. And now all is to come forth from Himself. Nothing will be seen until He rises from the right hand of God. Then He will come to take His place and to establish the universe of bliss. He will come to be glorified in His saints, and to be admired in all those that believe. The church is the special object of His love, that with which He has been concerning Himself in His absence, and in it His glory will be set forth. He will be known by her in the gate. Israel too will in a sense come forth from Him. It may be said that they will be gathered from all places in which they have been hid, but morally they will come forth from Christ. He is the true vine, the true Son of God that has been called out of Egypt, and all that will distinguish Israel morally as a people on earth will be of Christ. They confer no distinction on Christ, but He gives character to them. Then too He is a light for the revelation of the gentiles, they will come out of the close places in which they have been hidden from God, in the degradation of idolatry. Men will be blessed in Him, the true seed of Abraham, all nations will call Him blessed. He will fill all things with blessing. The One that takes away the sin of the world is the One suited to fill all things with blessing according to God. All this is hid in Christ at the present time at the right hand of God. The world goes on its course perfectly regardless of all this, and, alas! many christians are very little
{174}
affected by it. The terrible mistake has been made of regarding Christ as having come in to better this world, instead of seeing that the moment He comes in as man He is the beginning of another world, in which man can have part by the Spirit of Christ in virtue of the accomplishment of redemption. Hence Christ is the hope of the christian, who is most deeply interested in all that which Christ will bring in at His coming.
In the light of what has been said above, there can be little difficulty in entering in some little measure into the prayer of the apostle Paul in @Ephesians 3. The church is here as the bride of Christ, but the Bridegroom is absent, and His absence is a test of the fidelity of the bride. If she is true to the Bridegroom, she would have Him dwelling in her heart by faith. She would regard no interest but His, would cherish all that concerns Him, and would not allow anything to conflict with His rights in the heart. In this way the Bridegroom would be reflected in the bride. She would be a witness to Him in His absence. How far this has been realised in the church I leave anyone to judge. But the power of the Spirit of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ can strengthen us with all might in the inner man that this may be the case. One cannot allow that the prayer of the apostle is to have no answer in the present time, and if so, even at this late moment there may be the witness of fidelity to the Bridegroom. The point is whether we are prepared for this strengthening in the inward man, for it may be accompanied by a corresponding weakening in the outward man, so that all the links with the world may be loosened. But there is great gain in it. The result is that we are rooted and founded in love, for love, in the true sense, lies in the inward man, and if we are strengthened there it is in the way of spiritual holy affections, the
{175}
secret of all real intelligence. It is the enlargement of the man that is wanted that there may be the opening of the intelligence. Then we have a vast expanse presented, the breadth and length and depth and height. This is a wonderful subject of contemplation, the vastness of that moral expanse that presents itself to the one that apprehends the true thought of the Bridegroom, who enters into alliance with and gives character to all that which is for God. It is an expanse which will be filled with the glory of God, and will rejoice in liberty from ill, and in the blessing of God. Then we know too the warmth with which all will be filled, the love of Christ that passes knowledge. The church is privy now to these things, and the knowledge of them qualifies her to be an expression of the wisdom and love of God while she waits the coming of the Bridegroom. One can only pray that saints may be awakened to this in these last moments, that there may be an answer morally to all the infidelity that is abroad, and a support to the testimony of the gospel.
{176}
WHAT GOD HAS ESTABLISHED
@1 John 2: 12 - 27
The special addresses which are given in this passage to christians in various stages of growth are well worthy of careful study, not only in regard to what is said as to each particular stage, but because what is involved in the whole really covers the whole ground of christianity. The prominent thought in the fathers is the One from the beginning, in the young men, the word of God abiding in them, and in the little children, the knowledge of the truth by the anointing. If the One from the beginning, the word of God, and the truth are put together, there is not much to be added.
It may be useful to take up these thoughts a little in their particular connection; we thus learn that which happily marks christians in various stages of spiritual progress, and, what is of more importance, apprehend that which God has established here so immovably that, though obscured, it cannot be shaken. It may be well in the first instance to touch on that which is addressed to the little children.
The apostle's desire for the little children evidently was stability, that they might not be moved by any antichristian influences that were at work. The object of these was to neutralise the revelation of God in Christ, that which is designated as "the truth". The Father and the Son were denied. The real test in regard to this is the Son, for there may be loose talk as to the fatherhood of God to men, which does not come out of the fact that the Father has been set forth in the Son. The unwary might be beguiled by this. Now the safeguard of the little children was, that they had received from the Holy One that which completed the truth, and made good in them the revelation. The Father had sent the
{177}
Son, and the Son had sent the promise of the Father. The little children had an unction from the Holy One and knew all things. They had not need that any man teach them. Now this position ought to be clearly understood. Every soul begins with the faith of Christ, and consequent on this the gift of the Holy Spirit is communicated. And, in the Spirit, the believer has all the truth. The Spirit is the truth. The revelation of God was perfect in Christ, and the Spirit has sealed a complete testimony. There is nothing to be added to it. All that we want is clearer apprehension of what was expressed in Christ by the Spirit, and is now made good in our hearts by the same Spirit. Any addition to this must be false. Nothing can be more important for the simplest believer than to see that, in the possession of the Spirit, he has all truth, and that what is needed for the apprehension of it is the cultivation of relations with God as He has been revealed. Here lies the secret of all growth in spiritual intelligence, and man gets his true measure in our thoughts. Men may seek to accommodate the Scriptures to the results of man's investigation, or to conclusions at which the human mind has arrived; but if this were possible there would really be no revelation. We must have the truth as it is, or reject it as a whole. There can be no compromise, for the truth professes to set forth divine Persons, who could not have been known if They had not been revealed. Thus the little children knew the Father in believing in the Son in whom the Father had been revealed. All this is confirmed in us by the Spirit, and from the time that the Spirit is received we are placed in relation to the Persons revealed; and in the maintenance of this lies the safeguard of saints and the way of progress in intelligence. They have to abide in that which was from the beginning. God is now revealed not simply
{178}
in names which imply divine attributes, but in His nature, and this has involved the whole truth of the Godhead coming to light. It is a great point to bring home to young believers that they have the truth in having the Spirit, and that in giving place to the Spirit is the secret of advancement, and this in the knowledge of God. And the Spirit will always keep them within the lines of Scripture, so that they can always appeal to the law and to the testimony. But the truth lies in that the living Persons of the Godhead are livingly revealed. And this puts revelation outside of all that is or can be of man.
What more peculiarly marks the young men is, that they are strong and that the word of God abides in them. This does not imply that they had not all that the little children had. All had the unction, and the young men had overcome the wicked one, which refers probably to the false anti-christian workings of Satan. Now vigour is that which is commonly seen in young men. And in divine things it is expressed in the word of God abiding in them. A distinction may be made between the truth, and the word of God. The former perhaps refers to the revelation of God, and the latter to the making known His mind. It is true that the one hangs on the other, but the revelation of God in Himself is clearly distinct from the expression of His thought as to man. It is in the young men that the testimony abides. The little children need to be established by the Spirit in the truth; when this is the case, they are young men, and in such the testimony abides. We see the apostle Paul committing the word to Timothy, who may be ranked among the young men. The vigour is there, in which the word of God is maintained in witness in the world. It is not difficult therefore to see the importance that attaches to the young men. The truth is secured in the presence here of the
{179}
Spirit, the word of God abides in the young men, in order that it may be kept before men. We are to preach the word, to be instant in season and out of season. And on the other hand, to beware of the things of the world, which are always at hand to ensnare us, and to obscure and spoil our witness.
The fathers had known Him that is from the beginning. The thought "from the beginning" clearly marks a point of departure; and the Son of God, become man, must of necessity be this. He could not simply be the crown of things that existed. He is the beginning, but He is also from the beginning. This may refer to the fact that the true light now shines. This is true now in Christ and christians. God has come out in light, and in Christ is the Sun of righteousness, not yet arisen, but hid beyond the horizon of this world's vision. But the true light now shines, and the question is what may abide this light. Here it is that Christ occupies the place of centre and sun. As in @Genesis 1 we have the light from the outset, and then on the fourth day the sun set in its place in relation to the earth, so in Christ we have first the light of the revelation of God, and then Himself as the appointed light to rule God's day. He is both "from the beginning" and "the beginning". I take it that the moral outset of all in the ways of God is the revelation of Himself in His nature. And the One who became man, that this might be, must of necessity take the central place in the universe of bliss. This was apprehended by the fathers, and in the apprehension of it their thoughts were diverted from all else. The world, in which man has glory, had passed from their regard. Another order of things had come into view in which, in result, God would be all in all. Not only had they believed in the One from the beginning, but they knew Him, and in knowing Him they had reached the eternal life. There is in Him a power
{180}
and energy of life that can hold in impotence death and all the powers of evil. The fathers had realised christianity in the true power of it.
I think that it will be admitted that there is great interest in getting in our minds the sum, as it were, of what is embodied in these words to the various classes; the truth, as the foundation, assured in the anointing; the word of God abiding in those that were strong; and the One from the beginning appreciated here in the midst of a world that knew Him not, and knows us not. And all this combining to give to the christian circle a character which should make it agreeable in the eye of God, and to the praise of Christ. One may mourn how little it is realised at the present time, and any true heart would desire to be so in the reality of these things as to be an overcomer in the midst of the terrible defection.
{181}
THE REVELATION OF GOD AND THE GLORY OF CHRIST MAINTAINED BY THE SPIRIT
@Luke 12: 1 - 12; @Luke 24: 36 - 53
In chapter 11 the heavenly Father waited to be asked for the gift of the Holy Spirit, and here in chapter 24 we have "Behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you". We know that He did send Him, and they were endued with power from on high. Christianity in one word is Christ; it is made good in the soul by the work of the Spirit. The believer is brought into sonship and liberty by the Spirit.
In the ministry of Christ there was an entirely new beginning. The visits of the Spirit of God before had been fitful; often long intervals between, and before the advent of Christ there had been a dearth of hearing the prophetic word for some hundreds of years. Now there comes a new departure, an announcement of righteousness for man, and deliverance from spiritual ills. It is a very great help to us to see that the Lord's ministry here upon earth contemplated for us a new beginning, and that all since has been a continuation of that. In chapter 4 the Spirit of Jehovah was upon Christ, but in chapter 12 the Lord contemplates a time when He would be absent, and the word spoken in the last chapter would be fulfilled, "Behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you". The point is, that on the one hand men would blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, for which there would be no forgiveness -- that testimony being final; and on the other hand the disciples were to commit themselves to the power and teaching of the Holy Spirit. We cannot take into account too much the presence of the Spirit. Christianity knows no other power.
{182}
Prophets spoke before, and in that sense we have none now, but we have something much greater in the presence and power of the Spirit. This ought to affect us as to our speech and witness. Christianity cannot be enforced by fire or sword, or by politics, or by anything of that kind; it is wholly dependent on the power and the presence of the Spirit down here. The Lord in @Luke 12 was anticipating the moment when He would no longer be here, and He asserts that there would be no forgiveness for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of God brought in a closing testimony and that testimony is final.
Two objects present themselves as connected with the presence of the Spirit; the first, to maintain the revelation of God; the other, that He has come down from the exalted Man, to give effect to the counsel of God in Christ. How could the testimony have been maintained apart from the Spirit? The disciples could not have accomplished this. Their memories could not be trusted more than ours. There is no additional revelation, all is complete in Christ. If we speak of the truth, it is the revelation of God. God is love; it was revealed in Christ, and the Spirit has come to maintain the revelation. Again, His presence here is a remarkable witness to the unity of the Godhead. Revelation would be entirely ineffective and effaced from the mind of man if the Holy Spirit were not down here. Man's mind does not naturally care for the declaration of the mind of God, but in spite of all the darkness, it *has* been maintained. Yet if that declaration is blasphemed there is no forgiveness, all is over.
We get a great deal in the New Testament of the one Man who is the sun and centre of the universe of bliss. The Holy Spirit gives us intelligence of that one Man. Turn to @John 16: 8 - 15. Those verses
{183}
express what the Spirit is here to maintain. Christ is the centre on which all the Father's glory hangs. The Spirit would come and glorify Christ, "He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you". What comes to pass now in the saints is, that Christ dwells in their hearts by faith. So there are two great results from the presence of the Spirit here -- the maintenance of the revelation of God, and intelligence in the saints as to the exalted Man, the One who has gone up "far above all heavens". The Holy Spirit has come down to report His glory to us: "He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you". The Lord contemplated that in @Luke 12. He was going to the right hand of God, while the Holy Spirit would hold the ground down here, and ever keep in the view of the saints the Man in the glory and all that centres in Him. It is a great mercy if God gives us any sense of Christ's official glory. The mystery is now manifested to the saints, revelation is maintained -- man cannot blot it out, and Christ is witnessed to as the exalted Man in whom every divine thought for man is revived for God. He is the pivot on which all turns; why? Because He tasted death for every thing (@Hebrews 2: 9).
The two scriptures, @Luke 24: 26, 27 and 44 - 47, are very remarkable. Repentance and forgiveness were to be preached, but in *His name*. A proclamation was to be made in the whole world through that One who had suffered according to the Scriptures, and was risen again from the dead; and why? In order that those who received it might be attached to that Man by the Spirit. The apostles had to carry out this work as endued with power from on high, and the way in which they carried out their work was again a witness to the unity of the Godhead. God is our Father, revealed in the Son; and the testimony is maintained by the Spirit.
{184}
Now see what a great place the Spirit has in this present time. The Lord attaches more importance to His presence here than even to His own presence. "It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you" (@John 16: 7). It was the final testimony. What I plead for is that we should *recognise* the presence of the Spirit. If we want to order our conduct according to God, there will be the "lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love; using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace". The conduct of all should be regulated by the Spirit of God. He will put no kind of sanction on the methods of man. As christians we ought to be prepared to abandon human methods and ways. There is nothing beneath the Spirit of God down here; even if we are only shewing mercy, it is in His power we do it. Whatever we have to do, there is nothing beneath Him. His power was not only for apostles, but for every member of the body of Christ. Whatever our functions, the smallest and the meanest might be carried out in the power of the Spirit. What would the human body be without oil, or how could machinery work without oil? Even so, what would the body of Christ be without the unction of the Holy Spirit?
We need much of the power of the Spirit to carry out anything for God down here. It is a great comfort to know that whatever has been the defection of the church, the Spirit of God remains. One effect of giving the Spirit His right place is, that we shall be very conscious of being in marvellous light. Another effect is, we shall have delight in the glorified Man at the right hand of God, and in all that of which He is going to be the sun and centre.
{185}
(1) CHRIST AS APOSTLE AND HIGH PRIEST
@Hebrews 1: 1 - 14
F.E.R. I suppose all the epistles go to make up the testimony. I think it follows upon that that every epistle must have its roots in the Old Testament and its bearing on the future. It is important to bear that in mind. The Scriptures are one complete whole, and the testimony of God is just as clear in the Old Testament as in the New. The one great point is the testimony -- "Be not ... ashamed of the testimony of our Lord".
Ques. What is the aspect in the Hebrews?
F.E.R. Christ is the Apostle and High Priest -- the true Moses and Aaron. Yet you get the Apostle, and at the same time He is the great Priest over the house of God. Then the thought of the house of God carries you on to the future, and at the same time it carries you back to the past.
J.S.O. What did you mean by the 'roots'?
F.E.R. Things are taken up in a new way in the New Testament, but the things are really found in the Old Testament. For the moment however, they are secured in that which is not seen in the Old.
P.R.M. Would you say that is true of Colossians?
F.E.R. Yes, undoubtedly.
P.R.M. You get the circumcision brought in.
F.E.R. And a great deal more; you get the head and the reconciliation of all things. It carries you back to the past.
Ques. In what way to the past -- the day of atonement?
F.E.R. I mean you must find some thought of the head in the Old Testament -- the high priest is the head. You may divide the epistles into two classes -- those which contemplate Christ coming
{186}
out and those which contemplate Christ going in. Romans, Corinthians and Galatians, His coming out. Ephesians and Colossians contemplate Christ going in.
Ques. What about Philippians?
F.E.R. I could not quite say at the moment. I quote the others because it is pretty plain there.
Dr. M. Would you get both in Hebrews -- the coming in and going out?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. Take Romans -- there you have the mercy seat -- that is coming out. Then in 1 Corinthians He is the wisdom and power of God -- that is coming out. In Galatians, Christ is the true Isaac, the vessel of blessing to the gentiles -- that is coming out. Now when you come to Colossians and Ephesians, it is really 'going in'. So you "set your affection on things above ... God", @Colossians 3: 2.
S.L.J. In 'coming out' you mean coming out the first time?
F.E.R. I mean coming out in the revelation of God -- as apostle.
S.L.J. Not as coming out in the future?
F.E.R. No. Because I think then He comes out as king and priest. He came down as apostle, but has gone up as priest.
C-I.B. What is the difference between the testimony at the present moment and the testimony in the Old Testament?
F.E.R. Not a bit of difference in the world.
C-I.B. What is the difference in the display of it?
F.E.R. It is not display, else it would not be testimony. Testimony is in contrast to display.
C-I.B. Was there a living testimony in the Old Testament?
F.E.R. There was a testimony, though it was not set forth in a living vessel, it was there. Now it is set forth in a living vessel. You get Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith. You could not get
{187}
that in the Old Testament -- that has to be a testimony living. In chapter 3 of this very epistle, you get Moses spoken of as being faithful for a testimony of the things which should afterwards be seen. He was a servant in God's house for a testimony.
C-I.B. Then does the difference between Moses and the Son bring out the character of the testimony?
F.E.R. Now that the Son has come in, and you get Christ in the saints by the Spirit, you have, I think, the living vessel, that is, the church properly speaking.
If you take this chapter, it is as evident as possible that the epistle to the Hebrews has its roots in the Psalms. Almost every quotation through the epistle is from the Psalms, and almost entirely from @Psalm 2 and @Psalm 110. But there is another point connected with it -- it all has its bearing on the future. I refer to the throne and Christ seated at the right hand of God until His enemies be made His footstool. It is perfectly astonishing what a comprehensive view of Christ you get in the Psalms. The first book of Psalms is full of Christ. You get Him brought into the world -- "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee". Then, to mention nothing else, in @Psalm 8, you get Him as the Son of Man. In @Psalm 40, He is the Ark of the Covenant. In the second book of Psalms, He is ascended up on high, and led captivity captive, and you get the ascended Man who has given gifts to men preparing the way for God to dwell. Then you get the sure mercies of David in connection with Zion. Then in the fourth book He comes into David's house, recognised as Jehovah. In the fifth book, He is exalted as Priest and is welcomed when He comes again. It is all perfectly orderly too. You get both ideas in the Psalms -- the coming out and the going in. In Hebrews Christ comes out as apostle and goes in as priest.
{188}
J.S.O. The difference in this dispensation is that the relationships are different.
F.E.R. Exactly; but then it is so very interesting to see that in this time of the rejection of Christ you get every divine thought taken up in the church. I think it is in the way of education, so that the saints may become conversant with every way of God -- it is all to fit the saints for the heavenly city.
J.S.O. They are learning now in Christ everything which is to come.
F.E.R. Everything which is to come out publicly, yes.
S.L.J. But the mass of us do not seem to learn it.
F.E.R. Then it is a poor look-out if we do not.
J.S.O. So that everything which broke down in the past history of the Old Testament, in man, will come out in the future?
F.E.R. Yes; but then *now* it is that through the church might be known the manifold wisdom of God (@Ephesians 3: 10).
C-I.B. In @Revelation 11 you get "there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament".
F.E.R. It is really Christ seen in heaven -- the ark of the covenant secures everything. The testimony has left the earth but it is seen in heaven -- everything is secured in the ark of the covenant in spite of all that prevails here. We have come to a day when there is a tremendous effort abroad to assail the Old Testament, and we have to be on the alert in regard to that. I think the great preservative is to apprehend in the Old Testament the testimony of the Christ which is just as plain there as in the New.
B. So that in this chapter although the voice is different the testimony is exactly the same?
F.E.R. Yes; that is what made me say that every epistle has its roots in the Old Testament, in the light in which Christ is presented. For instance, if
{189}
you take up one simple thing, the tabernacle of the testimony -- it was there in figurative representation, but now you have the thing livingly -- but you have the same thing.
J.S.O. You could not possibly have the testimony of God inconsistent with itself.
F.E.R. Of course not.
Rem. And when Christ came He testified of Himself.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so -- "Ye search the scriptures ... witness of me".
E.D. Would it be too much to say it was more latent in the Old Testament?
F.E.R. I would almost say it is all patent, now that we have the light of the New. Every book in the New Testament has its roots in the Old. I think you get the roots of Luke in Jeremiah and John in Ezekiel, Matthew and Mark in Isaiah. Matthew is connected with the first part, and Mark with the second part of Isaiah. I only suggest this, and am not dogmatising one single bit.
Ques. You cannot therefore separate the Old Testament from the New?
F.E.R. No. It stirs my spirit indeed to see people who prefer to accept Christ in the New Testament and reject the Old.
C-I.B. "Son of man" is an expression which you get very frequently in Ezekiel. How does this apply in John?
F.E.R. The Son of Man is very prominent in John -- "As Moses lifted up ... Son of man be lifted up" and "Who is this Son of man?" -- "Hereafter ye shall see heaven open and ... Son of man". I do not however want anybody to think I am laying it down as a fact, I only suggest it. You could not understand the Old Testament, if you had not got the New. In the time of the Old Testament, nobody ever questioned its authenticity. Now, its
{190}
authenticity is questioned and you have got the New -- but really the New is the key to unlock the Old. I think the preparation to meet the infidelity around is the intelligent understanding of the word of God -- to see that one thought prevails throughout entirely, and that is the testimony of God. He expounded unto them in Moses and the Psalms and all the Prophets the things concerning Himself (@Luke 24). Do not look for anything else in Scripture but Christ. In @Revelation 19 you get "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy".
S.L.J. The question is not to meet the critics by working on their line, but to show what underlies the Old Testament.
F.E.R. They are as dark and ignorant as can be in regard to what underlies the Scriptures. The critics set forth that you can give up Scripture because you have got Christ. But then the point is this -- you would have no authority for anything without the law and the testimony. They have no apprehension whatever of Christ as divine, and have got Him as a matter of history. How can you possibly know where Christ is now? You must have a living witness to it. The Spirit has come down to report the glory of Christ and everything hangs upon that. It was so on the day of Pentecost. The fact of the Spirit's presence is witness to Christ -- "He shall testify of me".
M.S. Does not the Lord say, "The scriptures ... testify of me"?
F.E.R. Yes, but He meant the Old Testament Scriptures.
M.S. It has testified to me very often when nobody living was present.
F.E.R. But it was the Spirit who testified Christ to you.
A.S.L. Does Scripture make this distinction between the Old Testament and the New?
{191}
F.E.R. The Lord said "he shall testify of me" and then "He will guide you into all truth".
A.S.L. But the Scriptures are one whole.
F.E.R. Yes, and every scripture is divinely inspired. It is a conventional distinction between the Old and the New Testament. I do not think we must allow anything whatever to prevent us from apprehending the peculiarity of the present time in contrast to the past -- that which is dependent on the fact of redemption being accomplished, Christ being at the right hand of God, and the Spirit being here. What we call the New Testament is the new covenant and what we call the Old Testament is the old covenant, yet all is apprehended in the term "Scriptures". God is now speaking through the Son (verse 2) and you could not have any speaker after the Son.
Ques. What does the Spirit say?
F.E.R. "He shall testify of Me". "He shall take of mine" and the record of that is the New Testament.
Ques. If there is only one testimony what did the Lord mean by the "New Testament"?
F.E.R. He has made the first old. There is only one testimony -- that is Christ.
Ques. What is the testimony at the present time?
F.E.R. It is the ark of the covenant, but the curious thing is that in the ark of the covenant is the old covenant, and the tables of stone.
A.S.L. There is no difference between "covenant" and "testament" is there?
F.E.R. No; but the tables were put into the ark of the covenant. "I come ... to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart". You have the old secured in the new covenant. Christ came as the righteous One, but in virtue of redemption He is the new covenant; yet the old covenant is all secured there. The spirit and principle of the law is all perfectly secured there. The spirit and principle
{192}
of the law is all perfectly secured in the ark of the covenant but now it is, of course, Christ as the new covenant.
D.L.L. Then what was set aside and what became old was the bearing of it upon man in the flesh?
F.E.R. It was the formal system which became old.
E.D. Is that summed up in, "Christ is the end of the law"?
F.E.R. Yes; all the law is summed up in Him -- "Thy law is within my heart". The law was the expression of rights which properly belonged to God and which it was absolutely impossible for God to give up and even in regard to us, who have come into the new covenant, we really fulfil the requirements of the law.
J.S.O. "Love is the fulfilling of the law".
F.E.R. Exactly.
A.S.L. So in the Psalms it comes out in regard to Christ "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness".
F.E.R. Yes. We have not to do with the law as a system, but we have to do with it in the sense that the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us in the power of the Spirit.
Ques. Is there any testimony apart from the person of Christ?
F.E.R. No; but rather, I would say, from Christ -- it is Christ officially. He is the divinely appointed Head of the moral universe. He is the Ark of the covenant, the Priest -- the Head.
S.L.J. Do you make the ark as well as the tabernacle, Christ officially?
F.E.R. I think the ark is according to @Psalm 40 "I come ... to do thy will, O my God ... thy law is within my heart".
S.L.J. That is personally.
F.E.R. I think it is officially -- He comes out accomplishing the will of God. He will give place
{193}
to the will of God in the universe in the fact that everything is centred in Him.
P.R.M. The tabernacle came under the anointing.
F.E.R. Yes. And you can look at the tabernacle in another point of view -- as a figurative representation of the universe.
S.L.J. But will not Christ fill the universe?
F.E.R. Yes, but I think as the ark of the covenant.
B. Do you take the anointing of the tabernacle to indicate that all will come under the influence of the Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes, the Spirit of God morally will influence everything.
B. It shows the immense power of the Spirit.
J.K. Is that pouring out His Spirit on all flesh?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it is to subdue -- all will come under the influence of God.
Ques. Is there some answer to that now in the church -- God working in you to the willing and doing of His good pleasure?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so.
Ques. How do you understand "the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus"?
F.E.R. He is the Apostle -- the One employed to inaugurate the profession. He comes out on the line of revelation.
Ques. Where you say 'coming out' you do not mean Christ actually present on earth?
F.E.R. That is not so much the point, but Christ coming out to reveal God. He "was come from God, and went to God". He came from God to reveal God's mind and He went to God as Priest.
D.L.H. Is it true that we always either get the revelation line or the going in line?
F.E.R. Yes, Scripture ranges itself on one of those two lines -- revelation or approach.
Ques. Would you say that Moses and Joshua were both apostles?
{194}
F.E.R. Oh no. Joshua had nothing to do with the setting up of the profession -- it was all inaugurated by Moses.
J.S.O. Joshua was more on the line of 'going in'.
F.E.R. Yes. He took the people into the land.
J.S.O. The great point in this chapter is God having spoken, is it not?
F.E.R. I think so -- you get the Apostle.
J.K. Is there any difference between that and the Mediator?
F.E.R. I think the thought of the Mediator is not quite like Apostle. The Mediator brings God and man together.
A.S.L. You speak of the Apostle as the one who inaugurated the profession and the Priest as the one who sustains it?
F.E.R. Yes, and the Priest is as great as the Apostle.
A.S.L. Would you say that as the Apostle He is alone, and as the Priest He has companions?
F.E.R. As the High Priest He has a house -- as Apostle He is alone.
A.S.L. The One who is the Apostle is the object of worship.
F.E.R. He is entitled to worship. I think it would be a very poor thing if we were not entitled to worship Christ.
Ques. Is it not important that the approach should be equal to the revelation?
F.E.R. I think it is extremely important. It is a wonderful thing that Christ has gone in. As Son He stands simply in relation to God. In another sense you can view Him as having been born in time and in that sense He has companions.
J.S.O. In verse 8 He is saluted as Son, and in verse 9 it says "Thou hast loved ... companions".
F.E.R. I think that has come in as what you may call the moral foundation of the throne. It is a
{195}
throne established in righteousness and hatred of lawlessness.
A.S.L. Do you look upon the companions (verse 9) as priests?
F.E.R. I could not tell exactly but I think it well to keep the thought of priests out of chapter 1. In chapter 1 Christ touches God; in chapter 2 Christ touches man, and then you get the thought of Priest brought in. The throne is established in a Man. It is not yet set forth but it is established in a Man and the basis of it is, "Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity".
A.S.L. Is the approach on our part the approach of those who are priests?
F.E.R. No, the approach of those who are sons. We are priests because we are sons. All the revelation -- the apostolic work -- was done before even Christ became Priest. He could not be a Priest until He went to God when all the apostolic work was done. You must have the throne of God (verse 8). God must be the centre of influence holding everything in its place. You could not have any idea of a moral universe without that. Mr. Darby writes of it: 'Our God the centre is'. It is the centre of a moral universe the influence of which holds everything in its proper orbit.
J.K. Is that the idea of the throne?
F.E.R. Yes.
S.L.J. That is eternal, is it not?
F.E.R. I think it is contemplated here in the world to come. It is eternal, but the world to come is the point of the epistle.
{196}
(2) THE APPROACH EQUAL TO THE REVELATION
@Hebrews 1: 8 - 11; @Hebrews 9: 1 - 28
F.E.R. It is plain that in chapter 1 we get the Apostle and in chapter 2 the High Priest. I think the entire system of the world to come depends on the Priest touching the mercy-seat. Christ has entered in as Priest, but in the very fact of His being the Mercy-Seat of course, the Priest touches the mercy-seat. What it really means is, the approach is equal to the revelation: the revelation is identified with the Apostle, and the approach with the Priest.
J.S.O. You approach by Him who is the revelation.
F.E.R. Exactly. Aaron was not equal to Moses, but now you get the Apostle and High Priest of our profession as one -- Christ Jesus -- you get perfection.
P.R.M. Do you use the term 'touching the mercy-seat' in the sense of identification?
F.E.R. Yes; He goes in as priest but in the very fact of the two being One, the priest touches the mercy-seat.
E.R.C. Does the apostleship cease at the cross?
F.E.R. Well, it holds good now. God *has* spoken but the effect of what has been spoken abides -- it is all maintained. The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth are come to pass by Jesus Christ.
A.S.L. You said the approach is as great as the revelation -- is that in connection with the saints?
F.E.R. The High Priest has gone in, and we are priests in virtue of being kindred to the High Priest -- like the sons of Aaron were kindred to Aaron. It comes out in chapter 2, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren".
{197}
J.S.O. As He is the only way of approach, we come unto Him.
F.E.R. I think so; you get in through Him. "Through Him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". He is the measure in a kind of way, of our approach.
D.L.H. Is not the thought on the one hand of God coming out to man, and on the other of man going in to God?
F.E.R. Yes, but you could not get it brought about apart from Christ -- you can only bring perfection in by Christ.
J.S.O. You would use the word 'approach' a little differently with Christ than with us?
F.E.R. I would indeed, but there is the idea of entering in.
J.S.O. He goes in in all the value of what is accomplished.
F.E.R. Exactly; but then He goes in entirely on our behalf, and that is why it is not without blood. He must go in on the value of redemption. I think people have to distinguish between what you may call the perfection of christianity in itself, and the imperfection of those who profess it. You get the coming outside and the entering inside in perfection in Christ. It is in proportion as man appreciates Christ that he has power to approach.
E.D. On God's side our approach would be equal to Christ's.
P.R.M. It is not as man that He is Apostle?
F.E.R. No: God has spoken by His Son, who is the effulgence of His glory, and the exact expression of His substance, upholding all things by the word of His power.
J.S.O. For the sake of those Hebrew christians to whom he was writing the apostle presents the Son in contrast to all that had gone before.
F.E.R. Exactly. You get the throne, and everything,
{198}
hanging on the Speaker. When everything is changed -- "*Thou* art the Same, and thy years shall not fail".
D.L.H. There is a point of contact in His Person -- He is the Son who is Apostle and the Son who is the Priest.
F.E.R. That there is a point of contact, I quite admit. On the one side He touches God, and on the other side He touches man. In that way you get God and man brought together, and the whole system of the world to come depends upon that.
A.S.L. What is the difference in the thought of mediator and apostle -- they are not the same?
F.E.R. The Mediator is spoken of as between God and man. Hebrews contemplates God taking up a remnant of Israel, but that remnant becomes the church.
E.D. It is the Mediator of the new covenant in Hebrews.
F.E.R. Yes, not the Mediator between God and man.
Ques. Does the thought of Apostle go on to the end of verse 4, chapter 2?
F.E.R. I think so.
M.S'D. Why did you say the apostleship ceased at His death?
F.E.R. I did not say so. I tried to modify it. All the light of God came out at the cross when the veil was rent from top to bottom. The revelation therefore was complete. He could not leave anything else to be revealed.
D.L.H. I think there might be some little misconception as to the meaning of the word 'revelation'. When you use the term you mean the revelation of God?
F.E.R. I mean the revelation of God in His mind and thought toward man.
{199}
D.L.H. Exactly, and it must be pretty clear that there could be nothing left to complete it.
F.E.R. The work of the Apostle was done and the revelation was complete. The system has been inaugurated. The Apostle has inaugurated the system of our profession by the revelation of God.
J.S.O. I suppose the word 'revelation' is in connection with the mystery of God?
F.E.R. It is the mystery of His will which has been hid.
A.S.L. "Has spoken to us in the person of the Son" (verse 2) -- that is the revelation of God?
F.E.R. Yes: the mind of God made known -- and we have to take heed to what we have heard.
S.L.J. Has not the revelation of what christianity is come from the glory? -- we do not get it at the cross.
F.E.R. You do not get anything added to the revelation -- the Holy Spirit added nothing to that. Everything came out when Christ was here. He was the expression in His Person of what God had to say. It culminated in the veil of the temple being rent in twain from top to bottom.
D.L.H. The words here seem to suppose the completeness of the revelation -- "Who, being the effulgence of his glory".
J.S.O. There was no competency to take it in until the Holy Spirit came?
F.E.R. No.
A.S.L. It is generally said that when the veil was rent God came out. Did He not come out fully when Christ was here?
F.E.R. All that Christ did in His service here was in view of His death, but it was in death that God came out fully.
W.J. The Son was the only One competent to set forth God, and the Spirit is the only One competent to make it good in us.
{200}
F.E.R. Exactly. "God commends His love toward us ... Christ died for us" -- there is the expression of the love of God; but then the "love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit". Every detail of the life of the Lord is explained by His death. You could not understand the detail of the gospels except by the death of Christ. All that came out at the cross governed all His ministry. Take for instance "thy sins be forgiven thee"; how can you understand that except by the anticipation of His death? Giving sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and so on, was all an expression of the mercy of God, but it was all lighted up by His death, because He came in to give effect to the mercy of God. Then again, all the time the Lord was here, He would never tolerate anything of man, because in His death He was going to terminate man. On the one hand He was introducing the mercy of God and on the other there was the putting aside all the pretension of man. He went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with Him; but it was not likely that He was going to put any sanction upon man in the flesh, because He was going to put him to death. You will find these principles in everything the Lord did.
W.J. It is remarkable to notice the quotations from the fourth book of Psalms.
F.E.R. The whole of the Hebrews is built up on the Psalms. You get in the Psalms the testimony of the Christ very distinctly.
E.D. Is there any connection between the Apostle and the world to come?
F.E.R. Yes; the epistle all has reference to the world to come. Christ has come in as Apostle, but He comes in as King and Priest also, and that brings in the world to come. The great point of the first chapter is the apostleship. Then the throne comes in;
{201}
you must have security against lawlessness within and enemies without in any country and God is going to establish a universe on that principle. All that transpires here now is allowed in the providence of God -- not in the light of God: but God is going to build up a universe according to the light of God.
W.J. In @Psalm 94 you have the throne of iniquity.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so, and there will be the throne of iniquity when Satan gives his authority to the beast -- "Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?".
H.C.A. The priest maintains for God the company within.
F.E.R. That is during the time of God's providence but when God comes out, then the Priest comes out. In Zechariah we read -- "He shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both" (chapter 6: 13). The church is the vessel of testimony now and the church will be the ruling seat then. Jerusalem on earth had become desolate because it was under law; then it is that God brings in the heavenly Jerusalem which rules over the kings of the earth. The earthly Jerusalem never has the place she had before, but she gets her character from the heavenly Jerusalem.
Ques. Will the Lord come out as Priest because He is Priest after the order of Melchisedec and not after Aaron?
F.E.R. Yes. When Christ comes out. He comes out as King and Priest and He comes out to establish blessing. Moses and Aaron came out to bless the people -- you get the figure of it there.
S.L.J. Is Israel looked upon now as in the city of refuge?
F.E.R. I think so. God provided for the true Israel in the church. Jerusalem on earth was bound to go. Like Moses, he could not enter the land, not
{202}
simply because he failed, but because he represented the principle of law. The old Jerusalem is in bondage with her children, and God puts that aside and brings in the heavenly Jerusalem. In connection with that, what you get in @Isaiah 60 is very beautiful -- it is a challenge to "Arise, shine; for thy light is come". The earthly Jerusalem will be lighted by the heavenly, but she will shine as never before. It is in the heavenly city God shows forth "the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus". The earthly Jerusalem will shine in that light.
J.S.O. And the Sun of righteousness arising with healing in His wings will be through the medium of the heavenly city?
F.E.R. I think so.
D.L.H. What do you understand by the great salvation in the second chapter?
F.E.R. I look upon it as being Christ Himself. Where can you make salvation out except in Christ? You cannot find any escape from the world as it is except in Christ.
Ques. Is not that why it is called a great salvation?
F.E.R. I think so.
Ques. In what sense do we inherit it (end of chapter 1)?
F.E.R. That verse is speaking in a kind of way of what angels were "sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation". It is indefinite. But if you look at salvation as a present thing, Christ must be it, because there is no salvation apart from Christ. What possible outlet is there from the world except by Christ? "By me if any man enter in, he shall be saved". I think the disciples in a sense enjoyed salvation in the presence of Christ. Nothing could harm them. The Lord kept them, and they
{203}
were saved by His presence. I think we are saved by being brought into attachment to Him.
J.S.O. When the Jews refused his word, Paul says -- "For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee ... for salvation unto the ends of the earth", @Acts 13: 47.
F.E.R. That will do, will it not? It is very wide. That is what Christ is to us -- salvation.
Ques. Is there any connection with that in Simeon?
F.E.R. Yes. He took the babe in his arms and said, "Mine eyes have seen thy salvation", @Luke 2: 30.
W.J. It is very interesting in the 80th Psalm, where it is repeated, "Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved".
F.E.R. Yes. That is why the world to come is brought into view here. If you want to be outside the judgment of God, it is by being in attachment to Christ.
J.S.O. Like Noah and his house -- "Come thou and all thy house into the ark".
F.E.R. Exactly.
Ques. In Timothy it speaks of the salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus?
F.E.R. The salvation is in Christ Jesus. Faith is the way you come into it. I think it is that you get out of bondage and you can only do so by being in Christ.
Ques. Salvation is a continuous thing?
F.E.R. Oh yes!
{204}
(3) PRIESTHOOD BASED ON RIGHTEOUSNESS
@Hebrews 2: 5 - 18
F.E.R. In the first chapter we get the thought of Apostle and in connection with that, the throne. In chapter 2 we get the Priest, and in connection with that "all things" -- "Thou has put all things under His feet".
D.L.H. That is as Head, I suppose?
F.E.R. Yes. He tastes death for everything. But then He is crowned with glory and honour and that brings in the thought of priesthood, therefore in the beginning of chapter 3, it is "consider the Apostle and High Priest".
P.R.M. Why does "crowned with glory and honour" bring in the thought of priesthood?
F.E.R. I think the Priest is the One who is Son of man. He is taken from man. In chapter 1 He is the Son of God (much more) but the priest is taken from men -- He is the Son of man; He has to accomplish redemption; then He is crowned with glory and honour. That carries you on to @Psalm 110. Then it is, "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek". It is the One who goes up who is crowned with glory and honour, who is constituted a Priest.
J.S.P. @Psalm 8 would be more a present kind of Melchisedec priesthood?
F.E.R. I think so.
J.S.O. And the point in both chapters is His superiority to angels.
E.D. Then it goes beyond the Psalm although that is alluded to.
F.E.R. It does. There you get "Thou hast put all things under his feet", only this gives its construction
{205}
to it. The world to come is here identified with the whole system of things that comes under the Son of man.
A.S.L. Is there any reason why "crowned with glory and honour" comes in here, it does not come in after tasting death for everything?
F.E.R. That of course connects with the first part of the sentence "We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man".
A.S.L. You do not look upon it as crowned with glory and honour on the way to death?
F.E.R. No. The last part of the verse is linked up with the first part.
J.B. Was there not a sense in which He was crowned with glory and honour in @John 11 and @John 12?
F.E.R. No; crowned with glory and honour is above, that is He is put in the place of Head of the entire system. The Psalm runs, "Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet", @Psalm 8: 5 - 6.
Ques. Could not that be said of Adam?
F.E.R. No, I think the psalm applies to the Son of man in distinction to man. What is said of the Son of man could not be said of Adam. Adam was put over the inferior creation, but the point of the Psalm is that "all things" are brought under the Son of man. "In that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him".
P.R.M. Does that relate to, "Who hast set thy glory above the heavens"?
F.E.R. Yes, in virtue of what He has accomplished the Son of man goes to the right hand of
{206}
God, and is set over the works of God's hands. It is the great answer to what Satan did down here. Man is corrupted by angels and the Son of man is God's answer to it all. The Son of man goes to heaven and Satan is cast out as lightning from heaven, God establishes the Son of man over all the works of His hands upon the ground of redemption. I look upon it as being the great triumph of God.
J.S.O. So "crowned with glory and honour" would be in respect of redemption.
F.E.R. I think so.
J.S.O. Mr. Darby gives a note, 'But we see Jesus who on account of the suffering of death was made a little lower than the angels crowned with glory and honour'.
F.E.R. That is it. Man lost the place which God had put him in to a large extent and the thing was never redeemed until redemption was accomplished and the Son of man exalted.
S.L.J. But you do not mean Satan is cast out of heaven yet?
F.E.R. No, what I mean is, he is cast out of heaven consequent upon the Son of man going into heaven. The man-child is taken up to heaven and war takes place, and Satan is cast out of heaven with his angels. It is the fact of the man-child being caught up to God and His throne which is the prelude to Satan and his angels being cast out. The Lord, I think, foresaw that in @Luke 10.
H.C.A. I suppose the lowest point must be touched before the highest point can be brought out?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it has been rightly said that the exaltation is commensurate with the humiliation.
Ques. What relation has this to the world to come?
F.E.R. It is the world to come that is in view. The world to come means everything put under the Son of man. It is not yet displayed but what we
{207}
do see is Jesus crowned with glory and honour. The moment has not yet come for display. The latter part of the chapter explains that for the moment God is bringing many sons to glory. The world to come is not put under angels but under the Son of man. Then it goes on to speak of @Psalm 8 which does not simply mean the world to come but "all things".
Ques. Did the Jews understand the expression? They said, "Who is this Son of man?"
F.E.R. No; I think it was an enigma to them, though they ought to have known.
A.S.L. What is the meaning of the expression in @Romans 3 -- that "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" in connection with this question of glory?
F.E.R. I think the whole universe which God intends to display will be lighted up with the glory of God. God is making that now the standard of everything. It is not the point that men have failed on the ground of responsibility but they have come short of the glory of God.
H.C.A. I suppose the "crowned with glory and honour" is now?
F.E.R. Yes. It says lower down, "For it became him ... in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings".
H.C.A. How do you understand that -- "It became him"?
F.E.R. I think it was what was according to His glory.
J.S.O. Morally suitable. If He was to take this place He should be perfect through suffering.
F.E.R. Yes.
S.L.J. Does not the "whom" refer to God? (verse 10).
{208}
F.E.R. Yes. The thought of God's bringing many sons to glory, and it was according to His glory that the Captain of their salvation should be made perfect through suffering.
A.S.L. What is the idea of glory -- a place?
F.E.R. Not exactly place -- glory is the climax. Perfection connects itself with glory -- the perfection of His purpose. You could not get priesthood without suffering, because all priesthood must be based on redemption -- on righteousness. Mr. Darby pointed that out over and over again -- priesthood must be founded on righteousness. The Priest must stand on the basis of redemption, because he has not to say to us about our sins -- that point has to be entirely settled before you can touch priesthood.
H.C.A. Do you take the word "perfect" to mean that it was necessary that He should go that way of suffering, so that He might come into the place?
F.E.R. Yes -- being made perfect, He could take up the position.
J.S.O. He was to do all that was required to be initiated into the office.
F.E.R. That is the idea.
Ques. Does the word "perfect" refer to salvation?
F.E.R. It has reference to our salvation, because He is the Captain of our salvation. The Captain of our salvation had to be made perfect through suffering. He has not got to say to us about sins now, but He brings us into salvation.
E.D. What is the force of the word "Captain"?
F.E.R. Leader. The point is, it is impossible for anybody to realise salvation except in Christ Himself. The more we become attached to Christ, the more we grow to salvation.
J.S.O. Would there be a shadow of difference between leader and high priest; is leader more like Joshua?
{209}
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. Christ is the only One outside the condition of things in which the devil operates -- hence salvation is only known in Him.
Ques. What are the sufferings referred to in verse 10?
F.E.R. They are connected with the atonement.
W.B. Would you exclude all other sufferings?
F.E.R. I think so. He "was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death" (verse 9). It is all based on that. Then it is, He became perfect through sufferings.
W.B. It also says He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.
F.E.R. That is Himself. Priesthood must be based on righteousness. That is what I understand by, "It became him, for whom are all things". It would be impossible for God to bring many sons to glory without laying a foundation of righteousness. Therefore it became Him to make Him perfect through sufferings.
J.S.O. I thought of His suffering in connection with His being able to sympathise, but perhaps you get that later.
F.E.R. Yes, but then it says "to make propitiation for the sins of the people". I think that the prominent thought is that the priesthood should be based on righteousness.
Ques. Has the crowning with glory and honour any reference to Aaron being clothed with the garments of glory and beauty?
F.E.R. It may have. It has been sometimes said that Aaron never put those garments on -- he was forbidden to go into the holiest. The fact is, until Christ, no one could put those garments on.
Ques. Why were they made?
F.E.R. You get a perfect setting forth of the divine mind in every part of the tabernacle and its furniture, and the clothing and dress of the priests.
{210}
Moses had to make all those things for a testimony. God gave a testimony of things that should come afterwards.
S.L.J. It says they were put on Aaron on the day of his consecration.
F.E.R. Then they were never put on afterwards. Everything must be on the ground of righteousness. God has got to consult Himself in regard to the universe, and there would be no security for permanence of anything except on the ground of righteousness.
W.B. Of course, you must connect righteousness with God's acts.
F.E.R. It is not only that, but divine righteousness is really the first principle of the universe. What can possibly be right if God has not got His rights? Any universe must be based on God's righteousness. The abstract principle of righteousness existed long before God made the world. Angels must be governed by the righteousness of God.
H.C.A. That is the basis of the exaltation of Christ -- Thou "hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness" (chapter 1).
F.E.R. Yes, because that is the basis on which the throne is established. Any one can understand righteousness if they put it in contrast to lawlessness. In any universe where lawlessness exists, things must be put out of gear. It would be a very poor thing if lawlessness existed in the solar system. The psalmist said, when he looked up to heaven -- the heavens declare the glory of God.
D.L.H. So it brings in the thought of rule?
F.E.R. Yes, what I understand by righteousness is the rights of God, and the rights of God rule. God is entitled to the supreme place in the affection of any intelligent creature. Who could gainsay that for a moment?
{211}
A.S.L. Does it necessarily suppose the existence of evil to speak of righteousness.
F.E.R. No, not at all. Righteousness implies the rights of God. I would speak of lawlessness as a relative term, but if sin or lawlessness had never come in, righteousness would not have been relative. Who can doubt for a moment that before ever this world was made at all, holy angels had regard to the righteousness of God. They fulfilled beyond all doubt the principles of the law -- "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God ...".
A.S.L. Was the question of righteousness never in the garden of Eden before the fall?
F.E.R. I think it was. It did not come into prominence until sin came out.
J.S.O. It is very important to notice that there must be either righteousness or lawlessness.
F.E.R. Sin is lawlessness -- departure from rule. Man passed out of the moral rule of God. Then you can very well understand that the first thought of God has been to bring back man under His moral sway, therefore the first principle of the gospel is the kingdom of God.
D.L.H. If sin or lawlessness is departure from rule, that shows that rule must have been before the departure.
F.E.R. Quite so.
A.S.L. In the eternal state righteousness will ever be prominent. It will dwell then and there will be no evil.
F.E.R. Quite so.
H.A.A. I suppose lawlessness means a man is out of attachment.
F.E.R. Yes, like a wandering star.
H.C.A. That characterises the present day.
F.E.R. I do not think anybody can look abroad at the present day without seeing it.
{212}
A.S.L. When it says, "Thou hast loved righteousness" and "anointed thee ... above thy fellows" (chapter 1: 9) does that refer to His place amongst His own before the work was finished or in resurrection?
F.E.R. I think it is the place He has in His system of "all things". I take it that the Lord will have companions in heaven and it is possible that He will have companions upon earth. You get the elect company who follow the Lamb, in Revelation.
E.R. I suppose the cross was the greatest testimony of His having loved righteousness and hated lawlessness?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. Everything was in accord with the cross. That is one of the interesting points in connection with the Lord. Every act of the Lord's ministry was in connection with the cross. The great end of the cross was to establish righteousness. He gave full place to the rights of God. But then on the other hand He himself took the place of the lawless man to abolish lawlessness, because He hated it. He had to take the place of what He hated.
E.D. Is it summed up in that petition in the Lord's prayer -- "Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven"?
F.E.R. I think so. By coming in to assert the rights of God, He takes away the sin of the world.
Ques. He undoes the works of the devil?
F.E.R. Yes, because the works of the devil have been to a large extent to entangle the world. Take any man, there are things that are very beautiful. One must be very blind if he does not trace in man something of the creation of God. Look at the affection of a mother for a child -- man and wife -- that is not the devil, it is of God; but the terrible thing is that what is of God has been mixed up with lawlessness. The whole thing is spoiled by man having passed from under the moral rule of God.
{213}
J.S.O. The Lord recognised it in the young ruler.
F.E.R. Yes. The point of recovery was right there before him, but he was not prepared to follow Him.
Ques. How do you understand the 11th and 12th verses?
F.E.R. We are the ones set apart for holy use and evidently Christ is the One who sets apart -- the Sanctifier and sanctified *all of one*, that is the most remarkable part of it -- "all of one".
H.C.A. There must be the exclusion of lawlessness there.
F.E.R. I think so. Properly speaking, the moment a person is brought into attachment there is an end of lawlessness in principle. I mean attachment in the sense of bond, but it works into affection.
W.B. How does the figure of the heavens come in where it says "Abide in me"?
F.E.R. Well, I think you must accept the responsibility to abide as long as things are as they are down here. "Whosoever abideth in him" (you get that remarkable word) "sinneth not".
A.S.L. Do you take this "all of one" to be on the same line as abiding in Him?
F.E.R. It is the same principle, but the best thing I know is the figure employed in Scripture -- Aaron and his sons -- they were all of one. You can take a man up on the ground of his profession. A man may profess to be in Christ but the abiding is the test of it. For instance, we read, "You ... hath he reconciled ... if ye continue in the faith".
E.D. Also in @1 John 2 it is "He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked".
F.E.R. Yes, we must allow responsibility as long as we are down here.
E.R. The great point is to be kept in the spirit of dependence.
{214}
F.E.R. I think so. We are brought into attachment to Christ and the object of it is that we might bring forth fruit unto God. The object of the Spirit is to create affection.
J.S.O. That is a very important point.
F.E.R. All affection is dependent on the Spirit because the Spirit makes us so sensible of the attraction in Christ. I suspect there are very few christians who have any adequate idea of the attraction that is in Christ. I think we so poorly appreciate Christ because we are so little aware of the attraction that is in Him. To qualify you for service, you want what is spoken of in Ephesians -- "to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith".
{215}
(4) RESPONSIBILITY CONNECTED WITH THE HOUSE
@Hebrews 3: 1 - 19
F.E.R. We have had the Apostle and High Priest before us in chapters 1 and 2 so that the writer can ask for consideration of Him in those two characters.
Ques. What does the term profession take in?
F.E.R. There was the Jewish profession, and now there is the christian profession. Christianity is a certain kind of profession -- we profess certain things. So judaism in the same way was a certain profession of which Moses and Aaron were the apostle and the high priest. In christianity you come to finality -- Christ. I do not think there will be any profession when the Lord comes, but while He is absent there is a profession.
Ques. Have not some told us it should be confession?
F.E.R. I do not mind if it is profession or confession.
Ques. What we confess as christians?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Is it not something like 'the faith'?
F.E.R. There is confession of certain things which we esteem to be the truth or the faith, if you will, because the faith and the truth are pretty much equivalent.
Ques. Does that involve the house?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. What is the difference between the house here and in 1 Timothy?
F.E.R. I do not know any.
Ques. Not as to aspect?
F.E.R. No; I think the thought of the house is brought into this chapter to lay a proper basis of
{216}
responsibility. I doubt if you get an adequate idea of responsibility if the thought of the house is not brought in.
Rem. It is a little more structural in Timothy; here the thought is taken up from Israel.
Ques. Is the thought God's house all through, or does it bring in the thought of Christ's house?
F.E.R. Oh no, it is God's house all through; Mr. Darby pointed that out long ago. Moses was faithful in all God's house. I take it that God's house was Israel; you could not make that Aaron's house. Moses was faithful in contrast to Aaron's unfaithfulness. Israel was God's house -- God dwelt in Israel. The object of making the tabernacle was that God might dwell among them, and Israel had the place provisionally, at all events, of being God's house.
Rem. Aaron's house brings in the idea of kindred.
F.E.R. Yes, the great thought in connection with the house of God is that God dwells there. I think it is all to bring in what it says after verse 7. God's house is brought in really to lay a proper foundation of responsibility. Christendom has lost sight entirely of the presence of the Spirit, but the Spirit of God has a voice here -- He could not possibly be dwelling here without having a voice. I think that involves the responsibility of those who compose the house. The moment the house is brought in it says, "Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts".
Ques. Have you responsibility in respect to the Son?
F.E.R. I think so, because He is over the house. I think the Spirit always maintains responsibility to Christ.
Ques. Would you say that the house comprises all who make a profession of christianity?
{217}
F.E.R. No, there is an 'if'. People may have a certain place in christianity professedly, but they must reckon with the 'if'. There are hosts of people in the profession of christianity, but I would not say they were in the house of God.
Ques. Do not they belong to the responsible body?
F.E.R. I think they belong to the church looked at as a responsible body, but I would not say they belong to the house. They have to reckon with the 'if'.
Ques. Is that apostasy?
F.E.R. I think so, in the real force of it. The Spirit of God dwells in what Christ has built.
Rem. But you cannot separate the fact that we are all on one common platform.
F.E.R. That is what I should call external christianity; we are all on one common platform there, but the Spirit of God dwells in the house which Christ built, not which man builds. Christ built a spiritual house, and the Spirit of God dwells there; only being composed of people down here, you may get a lot of people added professedly who have not any part in it at all.
Rem. Scripture always treats people as christians until they prove themselves otherwise.
F.E.R. I think so; but I think it keeps clear the idea of what is really of God, and what Christ has built.
Ques. When a person is baptised do they come into the place where the Holy Spirit dwells?
F.E.R. No, they come into the precincts of the house.
Ques. How do we gain entrance into the house?
F.E.R. By the Spirit.
Ques. What force do you give to the words, "And it filled all the house where they were sitting"? @Acts 2.
F.E.R. I think that is the actual house.
{218}
Ques. You will admit that the idea of the Spirit dwelling in the individual is different to the Spirit abiding in the house?
F.E.R. Oh yes, it is a different idea altogether. For instance, the Lord was the temple, but at the same time He was the anointed Man to preach the gospel. He was the temple, God was there, the oracles were there, but I think you get quite a distinct thought in Luke, where He is presented as the anointed Man to diffuse the light -- to preach the gospel. The Spirit of God dwells in you, the temple; but then the church as the body is quite a distinct thought; there you get the diffusion of light.
Ques. But do you not think of the union of the members?
F.E.R. When the thought of the body is brought in, the thought of the gifts is brought in too, for the diffusion of the light. In John's gospel Christ is the temple. In Luke's gospel He is the anointed Man to preach. Both things are true, but they are two distinct thoughts. The Spirit of God to instruct us has drawn figures from human things.
Rem. The idea of the temple is more connected with oracles.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The house I think is brought in in connection with behaviour -- that a man may know how to behave himself.
Rem. Take Ananias and Sapphira for a moment -- apart from the question whether they were converted or not; Peter charges them with not lying unto man, but to the Holy Spirit. It is not difficult to see that they were in the house.
F.E.R. I would not say they were there or not there; they were responsible to the Holy Spirit. God takes up people on the ground they take up. If you ask me what is really the house of God, I should say it is composed of those who are baptised by the Holy Spirit. It is a curious thing that the house of
{219}
God is never brought in in connection with any particular epistle. It is only brought in in the catholic epistles. It is a general idea and is not brought in an epistle to any particular church.
Rem. You get it in Ephesians: Jew and gentile builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit.
F.E.R. But I think that is more the thought of Jew and gentile. Christ had to gather together in one the children of God scattered abroad. The spiritual house is evidently a general idea, and Peter writes to the saints scattered abroad.
Ques. Did not the Lord take up the temple as God's house?
F.E.R. He did; He owned it as long as God owned it, but at the same time, morally, the house was superseded by Himself.
Ques. Is it not possible to do something analogous to that recorded in @John 2, and make the house of God into a house of merchandise today?
F.E.R. I think that is what man has done in regard to the temple, at all events in regard to what has been entrusted in his hands. God allows things to work so that people become apostate. They will ruin themselves. I think that one of the most remarkable things in Scripture is the harlot riding the beast.
Ques. That is before the apostasy?
F.E.R. No, I should think it is after the apostasy. The harlot is a harlot and shews that she is Babylonish; and I have not the shadow of a doubt that popery is Babylonish, which means man's glory, idolatry too, It is a remarkable thing in the present day that people are losing their horror of popery. In this country it does not come out in its true character, it adapts itself to the state of things, but I am sure people are losing their horror of it although it is perfectly devilish
{220}
Rem. I have thought it one of the most striking things of late that statesmen are awfully ignorant of what they are trifling with.
Ques. Is discipline connected with the house?
F.E.R. It is connected with the local assembly. The local assembly has its responsibility.
Ques. In @1 Corinthians 5 where it says, "Purge out the old leaven", do you get the idea of the body there?
F.E.R. No.
Rem. It has been said, 'Keep the house of God clean'.
F.E.R. I will tell you what I should try and keep clean -- keep your fellowship clean. If we have come into the place of christian fellowship we are responsible that our fellowship is according to God.
Rem. Then it does say, "Remove ... from amongst yourselves", it does bring that element in.
F.E.R. "Amongst yourselves"; people come into christian fellowship and they have their responsibility in connection with the fellowship.
Ques. Is it like the unleavened bread -- the feast of unleavened bread was to be throughout the dispensation?
F.E.R. Yes, I think they had to prove the unleavened by purging out the leavened.
Ques. Would it be right to say that the house of God is commensurate with the body?
F.E.R. I do not think there is anything outside the house of God that is not outside the Spirit of God. I think we want to maintain thoughts of that kind in their own proper character.
Rem. It is a great thing to get the divine idea before the mind.
F.E.R. I think so.
Rem. Only I think a good deal has come from the type used in 2 Timothy, "A great house".
{221}
F.E.R. Christendom is the great house, but at the same time I do not see that Paul ever said a word about the house of God in the second epistle. He does speak about the house of God in the first epistle.
Ques. When the Lord says, "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of robbers" (@Matthew 21: 13) does He not shew that He speaks of the temple as to what was according to God?
F.E.R. Yes, it is in the power of man to corrupt christianity, but I do not think it is in the power of man to corrupt what is of the Holy Spirit.
Rem. But you have in @1 Corinthians 3, "If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy".
F.E.R. I think they were corrupting real christians. That is what popery has done -- attempted to corrupt real christians. I look upon corrupters as being unconverted men, but their wickedness is in corrupting what is of God.
Ques. When it says, "Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died", would that be corrupting?
F.E.R. I think the point is that he would destroy by apostasy. The person was not exactly a corrupter; Corinthians is much beyond that -- the corrupter is a wicked person who brings in defiling principles by which real christians might be affected.
Ques. What do you mean by apostasy?
F.E.R. A man who has given up the name of Christ. I think there are many steps on the way to it, but in result they mean giving up all. When the thing is in its early stage it is difficult to detect, but I think sometimes you can see the cloven hoof; that is why it is judgment begins at the house of God. It is discipline -- judgment in the sense of chastening.
{222}
Corrupting principles come in and discipline comes in to check it. The house of God here in @Hebrews 3 is a very large thought -- it is the church, provisionally, but I have no doubt it is the universe. "He who has built all things is God". God intends to make the universe His dwelling-place.
Rem. The tabernacle was a picture of that undoubtedly.
F.E.R. I think it is one of the most wonderful things you can imagine that when God took up a nation on the ground of redemption He set forth His purpose in regard to the universe in figurative representations.
Ques. How does that come out in detail?
F.E.R. You get the holiest of all; then all that is connected with Israel, then all that is outside the precincts. Heaven is the holiest of all. You get all things in connection with Israel in the holy place; then there is the court of the tabernacle which brings in all that is outside.
Ques. In the millennium?
F.E.R. Yes, I think the wonderful thing about the tabernacle is that for the moment everything was covered by Christ. If you come to think what Christ was under the eye of God down here -- He comprehended a universe.
Ques. I suppose "Holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling" would be in contrast to Israel?
F.E.R. I think so. It brings in the heavenly calling. The High Priest has gone in -- the approach is as great as the revelation -- it is perfection. Aaron was not equal to Moses, and after all Moses was not the Ark of the Covenant and the Mercy-Seat: Christ is that; then the High Priest is Christ, so you have got perfection, and you can go on to perfection. My impression is that we are not sufficiently in the good of the revelation; if we were we should have
{223}
access according to Christ. "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father".
Ques. What value do we get in the expression "Who is faithful to him that has constituted him"?
F.E.R. Christ is the house of God and He will maintain it according to God. It is no good our thinking that Christ will accommodate Himself to us, we have to accommodate ourselves to Him.
Ques. I suppose that is what is meant by behaving ourselves in the house of God?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. All the rest of the chapter is really in connection with the 'if' in verse 6?
F.E.R. Yes, you have the Holy Spirit now: "Wherefore as the Holy Spirit saith".
Ques. When you have the thought of God's house does it imply God's household?
F.E.R. Yes; the Spirit of God is there, and I think you are responsible to listen to Him. I think you get the steps of departure marked here at the end of this chapter. The first thing is "provoked", then the next step is "sinned", and finally "unbelief", verses 16 - 19. The deadly thing is unbelief -- that is the real meaning of apostasy. We have provoked God many a time, but the deadly thing is unbelief. "See ... lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from the living God".
Ques. I suppose that no one who has the Spirit could apostatise?
F.E.R. Oh no. I think young christians have got to look to it tremendously how far they countenance lawlessness. Lawlessness is exactly the opposite of abiding in Christ. I am sure young people to a very large extent are lawless in a great many things they do -- in what they read and where they go; if they are not abiding in Christ they are lawless, and I am sure lawlessness is very deadly to our walk.
{224}
Ques. Is that why we are to exhort one another?
F.E.R. Yes, "Lest any ... be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin". Sin is lawlessness. You have a continual living voice of warning: "The Spirit speaks expressly". He warns of things which may come in, not only of the things which have come in. When people cultivate lawlessness, do you think they will be very sensitive to the voice of the Spirit? I know they will not. Nothing will deaden people to the voice of the Spirit more than the occupation of the mind with what I call triviality.
Ques. In the end, I suppose, falling in the wilderness?
F.E.R. Very likely. I know when we came into fellowship it was a pretty settled thing that we abandoned what we went on with before -- athletics, light reading, and all that kind of thing.
Rem. Not as being under any obligation, but because you had something better.
F.E.R. Well, I think so. The Spirit is a still small voice, and the Spirit is excessively sensitive.
Rem. I felt one could not go on with those things and Christ too.
F.E.R. Now there is a great effort to go on with those things and Christ, and I am sure it is a dead failure.
Rem. The thing ought to be a good deal laid upon our hearts; they are the rising generation.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I always look upon my children in two ways, as a father and as a brother. As a father I should like to see them all in fellowship, but as a brother I am not quite so sure.
Rem. I have heard it said that there is so little for young people among us. I think it is well to mention it; the expression, though I thought I understood it, grated on my ears a good deal, because, if there is Christ, Christ is good enough for young people just as much as old people.
{225}
Rem. Still there is a certain way of ministering Christ to the state and measure of souls. I have heard a similar remark many a time.
F.E.R. You will never make Christ pleasing to the natural man.
Rem. That is really the secret -- that is true.
{226}
(5) THE PRESENT IS A TIME OF EXERCISE
@Hebrews 4: 1 - 16
F.E.R. There are points of similarity between our position, and the position of Israel. At the same time there are strong points of contrast.
D.L.H. But we are put to the test like Israel.
F.E.R. I think that is so. The first question is in a certain sense a point of similarity -- "Who was it, who, having heard, provoked? but was it not all who came out of Egypt by Moses?"
C-I.B. In what way similar?
F.E.R. I suppose we have come out of Egypt. It was a people who were on the ground of God's deliverance who provoked. The same may be true in regard to us.
Rem. It was they who fell in the wilderness.
F.E.R. Yes, and the principle of it was, they did not hearken to the word.
Ques. Where is the contrast?
F.E.R. They were brought out of Egypt by Moses, and the point of contrast in those spoken of in the epistle is that they had fled for refuge. That was the position of the Hebrews, and our position too, to a certain extent.
D.L.H. We have had the gospel preached to us as they had a gospel preached to them.
F.E.R. Yes, we are in the same position in that sense.
E.R. Would the gospel take in the purpose of God?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
C-I.B. I suppose the contrast is that there is One who has entered into His rest?
F.E.R. Well, I suppose so. Israel had been taken up after the flesh, but these had not been taken up
{227}
after the flesh. If there were not a point of contrast in that way, it would really be a repetition of what had been, which certainly God never intended. I think there are two great tests to which we are subjected. One is the presence of the Spirit, and the other is the glad tidings. You get the one in chapter 3 and the other in chapter 4.
E.R. In what way are we tested as to the Spirit?
F.E.R. I think it is by the voice of the Spirit -- "Wherefore as the Holy Spirit saith". If we are God's house and the Spirit is there, we have to listen to the voice of the Spirit. I think christendom has failed entirely in regard to that test, having disregarded almost entirely the presence of the Spirit. The consequence is, they have hardened their hearts. Apostasy has set in to a very large extent, because they have practically ignored the presence of the Spirit.
Rem. It is very striking that in 1 Timothy where the house of God is spoken of, it is immediately followed by "The Spirit speaks expressly".
F.E.R. Yes; and so in the third chapter of this epistle -- you have to listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit.
P.R.M. Why is the Spirit brought in before faith in the report?
Rem. I did not think the Hebrews were brought into blessing by faith in the report.
F.E.R. No, they had fled for refuge -- it is more that kind of idea.
D.L.H. You get the same order in other places -- for instance @2 Thessalonians 2: 13 -- "Salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth".
F.E.R. You really never get faith in the truth characteristically except by the Spirit.
D.L.H. Will you please explain that. I think there are difficulties in a good many minds in regard to
{228}
that, for we have understood that you get faith first, and then the Spirit.
F.E.R. Faith is a characteristic -- "The just shall live by faith" -- and faith characteristically is by the Spirit. I think every man is responsible to believe in the testimony that God addressed to men, but when you come to look at faith, as a characteristic, you must have the Spirit.
D.L.H. What about the Old Testament folk -- those who lived by faith?
F.E.R. I think God helped them, everything was in view of the time when He would give the Spirit.
D.L.G. In that way anticipating in some sort?
F.E.R. Exactly. Whatever this life was, they lived by faith -- "The just shall live by faith". I think in all that they were divinely supported. God has just as much regard for them as for us, and there cannot be a doubt for a moment that God supported them. Faith is simply a fruit of the Spirit.
W.B. Do we not receive the Spirit on the principle of faith?
F.E.R. Yes, you must believe God's testimony. Man must believe the report -- God gives him grace to do so; but the Spirit becomes the spring and source of faith. Faith is a fruit of the Spirit.
D.L.H. That scripture makes it quite plain -- that faith is a fruit of the Spirit.
F.E.R. Every man is responsible to believe God's testimony, and God gives man grace to believe it. Then the Spirit is given and faith is characteristic of the principle of life in that way. It is a fruit of the Spirit. Anyone can see it is one thing to believe a testimony which God addressed to man and another thing for faith to be the principle of man's living. Now, for instance, faith is the substantiating of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. It is the principle of our life.
{229}
Ques. Would you say the Old Testament saints were helped by the Spirit? David said "Take not thy holy spirit from me".
F.E.R. Undoubtedly they were helped by the Spirit.
Ques. The first aspect, I suppose, would be the obedience of faith?
F.E.R. No, I think the obedience of faith is the test of faith. That is really the place of the Scriptures -- the test of faith.
W.B. Is not the first time that it is mentioned in @Genesis 15? "Abraham believed God".
F.E.R. Yes.
W.B. Well, that was a faith that was grounded on a divine work.
F.E.R. Quite so, he believed what God said to him. "Sanctification ... and belief of the truth" (the latter follows upon the first) "whereunto he called you by our gospel". I think the great thing is to apprehend what God has in view in regard to man -- that men should receive the gift of the Spirit. Everything has its source and spring in the Spirit. You get expressions such as "faith in Christ Jesus". That is not exactly faith in Christ Jesus as the object of faith, but faith in Christ Jesus is characteristic of the christian.
P.R.M. Is the "report" here by the Spirit on the day of Pentecost?
F.E.R. We have no report of the land of promise except by the Holy Spirit.
W.B. But is not that report found in the Holy Scriptures?
F.E.R. No, it is recorded but not reported. It is reported by the Spirit. The Spirit has come to bring report of Christ in the land of promise -- that is what I take the report to be.
W.B. That reached people through the gospel?
{230}
F.E.R. Yes; but I think it goes beyond the gospel of the grace of God.
W.B. Yes, but "Whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel".
F.E.R. But the truth of the gospel covers everything. Evidently, it is as easy as possible to see that the Holy Spirit has brought down a report of Christ in relation to the world to come. The Lord Himself gave commission that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name, but the Holy Spirit has brought in something different -- He has brought in the light of Christ in relation to the land of promise.
Ques. Would "faith" in the gospel of John be characteristic?
F.E.R. Always, from beginning to end, it is characteristic of the person. It is the believing person all through John's gospel. The term "gospel" is a little too conventional -- it is "glad tidings". Hebrews occupies a very peculiar place, and you cannot put the Jews exactly on the same platform as the gentiles. The announcement to the gentiles was "repentance and forgiveness of sins" but the Jews had "fled for refuge". They take up in a way the position of the man-slayer -- they had been the man-slayer.
C-I.B. That makes Hebrews rather difficult for the gentiles.
F.E.R. It is difficult for the gentiles. They have not been guilty of crucifying Christ but they have come under the guilt of blood and they are those who have "fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us".
Ques. "We which have believed do enter into rest" -- what is the "rest"?
F.E.R. I think it is the purpose of God in regard to believers, that they should enter into rest. It is really God's rest in regard to His works.
{231}
D.D.H. Then in the full application of that, it must refer to the world to come.
F.E.R. Undoubtedly. It refers to the seventh day. The seventh day has been a very long day, because it has never had its completion yet.
C-I.B. The seventh day is the day in which God will be able to bring everything under the new covenant?
F.E.R. I think so, and it will be a time when God will have complete complacency in everything. The Israel of God will enter into God's rest beyond all doubt.
H.C.A. I suppose everything in the rest of God takes its commencement in Christ?
F.E.R. I think it does, and where God will find His complacency is in gathering up everything in Christ. So the Lord Jesus is spoken of as the beginning of the creation of God, and if He is the beginning, He is also the crown of the creation of God. When He comes in as the true Witness -- as the beginning of the creation of God, then it will be that God will find complacency in all His works. The rest of God is dependent on Christ filling all things and the one who enters into that, enters into His rest. If Christ is capable of filling a heart that was once estranged from Him, I think He is capable of filling a universe.
C-I.B. Because all hearts are alike.
F.E.R. Yes.
C-I.B. Then did He not bring in a rest constantly in the Old Testament?
F.E.R. Well, the Lord Jesus said in @Matthew 11 -- "Come unto me ... and I will give you rest". If I had the capability of entering into the thought morally that Christ is capable of filling "all things" then I think I should enter into His rest morally.
D.L.H. The great conclusion here is -- "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God"
{232}
and however one might enter into it morally, it remains.
F.E.R. Well, one very good thing is this -- the present is a time of exercise. Some may be quite exceptional christians, but at the same time they need exercise.
Ques. Would there be some allusion here to Joshua and Caleb -- "we which have believed do enter into rest"?
F.E.R. Caleb and Joshua did not enter into rest -- the point is, faith characterises those who enter into rest. Hebrews goes on the ground of "He that shall come will come, and will not tarry". So it says "Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation". It does not go on the ground of anticipation of death but of the coming of the Lord, and the coming of the Lord will bring in the rest of God. I think the present is a time of exercise, and when people get out of the way of exercise it is an uncommonly bad lookout for them.
C-I.B. Does not God put exercise in our way?
F.E.R. Well, I think some seem to have little of it. If you get people who are callous and indifferent, I think the word of God will not always prove itself a test to them.
Ques. What is the special character of the word of God here?
F.E.R. It is what the word of God is morally -- it is God in the expression of Himself. When God expresses His mind, you may depend upon it it is His word, and it will detect everything in you.
D.L.H. It seems to me to come a little more on that side, than on the side of nourishment and blessing -- it is more to expose and discover what is unsuitable.
F.E.R. Yes. The point is the word of God brings God to you -- "All things are naked and opened unto
{233}
the eyes of him with whom we have to do". God brings Himself to you in all that He is morally. In the word of God, God comes out in mercy. Suppose you do not show mercy, you will be detected. If a man does not follow righteousness -- God comes out in righteousness, and he will be detected. Suppose a man is bent on self-pleasing, or has some particular object before him -- God has not pleased Himself; He has come out, if I may use the expression, in the sacrifice of Himself, and that man would thereby be detected.
E.R. It is the greatest blessing to be detected.
F.E.R. I think so.
E.R. The point is we are detected to ourselves.
F.E.R. No.
Rem. Actions expose you to others.
F.E.R. Exactly. All that kind of thing tends to a good bit of exercise in the course of the christian. In this is the life of the Spirit in a kind of way. The great object of it all is that you may be in accord with God, "holy and without blame before him in love". I think it is very wonderful that the word of God should come in in that way. It is so morally perfect that it will detect everything in us.
Ques. How far are you referring to the Scriptures when you speak of the word of God?
F.E.R. I am referring to the word of God morally. My point is that you want to get into contact with God and all that God is morally. What you have to take account of is that you have the Spirit of truth. You would never get anything whatever detected if you had not the Spirit of truth.
E.R. In that way it is "quick, and powerful"?
F.E.R. Yes, because it is really God in you dividing asunder soul and spirit (that is, what you may call the animal and moral), discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart. One knows how much there is in one, in object and purpose, that
{234}
is contrary to God. One is very often bent on self-pleasing, and that kind of thing -- having some ulterior motive in doing a good thing. You must accept the searching power of the word of God because the great point of it is that you may be morally according to God. You could not conceive of a greater thing being brought about in a man down here.
Ques. Would the effect of that be to cast you upon the Priest?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
D.L.H. Then the priesthood is not connected with all these evil motives but with the helping of a person who is really anxious to get on the right road?
F.E.R. Yes, it has regard to infirmities, not to sins.
H.C.A. It is interesting to see that the exposing of motives does not make you lose confidence in God, rather the reverse.
F.E.R. Yes. I find in all that I do, though one does not want to speak about oneself, there is a tinge of self-pleasing.
E.R. How do you get comfort in regard to that?
F.E.R. You do not get any comfort in regard to it. I am only thankful that God exposes it.
H.C.A. I suppose you do not get the help of the Priest in regard to infirmity whenever you act yourself by the grace of God on a right line, you are sure to get help in yourself.
Ques. Was Peter an example when he said, "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord"?
F.E.R. Yes, he really was exposed by God and the Lord helped him.
W.B. But an exposure of that kind is always accompanied more or less with a revelation of grace, so that while you are convicted, you are led to confide in the One who has convicted you.
{235}
F.E.R. There is no expression of God apart from grace. The word of God exposes but it brings in immediately the grace of God. Grace is the essential characteristic of the word of God. "The new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness". It is a new creation. You could not get that brought about without the exposure of yourself. You could not have put on the new man without having put off the old. The character of the old man has been detected in a man, and he appreciates the new man. That is the truth in @Ephesians 4: 22 - 24. What could be more wonderful than that we should be morally according to God -- it is inconceivable.
J.McK. I suppose it comes out in chapter 3?
F.E.R. Yes. You take the ablest men of this world, there cannot be a doubt of their very great natural powers and capabilities, but then if you put things in comparison, the moral thing is very much greater than the natural; and the divine idea is that man should be according to God morally -- not simply in faculties.
Ques. Is that why the Priest is the Son of God?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. God's idea about them was that they should be a kingdom of priests, and they had to learn the character of their calling. We learn it now in the Son of God.
D.L.H. Will you say a word about the throne of grace?
F.E.R. I think the throne of grace depends upon your having the good of the word. Grace is enthroned in the heart of the christian; if you have not the sense of that, you will hardly come to the throne of grace.
D.L.H. It gives the idea of supremacy of grace.
F.E.R. That is the idea -- you must have a sense of that. Grace must be enthroned in your heart else you will not come to the throne of grace.
{236}
I think it is all consequent upon the place which Christ has with God on our behalf. But then if a man is going to avail himself of all that, he wants grace enthroned in his heart. It is the moral idea, and really indicates that grace is supreme.
Ques. Do you mean he is governed by grace?
F.E.R. No, but I think in itself, grace is supreme. Grace has carried men through anything and everything.
Ques. What about the 'mercy' -- does it suppose failure?
F.E.R. No. I think it indicates more weakness on your part, and you need mercy.
Ques. Does the detection you have spoken of bring about the enthroning of grace in your heart?
F.E.R. I think the Spirit of God does that. You could not survive the exposure if it was not for the grace. You do not simply get grace but you get mercy, and what I understand by mercy is that everything is taken into consideration with God. I do not think mercy is the enduring kind of thing that grace is. Mercy comes in where people stand in need of mercy. For instance, it says, "That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace" -- it does not say "mercy". I think grace has given us a place in the scheme of divine counsel, and that grace will be seen.
C-I.B. But you will not be in the condition in which grace is needed.
F.E.R. No, but grace will be seen.
H.A.C. I suppose it shows that there is no obstacle to our getting on?
F.E.R. No. People want to consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession. I think people would do well to study the tabernacle and all connected with it.
{237}
THE CHURCH AND THE KINGDOM
@Matthew 16: 1 - 28
It is not difficult to see that in the history of the Lord down here, the moment arrived at in this chapter was a very critical one -- a great change was about to take place. This is indicated by the words in verse 4 -- "He left them and went away". From that point the Lord is occupied with the disciples: He looks upon them as the bread, and He warns them against leaven. They were the body He was concerned about, and they were not to be leavened with the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
Then when He comes into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, He questions the disciples as to what the people said of Him, and then as to what *they* said of Him, and Peter confessed, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (verse 16). No one could have told what change was coming in; the confession of Peter determined it. The Father had revealed something to Peter, and that revelation determined what was to come in, consequent on the rejection of Christ: not that Christ was rejected only, but He had rejected them -- "He left them and went away" (verse 4). We come then to Peter's confession, which brought to light what was to supplant all that existed. I know well who the Lord was, and that He knew all from the beginning, but as the dependent Man He waited on God as to His service, according to @Isaiah 8: 15 - 17, "And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and snared, and taken. Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. And I will wait for Jehovah, who hideth his face from the house of Jacob; and I will look for him". He waited on the Father, and Peter's confession was the indication
{238}
to Him of the course things would take. Hence He says: "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" (verse 17).
We get three things immediately referred to. First, the church; second, the kingdom in mystery; and third, the kingdom in glory. I come to the first. Peter confesses: "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God"; and the Lord declares, "On this rock I will build my assembly, and hades gates shall not prevail against it". Now, the thought of the church is very familiar to us, though many people associate very wrong ideas with it, and look upon it as either a material building, or any organisation of men; but here it means "assembly". I have no doubt that as to the main idea, Christ was going to build for the day of His glory, not for this world. You will find *the present* application of the truth of building in chapter 2 of 1 Peter; but in this chapter I think the day of His glory is in view, and the idea of the assembly was determined by Peter's confession. Nothing would have been adequate to that confession but the building of the assembly, nothing else would suit it, What do you think its meaning is? That there should be a body which should reflect Himself, be descriptive of Him, in which He would be displayed. The heavenly city in @Revelation 21 shows what it will be in the day of His glory. There is that here that answers to it, but it could not come out here fully. It is now a spiritual house, a holy priesthood; but that does not come up to the full idea. He was about to construct a building in which every stone was to be a reflection of His glory. Peter's confession was an indication that the foundation was laid on which He could build, though the time had not quite come for building. Peter's confession proved him to be a stone: the building is going on now. Christ, rejected of
{239}
His people, is declared to be the Son of God by resurrection, and He builds what is according to Himself. Temples made with hands are no longer the house of God -- they are not Christ's building at all. His assembly is not a material building. Here the Lord sees the foundation; it was the Father's revelation in a living soul, and He says: "On this rock I will build my assembly, and hades gates shall not prevail against it" (verse 18).
I want to give you an idea about building. Here was a stone: that we all admit. What constituted Peter a stone was the confession of Christ as the Son of the living God; and it is the same as to every one of us -- we have to come to that. It is more than the apprehension of Christ as Saviour, it is as One who came not from Mary or Joseph or from Israel, but from heaven; and that confession is a proof that a stone is there. There are two thoughts as to building; there is building in and building up. The stone is built in: it thus forms part of the structure. The confession is very elementary, though it is the effect of the Father's revelation, and I think the soul has then to be built up. I might be asked: What do you mean by 'building up'? I mean, built up in the divine nature. Christ is going to lead that soul on to the enjoyment of what He Himself knows. It is an immense thing for us to apprehend the glory of His Person -- for He then leads us into what no one but Himself knows, the Father's heart, and He imparts what no prophet or law-giver could impart. He dwells in the Father's bosom, and He delights to impart to us the love which He alone knows, that we may respond to that love: that is what I mean by being built up in the divine nature. What I am brought into by the Son of the living God is companionship with Himself. He has relieved me from what was upon me, that I may enjoy what He enjoys and may respond to it. Every
{240}
christian has to be built up in the divine nature. In heaven none of our natural peculiarities will be left, not even natural memory: we shall recall only what the Spirit brings to our remembrance. In heaven affections will be spiritual, divine affections reign supreme there. The Son is the object of the Father's affections, and He delights to bring us there. He puts every stone in place, and builds up every one in the divine nature. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, and we are formed by the place in which we are set through grace.
In the glory every stone will reflect Christ; no angularity, no obstruction there, not a bit of *us* will be left -- nothing left but what grace has formed in us. Every stone in that building will reflect Himself, and be descriptive of the Builder. There is nothing like the church in eternity: the glory of God is there -- no natural light, no need of sun nor moon -- no need of the most distinguished luminaries, the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof.
The Lord seizes the moment here -- He always did seize the moment -- of this confession of Peter's. It is wonderful to see what He works. It is of the utmost importance for you and me to get the idea of His assembly, and not to be content merely with being saved. I ask every one here to leave room for Christ and to see what He will do with you: I know what it will be, for I know what He has done for me. He will make you to know the Father's affections as He knows them, that in the day of His glory you may be descriptive of Himself -- that is what He will do.
I pass on now to the kingdom in mystery, verses 19, 20. What I want to say is, that the kingdom of heaven appears to me to subserve the assembly: it exists for the sake of the assembly. Christ takes the place not of ruling but of building: He is king
{241}
in title but not yet in fact, as reigning, but He is supreme in administration: the proof is that He gives the keys to Peter. What I understand by the kingdom of heaven is the moral sway of heaven upon earth; it is established in those that know redemption. Until Christ was established in heaven, the kingdom of heaven could not begin. The authority of heaven is maintained by the testimony of what is there. Christ does not yet rule, and the keys of the kingdom were committed to Peter -- the authority of Christ was to be exercised here by the word with regard to the kingdom: "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven" (@Matthew 18: 18). You may ask what is the importance of the kingdom. It is of great importance -- it is the great bulwark against evil: if not for the kingdom, evil would be completely rampant, but so long as the kingdom is maintained that is impossible. There are plenty of people who though not converted are not prepared to give up the word of God. They feel that every barrier against evil would be gone if they did. What guarantee have you against the break-up of all social ties but the word of God? What to hinder a man putting away his wife? Depend upon it the kingdom is the great bulwark, the light of christianity. The church is very precious to Christ, His treasure here; the kingdom exists as a bulwark against evil whilst He is building His assembly. With regard to the church, Peter was but a stone like any other stone; but in the kingdom he had authority. "Whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens". Peter was sent by the Lord in @Acts 2 to open the door of the kingdom to the Jews. He preached forgiveness of sins in the name of Christ, and those who accepted the glad tidings were brought under the authority of Christ in heaven;
{242}
then I find him in @Acts 10 bringing it to the gentiles and opening the door to them, thus carrying out the administration that was committed to him.
We see @Matthew 13 fulfilled as to the kingdom. It has become conspicuous like a great tree, a leavened inflated mass, but we cannot shut our eyes to the great moral value of the kingdom, that opportunity may be given to Christ to build His assembly.
In the remaining part of the chapter the Lord shows that His path led on to suffering, but also that He was to come again in glory, the glory of the kingdom. Now a word as to the importance of this as regards us. What is the path for us? I have tried to show what Christ is doing, and what we are as stones, but as to our pathway here in this world we have to accept fellowship with His sufferings; He has been rejected here, and we cannot be at home in this scene where He has been rejected. If I save my life in this world, I lose it. If at home in this world I am not accepting the path of rejection with Him here. The path is not altered since 1800 years ago. Do you want to have part in the glory of the kingdom? Well, the road is to suffer with Him. Nothing is right in God's thoughts till Christ has His rights. His rights as to this world are in abeyance now, but He will come again in glory, and if you want to reign in that day, be prepared to accept the suffering now: "If we endure, we shall also reign together: if we deny, *he* also will deny us; if we are unfaithful, *he* abides faithful, for he cannot deny himself", @2 Timothy 2: 12, 13. That is the path now -- it leads to glory. Would there have been any glory at all if Christ had not been content to suffer? It is the path He took, and we are to take the same. If you could put the world in perfect order, nothing could set it right for God till Christ gets His rights; and when He comes He brings His glory with Him, He does not find it
{243}
here. He received from God the Father honour and glory, and He will come in glory. If we suffer with Him we have part in that. It is an individual thing, not exactly a question of the church. You earn your reward. Our part in the kingdom will be determined by our individual faithfulness here. Christ builds His assembly: our faithfulness does not come in there. Every stone will completely reflect Himself, but while we are living stones it is equally true that everyone is called to His pathway here.
The point I delight in is, the way the Lord seizes Peter's confession as the opportunity to declare what He was about to do. No doubt Peter entered much more afterwards into all that the revelation meant -- that Christ was not simply Messiah, Son of Abraham and of David, according to promise, but Son of the living God. I beg everyone here tonight to look for grace, to leave themselves in the hand of Christ that He may make known the Father's heart to you, and in the glory you will be descriptive of Himself.
May God give us great interest in these wonderful revelations, that our faith may be sustained and energized by them.
{244}
THE WISDOM OF GOD
@Proverbs 2: 10 - 17; @Proverbs 8: 1 - 36
It is evident from these scriptures that it is a great day "when wisdom entereth into thy heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul". Wisdom is the great preservative from the evil that is in the world in its two great forms -- the violent man and the strange woman. The young are especially exposed to the influence of evil, and things are presented under subtle and deceptive forms, and so become attractive to them, unless wisdom has entered into their heart and knowledge has become pleasant to their taste. That is the great end to be desired, and which I should like to see brought about in those dearest to me. There is often a disposition on the part of the young to consent to the truth, but without desiring it so as to be governed by it. If we know wisdom at all, we appreciate very highly its great value to us in this world of evil. God makes us know divine wisdom; what could be a greater favour? Many things appear fair to the young which are really in the way to destruction. God, in His wisdom, allows evil to dominate in the world, but it will not always be so; He will put it down, but until that day the world is a scene of temptation and danger, and very specially so to the young.
I desire to give an idea of wisdom, while feeling my own inability for it. I suppose all will allow that wisdom is Christ. He is the expression of it. Christ is spoken of in Scripture as the power of God and the wisdom of God; He is the power of God as being the witness and sign of divine intervention; He is also the wisdom of God; and not only so, but He is made of God wisdom to us.
{245}
What I understand by wisdom is the resource of God's love, so that the purposes of His goodness might not be frustrated, but that they might be brought into effect. Christ was with God and was God. Wisdom says, "Then I was by him his nursling, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him", but at the same time "rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the Sons of men". This brings before us an immense range of thought, and bridges the distance between God and man.
I desire to bring before you certain things which in God's ways have been connected with man down here, but in which, man having failed, the wisdom or resource of God is brought to light.
To go back to the beginning. *Headship* was set up in Adam: he was constituted head, but he soon failed and forfeited this place. Nevertheless God's purpose as to headship -- the purpose of His goodness -- was not to be frustrated. Wisdom was by Him, as one brought up with Him. Christ was there, and in due time He comes out as Head over all things. Headship is taken up in the Son of man, so that it cannot fail.
*Unity* was seen in Adam and Eve. Eve was brought to Adam as the expression of divine goodness, that she might be a helpmeet for him, and there was also unity. They twain were one flesh. The woman took an independent course, and unity, morally, was gone; the relationship remained, but what gave point and character to the relationship was gone. But then Christ was by Him; the church is united to Christ, and thus unity can be maintained in saints in such a way that it never can be broken.
In Abel we get *righteousness*, a man accepted of God who bore witness to his gifts that he was righteous; but Abel died by the violence of his brother -- he did not remain. But God had Christ
{246}
by Him, the righteous Man who has accomplished righteousness, and the blood of Jesus speaketh better things than that of Abel.
We see *government* established in Noah, but the one to whom God entrusted government became drunk; he debased himself in the eyes of his children. But wisdom was with God. In the book of Revelation we see the throne, and the Lamb in the midst of it, and before it the seven spirits of God. "I was by Him", and so government is secured.
*Promises* were made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They saw them afar off, and by faith embraced them. But what became of those to whom the promises were made? They passed away by death. The promises remained, the men died; they were not relieved of the common penalty of death. But all the promises have their yea and amen in Christ Jesus. All is taken up in the true seed of Abraham, that is Christ.
*Sonship* was seen in Israel. Israel had this special and peculiar place; he was Jehovah's son, His first-born, and Jehovah said to Pharoah, "Let my son go, that he may serve me", @Exodus 4: 23. God would be served in liberty by His son. But Israel fell into idolatry, and were carried away beyond Babylon. What became of the calling? It is taken up in Christ. "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (@Matthew 2: 15), and liberty to serve God is secured in Christ.
Then in Moses we have the *prophet*, in Aaron the *priest*, and in David the *king*. Moses failed, and could not enter the land; Aaron had a hand in making the golden calf, and died in the wilderness; and David sinned and fell under the penalty of death. Well, Christ is Prophet, Priest, and King. "I was by him", and everything is secured.
In Nebuchadnezzar we get *power* given of God to the head of the gentiles, but Nebuchadnezzar sets
{247}
up a golden image and uses the power given him to further idolatry, and his kingdom comes to an end -- it is given into other hands. Christ is made the Head of the nations, in Him power according to God's glory is secured.
There was from the outset wisdom with God, so that whatever failure might come in on man's part, all comes out in due time for God's glory, and is seen to be secured in the One who is Wisdom. It is of great moment to apprehend that all things are gathered up in Christ. Scripture is of profound interest looked at in that way. You need to read all Scripture in the light of Christ. "The Lord is that Spirit" means that He is the Spirit of Scripture. I see three things in Scripture: the Father's counsel, Christ the great Object of all, and the immediate agency of the Spirit; and from beginning to end I expect to find Christ in it, for Christ is the resource of divine love.
We may pass on now to @Luke 7: 36 - 50. Wisdom is incarnate here in "the Word", and wisdom is justified of all her children. God is bringing to light the children of wisdom, and it is by appreciation of Christ that they are brought to light. The world was tested and exposed, while the children of wisdom were brought to light. Simon and the woman were alike outwardly near to Christ; they both had the same opportunity, but one was a child of wisdom and the other was not. The one distrusted Christ, while the other appreciated Him. There was no sense of need in Simon's soul; there was that sense in the woman. The presence of Wisdom here on earth became a most searching test to man, and so it is today; there are those who have the sense of need, and Christ *always* meets that. Every child of wisdom is of this stamp and type; as such we appreciate Christ. He is wisdom *to us*, so that no purpose of divine goodness might fail. Forgiveness
{248}
was part of that goodness. The woman appreciated divine goodness in Christ. She felt instinctively that God was there, and she proved herself a child of wisdom. Simon no doubt thought himself a very wise man, wiser than the Lord, for he said, "This person if he were a prophet would have known who and what the woman is who touches him, for she is a sinner".
But to go a point further (@1 Corinthians 1: 30, 31), what has come to pass is that Christ is made of God wisdom to us. He is a source or stock, so to speak. The man not according to God, the man after the flesh, who was under the judgment of death; that man has been removed in judgment in the death of Christ, that Christ might be the source of a company. "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus". Of God in Him. Christ is the source of life; we have received living water from Him. Every christian derives his moral being directly from God in Christ Jesus.
It is a great thing when wisdom possesses a man's heart; it is thus we find ourselves in the midst of the paths of judgment, and our treasuries are filled by wisdom. The point to be desired in the experience of christians is that Christ should be in their hearts as wisdom: and He is made wisdom to us that we may not miss our way; it is a great thing to be kept of God. When the woman of the city went forth from the presence of Christ she found a new path for her feet, she did not revert to her previous course. Wisdom undertakes to find a path for us and to lead us in it; the man who is subject to Christ will find that path and be maintained in it by his soul's appreciation of Christ. I have thought much lately that christians often do not go the right way to secure their own happiness. If they appreciated Christ and were content to be guided by the appreciation of Christ, they would be happier in this world.
{249}
If wisdom has entered into the heart and knowledge has become pleasant to the taste, God gives a very special favour, as we see in @Ephesians 1: 8, 16 - 20: "The spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him". The practical result of this is, you begin to be conscious of the hope of His calling and of the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, which is in the heading up of everything in Christ. But it is His inheritance in the saints; if all things are gathered up in Christ, the church gets her part in the "all things". I could not exclude my wife from anything I possess on earth, any more than from my confidence. And do you think the church is going to come short of that?
Another point is the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead (verse 20).
I ask any here, Do you believe in the reality of the mighty power that is towards you? -- that that mighty power which wrought in Christ is really towards you and me to put us into possession of the inheritance? I have often thought that it was impossible but that Christ should be raised, but then the exceeding greatness of God's power which raised Him is to us-ward who believe.
I cannot understand why christians cannot find enough, and more than enough, to take up their attention in what God has presented to us in Christ. What can be more profound than the good pleasure of His will, that every purpose of His goodness should be established in Christ? He is the Man of God's pleasure, the Son of man that He has made strong for Himself, the Yea and Amen of His purpose.
I wonder if we accept all this as reality. It is that, whether we accept it or not. You may depend
{250}
upon it that the woman in @Luke 7 found Christ a very great reality to her; she very much cherished the Lord's word in her heart. He was wisdom to her.
It is a wonderful thing to find in this world, where all is so intricate, a path which is agreeable to God, through Christ being made wisdom to us.
{251}
"BEHOLD, THE BRIDEGROOM"
@Matthew 25: 1 - 13; @Psalm 19: 1 - 6
The passage in Matthew presents a very striking picture, and evidently relates to the present time; it follows on a statement in the previous chapter, "the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites", that is, the parable presents to us the kingdom of heaven as it is at the end. The latter part of chapter 24 looks on to the time of the Lord's coming to judge His servants. Then in the beginning of chapter 25 we have the kingdom of heaven, in view of the coming of the Lord. All will have noticed that the cry has gone forth, "Behold, the bridegroom" -- everything is looking on to the coming of the Bridegroom, that is the consummation of all. And hence I would like every one to apprehend the importance of the parable. On our part we have to see to it that we have the preparation for it, and evidently one important item in the preparation is to have oil. The foolish virgins had no oil, they were in want, and in answer to their appeal the wise virgins answered wisely, "Go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves". That is the only way in which the oil is gained.
First, I will say a little as to the Bridegroom, and as to how things are at the present moment in regard to Him; things in this world are going on without any thought of Him, and I do not pretend to say how long they may be going on, but this I say, everything is in view of the Bridegroom. The thought of the Bridegroom is not a new, but a very old thought, and everything has looked on to His coming, and *He is* coming! It was that thought that
{252}
led me to read the few verses in @Psalm 19, for the thought of the Bridegroom is there: it is figurative, of course, for literally the psalmist is speaking of the heavens, and of the order displayed in them. In the world we see a great deal which is highly artificial, and great moral confusion too; the state of society is artificial in the highest degree, but when you look at the heavens you see the glory of God, there is no confusion; everything goes on in its own appointed order. The more you study astronomy the more you find the regularity with which the heavenly bodies perform their courses; they all move in connection with their appointed centre, and therefore "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork".
But another point comes out in the psalm, "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun" -- the sun is the centre of the heavens -- "which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race" -- that is the figure, and I have not a doubt that the Spirit of God in inditing that psalm by David had Christ in view. There is a quotation from that psalm in @Romans 10, "Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world", illustrative of the gospel; and the Bridegroom is really Christ. I refer to that because it shows that the thought of the Bridegroom has ever been before God. From the beginning of this world's history God has had one Man before Him, and that is Christ. Adam was the figure of Him that was to come; that is the Bridegroom.
The ten virgins went forth to meet the bridegroom, and the moment came when the cry arose, "Behold, the bridegroom": that is the position at the moment, the Bridegroom is coming, and the Bridegroom will have the bride. There are certain things for God here upon earth, and all belong to the Bridegroom.
{253}
"He that hath the bride is the bridegroom"; He is coming to take up all that is for God, and until He comes there can be nothing but confusion here. There is a great deal of the glorifying of man today, the condition of things is that in which man can be glorified, but there is little for God in it all, everything waits for the coming of the Bridegroom. John the baptist recognised Christ as the Bridegroom, and said, "He that hath the bride is the Bridegroom". Now we are brought into view of the coming of the Bridegroom, and the Bridegroom is the Sun of righteousness, the Centre and Head of the universe of bliss. Depend upon it there is a universe of bliss, a Head and Centre to it, and that Head is CHRIST. Now it is a great thing to get that in view. This world is passing away, and everything looks on to the coming of the Bridegroom. The kingdom of heaven is a mixture of wise and foolish virgins, but the bridegroom's coming is the test of the virgins. The coming of the bridegroom found out whether they were ready for him or not, and it is the thought of His coming that is the important point for every one of us, whether we are prepared for it.
Now Christ is the test of everything. He is the Saviour of the world, and there is no other. The woman at the well of Sychar recognised Him as that -- "the Christ, the Saviour of the world". But He is also the test of the world, the test of men because He is the Head of every man; and the way in which He has become the test of every man is that the question is raised as to whether men will take their direction from Christ. It is in that way that I understand Christ to be the test of every man. Men cannot help Christ being their Head, because God has set Him in that place; Adam was but the figure of Him that was to come, and as I said before, Christ necessarily becomes the test
{254}
of every man because He is in the place of Head as set there of God. You cannot help Christ being the Head of every man, or the Sun of righteousness, or the Bridegroom, but it raises the question, in regard of you, will you take direction from Christ? I can tell you in what way you will be guided if you do take your direction from Him -- it will be in the way of righteousness. The righteous Lord loveth righteousness, and if you come under the control of wisdom -- the control of Christ -- you will be led in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment.
There are many in the world who set up to be leaders of men, many professed guides of men, who will lead men in certain paths. All sorts of people spring up, and embody certain ideas, but they all are lawless, and the One whom God has appointed as Head of every man, is the One who alone is the guide for every man, and His guiding leads in one direction, and that is in the way of righteousness. The head of the family is the guide in it, and it would be wisdom for every one in a family to be guided by the head. Children are tested in that way as to whether they will accept the guidance of the head, and if they turn to their own wisdom, and refuse guidance, they go altogether wrong; they show self-confidence, and self-will, and they go often to ruin, in every family it is wisdom on the part of every member to accept in lowliness the guidance of the head. Now Christ is in the position of Head to every man, and it is wisdom on the part of man -- of every man -- to take his guidance from Christ. And I venture to say this, there is no real wisdom for man except Christ; whatever course a man may take, he does not know to where his path will lead; but wisdom leads in the midst of the paths of judgment.
{255}
Now I come to the thought of the bridegroom -- the virgins went forth to meet him. Christ presented a kind of attraction to men, or they never would have gone forth to meet Him. Now all went well up to that point, but then all the virgins slumbered and slept, and were at length awakened; but then came the test, the bridegroom was the test. They are tested as to their preparedness for the coming of the bridegroom; and that is what is going on at the present time -- not among the heathen, for it is not the heathen today who are tested by the Bridegroom, but christendom, those who are in the profession of Christ; the testing comes as to whether they are ready for the Bridegroom.
But to come to the nature of the preparation. It is that one has a light, and that a sustained light. All the virgins had their lights in a kind of way, the weakness came out in the foolish virgins in that their light was not maintained; their lights had burned for a moment, but it was only a momentary shining, there was no power to sustain the light. But now I will tell you how the light is to be sustained. The light could not be maintained without the Spirit, and yet there could be no maintenance of the light if there were no Christ; all depends on the soul being in the light of Christ. If you were to take a diamond and put it in a dark cellar it would not shine at all, for the shining of the diamond is dependent upon its being in the light; it cannot shine without. So the christian shines by reflected light, and there can be no shining except as he is in the light of Christ. There can be no sustained light except by the Spirit, you want the power of the Spirit to keep your face directed towards Christ. If the earth could get out of its connection with the sun it would appear as a dark mass, the shining of the earth is dependent upon its being in the light of the sun. And there can be no real shining
{256}
on the part of the christian except as he is in the light of the Sun of righteousness. The maintenance of the light is the test, and it brings out whether a person is under the control of the Sun of righteousness, or whether he is lawless. Christ, the Sun of righteousness, is there, and He is the Head of every man whether men like it or not. I have often attempted to point out that Christ subjected Himself to everything that lay upon man by the judgment of God that He might be the Head of every man. You get the strongest expressions in regard to Christ, for instance, God "made him to be sin for us" -- the point in it was that He might enter into all that which lay upon man by the judgment of God. He was made a curse too; He entered into every liability of man, in order that in the position of Head to every man He might guide every man -- that is the grace of the Lord Jesus; otherwise God could have had nothing to say to man. The present moment is marked by this, that Christ is the Head of every man; His shining is not yet seen, but we have the appeal, "Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light!" -- the need for every one is to come into the shining of Christ. It is the wisdom of all men to be ready for the coming of the Lord, for the Lord will come. No one can say when, but He *will* come; and a man who does not see to it that he is ready for the coming of the Lord is like these foolish virgins. Christ is the Head of every man by God's appointment, and God's appointments are not dependent upon man's acceptance, He does not consult man as to whether he likes them or not; He has set Christ as Head, He is the Mediator between God and men by divine appointment, and it is the wisdom of men to believe in the Head, and to accept guidance from Him, and to come thus into the shining of the Sun of righteousness. I want
{257}
you to believe in Christ, to know Christ, who is to become manifest as the Sun of righteousness; that is the Christ I present. He came once that He might accomplish the work of redemption, and has now gone to the right hand of God, but it is not to abide there; He is abiding there until the appointed time, and then He will come again into this world to take up everything for God here. Now man has to take that into account, and if he does not, he is but as the foolish virgins, for he leaves out what is the most important point in regard of men down here. He is like a person working out a sum in mathematics and ignoring the most important factor -- to go about our ways down here, and leave Christ out of account, is only to condemn ourselves as foolish. The point is to recognise Christ as the Bridegroom who is coming. He will yet be manifested as Head of every man, and those who do not bow to Him will disappear, they will have no part in the universe of bliss. The point now is to get from Him oil; you want a sustained light. I desire that every one might get oil from Him, and that no one might be so foolish as to trust themselves. Many may make a flicker; indeed, there may be a great flicker for a moment, yet it is but for a moment, it will not last. A sustained light depends on the oil, and that is true in spiritual things, and the oil can be got alone from Christ. You can get it through personal transaction with Christ, "Go ... to them that sell, and buy for yourselves". The Lord said to the woman at Sychar's well: "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water". You must ask of Christ if you would receive living water: and if you are to get oil -- perhaps a figure of the same thing -- you must come and buy for yourself. I want just to press that Christ is available to you.
{258}
You have read the gospels, and I am sure it must strike any one how approachable Christ was when here; there never was any one here upon earth so accessible to all as Christ was. The great people of the world do not attract me very much, for I have no access to them; and I cannot say that I care about any one very much to whom I have no entrance; their glory does not attract me. But though Christ had all the divine power and authority, He was the most approachable Man upon earth, and the Pharisee could approach Him, the publican could approach Him, a sinful woman such as you get in @Luke 7 could approach Him; it is one most striking feature in the Lord Jesus Christ down here upon earth that He was the most accessible of men. The Lord never refused an invitation; He came into the house both of the Pharisee and of the publican; He refused no house, and no person, all had access to Him. Now Christ is still living, He is at the right hand of God, He is not one whit changed; to think of Him as changed in any way would be to gainsay the truth. He is as approachable today as to that poor woman at Sychar's well, and indeed He Himself approached that woman; He began by approaching her, and He is approachable today. You can ask of Him, and He will give you living water; you can go to them that sell, and buy for yourself, and that without money, without price, it is for every one that thirsts. The Lord says at the end of the Revelation, "let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely" -- this proves Him to be unchanged -- the Christ who was here upon earth is not a bit altered -- the circumstance of glory could make no change in Him! He is the same yesterday, today, and for ever. If you could put me on a throne, it would turn my head for a certainty; few men could stand it. But Christ came into this world
{259}
in lowliness and meekness, and though He has gone back to that place to which He properly belongs, He has gone back as the SAME, yesterday, today, and for ever.
Now, if you get the oil you are prepared for the coming of the Bridegroom, you will have your face continually directed to Christ. To be in the light of a living Christ is the occasion of the greatest delight down here. One sees people looking for happiness here, but they do not go the right way to find it. There is no happiness to be found except in the light of Christ, and then there will be shining too. The Spirit of Christ would keep you continually directed to Christ, and you would be always bright; you would have not simply a vessel and a lamp, but you would have light; and the light sustained by the Spirit: and be prepared for the coming of the Bridegroom, who takes up everything that belongs to God; He will put His hand on the moral confusion, and on all the glory of man down here; on this world system, in every part of it, and bring in what is according to God; the light of divine goodness and love. He will revive Israel, and the nations, whatever there may be for God upon earth will be taken up by the Bridegroom. When He comes He will be glorified in those He brings with Him, and in those too who are upon earth where He was dishonoured; there will be a people waiting for Him, and they will delight themselves in the Lord. The Bridegroom is coming, He is hid for the moment, but is presented in testimony as the Bridegroom, the strong man that delights to run a race.
To my mind there is a great grace in the three and a half years of the Lord's ministry down here; what I have spoken of came out in the death of Christ, so that we are not ignorant of what He is, though now at the right hand of God. He is coming again to displace the whole world system, with all
{260}
its great achievements in the way of discovery and science. All those laws of nature which men have been able to find out and turn to their advantage came from God; and is it not far more important that man should recognise God, and admit the rights of God and the rights of his neighbour, than gain the greatest acquaintance with nature? If you accept Christ as Head, He will guide you in the way of righteousness, He will communicate to you the Spirit of God. It may be that you know the forgiveness of your sins, but the point is that you might delight your heart in Christ, accept Him as Head, and ask Him for living water. The water of life is there, but people have to come to Christ and take it; no one can dispense that water of life save the One who died for all. The cross was the way by which the Spirit could be communicated; the One who bore the cross is the One who communicates the Spirit, and He is coming again; but in the meantime He is ready and waiting to impart to any one who turns to Him for guidance the gift of living water. It would be a great thing if every Christian were bright by the shining of Christ, and to be bright can only be as we are brought into the shining of Christ.
It makes one's heart ache to see the glory and the glitter of this world, for there will be nothing whatever of it left when Christ comes, everything will be broken up like an egg-shell, and will disappear; but meantime He is the test of every man, because He is the Head of every man.
{261}
CHRIST FILLING ALL THINGS
@Luke 10: 1 - 37
F.E.R. I suggested this chapter, because it presents in a striking way the place which Christ fills in connection with divine ways. The first part shows Christ sending out the seventy on their mission. The end of this is the falling down from heaven of Satan; and then we go on to the thought of everything being delivered of the Father to Christ, and eternal life is brought into view. Like every other part of Scripture, it commends itself -- it is so entirely divine, but impossible to be understood except by the Spirit of God. The mission of the seventy is confined to this gospel. It is connected with Christ being received up (see chapter 9: 5 1.) What follows on this is Satan cast down from heaven. The mission of the seventy is wider than that of the twelve which we get previously. The point is that it is the beginning of the downfall of Satan, the beginning of the end of undoing the works of the devil. The end is when Satan is cast down from heaven. The Lord speaks of the gathering in of the harvest. All is final, things are brought to an issue. The ground in Luke is wider than in Matthew. Christ is set as a light to the gentiles. At the beginning of Acts we have more the mission of the twelve, carrying out the testimony that Christ had given. Luke is more connected with the testimony of the apostle Paul. Everything is brought to an issue. The present testimony of the gospel will bring everything to an issue. The ultimate effect of the preaching of the gospel is the overthrow of Satan. Paul says, "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds". The light coming in has
{262}
given an enormous impetus to human intelligence, but the real effect is in bringing to light the forces of evil. Lawlessness is brought to light in christendom and so too antichrist. While the preaching of the gospel gathers in the harvest, it brings fully to light the powers of evil. God has ordained that Christ should be the great test. "The Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil". Everything has to be disentangled. The harvest has to be gathered in and everything must become ripe for judgment. It really is more and more the question, "What think ye of Christ"? The spirit of lawlessness is seen in that light has been presented and deliberately refused. On the other hand, Christ has an eye on every thirsty one.
In the first fourteen chapters of Acts we find opposition to the preachers of the gospel; in chapter 15 it is adulteration -- law brought into the gospel.
It says in verse 21, "In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit". Then the lawyer raises the question of eternal life, and the Lord gives a solution of it in the thought of the neighbour. It is another order of things. The chapter brings into view an order of things in which the Father is revealed, and in which Christ gives the impulse. Christ fills all, and everybody is affected by the impulse which He gives. Mercy pervades all -- the principle is "Go, and do thou likewise". The priest and levite could do nothing in this way. Jude says, "Looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life", and the impulse of mercy affects everybody. Christ has ascended far above all heavens that He might fill all things. Light is supposed to be ether -- and it gets its impulse from the sun. You get in this chapter the break-up of one system and the introduction of another. There is a new system set up by God, and of this Christ is the Centre. The names of disciples being written in heaven is connected
{263}
with purpose. The companions of Christ were to have a place in heaven. We have this thought in @Hebrews 12, names enrolled in heaven. Divine love has not its end till God's people are in heaven. God would have them with Himself. We get the same thought in @Exodus 15, in regard to Israel, "Thou shalt bring them in". When God comes out in the revelation of Himself in His Son, He gets His satisfaction -- His love has its answer in those surrounding Him. The joy set before Christ was to give effect to the divine will. The Lord was supremely the evangelist here, and every evangelist is the reflection of Christ. The disciples when sent out were wonderfully equipped. Power is not expressed in quite the same shape now, but the power is there. Men are delivered from the power of evil as truly as then. In the thought of their names being written in heaven the Lord corrected the disciples thought of power. Love is greater than power. Man is likely to be elated by the exercise of power down here. If I saw people manifestly set free by my agency from the power of Satan, I am not quite sure how I could stand it.
Ques. Why does the Lord introduce what we have in verse 22?
F.E.R. Because He is bringing into view the new system. There is the dissolution of the old system in the fall of Satan. The system of the world which has been under Satan's domination is reduced to its moral elements. A new system is built up, everything being put into the hands of Christ. Then the glory of His person comes out. There is in Him the revelation of God: "In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". There is a system which will subsist in the revelation of God, in which Christ will shine forth as the Sun of righteousness. What gives its brilliancy to the Sun of righteousness is that the glory of God shines in His face.
{264}
Ques. Is growth in christians growth in the knowledge of divine Persons?
F.E.R. Yes. And for that you must be brought into contact with them. You will not know me except in coming into contact with me. The Spirit brings us into contact with divine Persons, so that we really know these divine Persons before we get to heaven. That is in truth the holiest. I think the holiest is really the heart of God. When you get to heaven nothing will be strange:
<blockquote>'There no stranger -- God shall meet thee'. (`76:10)</blockquote>
The gospel of John gives us a clue to this. It is the gospel of the sent One, and the real way of entering into the knowledge of God is by the sent One.
When Christ arises as the Sun of righteousness He gives an impetus to everything. Every one will show mercy. Houses of Parliament and legislation will not then be required. Christ perfectly meets both death and dearth. He brings in the mercy of heaven. Man will be freed from death and will be abundantly satisfied. If you could get man satisfied and freed from death, you would have eternal life here. The One who brings in the mercy of God sets aside death. This is what @John 5 brings out. He reveals Himself there as One who has complete authority over the domain of death. Everything hangs on Christ. Our blessing at the present time is in the way of knowledge; but there is no limit to what you may know because there is no limit to the Spirit of God. In the close of the chapter you get the moral effect of the apprehension of mercy in Christ. Mary sits at the feet of Jesus, and the consequences of this are seen in the next chapter.
No one can fathom the depths in the Son -- the glories of His person. We know nothing, of course, of Christ, except through revelation. No one can know the Son save the Father. The Lord says,
{265}
"Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see". He was speaking of this wonderful revelation. It was only Christ who could estimate the opportunity they had. It is a blessed thing that we have got the revelation of the Father in the Son, and Christ as the Centre of all -- the Sun of righteousness, who is going to give impulse to everything.
Everything on the divine side was perfect in Christ when He came, but we could have no part in it till after His resurrection. Christ has made the Father known. Eternal life in our case depends on the communication of the Spirit -- the living water. The verse in @John 17, "Thou hast given him power over all flesh", is true of Christ now that He is glorified. We come into eternal life by receiving the Spirit. Here the Lord brings out the powerlessness of the law with regard to eternal life. It is dependent on God's mercy. We become conscious of eternal life in the knowledge of the Father and the Son, outside the region of death and dearth. There is growth in this knowledge. There is no limit in it. You increase by the true knowledge of God. All depends on the capability that is in the Spirit and in His work. If people were prepared for the surrender of their hearts, to be set on that, they would get much greater capability. We are but small in the inward man.
The consequence of what we have seen is that we pray for the coming kingdom (chapter 11: 2). The moment you come under the influence of Christ you prove the effect of it. That is really "looking for the mercy". It is a wonderful transformation. The effect on a person who comes under this influence is the looking for the Father's kingdom. The question is how to get people under the influence of Christ, especially the young. If the older ones were more under the influence of Christ they might draw them. You may have everything as proper and
{266}
orthodox as possible, and yet all be as chilly as death. The "young men" in @1 John 2 are in danger from the world. That is the great snare of the present day. We ought to make it manifest that the world is hostile to Christ. You dare hardly mention the name of Christ in the world.
{267}
FRUIT, THE EVIDENCE OF VITALITY
@John 15: 13 - 16
G.G. There was an allusion this morning to a connection between @John 14 and @Ephesians 3. Could that thought be carried on to the succeeding chapters?
F.E.R. I think you get what is spoken of in these chapters expressed in the same prayer: "Strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth ... and to know the love of Christ ... that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God". I think we come in this to @John 16.
F.H.B. What does this chapter answer to?
F.E.R. "Rooted and grounded in love". Fruit is the evidence of vitality. Christ has come that we might have life. He says, "These things I command you, that ye love one another". Fruit is the evidence that life has come in. Rooted and grounded in love comes out in that we love one another. That is christianity -- not simply faith, but evidence that life has come in. Hence the Lord takes the ground of being the vine and the disciples were the branches. The life abides and gets its expression in fruit-bearing.
F.H.B. Then we must be in the enjoyment first of all.
F.E.R. You must be alive.
Ques. Is the fruit in this chapter *love*?
F.E.R. That is what the Lord insisted on.
{268}
G.C. Is that why you have living in the Spirit and the "fruit of the Spirit" together? (@Galatians 5: 22, 25).
F.E.R. Probably.
Ques. Is fruit here for the Father's glory?
F.E.R. I think so; they were manifested as the disciples of Christ by bearing fruit. "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples".
G.G. Then the fruit would be seen of men.
F.E.R. "That they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven". I think it is all testimony to Christ. He is to have an entrance here in His absence and fruit is the evidence.
W. Does not this contemplate the disciples being together?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
A.H. Is the fruit here individual or collective?
F.E.R. If it is purely individual, how can you have love? "That ye love one another". I do not understand love save in relation to one another.
H.T. "Let your light so shine before men". Is there any difference between "light" and "good works"? Would the "light" be Christ shining out and the "works" more works of faith?
F.E.R. I think "your good works" are the proof that you are in the work of God and you do not do evil works.
W. Are not the "upright works" the works of the kingdom?
E.D. It is evident "the *works*" are not to shine, it is "the *light*".
Ques. In Colossians we have "That ye might walk worthy of the Lord ... being fruitful in every good work". Might there be "good works" without fruit-bearing?
T.H.R. The good works speak to the Father of Him who is the source of them. I think it is an immense thing to think of the delight of the Father to see Christ reproduced down here, where He has
{269}
been cast out. It shews the manner in which you get the Father's care here. What a care He has for all that belongs to Christ!
F.H.B. That really is the result of Christ dwelling in the heart.
E.D. What is the connection between abiding *in Him* and Christ abiding *in us*?
F.E.R. I think we are conscious of the place we have in His affections and the place He has in ours.
A.H. What is fruit?
F.E.R. It is difficult to define it. I take it to be the evidence of life -- not exactly service.
W.B. And might assume a thousand forms?
F.E.R. I do not look upon Christ as bearing fruit; I think the fruit is borne on the branches. The vine is the source of fruit-bearing.
G.C. "Love, joy, peace" could not be as the fruit of the Spirit in Him.
F.E.R. I think He was the source of vitality in others, that there should be something here for the Father's pleasure when He was gone. It was the branches that bore fruit, but only by reason of their being in the Vine.
J.P. "I do always those things that please him".
F.E.R. That is all true. I would not like to speak of fruit-bearing in connection with Christ, but I think God is entitled to look for fruit where there is culture.
H.T. Would you apply @Psalm 1 to Christ?
F.E.R. No; but I should @Psalm 2. I think Christ identified Himself with the class of the godly, but I should not like to put Him in the class. He was pre-eminent. There was culture with Israel, but no fruit; the culture was in a sense thrown away. Where there is culture, God is entitled to look for fruit. With the disciples there was culture, the object being that they might bring forth more fruit. There
{270}
must be discipline; discipline and culture are, I think, very intimately connected. Culture takes the form of discipline; education is discipline.
E.D. Is abiding in Christ living of His life?
F.E.R. I think so. "The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me". The christian is affected by the love of Christ -- the love of Christ becomes the motive -- spring of everything and carries him above all that is natural; I do not say that he ignores what is natural. Fruit reproduces itself.
A.H. Would you connect fruit with the apostles testimony?
F.E.R. I think the thought is that fruit reproduces itself. "That your fruit should remain". If you sow the *leaves* of a tree they will not bring fruit, you must sow the seed, that is really the fruit. I have looked to see where preaching can be found in this chapter. It may be involved in, "I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain".
T.H.R. All here today have come from the apostles ministry and are their fruit. Fruit-bearing has gone on and there has been reproduction.
F.E.R. The Lord is looking at things, not so much in regard of persons as of fruit -- that is, morally, that it was to abide and not to pass away.
F.H.B. I think we get it in the apostle. "Death worketh in us, but life in you".
F.E.R. Yes.
T.H.R. It is a very important point that in the thought of culture responsibility comes in to abide in Him. It raises the question whether we answer to the culture.
F.E.R. If you get a person self-reliant, self-sufficient, fruit-bearing is very much marred; that is the opposite of abiding in Christ. In abiding in
{271}
Christ you give up all sense of your own sufficiency and every kind of self-assertion.
F.H.B. So there must be: "death worketh in us".
T.H.R. The question is not a matter of apostolic succession, but of life and abiding in Christ.
W. Does not verse 7 take it out of figure into plain teaching?
C. What is meant by "and I in you"?
T.H.R. J.N.D. used to say that "abide in me, and I in you" is the divine order in @John 15 and brings in responsibility.
F.H.B. Is not that because the realisation of His being in us is the result of our abiding in Him?
F.E.R. I think verses 1 - 6 are in connection with the disciples here. The point of transition where we take it up is, "if ye abide in me, and my words abide in you". Christ was the true Vine, and the disciples came in, really, as the true Israel; and the church has come in as the companions of Christ. I think this comes in incidentally to our being here; it will return to Israel by-and-by. I think we come into many things not exactly proper to the church as a heavenly company, but in connection with our being here. When Israel comes into it everything around will be favourable; now we have to bear fruit in the presence of uncongenial surroundings. "So shall ye be my disciples" means to be manifest as such in life and character.
F.H.B. I suppose the first idea in connection with a disciple is of one who receives the teaching of another? The following is the result?
F.E.R. Yes; the disciple is not greater than his Master. It is so important to see that Christ is the beginning of everything, "The beginning of the creation of God".
F.H.B. Because everything that did not begin with Christ will ultimately pass away.
{272}
F.E.R. Quite so. It is not that Christ has come in to remedy a bad state of things, but to bring in what God had in reserve; all was to come to pass by Christ; but in divine wisdom there were certain previous provisional dealings of God, but Christ is really the beginning. You can understand new creation in regard of man, because man is to be according to God, and that cannot be apart from new creation.
W.B. What is that word, "Behold, I make all things new"?
F.E.R. That is the new heaven and new earth, not exactly the "creation of God". Christ was the outset of creation because everything was created by Him and for Him, but He takes things up on the ground of resurrection that we may have part. He is entitled to everything; but if Christ took up His Headship on that ground, we could not have part. He takes all up on the ground of redemption that we may be brought in.
F.H.B. Then "the creation of God" includes more than "new creation"?
F.E.R. I think "the creation of God" *is* "the creation of God". Man is a new creation. Christ is the First and the Last. Whatever God set forth in previous dealings had always Christ in view.
D.L.H. It is important that nothing God had before Him has broken down.
F.E.R. Very important.
D.L.H. Christ is the beginning of the creation of God.
A.L. There is the "natural" and the "spiritual".
F.E.R. What God had before Him was the "spiritual".
F.K. Say a word about "new creation". Do you say that is not "the creation of God"?
{273}
F.E.R. Certainly not. You get "new creation" in connection with man, but I think we often use the expression in a different sense to that.
F.H.B. It has been used in connection with an order of things into which we come.
F.E.R. Surely God is going to be glorified in connection with creation? We have taken up the term 'new creation' and given it a conventional use. Certain terms become conventional and when you look into them they do not always carry with them what is generally supposed. New creation has been applied wider than Scripture warrants.
D.L.H. Adam was a figure of the One to come.
F.E.R. Quite so; but Christ was the One to come. You get nothing morally precedent to Christ. God saw fit to carry on a kind of testing previously, but God was ever looking forward to the introduction of the Man according to His mind and everything taking character from that Man.
F.K. God's creation is a very wide thing, and includes the whole universe of which Christ will be Head.
F.E.R. Quite so. He is not only the beginning of it, but the crown of it.
W. And He could say, "As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you".
F.E.R. Christ gives the impulse; and the impulse no doubt will be felt in every family, though not in the same degree.
E.H.C. The new heavens and new earth in Isaiah?
F.E.R. God goes on there to the full extent of His purpose. Then He returns to shew the present thing, "Behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing".
G.C. You do not think it is in a moral sense?
F.E.R. I think God goes on to the full extent of His purpose. All the ways of God are in view. The new heavens and new earth, that is the great consummation before God, and God has made known the consummation. Every enemy subdued, every
{274}
question resolved, then the kingdom given up that God may be all in all.
F.C. When scripture speaks of the "new heavens", what is referred to?
F.E.R. The material heavens.
T.H.R. The created heavens, that which is connected with this earth, and has been tainted by evil. It is a great thing that in the millennium, what Satan has brought into ruin will be set up in Christ, so that Satan will not be able to say that he has triumphed. Where Satan has brought in evil there God triumphs. What has been spoiled by Satan, God will set up in Christ in beauty.
W.J. "As a vesture shalt thou fold them up".
T.H.R. Every moral question has been worked out here, and then the present scene is done with.
F.E.R. God allows the power of evil to appear for a moment (at the end of the millennium) only in view of the final solution. I have thought for years that the new heaven and new earth and the lake of fire are presented to shew us the ultimate determination of good and evil. When the disentanglement is complete good and evil find their own place. "*Lake*" gives the idea of a *limit* -- that there will be no scope for the activity of will, there will be a limitation to it in its own scene.
T.H.R. There is no universal dominion, no such power as that of the beast, after Christ's reign.
W.J. "That my joy might remain in you". What does that mean?
F.E.R. I think the Lord has His own joy in His disciples; His point was that His joy might continue in them. We often put the contrast between "my" and "you", but I question if it is just.
D.L.H. Is the force of "abide in me" that in our souls we have the sense that Christ is everything, and apart from Christ there is nothing for God?
{275}
F.E.R. I think it brings in a sense of responsibility. Our responsibility is to continue in Christ.
A.H. Is it that we do not apostatise?
F.E.R. I think so.
Ques. Go back to Adam?
F.E.R. You will go away perhaps to something worse than Adam.
F.K. Is abiding in Christ going on in the faith of the thing?
F.E.R. Yes; and that means a great deal. When you get christianity adapted to the world it is falsified; but if you continue in the Christ that has been rejected, it is a great thing.
P. That is very far-reaching.
F.E.R. I think the point of moment is to apprehend what Christ is in the divine ways; not only that He is *Lord*, but the *Christ*.
F.H.B. It comes to the same thing as "holding the Head".
F.E.R. It is "holding the Head" -- exactly what we have to do down here.
W. It is remarkable how this comes in after the end of chapter 13, "Now is the Son of man glorified".
F.E.R. You get in the beginning of chapter 14, "Ye believe in God, believe also in me".
Ques. Would the believing in Him be the same as abiding in Him?
F.E.R. Not exactly, because there the Lord is laying down the position in a way.
W.B. Could you speak of a christian going on badly as abiding in Christ?
F.E.R. I think a man is judged by his practice; if his practice is contrary to Christ, I could hardly say he is abiding in Christ.
A.H. That is not the point here, is it?
F.E.R. I do not think it is.
A.C. Would not that test unchristianise a good many?
{276}
F.E.R. I think they have unchristianised themselves.
T.H.R. The point the Lord brings out is a fruit-bearing branch and a not fruit-bearing branch. It is not a question whether a fruit-bearing branch may fail to bring forth fruit for a time.
W.B. What is the force of that -- a man "cast forth as a branch, and is withered"?
F.E.R. He becomes rejected, never restored.
F.H.B. Judas is the example. It applied to the moment when there were those who were associated with Christ after the flesh.
F.E.R. The apostle says, "Lest ... when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway". We have to abide in Christ; we are under responsibility down here in this world; any one of us might turn away. I think it is very foolish to take the ground of its being impossible to turn away from Christ.
W.B. Might you not have confidence that Christ will keep you?
F.E.R. That is another thing.
G.C. Is not every bit of departure in christianity on the line of apostasy?
F.E.R. It is. We have come to the day when "the Lord knoweth them that are his".
A.C. What is the meaning of "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die"?
F.E.R. I should think it is the statement of a general principle.
F.H.B. It brings us back to that -- we have to abide in Christ.
F.E.R. You have salvation in abiding in Christ. It is impossible to get out of that kind of responsibility while you are down here. It is not a question of salvation *for ever*, I am not concerned about that, I am concerned about the present -- it is salvation *in the presence of what is down here*.
{277}
G.C. "Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes".
F.E.R. Quite so. I do not think a man ever *talks about* his confidence; if he does, I do not think he has got it. I think salvation is exactly what the bulk of christians are in need of. Forgiveness of sins is righteousness. God is a Saviour, because He saves you from all that to which you are naturally in bondage. Abiding in Christ is the secret of salvation.
G.C. Is the gospel spoken of in @1 Corinthians 15, the gospel of their salvation? (@Ephesians 1.)
F.E.R. I suppose so.
W.B. "Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou ... shall be saved".
F.E.R. I think salvation is inherent in christianity. "I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus".
T.H.R. I think it is of great value always to keep the end before one -- that I am going to be with Christ. People are often like wanderers down here without an end in view; the great thing that makes one continue is the thought that we are going to be with Christ. I do not mean a person feeling that all is secure, so that it is certain they will be with Christ. God has an end for me and I go on to that end in my soul. "Hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end".
F.E.R. I think salvation in Romans depends on the transfer from Adam to Christ; the gospel presents a Man in whom is salvation, we are "saved by his life". Salvation is inherent in Christ. I think salvation *by* Christ refers to the ultimate result: "We look for the Saviour", but God is our Saviour. Salvation is based on righteousness. You must have a basis, and then you come into salvation. For salvation you want the "washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit". You will not get much sense of salvation without those two things. You
{278}
want dissociation from the old things on the one hand and the work of the Spirit on the other. It really involves the transfer from Adam to Christ, and then you get salvation in Christ. Pure association refers to the christian company, that which a converted heathen was *brought* to through baptism. The renewing of the Holy Spirit fits us for the new associations.
{279}
THE SPIRIT HERE TO DISCLOSE ANOTHER WORLD
@John 16: 1 - 15
Rem. I suppose the being "offended" is a very real thing today as well as in that day?
F.E.R. I think people get offended and are stumbled over Christ because they get their minds full of what is of man. They get exaggerated ideas of the importance of man so Christ is not good enough for them.
W. They want to use Christ as a help to themselves?
F.E.R. I think so.
P. What are "these things" the Lord refers to in verse 4?
T.H.R. You get the same words "these things" in chapter 15: 21. There was the same kind of stumbling in John the baptist (@Matthew 11: 3). He could not understand Christ being rejected, though he had had the testimony. "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending ... he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit". Yet afterwards John said, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" The disciples would have to meet this rejection, and might be stumbled by it; but Christ had foretold them.
A.H. Is this the treatment the witness for Christ in this world would get from the hands of the world?
F.E.R. The world of which the Lord speaks is the religious world; at that moment it was the Jew. I do not think the religious world cares for vitality; I think that has been proved over and over again. If vitality comes in it shakes a person free of the religious world.
T.H.R. And God helps us by the opposition to be free of the world. The Lord says, "They shall
{280}
put you out of the synagogues", not, you will have to go out. If we are Christ-like they will not have us, which is a greater test than having to leave them. Often when we do something we think something of ourselves; but when we are cast out that is a different case.
F.E.R. Christ has come, not to produce some effect in the present world, that is not the thought in christianity. If we were to run on that line we should not incur so much opposition. Christ is accepted in a way to put honour on man. That is the idea today, but Christ never could attach Himself to this world to put it right.
A.H. I suppose that was the line the Lord's brethren were on in chapter 7: 4, "If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world"?
F.E.R. Christ could not come to put *this* world right. Everything in this world is tested by Christ, for if He comes in He must of necessity be the Head and Beginning of another world; in the nature of things He is the Beginning, He could not be the end of an existing system.
T.H.R. Christ is going away in this chapter, and the result is that everything is put in its true place. The Comforter comes as witness of the truth. It was necessary that Christ should go away in order that the Comforter should come. He bears witness as to Christ in His right place as Head over all things, and as to the world in its right place, as judged.
G.G. "They have not known the Father, nor me"?
F.E.R. There had been the presentation of the Father's works and words; I doubt if the test would have been complete apart from that. In Him all the fulness was pleased to dwell. There was the full presentation of God in Christ; and the works He did and the words He spoke were the Father's works and the Father's words, carried out and spoken in
{281}
the power of the Spirit. There would not have been the same completeness of testimony had not the presentation been so complete.
A.L. That brought out the state of man -- absolutely incapable of receiving anything.
F.E.R. Yes, and you can understand that there would not have been the exposure of man without that presentation.
E.R. "Believe me for the very works sake".
M. In what way would the world know that the prince of this world is judged?
F.E.R. I do not understand that the *world* would know it, it is more that *we* should know it; the presence of the Spirit here is the evidence of it, and those who have the Spirit have the evidence.
A.L. Then I suppose it is only those who have the Spirit that get the benefit?
F.H.B. Then if we do not enter into what is true as to the world, we cannot enter into what follows -- the things of Christ?
F.E.R. People have an idea sometimes that Christ came to set this world right, even the disciples had; we must get clear of that idea; He never did.
F.C. To set this world right would be to recognise man.
F.E.R. The world around is a system that has grown up around man departed from God. The Spirit has come to make known another world. "All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you". The Spirit has come, that we, "being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height".
A.H. And that really is the "hidden wisdom" Paul speaks about to the Corinthians.
A.L. What is the connection, "of righteousness, because I go to my Father"?
{282}
F.E.R. The world is convicted on that plea. Christ was rejected here, but He has gone to the Father and righteousness is established there.
G.G. Would it be that He is the only righteous One and He has gone to the Father?
W.W. I thought that the idea is, that He was rejected in this order of things, but accepted in another order of things.
F.C. Is He not the righteous One, and if righteousness is to be found anywhere it must be there?
F.E.R. Yes, righteousness is secured there.
W.H.B. What is the difference between the statement, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin": (chapter 15: 22), and this in chapter 16, the Spirit coming to convict the world of sin? Is the one abstract and the other the conviction in the minds of those who have the Spirit?
F.E.R. I suppose so I think most of us understand the position of the world in regard of God, that its position relatively to Him is sin; but I think what we are less acquainted with is the other side, the things of Christ, that is, another world.
W.H.B. Is it not as the other side comes into your soul that the affections go out more and more?
F.E.R. I think when people are awakened to recognise the presence of the Spirit, they recognise, on the other hand, the absence of Christ, and they will make some move as to the world. I think the move made of late years has been in leaving the worldly religious systems.
F.H.B. Then that prepares the way for the opening out of another world to us by the Spirit?
F.E.R. Until people recognise the presence of the Spirit and the position of Christ in regard to the world they cannot make much progress. The moment people get a sense of the Spirit's presence, it is sure to bring home to them that Christ is rejected, and thus their position relatively to the world is
{283}
altered; it was so with every one of us. The two things go together.
D.L.H. It is a remarkable thing that in the christian world there is no sense of Christ being rejected.
F.E.R. Things are all taken up simply as facts and not in their significance; the death, resurrection and ascension of Christ are merely facts to them and all is interwoven with the world.
W.H.B. How are saints awakened now?
F.E.R. The Spirit of God from time to time will stir. Defection is allowed to go on, but the Spirit will make His presence felt, and it has been felt over and over again. In every movement of God it has been the Spirit making His presence felt.
W.H.B. Does He not awaken from outside? "Awake thou that sleepest ... and Christ shall give thee light".
F.E.R. Yes; but no one will awake but by the movement of the Spirit, though there is the responsibility. The Spirit is here in the saints, and thus the movement comes in connection with them, and this, in spite of all the defection in christendom. It is really the revival of the Spirit of Christ in the saints.
G.G. The movement of the Spirit, the recovery spoken of last night, would be really a revival of Christ.
A.L. Does not that apply now -- "If any man hear my words".
F.E.R. Yes; but none will hear His words apart from the movement of the Spirit.
W.J.M. When there is defection, God must begin to work?
F.E.R. I think so.
T.H.R. It is a great thing to apprehend that there are two scenes: one scene dominated by sin, and another scene where righteousness is established. Take Romans -- I think people think a great deal
{284}
more of the forgiveness of sins than of quitting a scene dominated by sin, and being alive to God in righteousness.
F.K. You take that in connection with "Of sin, because they believe not on me; of righteousness, because I go to my Father".
T.H.R. It is not conviction *of* sin and righteousness. It is conviction *concerning*.
A.H. Then the demonstration is "of sin" in this world, and "righteousness" with the Father?
H.D'A.C. J.B.S. said that righteousness is not here. It went to the Father.
T.H.R. I think it is a wonderful thing, that there is a scene where sin is not. Righteousness is not here; even in the millennium righteousness will look down from heaven. The scene here is dominated by sin.
G.G. Then you do not think it is a question of a righteous umpire, like @Psalm 17?
F.K. Is it that righteousness is seen there in His person?
F.E.R. I think it is that all that is of the Father is *with* the Father, and all will come out *from* the Father.
T.H.R. The Spirit brings the demonstration concerning righteousness and sin, that sin is here and righteousness is not here.
F.E.R. There are two things -- the world has proved its lawlessness, and would not have righteousness. In refusing Christ the world has refused righteousness and therefore in regard to the world righteousness is an absolute impossibility, and the practical effect of that is we must look for all to come out from the Father; all that is going to be displayed must be evolved from Him, and we can look for nothing from the world. God is allowing the world to run its course, but in due time we shall see a universe set forth in a day.
{285}
T.H.R. Christ being there, everything is ripe to come out, though all awaits the working out of God's ways.
F.E.R. Yes; God allows the present world to run its course and works His own will.
A.L. Is it not true that though the Lord speaks of the world, and the demonstration, it is that we may understand it?
F.E.R. Yes; the Holy Spirit demonstrates sin, righteousness and judgment, that we may understand the true position of things in regard of this world, and thus be prepared for the things of Christ being shewn to us. That *is* the position of things whether anyone understands it or not.
T.H.R. I think it is an immense thing to get things put in place.
G.C. "Let my sentence come forth from thy presence". God's sentence is a righteous one.
T.H.R. I think the devil got his sentence when he touched Christ at the cross; he brought all the world to crucify Him. He had a title to touch *us*, but he had no title to touch Christ: "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me". He touched Christ, and touching Him involved his judgment.
F.E.R. All between God and the world came to an issue in Christ. His coming was a test to the world, but He was also the Beginning for God. God being presented in Christ has fully tested the world, and the world has proved itself lawless in rejecting Christ, and so, for the moment, righteousness is in another scene *with* the Father, and all must come *from* the Father.
A.H. Everything here is closed now, and He opens up another world.
F.E.R. Yes, and I think that is what the saints have to be occupied with.
{286}
F.H.B. I think we want to "comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height".
F.E.R. Yes; we need the apprehension of all the extent of these things, of all that which is purposed by the Father and centred in the Son.
A.C. In a sort of way, the world was judged when Christ came into it.
F.E.R. I think so -- "All things that the Father hath" -- it is most wonderful to think of: everything that the Father has is established in the Son -- in the righteous One who is with the Father. It will all come out; I think God will greatly surprise the universe one day. He will set forth a new world in a day. The power of God will set it all forth thus, and for this reason, that all is there, it is all prepared, ready to be revealed. You have "the church of the firstborn", and "the spirits of just men made perfect"; everything is there.
W.H.B. Then the Spirit of God is here to give enlightenment and power?
F.E.R. The Lord says, "He will shew you things to come". I think God would have our hearts to apprehend all that is before Him, "breadth, and length, and depth, and height". God would have us to be in the divine secret. There are two things necessary for us -- the one, entering the holiest; the other, going over the land, where you learn the expanse of all that which Christ is going to fill. I think the holiest is where you learn the secret of God, His resource -- that is, Christ. Then, in going over the land, you get to know the expanse which He is going to fill; that answers to "things to come".
Ques. Will you explain why you must go into the holiest?
F.E.R. I think every one has to learn the resource of holy love. I see holy love in God, but I want to learn the resource of holy love, how God is able
{287}
to make His holy love effectual to fill the universe of bliss. You will never learn Christ in that light but in the holiest.
D.L.H. Is not that "Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith"?
F.E.R. I think so. Christ is the secret of God -- "the hidden wisdom".
Ques. Is the land the Father's house?
F.E.R. It may be, but I think the land is typical of the inheritance. No one is suitable to act as a priest till he has entered the holiest; he is only a believer till he enters the holiest.
W.J. Do you connect this with @Ephesians 1?
F.E.R. I think so. The fact is, that the practical effect of the holiest would be that people would sit lightly to things here. In coming in contact with people, I do not find that they have divine things much in view. See how occupied people are with their health -- very careful of their life here; it would be different if they had Christ before them as the One able to fill everything with the holy love of God.
W.J. "Until I went into the sanctuary".
F.E.R. Yes; when there we find that the best things in the world are really slippery places.
Ques. How does a believer become a priest?
F.E.R. By learning that he is kindred to Christ in the love of God. Then he is a priest; he proves his genealogy. Christ has the calling, and we are priests in virtue of being kindred to Christ.
A.L. Saints by calling; priests by association.
F.E.R. By being kindred to Christ, that is by the Spirit. The priests must also be consecrated.
Ques. Is that shewn in Aaron's rod that budded? (@Numbers 17.)
F.E.R. Aaron's rod budding was the proof of Aaron's priesthood; it shewed that all priesthood must be in the power of resurrection. If a man is
{288}
not on that ground he is not qualified to be a priest as to his own sense of things. It is life out of death.
F.C. What you say would account for there being so little priestly service. If souls do not know this there cannot be priestly service.
F.E.R. I think not. How may people bring the holiest into the meeting? You can hardly find the holiest in the meeting except you *bring* it there. People cannot jump into things when they come together.
T.H.L. You hear a great deal of thanksgiving to the Lord for what He has done, but very little sense of association with Christ.
F.H.B. Then I expect the general thought is the other way about -- not to *bring* the holiest into the meeting, but to *find* it there.
F.E.R. You are not going to find it if you do not bring it; you are not going to reach it in a moment. I think people must have a sense of the holiest, and familiarity with it, if they are going to get it in the meeting. I should think the ideal meeting would be when every saint brings the holiest there. If we eat the bread and drink the wine, it is not to *put* us in accord with the death of Christ, we should be in accord with that death already. Then you realise the presence of Christ. You realise the holy love of God. It is only in the holy love of God that you can realise the presence of Christ, for that is the atmosphere in which Christ abides.
Ques. The priests carried the ark?
F.E.R. So we have to carry God's testimony, but that is not the holiest ... I think we are all fitted in private for the place we take in the assembly. You may depend on it every man carries into the meeting the best he has got. I think the holiest is the apprehension of a scene which is characterised by the holy love of God, and when you get there you find what God's resource is.
{289}
T.H.R. When Christ was here everything was veiled. Now there is no veil: all God's glory shines forth in Him, and we are privileged to be in the light of all God's glory as set forth in Christ.
F.E.R. Exactly.
{290}
THE SPIRIT AS LIFE AND POWER IN THE CHRISTIAN.
@Romans 8: 1 - 27
Ques. Do you connect "Receive the Holy Spirit" in @John 20 with @Romans 8?
F.E.R. I think so.
Ques. Did they then and there receive the Holy Spirit?
F.E.R. I suppose so.
Ques. What about the day of Pentecost, and "Do ye remain in the city"?
F.E.R. I do not think they got the power for testimony.
Rem. They received the Spirit then as the Spirit of life.
Ques. Do you mean what we get in @Luke 24: 49?
F.E.R. No, that refers to what was yet to come. Christ must go to the Father in order to send the promise of the Father, and then they would be endued with power from on high.
Ques. What is the lesson for us in "Receive the Holy Spirit"?
F.E.R. I think the force of it is the purpose of Christ to bring us into association with Himself. Association must depend upon the Holy Spirit. "Go to my brethren".
Ques. Was receiving the Holy Spirit there in the sense of receiving life from the risen Lord as distinct from power?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Is there any analogy between that and @Genesis 2, where God breathed into man the breath of life, and man became a living soul?
F.E.R. I think so.
Rem. The breathing was in connection with resurrection, and the coming of the Holy Spirit in
{291}
connection with ascension. We have the accomplished fact, the Holy Spirit has come now both for life and power.
Ques. Is not "breathed into them" distinct from what follows? Is there not a difference?
F.E.R. No, the one results from the other.
Ques. Is it a presentation of Christ as the last Adam, the quickening Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes, the Lord takes His place as the last Adam.
Ques. Is there not something in the omission of the article -- "Receive [the] Holy Spirit"?
F.E.R. I always thought it was the Holy Spirit, the same as in @Acts 2.
Ques. In @John 10 we have, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly". Do you get it "abundantly" in @John 20?
F.E.R. Something seems to be needed to make them capable of entering into it, and He fits them for it.
Ques. You spoke just now of life in association with Christ.
F.E.R. I connected in my own mind @John 20 with @John 4. It was the water springing up in @John 20, the fulfilment of @John 4.
Rem. It did not spring up then.
F.E.R. How do you know that? I do not doubt it sprang up from that moment. "Continually in the temple, praising and blessing God" -- it was springing up then. That was before Pentecost -- it was life in the Holy Spirit springing up in worship. The point in @John 20 is what Christ said and did, and not what they did. You cannot imagine the Spirit as quiescent. He is going to carry us up to the level of Christ.
Ques. Is it right to say that in @John 20 it is the Spirit of another Man?
{292}
F.E.R. Yes -- the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the Father. It is all one Spirit, but in very different connections.
Ques. Could we have life except in the Spirit?
F.E.R. No one can know the Spirit of life (sonship) until they know the Spirit of God. The great thought is that the Spirit of God is presented objectively, while the Spirit of Christ is presented subjectively. What people need to apprehend is the Spirit of God. God has taken His place here by the presence of the Spirit, who sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts. The Spirit of God is the seal on the believer.
Rem. What is of God is brought in and man set aside.
F.E.R. Objectively God is here. We should be suited to the presence of God. That is the idea people have in taking off their hats on entering a church or meeting-room; there is a sense of being in the presence of One who is there.
Ques. When you say God is here, is it in the church?
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. "There are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all".
F.E.R. @Romans 8 is in contrast with chapter 5. The one gives the state of believers, the other is subjective. In chapter 8 you get the indwelling of the believer rather than of the church. Both are true and collateral. 1 Corinthians gives us the Spirit both objectively and subjectively.
Ques. What scripture is there for 'subjectively'?
F.E.R. "Baptized into one body". The "Spirit of God" refers to the individual. He is the seal on the individual; He sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts; but when you come to the "Spirit of Christ", or "of God's Son", it brings before us the thought of life, eternal life, and the body.
{293}
Ques. Did you say that the "Spirit of God" was objective, and the "Spirit of Christ" was subjective?
F.E.R. Yes, it is presented in that connection. The "Spirit of God" brings God in morally.
Rem. The soul is to be alive to the fact that God is here.
F.E.R. Yes, that is the point, God is here. The Spirit has come to make known the things of God.
Ques. When you believe, do you receive the Spirit of God?
F.E.R. When there is faith in God, the Spirit of God is given. Every one who believes in God has the Spirit. That involves the acceptance of God's testimony. Man must accept God's testimony, and bow to His righteousness.
Rem. In @Acts 10 Peter says, "To him all the prophets bear witness that every one that believes on him will receive through his name remission of sins".,
F.E.R. It does not say "shall receive the Holy Spirit", but "remission of sins"; and while Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon them. What was presented was the reception of forgiveness. In the eye of God they received forgiveness, but they had no consciousness of it till they had the Holy Spirit. The testimony of God is the resurrection of Christ; man accepts that testimony, and he is subdued by the righteousness of God.
Ques. In @Acts 10 what is the point -- "The word which he sent ... preaching peace by Jesus Christ"?
F.E.R. God sent it. There was a different idea of Christ from God in their minds.
Rem. The "Spirit of Christ" is connected with the thought of a risen Man before God.
F.E.R. Quite so. The Spirit of God makes Him known. What is needed is that we should bring home to people the presence of God and how it subdues the man who believes it. "The kingdom of
{294}
God is ... righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit".
Now in the first verse of chapter 8 we are under the control of the Spirit, and not under the law; the governing principle is the Spirit.
Rem. I do not think people believe that the first man is removed.
Rem. And that the Spirit is here to bring in God, and now there is another Man before God.
Ques. Where in Romans do you get the removal of the first man?
F.E.R. In chapter 3, not in 5, though the latter is based upon 3. He has quite disappeared in 8. God is brought in, and Christ; there is no condemnation.
Ques. How came the last clause of verse 1, because it raises so serious a condition?
Rem. There was a marginal note in the MSS. of the early centuries, and this slipped into the text.
F.E.R. The presence of the Spirit of God is what people need to realise. You never get the subjective side if you do not get the objective.
Ques. How would you present the truth?
F.E.R. All Christianity hangs on it; God is dwelling here. The great idea connected with the Spirit of God is that He has brought God in.
Ques. When you say that the Spirit of God is present, that God is present, is it not in the way of testifying that God has approached man in Christ?
F.E.R. If you recognise His presence, it is that which gives character to His house.
Ques. As to testimony, is it not governed by the words. "The Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him"? (@John 14: 17.)
F.E.R. Quite so; hence of necessity you must have God's house as the medium of God's approach
{295}
to man. What characterises the house is that it is where God dwells.
Ques. What is the relation of the assembly to the world? Has the assembly any responsibility towards the world?
F.E.R. The assembly is the pillar and base of the truth, and it has a good deal to say about the truth of the gospel. One great object of God's house being here is that God may approach man. 1 Timothy brings that out. See how it tells, in chapter 2, how men will be lifting up holy hands in prayer, women will be adorned in modest apparel, all suited to the presence of God. God is approaching man, and He will have all men to be saved.
All active testimony is governed by that which is passive; there cannot be the one without the other.
Rem. You get really into the presence of God in the assembly. It is a great thing to present God to the soul. The servants of the Lord ought to have the house of God before them, the building of it up.
Rem. And the unsaved too.
Rem. Yes, but put God first and the other will follow. The dwelling of God goes on into eternity, so that must be the principal thing. It is the great end in view that God will tabernacle with men -- there is the rest of God which remaineth. Jews and gentiles *are* builded together. What we have to do is to bring them into the *sense* of being builded (i.e., those professedly christian, not the heathen) in order to bring them into the reality of christianity.
F.E.R. The evangelist is not happy if he has not the idea of fellowship. There is a great deal more in fellowship than people think. Social life is all very well, but fellowship comes before social life.
Rem. It is fellowship with the Spirit.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Does conversion bring man into the house?
F.E.R. The reception of the Spirit does.
{296}
Ques. In what way does it "grow"?
F.E.R. I cannot tell you. The passage says it does grow. We want more confidence in God's work.
Ques. Would you keep His mind before men, and not tell of His love?
F.E.R. That *is* His love. In @Matthew 13 the net cast into the sea is a parable of the kingdom.
Ques. Is not that outward work?
F.E.R. No, God is taking care of it. The New Translation gives the idea. The net *has been* cast into the sea, and it *has gathered* of every kind.
Rem. The apostles were to go into all the world.
F.E.R. Yes, to preach the gospel, that repentance and remission of sins might be preached in His name.
Rem. That goes on still.
F.E.R. Of course it does. The work of the evangelist all tends to this end, that men shall be brought into God's house.
Rem. You emphasize the distinction between God's own work and God's work by man.
Rem. The presence of God must mean that God is active.
F.E.R. Yes, the blessed God sees fit to dwell, and there is supreme blessing in His house if God dwells. You may not get all the blessing, but it is there. The house was not formed by any labour of man; it was formed by Christ Himself, and the Holy Spirit came to the company which Christ had gathered together. Jew and gentile were builded together.
Ques. What is the building of @1 Peter 2?
F.E.R. The work of God going on in people. We are very slow in coming to the truth of God.
In christendom, at the present day, if a man is not a christian, he is an apostate, be has sold his birthright, i.e., christianity. God still works, and will work, but the present day is tending to apostasy.
{297}
It is of profound importance that God's house is here, and that God is dwelling. If it were realised more, it would have an immense effect on all the details of conduct.
To make God known to men is the true work of the evangelist -- that is the end and purpose of his whole service.
Ques. Where does the responsibility lie?
F.E.R. In a way, the whole assembly is responsible to God. That is where the special character of the house of God comes in. Then there is the responsibility of *gift*.
Rem. You speak of *gift*, I have a great idea of *grace*.
F.E.R. But no really gifted man would ever be a copy of another.
Rem. But there is a danger of making too much of gift, and not enough of hanging upon God.
F.E.R. Leave gift to itself, and make much of the house of God. The evangelist, if he has right thoughts of God's mind, would have the sense in his own soul of the need of fellowship, and the house of God is where he will find it.
{298}
THE SPIRIT FORMATIVE OF CHRIST IN US
@Romans 8: 9 - 17
Ques. I would like to ask why the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Christ.
F.E.R. As far as I understand it, the expression is characteristic. There is another expression in the same verse which may be compared with it -- "Ye are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you". It is the same Spirit, presented in different connections.
Ques. Would you say that the Spirit is formative of Christ in the saints?
F.E.R. Yes, He is the formative power.
Rem. What I think is remarkable with regard to the Spirit is that He did come down upon man here, and He was connected with man in perfection in Christ, and now He can be formative of Christ in us. It is wonderful that He came down in connection with man in Christ. Everything that could be from man to God was there. The Spirit did not add anything to Christ, but He came upon that Man.
Rem. If there is anything in us of Christ, it is by the Spirit's work.
Rem. You could not have Christ without the Spirit, and in the same way you could not have the Spirit without Christ. Here we have the Spirit as life, in Colossians Christ as life. You cannot have life apart from the Spirit or Christ.
Rem. The tenth verse follows the ninth -- "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life .."..
F.E.R. Quite so. The Spirit came down upon the Man before God, and could link Himself with every thought and expression in Him.
Rem. The Spirit identifies Himself with every part of the delivered condition. In the second part of
{299}
@Romans 8 it is the Spirit as distinct from us -- the Spirit of life and liberty in Christ.
Rem. The Spirit of sonship and liberty.
Ques. How is it that the Spirit carries on the formative work in us?
F.E.R. That leads us to the body or the collective thing. The church expresses that in which Christ is seen.
Rem. You do not get that in @Romans 8.
Rem. But it is leading up to that.
Rem. That would not be formed in the church collectively if not in individuals. "The Spirit life". "The perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ". The "perfecting of the saints" is the first thing.
Ques. What does "sealed" mean in the expression, "Him hath God the Father sealed"?
F.E.R. There was only one Man before God who could be sealed. A great many came to John's baptism, and there man (as such) went out of sight, and God immediately put His seal upon Christ. He was the only Man before God.
Rem. It was a mark of God's delight.
F.E.R. Yes, my impression is that man (as such) went out of sight completely before God.
Ques. Would the blood on the leper in @Leviticus 14 bear the meaning that one goes out of sight before the oil is applied?
F.E.R. Certainly. God cannot seal the flesh. It involves practical displacement in the case of believers.
Ques. Is 'sealing' for God, or for us?
F.E.R. For God. It is a kind of manifestation. It answers to the circumcision in Abraham. Circumcision means the cutting off of the flesh. He got it in consequence of righteousness.
{300}
Ques. Does not 'sealed' give a sense of security?
F.E.R. It was a kind of manifestation on the part of God, but it is really my displacement. "*Ye* are not in flesh but in Spirit". The very fact of being sealed shews that.
Rem. Blood is the witness that man in the flesh has been set aside.
Ques. Would you say a word in regard to the flesh in contrast to the Spirit? Will you explain the two conditions?
F.E.R. The flesh is the lawlessness of man, while, on the other hand, the revelation of love brings God in. So far as the flesh is allowed, man is lawless, but then it is contemplated that there would be appreciation of God's revelation. I do not think God declared Himself for nothing; everything for God (so far as man was concerned) consisted in how far God's revelation was appreciated. God asserts His supreme right to come into the affections of man, but man says, 'You shall not'. The flesh, that is lawless man, will shut God out.
Ques. What is the difference morally between the old and the new?
F.E.R. The old man "corrupts itself according to the deceitful lusts", the new man is "after God". The old man is governed by lust, the new man is created after God in righteousness and holiness; he is ruled by the law of God.
Rem. "The mind of the Spirit life and peace".
F.E.R. Yes. Nothing goes on in the moral universe that is not under the influence of moral laws. It is a principle of divine arrangement universally -- everything is subject to law.
Ques. What is the difference between "in Christ" and "in the Spirit"?
F.E.R. It is Christ in contrast with Adam, and the Spirit in contrast with the flesh.
{301}
Rem. The two are identified in this chapter.
F.E.R. Exactly so. I do not think there is any abiding in Christ except by the Spirit.
Ques. Do we get in the expression "in Christ" what is subjective, and "in the Spirit" what is objective?
F.E.R. No, they are both subjective.
Ques. Is it experimental also?
F.E.R. It cannot be apart from experience. Every one that has the Spirit is in Christ.
Ques. Is a person that is "sealed" in Christ?
F.E.R. Yes, in the sealing of the Spirit.
Ques. In the expression, "There is then now no condemnation", is there reference to the condemnation spoken of in chapter 7?
F.E.R. I think so. The ministry of law is the ministry of condemnation.
Ques. Is that an experimental condition of things?
F.E.R. Yes, condemnation is experimental. There is no condemnation "in Christ". Law came in as the ministry of condemnation. Chapter 7 is answered in 8 -- no condemnation. If you are on Adam's line, you are under condemnation.
Ques. Would you explain the distinction between being in Christ in the eye of God, as true of all Christians, and in the consciousness of one's own soul?
F.E.R. A Christian is in Christ thousands of years before he is born.
Ques. Is it "no condemnation" on the part of God, or on the part of one's conscience?
F.E.R. On the part of one's conscience. It is in contrast with what comes out in 7. There are three great questions in Romans to be met -- sin, law and flesh, in 6, 7 and 8 respectively -- to all of which man is in bondage naturally, and the answers to these are, "dead to sin and alive to God", married to Christ, and "not in the flesh, but in the Spirit".
{302}
Rem. You get the answer to the latter part of 7 in the first few verses of 8. Sin and law were looked at objectively, in 8 you get the subjective side.
Ques. I think you have said that the ministry of condemnation existed before law?
F.E.R. Law ministers both condemnation and death; the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
Ques. Will you tell us the difference between "judgment" and "condemnation"?
F.E.R. "Judgment" is more a judicial term, and "condemnation" moral.
Ques. Do we get "condemnation" elsewhere?
F.E.R. I think in "Has no one condemned thee?" Condemnation morally precedes what is judicial.
Ques. I would like to ask a question as to the difference between anointing and sealing in @2 Corinthians 1: 21, 22?
F.E.R. "Stablisheth" means firmly attaches us to Christ; the "anointing" means intelligence in divine things; "sealed" is for the inheritance, and the earnest of the Spirit is the pledge of it. You cannot enjoy the inheritance till you get it, but you can enjoy the pledge. Circumcision was a sign or seal to Abraham, and the Spirit is the seal of righteousness, the putting off the flesh, which must be cut off. The Spirit means that to the christian.
Rem. Mr. Stoney said that what @2 Corinthians 1: 21 conveyed to him was power, security, intelligence, and enjoyment, all by the Spirit.
Ques. What is the difference between Christ being in you, and your being in Christ?
F.E.R. Christ being in you refers to the practical condition of the Christian. "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness" (verse 10).
{303}
Ques. What is the force of the body being dead.
F.E.R. It is held in the place of death. The Spirit is life in view of righteousness, we come under the sway or law of God. Righteousness is the law of the moral universe. You are withdrawn from lawlessness. You cannot separate righteousness and life.
Ques. Would you say that righteousness was consistency with relation to God and man?
F.E.R. I would not say that exactly.
Rem. Practical righteousness is doing the law of God.
Rem. It is what is due to God and us in consistency with the relations between us.
F.E.R. It is not a question of relations.
Ques. "The Spirit is life on account of righteousness". Does that mean "in order that there may be" righteousness?
F.E.R. It is expressed in righteousness -- but in the enjoyment of it, you do not get life apart from righteousness. It is the well of water springing up. You love God with all your heart and your neighbour as yourself. What lay behind the law was the love of God, though Israel did not see it. He commanded them to love Him and to love their neighbour. We can see the love of God coming out through all Scripture. When man is righteous, all will be fully carried out.
Ques. Will that be in the millennium or in eternity?
F.E.R. In eternity. There are the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
Ques. Do others besides the redeemed, such as angels, know the love of God?
F.E.R. I do not think angels know it. All this leads on to eternal life; a great deal hangs on "the Spirit of life".
Ques. Will you explain the difference between life and eternal life?
{304}
F.E.R. The Spirit is a well that springs up into eternal life -- the Spirit brings you into it. You cannot separate life and eternal life. Eternal life lies the other side of death. In association with Christ you reach the other side of death. You cannot bring Christ to this side of death.
Ques. Is verse 14 characteristic?
F.E.R. Yes. You have the Spirit of sonship before you come into the reality of being sons of God. Sonship brings in the idea of association with Christ. Many a child of God knows it, but has not arrived at it in its reality.
Ques. What is the difference between a child and a son?
F.E.R. Every Christian is a child, and the Spirit bears witness. Sonship means association with Christ where Christ is. The Spirit of sonship is connected with both, but He is spoken of as the Spirit of God's Son.
Ques. Would you explain verses 9 and 10 -- the *Spirit* in you, and *Christ* in you?
F.E.R. They are two distinct things, it is the Spirit as life and the Spirit as witness to bring in the consciousness of association with Christ.
Ques. What is the Spirit of adoption, verse 15?
F.E.R. The Spirit of sonship; a Christian who has the Spirit is led on to sonship.
Rem. If he does not grieve the Spirit.
F.E.R. I think so.
Ques. Does Romans lead as far as eternal life?
F.E.R. No; but it is on the road to it.
Rem. "The end eternal life".
F.E.R. The moral end -- it led in the direction of eternal life. If you reach Christ where He is, you reach eternal life. The Spirit has come to conduct us to where Christ is, not to take us to heaven. It is Christ who takes us to heaven at His coming. We
{305}
are either raised or changed, but, in the meantime, the Spirit conducts us to Christ where He is now.
Rem. We are risen with Christ.
F.E.R. Yes, risen and quickened.
Ques. Would the Spirit be represented by Joshua -- to lead into fellowship with Christ's death, circumcision, and the old corn of the land?
F.E.R. Yes. Christ comes to us, but not in the wilderness. He makes advances to us. "In the midst of the assembly ..".
Rem. "I will come to you".
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. That is the holiest?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Where do we spend the rest of the week?
F.E.R. In the wilderness, where you have the help and support of the Spirit. "The kingdom of God is ... righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit". Priesthood comes in in sympathy and succour of the Spirit. We become conscious of the love of God through the Spirit.
Ques. Do we get to Canaan?
F.E.R. If you come to Christ, you come to Canaan.
Ques. It is not heaven?
F.E.R. No. I am sure the Spirit of God would lead us there. We are in a scene of distance down here. It is no part of God's purpose, but His ways, as J.N.D. said. We have to come under it. The other side is in connection with the High Priest.
Ques. Canaan is not corporate?
F.E.R. Well, I think it is. The Spirit brings in the body -- "In the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body". That is evidently corporate.
Rem. @Romans 8 does not go so far as that.
F.E.R. No, it does not go beyond what is individual.
{306}
Rem. You set immense store upon the assembly.
F.E.R. Well, I do. It is the light of God's purpose. The body is the great subject of the purpose of God for the moment, "the edifying of the body of Christ". You come into the scene of glory where divine love can rest, in complacency, on all that is before Him.
{307}
SANCTIFICATION IN RELATION TO RECONCILIATION
@Hebrews 9: 24 - 28; @Hebrews 10: 1 - 25
Rem. It has been suggested that we should look a little at sanctification in relation to reconciliation.
Ques. What is the meaning of sanctification?
Rem. The primary thought is of setting apart. The earliest mention of it is in @Exodus 13. "Hallow unto me every firstborn". You get shelter in chapter 12, sanctification in chapter 13, salvation in chapter 14. It is looked at from two sides, positional and practical, absolute and progressive.
F.E.R. I should like to hear a little more of what you say.
Rem. First you are brought into a new position, and then into a new practice.
Rem. It involves that you are separated to God, a new person altogether, not merely being brought into a new place.
Rem. If you do not begin with Christ in sanctification you have not the scriptural thought. You have, "I sanctify myself", that is positional, it is a new position. He is gone up there.
Rem. There is a verse too in @John 17: "Sanctify them through thy truth".
Rem. The two sides are so distinct and clear. How do you look at it?
F.E.R. I accept pretty much what you say, but I do not very much like 'positional'. I think I know what you mean. Sanctification is in another Man -- positional in a sense. The point to me is that Christ is sanctification. He "is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption". Sanctification is in another Man. It is important to see that sanctification does not apply in connection with the wilderness, but with the
{308}
service of God. It is being set apart for the service of God, having boldness to enter the presence of God. It is more a complete setting apart for God, the whole body, soul and spirit being preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord.
Ques. Is sanctification connected with approach?
F.E.R. Yes; I think it is being set apart for holy use.
Ques. What do you mean by being set apart in another Man?
F.E.R. Christ is sanctification, hence it is through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ.
Ques. Do your remarks apply to every Christian blessing?
F.E.R. Yes. "Both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one"; but then sanctification is in another Man.
Ques. What is the difference between consecration and sanctification?
F.E.R. Consecration goes further than sanctification. In consecration the hands are filled, which is not the idea in sanctification. The latter is the recognition of being set apart for holy use.
Rem. You could not be set apart in the flesh.
F.E.R. It involves "the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all". The meaning of that is, apart from the flesh.
Rem. That is bringing in reconciliation.
F.E.R. It is very near akin. Sanctification is our part, and reconciliation is God's part. Sanctification is by the will of God. Waving the sacrifices appointed before the Lord (@Leviticus 8: 25 - 27) with the hands full is connected with consecration. Sanctification is preparatory to consecration.
Rem. You could not get consecration without sanctification.
F.E.R. I think not.
Ques. Would you say a word on reconciliation?
{309}
F.E.R. Sanctification is on our part, and reconciliation is on God's part. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them". We have to be set apart for the service of God.
Rem. That is the subjective effect of the truth upon us.
F.E.R. Yes; but sanctification is not only that. "By which will we have been sanctified".
Rem. It is absolute in Christ, and progressive by the Spirit in us.
F.E.R. It is progressive in one sense, but Christ "is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption". Blood is the witness of death -- sanctification is by the death of Christ, "through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all".
Rem. You might have external sanctification without being really in it.
Rem. A kind of sacramental sanctification.
Rem. In @Acts 26: 18 Paul was to go to the gentiles "to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me". The "sanctified" were the remnant of the Jews who had inheritance by faith in Christ, and we have part in it too: "Fellow -- citizens of the saints, and of the household of God". We are associated with the remnant amongst the Jews.
Ques. Would the passage in Acts explain @1 Peter 1? The saints take the position in which Peter addresses them.
F.E.R. Exactly.
Ques. In @Acts 20: 32, "inheritance among all them which are sanctified". Were those only the remnant?
F.E.R. All believers, whoever they might be.
{310}
Ques. Where does @Colossians 1: 12 come in? "Has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light".
F.E.R. It is inheritance with the *saints*, whoever they may be. In order to enter into it, you must take into account the facts in @Hebrews 9. First, Christ has gone into heaven, "now to appear before the face of God for us". Then, "Once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for the putting away of sin by his sacrifice", and He "shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation". There is no revival of what is connected with our responsibility. Every liability has been met, there is no revival of sins.
Ques. Why is that in connection with sanctification?
F.E.R. To bring out that there is another Man. You cannot revive the Victim -- the Priest has been revived, but the Victim is gone, and the one for whom the Victim was offered is gone too. The conscience is perfected for ever by that one sin-offering.
Ques. What is conscience?
F.E.R. It is the link between the old and the new, between what we were and what we are. Hence, "By one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified"; they are perfected in regard to conscience.
Ques. What is the force of "perfected in perpetuity"?
F.E.R. The conscience witnesses that there is no imputation for ever -- in perpetuity, without break; not in reference to *time* exactly, but in the sense of continuity.
Ques. "Their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more". Is it to the conscience that the Holy Spirit witnesses?
{311}
F.E.R. The point is, the conscience is in the line of the Spirit.
Rem. The Spirit gives us to know now what Israel will know in the future.
F.E.R. Exactly so. There are three points: the work of Christ, the will of God, and the witness of the Spirit.
Ques. What is the conscience in an unconverted person?
F.E.R. It is the witness of error.
Ques. Not the knowledge of good and evil?
F.E.R. No, it is distinct from that -- conscience is a witness-bearer.
Ques. What is an evil conscience?
F.E.R. When conscience witnesses evil. A good conscience witnesses good -- you might say where there is no consciousness of conscience.
Ques. Has a man any power over his own conscience?
F.E.R. No, except to dull his conscience. In a continued course of evil, it ceases to bear witness, it becomes seared.
Ques. Will you distinguish between conscience and a knowledge of good and evil?
F.E.R. The effect of the conscience bearing witness is the thoughts "accusing or else excusing one another". This is consequent on the conscience bearing its witness within.
Ques. Did both come in from the fall?
F.E.R. No; I think that from the outset there was a certain sense of good and evil, but they got the real sense of good and evil from eating of the fruit of the tree, and then the conscience bore witness to it.
Returning to the subject of sanctification, the central figure of it is Christ. The sanctifier and the sanctified are all of one. "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God", and "By the which will we are
{312}
sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once".
Ques. What is the will of God?
F.E.R. All the pleasure of God. It includes God's bringing many sons to glory. That is a great part of His will, and Christ is the Leader of salvation. "By the which will we are sanctified" involves that we are apart from all that which came to an end in the death of the Victim. It is so important to see that there is a revival of the Priest, but not a revival of the Victim. God "condemned sin in the flesh". I have to accept that the Victim is gone.
Ques. What do you mean by the revival of the Priest?
F.E.R. Christ was the offering Priest. He offered Himself, and viewing Him in that character, He, of course, still lives; while, viewed as the Victim, He took the place of the sin-offering.
Rem. The sanctified ones are set here for the pleasure of God.
F.E.R. But not apart from the Sanctifier. Many make it individual, and leave out the Sanctifier.
Rem. And then they get self-occupied.
F.E.R. Christ was the *offering* Priest, not the high priest. He was not in the high-priestly place. The Lord offered Himself. He left the whole scene by the actual offering of Himself here on earth.
Rem. For one moment Christ was both Victim and Priest.
F.E.R. Yes. The sacrifice has been offered, and there is now no revival of the Victim, but the Priest is revived. He has "appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself". We have not yet sin actually put away, but we have got the sacrifice, and now Christ has gone to appear in the presence of God for us. The putting away of sin is a public thing for the universe.
{313}
It is wonderful to me that there is One introduced who is to give effect to the will of God in its whole extent. If people realised that, it would result in a complete deliverance. It is not Christ as Saviour, but as Head. "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God". He is the central figure in the will of God. Some limit it to the work, but to me it is the Person. He becomes the expression of the will of God. Everything depends on Him in the new heavens and the new earth. The whole thing is held together in One who became Man -- in Him as Man every company and everything is held together as one.
Rem. That is, reconciliation is brought in.
F.E.R. I think so.
Ques. What do you understand by reconciliation?
F.E.R. Reconciliation is the heading up all things in Christ. All distance is removed, that God may have complacency. Christ fills the whole place -- that is the great point.
Rem. "I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me ... that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day".
F.E.R. Yes, the last day will bring it all out.
Ques. Is a sanctified company a worshipping company?
F.E.R. I think so.
Rem. Israel will be a sanctified nation, set apart from all nations on earth, a holy nation.
F.E.R. Yes, separate from all nations.
Ques. To go back a little, what is justification?
F.E.R. I thought all were clear as to that.
Ques. How far does it go?
F.E.R. A man is cleared in the eye of God from every liability.
Rem. But I thought it was that he was accounted righteous.
{314}
F.E.R. Not in a positive way.
Ques. What is the difference between forgiveness and justification?
F.E.R. Justification goes farther than forgiveness. There is no imputation. "Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity". It is not *positive*, but "justification of life" is positive -- *life* is positive.
Ques. What is the difference between sanctification and holiness?
F.E.R. If you were holy, you would not need to be sanctified.
You have this thought of sanctification in regard to Israel, a people with God's sanctuary in their midst -- the principle runs through Scripture. The will of God equally applies to Israel. In the meantime, we are as a sanctified company, and "he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one". We therefore have "boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus". We are identified with the Sanctifier; the sanctified are worshipping priests because they are sons. We have sanctification in Christ, and by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once. We are apart from the flesh, and at the same time conscience is perfected for ever.
Ques. Could you present briefly the distinction between reconciliation and sanctification?
F.E.R. Sanctification applies to us that we may be set apart from the flesh and the world in connection with Christ, while reconciliation brings in the will of God in regard to all things, that God may have complacency in all things.
Ques. What is the meaning of progressive sanctification?
F.E.R. I do not know. Perhaps -- -- will explain.
Rem. Progressive is connected with progress. There ought to be progress in the things of God.
{315}
We ought to be more practical than we were years ago.
F.E.R. I am doubtful about progress in sanctification. I think the more you enter into divine love the more *holiness* is promoted, but not sanctification. The latter is in the will of God.
Rem. We are set apart for a purpose.
F.E.R. I think so. Everything depends on the One who is the Sanctifier. Holiness may be promoted, "perfecting holiness in the fear of God".
Rem. "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord".
F.E.R. Yes. It seems to me that everything goes on in the saints by the knowledge of God. He is the spring of everything.
{316}
THE WRITING OF GOD
@2 Corinthians 3: 1 - 18
It is evident that what the apostle had before him when writing this passage was not what saints knew or might know, but what was *written* of God in them. That which is written is permanent, while that which a man knows may pass away. *Writing* is the great point in this chapter.
The Corinthians were a letter of commendation to the apostle, and that because there was the writing of Christ in their hearts. It was this thought of writing which led the apostle on to speak about the new covenant. The old covenant (that is, the ten commandments) had been written on tables of stone, but the new covenant is written in the hearts of the saints.
Now what God is concerned with is that which is written in our hearts, not what we know; of course we must know, for the mind is the eye to the heart, but what is written is indelible, being by the Spirit of God. What is written is of course what you have known, but the point is that what is written by the Spirit of God is ineffaceable. Many christians are eager about and content with knowing the truth, but God is bent upon that which is written in the heart.
There are two sides therefore to ministry -- the objective side, that which is presented to the saints for the enlightenment of the soul, and that which is effectuated in us by the Spirit. The latter is in a sense the answer to the former. The apostle is speaking here of that which the Spirit of God had written in the Corinthians. Memory may enable me to retain an address, but what is effective and abiding is that which is written in me of the Spirit. "The same anointing teacheth you of all things"; this refers
{317}
to what is written on the fleshy tables of the heart. The writing of the living God cannot be effaced; it is that which will remain with us for eternity.
Now I will refer to what *is* written. In @Hebrews 8 we get the terms of the new covenant, namely, "This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel ... saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: and they shall not teach every man his neighbour ... saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more".
Here we have the *terms* and the people with whom the covenant is to be made -- the house of Israel and the house of Judah; but my point in turning to the passage is because it shews that God's laws are to be *written* in their hearts. This will be so in order that they may be a reflex of His mind, and in a sense of Himself, and that every one of them may have individual knowledge of God -- "*all* shall know me, from the least to the greatest". Another point comes out in the last verse, "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old". So that it is *enduring*, will not become old; there never will be another to succeed it. Now you will observe that these three thoughts come out in the chapter we have read. The apostle speaks of himself as minister of the *spirit* of the new covenant, not of the letter, and tells us that the Lord is the Spirit.
The new covenant is contrasted with the system which ministered death and condemnation. The ministry in the new is of the Spirit, or life, and of righteousness, and its glory is enduring.
The first covenant was an external system, under which, if the people could have abode in it, they
{318}
would have maintained themselves in relationship with God and thus have lived; but it was none the less, when spiritually known, a ministration of death. The law brought death home to a man. As we read in @Romans 7, "When the commandment came, sin revived, and I died". The first covenant was never God's pleasure, had it been so it could not have been superseded; but at the same time the pleasure of God was hid in it, so the apostle speaks of the *spirit* of it. Now in Christ there has been upon the earth a perfect reflex of the mind of God in a man. I speak of what the Lord was down here -- a perfect reflex morally of God.
I direct your attention to such a psalm as the sixteenth, where we see a perfect answer to the goodness of God. This is the spirit of the new covenant, that there should be a reflex of God down here. Israel, so far, will be this when the law is written in their hearts. When Christ became man He said, "Yea, thy law is within my heart", and this principle will be fulfilled in Israel hereafter; they will love God with all their heart and their neighbour as themselves.
Now in regard of christians it is not the law written but Christ written, and for this reason, that Christ has been here under the eye of God, the perfect reflex of Himself; and that therefore nothing inferior to that will suit God now. It is by the Spirit of God that Christ is written in the heart, and Scripture shews us the correspondence of christians to Christ. Turn to @John 1: 18, "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". Now in @1 John 4: 12 we read: "No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us". In these two passages we get precisely the same introductory clause. "No man hath seen God at any
{319}
time". There was first the perfect declaration of God in Christ personally, and then in christians we get the continuation of that which came out in Christ; that is, a perfect reflex of God in His moral being -- the expression of the love of God. That is what is to come out in christians. Christ's disciples were known by having love one to another. That is what is to be written in the heart, and if so it will come out in our ways; thus it is that Christ is the Spirit of the new covenant. It is easy to take up the letter: injunctions as to the conduct are the letter, and that kills -- but the Spirit quickens, and "the Lord is that Spirit". Whether in the present or in the future every family will take its character morally from the One who was God's reserve, and in whom God could be perfectly reflected in a man here.
It is in the apprehension that the Lord is the Spirit that a man is made alive. It is when Christ is appreciated as last Adam that the Spirit quickens. Underneath the letter you get what was the mind and thought of God, and that is that there should be a perfect reflex of Himself here, and this is what came out in Christ.
Now holding truths would not effect this, and indeed nothing short of what is written. We are acted upon by the expression of what God Himself is, as revealed in Christ, namely, grace and truth and goodness and love. It is as we appreciate that, we are affected and formed both Godward and in our walk and ways one towards another.
I turn now to another point which is very important, because it conveys the thought of individual dealing of the soul with God. "Much more doth the ministration of *righteousness* exceed in glory". Righteousness -- that is, the being justified in God's sight -- involves the individual application of God's grace to myself. "All shall know me, from the least to the greatest. *For* I will be merciful to
{320}
their unrighteousness". I know what I have myself been, and appreciate God's dealing with me in grace. And thus it is that I acquire an individual knowledge of God. Now this is the second term of the new covenant; that which is connected with the ministry of righteousness. The first term refers to what is moral in the reflex of God here, and this is the most important point with God, but the second conveys the thought that I have the privilege of knowing God in grace for myself.
Now I will speak of the last point, and that is that the new covenant is enduring. "If that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious". That in which God had no pleasure could not abide, and for the reason that what does not touch the heart effects nothing for God.
It is not my *mind* that God places value on, but the *heart*. The first covenant did not secure the affection of Israel; but the second covenant will, and for this reason the first had to come to an end. The new covenant is morally perfect, and therefore does not come to an end. It is in every way excellent, it is according to the will of God, it is that in which He has pleasure, and which answers His own proper thought -- that is, men here morally the reflex of Himself, and individually knowing Him. Nothing that is moral -- that which is of the work of God in saints -- will ever pass away. If we see an aged saint like Simeon, in whom a foundation has been laid of God, and who has received light from God, and who has left himself in the formative hand of God, we can estimate the moral structure built up and perfected. Do you think that is going to pass away? It will abide; Christ is written in lines which cannot be effaced, for they are engraven by the Spirit of God. There is nothing more blessed than to think of the work of God in a man -- first laying a foundation, and then building up a spiritual
{321}
structure, making and bringing to result that which will never pass away. It will remain when the outer man perishes!
What is written is of Christ, and that as the expression of what God Himself is -- for God is going to be all in all. The apostle prays in @Ephesians 3 that the saints may comprehend "what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge", and what for? That they may be "filled with all the fulness of God", that is, that there should be nothing of God morally lacking in saints down here. The Ephesians were to be the reflex of God down here, and this was to be brought about by their being "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith".
Now do not be content with what you know. The apostle was concerned about what was *written*, and that was Christ; and because it was morally perfect it was enduring.
I add one more word in connection with the glory of the Lord in verses 17 and 18. This came out on the Mount of Transfiguration. Peter speaks of Christ having received of God the Father honour and glory -- the recognition of who He was, and the expression of infinite delight in Him. What is the effect upon us of beholding that? It is a moral transformation. If I enter into that perfect satisfaction of God which has found its expression in Christ I am lifted up above all down here. "Are changed into the same image". Christ was exalted as man to the right hand of God, to the infinite satisfaction of God. We behold this -- we see who He is, and what He is, and the practical effect is that we are lifted up in moral superiority to everything that would affect and influence us down here.
{322}
"UNTO THE GLORY OF GOD BY US"
@2 Corinthians 1: 20 - 22
In chapter 4 of John's gospel the Spirit springs up to everlasting life, while in chapter 7 the effect is rivers of living water flow out. We get the glorified Man in chapter 7, and here in @2 Corinthians 1 all the promises of God established in Him. The Spirit is the witness to the glory of Christ and in that way we are in connection with all that is living, the living God -- Jesus glorified, the Son of the living God, and the Spirit of the living God, the church of the living God, and the service of the living God. We are in the apprehension of all that is living in virtue of the well of water springing up, and then you get rivers of water flowing out, and that in a scene of death. People make very little count of death, but death is here.
The idea of a living God is connected with all that is of life. Christians may die as to us, but all live unto God. He is, not was, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. We have Jesus glorified; that means that every promise of God is established. In the Old Testament there were promises (David's throne, etc.), but there was no man in whom they could be taken up, and that is the subject of Stephen's defence. The patriarchs all died, but Stephen looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus. He saw the Man, and Stephen could rejoice amid the threats which surrounded him. You could say of Stephen that out of him rivers of living water flowed; you get his testimony. He said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God". The infidelity of the present day is against the *Man*. In this country the existence of God would generally be admitted, there are few atheists;
{323}
the infidelity is against Christ, against the Man. It is exactly the spirit of antichrist, and the liar, which we get in John's epistle. Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?
People in acknowledging God are in a way content, they satisfy their consciences, but the point is that there are promises which have been given from time to time, and how are these to be fulfilled? Well, the Man is there in whom these are to be taken up. The patriarchs all died to whom the promises were made, but they have all to come out in connection with the Man glorified, with Jesus glorified. What would have been the gain of the Spirit to men if there had been no Man in heaven? He could not have been here to set up the flesh and therefore there would have been no gain to us until Jesus was glorified; then He comes as the Spirit of another man, He is the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus. Everything must come out from the right hand of God. The glory of Jesus is all bound up with it. The glory of God requires a man according to that glory, otherwise it could not be displayed except as withering man up in the presence of it. A Man has to come in who can stand in the presence of the glory, being Himself the righteous One, and He can take up man's liabilities. We can only be in the presence of the glory of God as we are in Him, that is, being partakers of the spirit of that Man. The glory of God is connected with the heavenly city in the future, and the world will get the gain of it through the city, but it is the heavenly city which is in accord with the glory, and it becomes the medium of the glory of God; through it the earth becomes filled with the glory of the Lord.
The first great thing in the passage read is that all *centres* in the *Son of God*. The whole of the promises are to be enjoyed in the church, they have their confirmation, their yea and amen. They are centred in
{324}
the Son of God, but they are brought to pass in the church, and so it is "unto the glory of God by us". All the promises are taken up in the church. The promises were not made to the church: they all had reference, not to Abraham nor David, but to the seed of Abraham and the seed of David, and therefore to Christ. But then they are taken up in the church, for the church is Christ; it is His body. The idea connected with the bride is that she comes into all that belongs to the bridegroom. Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it that He might sanctify and cleanse it -- a glorious church. It is according to Himself and fitted in that way for the glory of God and it shares in that way all the glory of Christ. What the bridegroom will come into the bride will come into. We can see how all the promises are to be fulfilled. We see the Man in whom they can centre. Redemption is accomplished, and He is the Son of God in whom the promises are established. We come into it now in the knowledge of that Man. I cannot conceive anything more wonderful than that there should be a Man who can abide in the full blaze of God's glory: He is the effulgence of it -- the righteous One, and we are of that Man.
Nothing gets into the glory except what is according to God's glory. You have to be outside all that is unsuitable to it to enter there. In the measure of the Spirit's work in us we are according to God's glory. If we can divest ourselves in mind from all that is not according to God in us, and take account of ourselves according to what is of the work of the Spirit, then we are according to that glory. The great thing is to bring people into the consciousness of being according to God's glory. If I think of myself as a child of God I am looked at as down here, where we may come under discipline because we are not according to that glory, but if I would
{325}
take account of myself according to the Spirit's work in me and exclude from my mind all that is not of the Spirit's work, then I should be according to that glory. This latter, that is, to exclude in our minds what we are as after the flesh, is the practical difficulty. In resurrection bodies we shall take account of ourselves only according to what we are in connection with the Spirit's work in us. There are not many moments of our lives when we come to that, but it is possible. In the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus we may be so absorbed as to exclude all that is not of the Spirit's work, and thus realise what we are as according to God's glory. Stephen did not enter into the holiest, but he saw it. Paul saw it and entered it. He gives it to us. When Paul was caught up, that was heaven -- not the holiest -- the holiest could not exist in heaven. The idea of the holiest is you are in the presence of the secret of God -- we are in the light of what is a secret to all the universe. His wisdom, the mercy-seat is there; the ark of the covenant is there, the secret of God's ways is all laid bare in the holiest.
Entering the holiest is a question of state. You do not enter by the mere fact of coming together in assembly. It is purely and simply a question of state. The holiest is not a place, it is a question of state. Entering heaven is entering a place, and all will enter there. There is no gainsaying that entering the holiest is a question of state. It is as risen with Christ and quickened together with Him, in your mind you have put off the body of the flesh; you divest yourself of all save what is the Spirit's work in you, and thus you enter. The idea connected with the holiest is moral. The holiest is not a type of heaven. We have the antitype of the holiest now. In the world to come God will have come out in all the glory of His ways. The Corinthians did not enter the holiest; what went on in their meeting was
{326}
a scandal. Christ comes to us in assembly, and we go to Him; we leave all that is connected with the court of the tabernacle and our everyday life to go to Him in the holiest. The holiest is the apprehension of all the secret of God. You worship God in the sense of the profound wisdom of His ways. Worship has for that reason a peculiar character at the present time, different I think, from what it will be in heaven. It is a great help to me to get an idea of the thing. While the Lord comes to us you must remember that you have to leave your present place of responsibility in the world, you have to join Him where you can be on common ground. The disciples when they went to the upper room were on the ground where they could meet Him. The Supper is the meeting-place. You meet Himself there. The Lord intends the Supper to be the meeting-place, and there He sings praises to God and we are associated with Him, so He leads us into the sanctuary. Aaron's sons had to be in accord with their father. If Christ is to take the place of Aaron He must be surrounded by those who are of Him: they must be according to Him; a stranger could not be there. Quickening is not knowing and believing that you are alive, but that you are consciously alive. The disciples called the Lord to mind in a way we could not for they had been with Him. We could not in the same way. Beholding the glory of the Lord is more connected with the covenant than with the holiest. In the holiest you come into the presence of the Man in whom God can approach man, and with whom God will fill the universe.
In christianity the principle is that you get what you are prepared for; if you seek you will find; and if you ask it will be given to you. People get what they want; it is all a question of asking and receiving and seeking. We pray for a good many things, the question is do you want them? If you really want
{327}
things you will get them. The Lord Jesus when people came to Him answered the man, not the man's question. If we had a true sense of the ruin of the church it would have a great effect upon our prayers. If we had the sense of what the church is as the vessel of testimony and how it is hid and obscured here, it is bound to have a great effect upon us. We never learn wisdom except in the holiest; then you learn divine wisdom. The holiest is the apprehension of what you see there, and it affects you so that you praise and worship. As a child the love reaches me down here, but there is another thing, I am in a world of confusion and I am athirst to know and understand the secret of His way. We learn this in the holiest. It is most wonderful that God can address Himself to me in a Man who has taken up the liabilities which lay on man and who will yet fill the universe. You have got the secret of all that God is going to do in a Man. Forgiveness of sins is the end of every man forgiven. It is the last word that God has to say to him. Anointing is connected with intelligence -- it is divine teaching -- teaching of the Spirit. God is hid now behind a veil of providence, but God will put aside all that and He will come out. Providence will come to an end. Angels at that day are ascending and descending on the Son of man. They will be attendant upon the Son of man on earth. When He was here on earth angels were attendant on Him, and, I suppose, they will be manifestly so in the world to come.
{328}
THE TRUE SEAL OF GOD
@Acts 15: 1 - 35
In the progress of christianity in the world we find when we get to this chapter that things were somewhat changed. Jerusalem is no longer the scene and centre of the Spirit's activity, as it had been at the outset; but yet some authority was still recognised as connected with Jerusalem.
The question which was referred to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem arose at Antioch. Antioch seems to have become the scene of the Spirit's activity.
According to the account given here, it was the brethren who proposed that Paul and Barnabas should go up to Jerusalem; but in the Epistle to the Galatians we learn that Paul in going up had the mind of the Lord -- he went up by revelation.
The point raised was whether it was necessary to circumcise the gentiles according to the law of Moses. Judaisers could not deny their conversion and blessing; but they wanted to impose the law of Moses upon them -- the yoke which neither their fathers nor they had been able to bear. It was a subtle effort of the enemy to spoil christianity by proselytising gentiles, and I want to get beneath the surface of the effort and to shew the meaning of it and its application to us. The effort was practically to deny the presence and power of the Spirit. From the outset there had been efforts in different ways to set aside the power of the Spirit, and to what end? To make room for the flesh. There cannot be place both for the flesh and for the Spirit; these, we read "are contrary the one to the other", the one does not allow the other, they are mutually exclusive. The fact is that the Spirit was not communicated until the state of man in the flesh had been closed
{329}
for God; and that was in figure set forth in the brazen serpent.
This great question, then, had to be fought out first at Antioch, and then at Jerusalem. The effort was virtually to make christianity a Jewish sect; but the truth was that with God all was new in the power of the Spirit, and that thus there was no difference between Jew and gentile. The Jew believed in the Lord Jesus, and so too the gentiles, and consequent upon believing, they had both received the Holy Spirit. The power of the Spirit was practically to set aside Jew and gentile -- as in the cross every man had been removed from before God.
Barnabas and Saul had been sent out on a missionary journey from Antioch, and they had now returned to report all that God had wrought by them. Special good had been wrought of God there, and for this reason the enemy made an effort to mar and spoil the work. Now through grace the difficulty that had arisen was wisely settled; had it been settled at Antioch it might not have satisfied the Jews; so the question was referred to Jerusalem, and then word was sent down to Antioch that no burden of law should be imposed upon the gentiles.
It is noticeable that the wiser men did not speak until after the "much disputing" (verse 7). Simon then declared how God had made choice that the gentiles by his mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe, and that God bare witness, giving them the Holy Spirit. Then Paul and Barnabas declared what "miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them". James afterwards brought scripture forward to substantiate the blessing of the gentiles, showing that even in the millennium the gentiles would be blessed, and would not need to be circumcised. The real mischief at work was, that while contending for the form and shadow, there was danger of losing the substance --
{330}
the moral force of circumcision was lost by insisting on circumcision in the flesh. The judaising teachers who were pressing this had their own end to serve in doing so. They wanted to save the flesh, and as a result the power of the Holy Spirit would be set aside; so too in our day, by training and education and ordination, men are supposed to be fitted for the service of God. But these things neither fit a man to be a priest toward God nor a levite toward men.
Circumcision was a seal, but only typical. The apostle Paul speaks of it in @Romans 4 as a seal of righteousness. It began with Abraham; there is no trace of it before that, and in Abraham's case it was "a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised". A seal attests or confirms. God put a seal upon Abraham, and it was a confirmation on the part of God of Abraham's righteousness. So now, God puts a seal upon the christian. A believer in the Lord Jesus Christ is sealed, not by circumcision but by the Holy Spirit. Where the power of the Holy Spirit is you get complete circumcision -- the putting off of the body of the flesh. Thus circumcision is in spirit, not in letter. A man when converted believes in the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God, and God in imparting the Spirit puts His seal on him, and the effect is this, that the truth of the Lord Jesus is confirmed and established in his soul. Then it is by the Spirit of God that we *confess* Jesus as Lord.
There was in circumcision the idea of *cutting off*; yet at the same time it recognised the *man*, or order of man, who was circumcised. Circumcision literally recognised the man after the flesh, although in the form of it there was the cutting off. Now when we come to the seal of God in the gift of the Holy Spirit there is no recognition of that man -- the man has been cut off for God in the circumcision of
{331}
Christ, and the office of the Holy Spirit is to practically set aside in the believer what has been cut off for God. The presence of the Holy Spirit in the believer means true circumcision; and the Spirit is at the same time the Spirit of another order of man. When a man receives the Spirit he is in Christ, that is to say, he has received the Spirit of another Man, and hence the Spirit will not allow the man after the flesh. This is of the essence of christianity. The one man has been cut off as before God, and the Holy Spirit given to the believer. God's ways are bound up with two men -- one has been removed and another brought in. If you do not see this, you will never understand christianity according to the mind of God. The effort all around is to make out that man as man is suitable to worship God, and to serve man down here, and that, even apart from the power of the Holy Spirit. Man as man does not appreciate God, and if that be so he can neither worship God, nor serve man according to God; and the first point of appreciation is the righteousness of God. There are many estimable people, amiable and exemplary in their homes, who cannot bear the idea of righteousness of God, and yet that is the first principle in man's relations with God -- man being a sinner. How then can man worship God? People speak of God as being love and as almighty, but I should like to ask them, What do you think about God being righteous? Man does not care for God's righteousness, nor does he find pleasure in the power of God, nor even in His grace.
Now I ask, How can a man worship a God whom he does not appreciate? Worship is the fruit of appreciation of God according to what He is revealed to be. It is when the believer receives the Spirit that he so appreciates God as to be able to worship and serve Him, and then only can he serve man
{332}
according to God. Many will do great things nowadays -- devoting their wealth -- seeking to serve God and man with their natural powers. God is not served in that way. Man may be endowed with great natural powers, and yet have no appreciation of God. Do you think that a man could be a good evangelist if he did not worship God in the Holy Spirit? It is only when a man serves and worships God in the power of the Spirit that he can rightly represent God to man.
Now if I do appreciate God, that means that I am of another order of man; I have the Spirit of another Man and He completely sets aside for me the man after the flesh. I have to learn that flesh is no good for God. I could not serve God in the best things of flesh, nor do they assist in the appreciation of God. Supposing that the Spirit of God came upon a man and enabled him to accomplish great feats, such as Samson did -- that could not in itself give him the appreciation of God: but having received the Holy Spirit the believer has the appreciation of God not only in His righteousness and in His power, but in His love. Our relations both to God as priests and to man as servants have to be carried out in the power of the Holy Spirit.
The effort of the judaising teachers was to revive an antiquated seal in order to maintain the status of man after the flesh, and thus to blind saints to the fact that in the cross man had been completely cut off for God. The Holy Spirit will put no sanction upon flesh, but sets Himself against it, and forms the believer according to that Man of whom He is the Spirit. It is true that many of the duties which attach to the life here do not belong to the order of life in which Christ is. We have not yet completely done with the things of flesh, but the point for us is deliverance from the rule and control
{333}
of the flesh, so that our souls may be governed by the appreciation of God.
It is not difficult to see the subtlety of the enemy in insisting on the antiquated seal in order to set aside the power of the true seal. May we give more place to the Spirit of God!
{334}
THE REVELATION OF GOD
@John 2: 23 - 25; @John 3: 1 - 17
Some may think the purpose that I have in my mind is rather pretentious, as the object before me is to show the connection between various parts of truth in Scripture -- how one step in advance leads to another. It is easy to take up detail of truth separately, such as the end of man, the kingdom, the church, the righteousness of God; but there must be a connection between all these, and this connection has to be made good in the soul of the believer, and in this light I want to show you how one part of truth leads on to another. The truth cannot remain disjointed; it forms one whole, and it is in the soul of the believer that it is to be put together.
I begin at the beginning -- the revelation of God, and that which is dependent upon this, namely, the kingdom of God, for the kingdom is the necessary outcome of the revelation, and the effect of the kingdom is to bring you into the light of the church; and the church leads to the testimony. It may be difficult at first to understand how the kingdom leads to the church, but I hope I shall be able to make it clear to you before I have done. But I confine myself now to the beginning, namely, *the revelation of God*. What comes out in connection with the revelation of God is the removal from before God of one man; for the testimony of God is bound up with the death and resurrection of Christ. In the death of Christ, God Himself is revealed; and in the resurrection His pleasure as to man comes out. But I confine myself now to the death of Christ. The resurrection brings in the light of the kingdom and the church, and in the
{335}
death of Christ we see that where God was revealed the old man was removed.
Now these two things are apparent in the scriptures before us; in the end of chapter 2 we are told that Christ knew what was in man, and that He did not trust man -- what was to become of the man to whom Christ could not commit Himself? It is clear that *that* man must come to an end; but in chapter 3 we get the thought that another man was to come in and that that man was to be formed by the revelation of God; the old man was to be put off, and the new man to be put on by the christian. But this could not be, had not God removed the old man.
Now this truth is presented in Scripture in an objective way as truth in Jesus, that we may see it, but what has been effected in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ has to be made good spiritually in the believer. Now the blood is the witness that man in the flesh is gone from before God; the blood is the life, and if the life is gone the man has no longer place; the blood of Christ is the witness that the man has been removed sacrificially -- "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh". Reconciliation is brought in because the man that had brought in the distance between God and man has been removed; and that for the glory of God. The man has been removed vicariously from under the eye of God, in the Son of man lifted up. The worst point about man was that Christ could not trust him. You would have thought there might be some good in man when his mind was convinced through the miracles -- no, he is like a bent bow, which goes back again; he acknowledges the miracles, but he is not to be trusted.
Nicodemus comes to the Lord as convinced by the miracles, he says, "Thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that
{336}
thou doest, except God be with him"; the Lord meets it by saying virtually that there must be another man; the cross is the removal of one man sacrificially, and in it, too, God is revealed. We hardly get a full gospel until we come to Paul; he preached that Jesus was the *Son of God* -- how otherwise could we understand that in the cross one man could be removed, and the formative principle of another brought in -- Christ was alone competent to take that place, for He was the SON OF GOD -- only He could do it. It is in the cross that we learn the heart of God; that God made a real revelation of Himself. In a friend I should not be content to know some of his qualities, or even his mind -- I want to know his heart. Now it is in the cross that you learn the heart of God. The love of God was expressed in the Son of man lifted up -- God commends His love towards us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Christ came out from God to declare the heart of God; not only His righteousness. We do not understand the heart of God save as we learn it in the cross of Christ. When Christ died the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. The Jewish system depended upon the veil -- God was hid -- and therefore when the veil was rent, the system was gone, for the testimony of God had come into man's lowest point. None of us have come to that yet, but into that *lowest* point of man here, death, the testimony of the love of God came. When Abraham prepared his sacrifices and parted them in twain, an avenue was made for something to pass through; it is a foreshadowing of where the love of God came to light; the smoking furnace and the burning lamp passed between the pieces. The old man is gone, but the love of GOD is there -- IT has not gone. The man was removed, but the love in which that man was removed *abides*.
{337}
Now I come to this, that whatever *is* formed for God here, is formed by the testimony of God's love; from the time that we receive the Holy Spirit the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts; and that love becomes the formative principle of the new man. The christian has believed the gospel, but he has been born again: that is the first thing; afterwards he is enlightened by the testimony of God's love as expressed in the death of Christ, and the Spirit by that love forms him in the new man. There has been the removal of the old man, but the love of God which remained is the formative principle of the NEW MAN.
Now I come to the *necessary consequence* of the death of Christ -- if He goes into death, He *must come out of death*; resurrection was in His case a necessity; He *was* the resurrection; He could not be holden of death. That God raised Him from the dead is God's testimony, when it is a question of His having been put to death by wicked hands; but when the question is of what He is personally -- He IS the resurrection.
Now two things are consequent on His being raised -- first, He must be exalted; and, secondly, He must send the Holy Spirit. CHRIST goes to the right hand of God, and that attests that He IS the SON OF GOD. Also the fact that He baptises with the Holy Spirit proves that He is the Son of God: "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God"; who but the Son of God could communicate the gift of the Holy Spirit? Do you think God is going to do anything now save through the Son? Now it is just those two things which bring in the kingdom -- the kingdom of heaven is introduced in connection with Christ's exaltation, and the kingdom of God in connection with the power of the Spirit. These two are distinct thoughts, but they have to come together in the soul of the believer. If there
{338}
is a Man at the right hand of God, He must have dominion over everybody. And as surely as I look up to Him, I shall get guidance and light amid the darkness here. If I want to go over new ground, I do not traverse it in pitch darkness, I wait for the light of the sun; so as a christian I see my way through this world only in the light of the Lord. As surely as I look to the One at the right hand of God, I get guidance as to service, and as to all that relates to the will of God.
The other side of the kingdom is that we get support down here; the sway of the Lord in heaven is effective in that we get direction from Him, but the Spirit is the support of the believer down here. We have righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit; I do not much concern myself about eating and drinking, for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink. I need these for support, but the kingdom of God means other things. God has established the throne of grace in the Man of His pleasure, in the One who has removed the old man and in whom God has been revealed. It is a mercy that I am not left here to find my way through the world as best I can, but I am free to look up to heaven from whence I get light, so that I need not miss my way; and, having the support of the Holy Spirit here, I am maintained in righteousness, and peace, and joy. The reign of grace, which is the moral force of the kingdom, is established in the One who is at the right hand of God, He is Lord to us now; other lords have had dominion over us, but we own Him now alone. The kingdom was established when He went to the right hand of God.
{339}
SERVING AND WAITING
1 Thessalonians
It is always interesting to turn to the first Epistle to the Thessalonians to see what one may call the simple effect of the truth on minds that had been educated in things very different from christianity. The apostle recognised the fact of their election, so that it is evident there was in them a very real work of God. This was the basis on which any enlightenment of mind rested. One may reasonably suppose that the saints themselves had the sense in their souls of being subjects of the sovereign mercy of God. God had from the outset chosen them. This is a very important point in the history of souls. The first impression produced on men by the word of God must of necessity connect itself with their sense of responsibility, and this is right, and is met by the grace of God. But the reception of the Spirit as the seal of God must inevitably sooner or later bring in other thoughts in regard of God. Moses had to learn in reference to Israel that they could exist only through the sovereign mercy of God. And the same thing must come home to all of us. The proper effect of it would be to produce the sense that we have no title to live to ourselves, that the claim of God is absolute. In this way we are marked off from the world, it has ceased to have any claim on us, we are a people sanctified to God.
All the world bore witness to the reality of the work in the Thessalonians, which was evidenced by their attitude toward God and His Son. This serves to make plain what the apostle had preached among them. The Son of God had been revealed in him that he might preach Him as glad tidings among the heathen, and he had evidently preached Him in this way among the Thessalonians. It is to be noticed that not only had they turned to God from
{340}
idols, but it was to be in bondage to a living and true God. They had been in bondage to dumb idols, or rather to what lay behind idolatry. The same kind of bondage exists in our day, for men are in bondage to the great Babylonish system around us, in which man has his glory, and which is maintained by the god and prince of this world. And this is the great agency for blinding the minds of men lest the light of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine for them. The Thessalonians had turned to God, not with the mere idea of escaping from the abominations of idolatry, but of being bound to the God who had revealed Himself to them through the gospel. I think it is evident from this that they must have been deeply impressed with the sense of what God is. The light of a living and true God had come home to them. They could be in bondage to such an One without suffering moral degradation. And to be in bondage to Him proved that there was moral affinity. Bondage to idols proved moral affinity, and the same principle holds good in regard to bondage to God. The great foundation on which christianity is built is that God has been pleased to reveal Himself, and that in His Son; hence it is evident that the only God that can be known is a living and true God. In the Old Testament we have hints now and again of a living God, but God did not make Himself manifest in that way, though there were witnesses to it; but in the presence of the Son of the living God, He is revealed in that light. He is a living God in relation to man, and man is to be in relation to a living God, and therefore discharged from the penalty of death under which he is labouring. If we apprehend God as a living God, it is the proof that we stand in relation to Him as such. "Living" is not a mere abstract idea, descriptive of God, but a characteristic of Him in what He is in relation to
{341}
men. This is made good in us in the writing of Christ, by the Spirit of the living God. If God is revealed as a living God, the question is legitimately raised, in what does He live, that is, morally? The answer may be, in the activities of love. And thus He is made known to the heart of the believer by the Spirit of the living God. God commends His love to us, in that, while we were sinners, Christ died for us. And thus God is known, and we are bound to Him by the very force of what He is. This all hangs on the fact of God having been livingly revealed, and of the Spirit being here to make the revelation good in the heart of the believer. And the Spirit does not design to make a mere transient impression, but one that is being continually deepened, so that bondage becomes more complete. But the fact is that bondage to what is infinitely and divinely perfect is compatible with perfect liberty. This was in the mind of the Thessalonians, and should be the effect of the gospel on all that receive it. To suppose that any creature can stand in absolute liberty is out of the question. God is independent of any other being, and, being love, maintains consistency with His own nature; but any creature must be bound by the sense it has of God, or it is lawless. Bondage to a living and true God is our portion now, since God has been revealed on earth in this light.
But there was another thing that characterised the Thessalonians, and that was *waiting*. It was part of their faith. The gospel had made them acquainted with the Son of God, and if He had been here once, it was possible that He might come again. More than this, it is morally a necessity that He should come again, in order that He may be glorified in the scene from which He has been rejected. He has been raised from the dead as witness on the part of God that He has appointed a day in which He will
{342}
judge the world in righteousness. The lawlessness of the world has well-nigh run its day, and the moment is not far distant when God will take up all the threads into His own hands. The principles of the kingdom have been witnessed in the ministry of the Lord down here, and when the heavenly city is complete then God will manifest the kingdom. In view of this there must come wrath on the world, for the world has no design to allow God to take the kingdom. It will seek to hold its own. It appears to me that the language of men means that God must limit Himself to heaven, and not interfere with man on earth -- it is for man to order things there. Hence wrath is coming on the world. And as far as saints are concerned, if they had to wait to the coming of the wrath they would have no power to take themselves out of its application. But the Son of God is known to them, the One who is the Firstborn among many brethren, and they await Him as Saviour. He is our Deliverer from the coming wrath, and I judge the way of this is in conforming us perfectly to Himself, so that we should be in every way suited for the courts above. Thus we await the Son of God.
We have seen the simplest elements of christianity realised in those who were young in the faith in such a way as that they were marked by them. And the same things remain unchanged in regard of us. We need to be roused from the lethargic influences around. Christendom has long given up the coming of the Lord, and is using the word of God to serve its own ends; and it behoves every one who has been really affected by the gospel to seek to get back to what marked the saints in early days. The power for that lies in the knowledge of God as He has revealed Himself, and in the appropriation of the Son as the expression and witness of our blessing, and as having power to completely conform us to Himself.
{343}
READINGS AND ADDRESSES ON SOME OF THE TEACHINGS OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN (1)
@John 6: 59 - 71
All I have to say to you, beloved friends, is of a very simple character (but I trust it may lead each of us into what may be real, practical results), to speak of the power of Christ to attract us and to attach us to Himself. It is not to believe certain doctrines, but what is connected with our relations to Christ, being actually bound to the Lord with the sense in our souls of it; the sense must be there and there is no real sense of it until we are attached.
The next step follows, He leads us to go in, we have access by Him; and the third step, He establishes Himself in our hearts so that we may witness for Him.
Each of these three steps is essential. There can be no knowledge of God without attachment to Christ. He has accomplished redemption to deliver us from this present evil world.
Who is the One here free from the world of sin? It can only be said of one Man, and that is Christ; so salvation must be in Christ, not in any one else, the salvation which is in Christ Jesus.
There are other steps equally important to conduct us to God; we may not be very far on the road, but wherever we are it must be very real to us, and thus we should be witnesses for Him, Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith. Then we shall be morally qualified to be witnesses for Him. It all comes down from above. We find the holy city, the new Jerusalem, spoken of as coming from God -- the Holy Spirit has come to us from God. We have been
{344}
taken in, so to speak, that we may come out as witnesses down here. Now there are two points to which I wish to call your attention. One is Christ as our attraction, and the second is that we have to be attached to Him. All must begin with attraction to Him. The Lord indicates that Himself when he says, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me". To use an illustration which I do not altogether care for, the thought conveys the idea of a magnet. Christ is the magnet which attracts hearts to Himself; there must be something in Christ which attracts. Attachment to Him we have to learn. The attractions in Him are vast and varied, and a long time must elapse before we can learn all the attractions.
When the Lord was down here He was a point of attraction to a great many; they were attracted to Him in a wonderful way. We know that some, while attracted to Him, did not walk with Him, but there were those who were not only attracted but attached to Him; they were held to Him by a wonderful power. It is needless for me to give examples, many will come to your minds, but I just refer to the disciples, and then there were many women mentioned, and we know at the day of Pentecost a hundred and twenty were gathered, attached to Him, and held to Him notwithstanding His death.
In Christ there is nothing to hold the natural man. Thus in @Isaiah 53: 1 - 3 the estimate of the natural man: "He hath no form nor comeliness ... no beauty that we should desire him ... he was despised, and we esteemed him not".
These things mark the natural man's estimate of Christ. Now we find another thing: in @Luke 2: 52 "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man". In looking at this we have to remember this was said of Him before He entered into His ministry -- before He came out publicly in
{345}
connection with His word and works. It is only there He can be really known.
I know there have been knight-errants for Christ, for one raised up in their imaginations, and it is very possible to have a Christ of the imagination, not the real Christ; the truth of the matter is that no one can know Christ save through His death, apart from what His death expresses. It was the great expression of Himself.
I know He was the Sin-bearer, but I am not just now looking at that side of things; but His death was the perfect expression of Himself. So we announce His death, and when He comes again He will come unto salvation. No form nor comeliness, there is nothing to appeal to the natural man. He never fitted in with the orderings of this world, as people born into the world are fitted into the positions they are born into as they grow up; but Christ was morally outside of all, and man did not, could not, esteem Him.
One of the temptations presented by Satan was the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them; Satan is the god of this world.
The other point I wanted to bring before you is the power of attachment to Christ. He was the perfect expression of the grace of God, and is, because He is the same yesterday, today, and for ever. His position has been changed, but morally He is the same and will be so for ever, and He declares it, because He came to declare His righteousness; and we have to remember there is the righteousness of grace as well as that of the law. John the baptist preached the last, Christ preached the righteousness of grace. He was here to talk about grace, and He not only talked about it but He was the perfect expression of it. He was full of grace and truth. He was the living Bread which came down from heaven. It is a very great point to me to see
{346}
what is in the heart of God. Christ was the embodiment of what is in the heart of God to man.
@Luke 7: 41 - 50. God is presented to us here as the Creditor; there are two debtors, and He forgave them both; that was surely an expression of grace; grace to frankly forgive when they had nothing to pay. The mind of the Creditor to both debtors was the same.
Simon did not apprehend it, but the woman did, and He says to her, "Thy sins are forgiven ... go in peace". She had, so to speak, the Spirit given to her as a witness. What is true is, the mind of the Creditor was the same towards both debtors. All here would admit the expression of God's grace to themselves, but the wonderful thing is, God's mind towards all debtors is the same. Christ proved a great point of attraction to that woman. She was a suitable object for grace, and she apprehended the grace that was present in the Person of Christ, and I do not think she was ever detached from Christ again.
The same thing is true of us; the finest man in the world is nothing in the eye of God. No man, whoever he may be, can make amends to God. There is nothing in man that can enable him to pay his debt; he has nothing to pay, and, this being so, all alike are fit objects for God's grace, and His attitude is alike to all. "Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins".
Now to pass on to another point of attachment. God and man have been brought together. In the incarnation of Christ God has been brought in touch with man. The Son of God became man; He was not going to abide alone, others would be associated with Him. I see an illustration of this in @John 1: 47, etc. In speaking of God and man being brought together I ought to have referred to a verse in 1 Timothy: "For there is one God, and one mediator
{347}
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus". The Mediator brings God and man together.
There was no mediator in the promises, for they were all on one side. In regard to God and man, two parties, a mediator was required. What has really come to pass, God and man have been brought together by the Mediator, and it means we are brought into attachment to the Man. "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit". Now Nathanael in @John 1 had that Man before him, a despised Nazarene, as he at first saw Him. And yet, after all, He so attached Nathanael to Himself that he has to own, "Thou art the Son of God". Thus we have a picture, God and man brought together in the one Man. Every one here ought to be able to apprehend that God and men have been brought together.
People talk of men and their doings, but there is only one Man before God; He is Head of every man. Now there is another point in regard to the power of attachment to Christ, and that is that He has taken up man's cause to be the vessel of blessing to man. Now for this I will give you an illustration in @John 12: 1 - 8. We get a contrast here to what we had in @Luke 7. There the woman washed His feet with her tears. Mary in @John 12 anointed the feet of Jesus, a very great token of her affection and attachment to Christ. She appreciated Him knowing who He was. She would remember Him as the One who had raised Lazarus out of the grave, and yet saw in Him the One who was going into death to take up the curse in order to be the appointed vessel of blessing; the true Isaac, the vessel of Abraham's blessing to bless the nations. @Galatians 3: 13, 14.
The thought presented was that death could not hold Him. He dispossessed death of its power; it could not remain in His presence one moment, but He went into death to take the curse under which
{348}
man was; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit.
Now these are three important points I have endeavoured to bring before you:
(1) Christ, the expression of God's grace to every man.
(2) God and men have been brought together in one Man, the Lord Jesus Christ.
(3) That He has taken up the curse under which men lay in order to be the appointed vessel of blessing to men.
You will remember He left this earth in blessing the disciples. He abides in the same attitude. Did you ever consider what blessing involves? I can tell you what curse is: man under the curse withers, like the fig-tree the Lord cursed; under blessing there is enlargement, the consciousness of divine favour, expansion.
Now another point: all we want in the way of help and support is found in Christ. The capability to heal and support man is all to be found in Him. He gives to us living water, springing up to everlasting life. @Luke 10 gives us an illustration on this point. The Lord used to speak in parables because He had to deal with unbelief.
The parables required an expositor, and He was the expositor. Now in this passage we get the neighbour, and what comes out in the neighbour is the character of mercy, he "went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast". What we find is this, that we want a great deal more than forgiveness of sins. He gives us the Spirit to accomplish His purpose in us in order to bless us. When has any one conferred things on us like this?
Suppose a person were to give you a million, what is it worth in sickness and death? It may enable you
{349}
to have doctors and comforts and all that sort of thing, but what is the worth of these things in death? He can pour in oil and wine. He can bind up our wounds. He can heal, He can support, He ministers the Spirit and carries us along the pathway here. And no doubt many of us can testify thereto.
Just one point more: we have the Lord presented to our hearts as the Centre around whom are gathered all the counsels of God.
See in @Luke 24: 26: "Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?" You find a parcel of foolish men attacking Scripture; they do not in the least understand the scope and meaning of it, or the purpose of it, and it is a poor thing to attack that which a man does not understand. To me it is one of the most wonderful things that we should have the Scriptures written at different times by different men, yet all through there is one central figure, the One who is the Centre of all divine counsel and purpose. He is to arise the Sun of righteousness, the Fulfiller of the mystery of His will; God's purpose will thus be made known in Him. He is the Centre of all, and He is capable of heading all things. It is a very great thing for us to have these things made known to us, "He opened to us the scriptures". Think of the Lord expounding the scriptures: from Genesis to Malachi they testify to Him. He is the central Figure of the books of Moses, as in the Psalms and the prophets. As He said, "Search the scriptures". I think the effect of all this would be greatly to establish the hearts of the saints. The proofs of Scripture must be its own evidence. Scripture is the test of faith. The ground of faith is Christ. The Spirit is now the expositor of Scripture. I believe, if we take up things in this way, it would enlarge our thoughts of Christ, and greatly attract us to Him; we should be bound to admire Him.
{350}
It is perfectly wonderful that all has come out in Him, and then He has attached us to Himself after having attracted us to Himself, so that we may have Him dwelling in our hearts by faith, and that He might have the affections of our hearts.

@John 10: 1 - 42
In the present time we get everything that can be secured to us and maintained in us by the Spirit of God. This marks the present time, so that we have no lack: everything is maintained by the Spirit; but on the other hand it is a time of testing for the saints. It is not like the time to come, the time that shall be when the Bridegroom comes, and the time of testing will be over.
Every blessing must be according to the pleasure and will of God; that must be the source of everything. Every thought for man has its origin in the pleasure of God; that is why the Lord Jesus said, "I come to do thy will". Then, too, the blessing is secured and maintained in Christ; that is very important; and in regard of us, every blessing must be witnessed to us by the Spirit down here, by whom everything comes to us. There must be the witness of the blessing down here.
Forgiveness of sins is also in the pleasure and will of God; it is secured in Christ and witnessed to us by the Spirit. We do not get the witness until there is faith in Christ, then we have forgiveness of sins. While it is true that there is a point where the blessing is secured, yet in ourselves and without there are not a few contrary elements; our surroundings affect us. If an angel came into the world, nothing would affect him; but with us there is so much that is kindred to it, hence it is that we are affected, and hence it is that faith has to overcome the world, and faith has to be maintained. It is a time of testing for us, and will be as long as the Lord is absent. God
{352}
will come out in light, the Bridegroom will come, and then it will be a time of sight instead of faith.
What leads me to speak of this is that one great test now is fidelity to the Shepherd; following the Shepherd is a very great point. The church is a kind of connecting link between the past and the future; one example of this is in regard of the law. God cannot set aside the great moral principles of the law, though He has set aside the covenant. The law was given to Israel and they did not fulfil it, but now we get the righteousness of the law fulfilled in us, "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit". It will be fulfilled in the world to come.
The church comes in as a connecting link in the ways of God between the past and the future in order that there may be no lapse. The righteous requirements of the law are maintained when the Spirit is in the church. In the world to come it is part of the new covenant. There are many other ways in which the church is a connecting link; it is "a holy nation", and thus comes in, in a sense, as a nation. As Peter says, "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light". Paul, too, speaks of Christ having redeemed us from all lawlessness to "purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works". The kingdom, too, is manifested now in the church and will be re-established in Jerusalem, so that we get the thought of a city also.
In this scripture we get the thought of the Shepherd, the flock, and eternal life. Of old the flock was Jehovah's flock. He led them by the hand of Moses. David, too, was a shepherd of God's people. The divine idea of a king is seen in a shepherd. Who is first exposed to danger? The shepherd. That characterised David when all Israel were affrighted
{353}
and trembled like an aspen leaf, and he went before the people and met Goliath. Israel was Jehovah's flock; they did not always prove faithful to their Shepherd, as in the case of Absalom. Their fidelity was tested by the way they followed the Shepherd.
Now we have come to a time of a shepherd and a flock. Christ is the Shepherd. He is Jehovah. It is Jehovah's flock, and we have the true David. Jehovah will have His flock in Israel by-and-by, as we see in @Psalm 95 and @Psalm 100. You get that thought coming out continually in regard of Israel. These psalms are prophetic and celebrate Jehovah's coming in, and in the meantime the thought of the flock and the Shepherd is maintained in the church, and our fidelity is tested. We have the true David, the true Beloved, which is the meaning of the name David.
Another thought is eternal life, which was a promise in the Old Testament, and now we are brought to eternal life. The promise of eternal life will be fulfilled in the coming age to Israel, but we are brought to it because we are brought into the presence of eternal life in the Father and the Son by the Spirit. The more you think of it the more you will see that the church is the connecting link. There is the possibility of everything for us in the power of the Spirit, but many a believer misses everything. They are believers, but are defrauded of their inheritance; they allow the world and other things to come in and defraud them of everything to which they are entitled; but everything is possible to us in the power of the Spirit. God has taken pains to secure everything to us where it cannot be vitiated. May we be diligent, so as not to miss anything which God has established in Christ Jesus for us.
Looking at verses 9, 11, 14, and 16, you will notice three thoughts: first, Christ is the Door; secondly, He is the good Shepherd; thirdly, the chief
{354}
Shepherd. We enter in by Christ as the door, and thus we enter in to God, for Christ is the revelation of God, and He has accomplished redemption that we may go in to God and be saved, come into liberty, go in and out and find pasture: salvation, liberty, pasture. Now having entered, we come to the thought of the good Shepherd, and that is continuous. He proves Himself the good Shepherd, laying down His life. He was the first to encounter the power of evil, as David did Goliath; the wolf is the power of evil.
In connection with the thought of the good Shepherd I desire to press what is of great importance, and that is the individual knowledge of Christ. We cannot know Christ collectively, it must be individual. We cannot live on meetings, formalities, ministry; He knows each one individually, and would have one know Him individually. In the present day nothing can be more vitally important than individual knowledge of the Shepherd. Each one of us has to see to it that we cultivate our relations with the Shepherd. Each one of us needs diligence to cultivate fidelity to the Shepherd.
There is the greatest possible gain in the knowledge of the Shepherd, for He never forsakes the sheep. The idea of "flock" is to follow the Shepherd. If you follow the Shepherd you do not settle down except for pasture; you do not settle down on your lees.
After David had slain Goliath the soul of Jonathan was knit to David, he loved David as his own soul; he felt that David was the man. We ought to have the same affection for Christ as Jonathan had for David, and then we shall be prepared to abdicate every natural right in order to be true to Christ, our David, our Beloved. Jonathan failed in fidelity to David, he clung to Saul; the natural tie came in, and he fell with Saul on the mountains of Gilboa. But
{355}
Christ laid down His life for the sheep. May we be prepared to forego every natural tie, so as to be in fidelity to Christ.
One flock and one Shepherd is a very great test to us in the present day. Fidelity to the one Shepherd means standing apart from everything which hinders, and which is accredited in christendom, and which denies the thought of the one flock, one Shepherd. We are all tested by this, and we ought to prove our fidelity. If there be one flock and one Shepherd, I cannot be identified with what in its government and constitution is a denial of the flock. All believers are tested by the one flock and one Shepherd. In Israel there were twelve tribes, but only one flock. It was a bad day for Israel and the beginning of the end when they were divided into two nations. Elijah at Carmel took twelve stones, recognising the whole nation, and thus proved his fidelity to Jehovah. Elijah was a faithful man, and recognised the unity of Israel. It is a mark of fidelity to the Shepherd at the present time to recognise the unity of the flock. It is a great point to cultivate our relations with the good Shepherd and to prove our fidelity to the one Shepherd.
Verse 28 has reference to the present time. "Perish" has no reference to the future, and in heaven 'plucking out' could never occur, so that the passage only refers to the present. You get a great contrast between Paul's ministry and that of John. Paul says very little as to eternal life, because he conducts us into the land of promise on the line of divine counsels; but John brings us into the greatest thing that can be established here on earth. Paul is on the up line, taking the saint to heaven; John is on the down, as it were, because he brings God down to earth. We have the full light of God the Father revealed in the Son.
{356}
In Matthew, Mark and Luke the Lord connects eternal life with the coming age; in John with the present. How can that be? Because John brings us into the full light of the Father revealed in Christ. John brings us the full revelation of the Father and the Son, the full light of God.
There are three things essential to life in natural and in spiritual things -- rule, atmosphere and light. All these conditions have come to pass. The Father is revealed in the Son; nothing is hid, there is nothing more to be revealed -- the word of God completed, light is provided and rule, and we are brought into attachment to Christ. We are not lawless, we are under the influence of rule, and God has given us an atmosphere down here where spiritual life can be developed -- the circle which is pervaded by the Spirit of God. The Spirit is here to maintain this, and Christ's circle is attached to the divinely appointed centre, and the spiritual life can thrive in the full light of the Father and the Son. Whatever people have in themselves it is impossible for any creature to live apart from the conditions that God has appointed. None but God Himself can live without conditions.
How does Christ give to us eternal life? He has given to us all that is necessary, so that as born of God we can live and thrive. By the Spirit of God we are brought into the full light of divine love. As spiritually born of God we have all we need to support life. The newborn babe is born into the atmosphere within and without, and also the same in regard of rule and also of light. If we abide in the light, the light abides in us.
The instincts of people are often beyond their intelligence. These are conditions in which the flock can live spiritually. There will be a blessed day in the world when the atmosphere will be the greatest possible contrast to the atmosphere of lust and pride
{357}
which characterise the world now. The flock belongs to the earth, and is composed of Jew and gentile in sanctification of the Spirit. Christ has given to His flock eternal life in influences maintained down here by the Spirit of God. Saints have been injured because they do not give full place to the Spirit of God. You are under obligation to do this and to look to it that you do not hinder the Spirit from making good to you all that God has to give us at the present time.

READINGS AND ADDRESSES ON SOME OF THE TEACHINGS OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN (3)
@John 12: 1 - 50
In these chapters witness is borne to Christ as the Son of God in the raising of Lazarus, then to Him as Son of David and King of Israel, and then to Him as Son of man. When the Greeks come He says: "The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified". In @John 1 also the three titles come together; in verse 34: "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God". In verse 49 we get Nathanael saying that He is the King of Israel, and in verse 51 angels are to be seen ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
The Son of man is also seen in @Hebrews 2. "We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels ... crowned with glory and honour". The title Son of man is generally in the gospels connected with suffering. Now He is set over all the works of God's hands, and supremacy is the thought connected with the title Son of man, as seen in Hebrews, @1 Corinthians 15 and @Ephesians 1. God's Man is set forth in the place of supremacy, hence in @John 1: 50 it is: "Thou shalt see greater things than these" -- that is, thou shalt see Him as Son of man set in the place of highest authority -- supreme. The Son of God is seen as the last Adam in life-giving power in John's gospel. The promises come in with Him as King of Israel. In Luke you get more the view of Him as Son of man. In @Psalm 2, where you get the expression, "Thou art my Son", it presents Him as begotten in time, and there is the thought of authority over the nations.
In @John 12: 20 there was a combination of circumstances which bring before the Lord the thought
{359}
of the Son of man, and the glory connected with that title, and at once it is seen that all must be on the ground of His death, on the ground of redemption. You get the Son of man glorified in the end of chapter 13; suffering and glory are brought together in the thought of the Son of man. The Son of God is seen as last Adam in life-giving power in Lazarus: the sickness was "not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby". You do not get the thought of the Son of God in the Old Testament; there the thought is of *one* God.
The title Son of man is connected with the *world to come*. It is the divine answer to the corruption of man; He is God's Man and is the answer to all the evil that Satan has brought in. In @Revelation 12 you get the man child caught up to heaven -- the rapture -- and the devil and his angels cast out of heaven as the result.
Then we get the Son of man lifted up; He must be lifted up; He is the only-begotten Son of God, and it is that whosoever believeth on Him, etc.; everything centres in one Person, and He is Son of God, King of Israel and Son of man, and at last *all* things are put under Him. When Satan is bound then the Spirit can be poured out upon all flesh.
In the case of the apostle Paul, we find that as soon as he had been blessed he preached Jesus in the synagogue that He is the Son of God; it is there that you get the full thought of God as regards man. He became Man to that end that He might express God's thought as regards man. In the title Son of man you get the thought of complete security, because all things are put under His feet. In the title King of Israel you get the thought of God's fidelity to the promises. In the title Word of God the thought with me is that of wisdom incarnate -- the
{360}
Word was made flesh. We are instructed in the knowledge of God, that is our education.
The existence of lawlessness down here calls in question the righteousness of God. In @Romans 9 to 11 we have taken up the faithfulness of God to Israel. These two questions, the righteousness of God and His faithfulness to Israel, are taken up in the epistle to the Romans, and both are seen in Christ. He was the expression of the righteousness of God and of His faithfulness to Israel, and He preached the righteousness and declared the faithfulness of God in the great congregation. (@Psalm 40: 9, 10). The world is an awful scene of lawlessness; and righteousness and faithfulness are established in Christ.
Israel is now seen entirely scattered, but they are to be gathered, and Christ in heaven is the answer to the promises to the Jews that are apparently broken; but all are established in Christ. So in Him we see the complete expression of the righteousness of God and of His faithfulness to the promises. Christ too is wisdom, He is the resource of God. Wisdom is justified of all her children. The woman of the city, who was a sinner, showed that she was a child of wisdom by making much of Christ -- it is *wisdom* to do this. "I lead in the way of righteousness", that is wisdom. I should not like to be without Christ. A man may be rich, or he may be a man of genius, but he really has nothing at all without Christ. To justify wisdom you must be in the path of righteousness. In verse 25 it says: "He that loveth his life", etc.; we must be in accord with the death of Christ; the one that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal, that is present: "him will my Father honour", that is present too; our present recompense for devotedness to Christ is life eternal and to be honoured of the Father.
{361}
The great thing with us is that we fail in abiding in Christ; the one who abides in Him does not sin; that is a wonderful word; in that way it is possible not to sin. People's wills dictate their movements, but if Christ dictates your movements you cannot sin; on the other hand, the one who is just dictated to by his own will, the one who "sins", has not seen Him or known Him, he is not a child of God at all. As to our pathway here the question is what course will give me the most liberty with Christ, what course will enable me to be most free with Christ; our view must not be limited by the present, we must go beyond the present. Christ is the real standard of right and wrong. We want wisdom, and wisdom's ways "are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace".
It is the state of the church undoubtedly which has made the question of eternal life so obscured; you want an atmosphere in order to enjoy eternal life, and that is dependent on Christ's circle; so the state of the church, and Christ's circle being so little known, must have a great effect on the question of eternal life.
In the beginning of Acts you see Christ's circle in its blessedness; the atmosphere was good, and hence the questions as to eternal life which are raised now would not be raised then. The great preservative from the world is found in Christ's circle; monkery does not shut out the world, but in Christ's circle a person, as we may see in the beginning of Acts, passed from death unto life -- from a bad atmosphere into a good one. In the beginning of Acts eternal life was understood and no question was raised about it; we on the other hand are painfully affected by the state of the church.
Verse 31. Christ comes in as the centre of attraction and the world is judged; He was lifted up in *testimony* to the love of God. In old days
{362}
the serpent lifted up was the witness of the mercy and love of God to man. He gives living water; the cross is brought in, God taking up every liability under which man was. Man was under the curse; lawlessness came under the curse of God. Judgment does not come in till man has set up a rival to Christ. So the love of God is toward man -- sin is condemned in the flesh.
{363}
READINGS AND ADDRESSES ON SOME OF THE TEACHINGS OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN (4)
@John 13: 1 - 38
Christ is about to take up a new position. He came from God and went to God. As He is gone we are under obligation to wash one another's feet; we get it referred to in @1 Timothy 5: 10, "if she have washed the saints feet", that is, if she have ministered spiritual refreshment and blessing to them. Feet-washing was a common thing in regard to a guest; it is refreshing: "if she have washed" signifies if she have refreshed saints, and by that act removed some defilement that may have been contracted by the way. We ought to accept the obligation to wash one another's feet.
Ques. Why is supper referred to?
Supper was symbolical of association; the treachery of Judas broke up that association; all that comes out in the chapter is in view of another association. Christ had been the centre of the association, and that was being broken up. He went to God. We want to be Christ's; that is, to take character from Christ; in system all responsibility is relegated to two or three; that will not do. All of us are under obligation to wash one another's feet. We must not come to the meeting expecting it to be carried on; we must come to help on things ourselves.
It is in connection with feet-washing that the traitor Judas is brought to light.
Ques. What is "part with me"?
It is association with Christ *where He is*; you get a thought of what part with Christ is in chapter 16. You enter by the Spirit into what is the breadth, length, depth and height. You have part with Him in that order where the Father has put all things into His hands and where He is Head. I want to get a
{364}
better acquaintance with all that is connected with Christ and another world. He had had part with them on earth, but He was going away and they were to have part with Him there in the power of the Spirit. To wash the feet is really priestly service, and no one can do it who has not discernment. There were two things needed for the priest of old, access and discernment; these two are needed by us in priestly service. There are those in the world who are loved of Christ; He loves us and puts us in contact with one another that we may serve one another. Officialism is deadly to Christ's circle; it relieves people of responsibility, but it is deadly to them; exercises are good for us.
The word of God is what morally affects us; the revelation of God affects me powerfully. God has come out in revelation; if that does not affect us, nothing else will. John had the sense that Christ was the expression of God's disposition to man, and he had his head upon His breast as the result. We are going to be perfectly conformed to Christ. If we wash one another's feet we have fellowship with Christ and with one another. At the end of the chapter we see how the darkest day precedes the brightest day. Judas went out and it was night, but Jesus says, "Now is the Son of man glorified"; we are in the light of that day now.
We see the depth and height of things in this chapter, Christ washing the feet of the disciples, and, on the other hand, "Now is the Son of man glorified". What a contrast! It is the really great person who washes the feet of a saint. We see it in the Lord: "Jesus *knowing*", it was because He knew who He was and where He was going that He could wash their feet. Nothing in this world would bring people together who are naturally diverse, nothing but discipleship of Christ; in the early days we see it all coming out blessedly; they were all together.
{365}
READINGS AND ADDRESSES ON SOME OF THE TEACHINGS OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN (5)
@John 13: 1 - 38
To get a right idea of the chapter you have to take into account all the conditions that came out in the first few verses. The world was to go on very much as it had done, but He was going to God, and there were those in the world whom He loved, and this chapter is occupied about them. An alliance is formed between Judas and the world to betray Him; this is very notable. It tallies somewhat with the harlot riding the beast in Revelation, and as a result there you get the marriage of the Lamb, and the bride has made herself ready -- the principle is that the worst evil really, under God, brings in the greatest good -- the worst evil is succeeded by the greatest good. So in this chapter where the alliance is seen between Judas and the world; at the close we get, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him"; these are great and blessed results. You could not have anything more evil than the harlot riding the beast, but then you get the greatest good, namely, the marriage of the Lamb. As to the expression, "God shall also glorify him in himself" -- Jesus is now glorified in God -- He is hid, He is not publicly glorified yet, and as to the word "straightway", He has not to await the time of public display, but He is now, at once, glorified in God.
Feet-washing is connected with the present position of Christ; it is necessary in this present time, when Christ is glorified in *God*. The world was ready to use Judas, but when he had served the world's purpose, then the world cast him off; and so it will be with regard to the harlot. Feet-washing
{366}
brings to light those that are really true, and the traitors are detected as Judas was. The real object of feet-washing is that we may have part with Christ, but at the same time we see all in this chapter interwoven with the detection of the traitor, Judas. We do not want those that are untrue to Christ in our midst.
For the length and weariness of the way we need feet-washing because of the scene we are in. The service would be accepted where there is a real desire to go forward. If you want to wash a person's feet you must seek to refresh his spirit, and thus his feet will be washed, without, perhaps, your being aware that you have done so. If there is fidelity to Christ on the part of the saint, then the service would be accepted; but where there is not, it would be resented. If in our communications one with another we are taken up with Christ, then we refresh one another, and feet are washed.
The Lord did it as an example and in a formal way -- He took a towel and girded Himself, etc. -- but as an example that we should do it in a spiritual way. It answers more to the defilement of @Numbers 19, where a man was defiled by a bone; we have death, that is, defilement, all around us in this wilderness scene, and feet-washing is connected with that sort of defilement; in the wilderness a man could not help touching a bone. The Lord puts us all under the obligation to do it to one another, and it would make a *very* great difference to us all if the obligation were accepted; what is unfaithful and untrue would be detected.
Fidelity to Christ is the thing for the moment; when He comes in glory there will not be the same test of fidelity as there is now in His absence. In this present day it is a great reproach to be true to Christ, but in the day of His glory it will not be so; hence today we are being tested as to our fidelity
{367}
to Christ. The test today to the world is Christ as Head of every man, but to the saint the test is Christ as Head of His body the church, and how far the saint is faithful to Him in that place. But after all how important is the statement in verse 3. The Father has given all things into His hands. If we have to suffer a bit of reproach now, we are in the secret of that, that the Father has given all things into His hands; we are in the secret of that by the Comforter having come. "He shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you".
Traitors will get in amongst us, as the apostle said to the Corinthians, "there must also be sects among you", and where feet -- washing goes on they will be exposed; this is incidental to the service. Individual fidelity to Christ is what is needed and then the company will be right. All turns really on individual fidelity to Christ; where there is that, then feet-washing will go on as it were unconsciously, and not with the idea of *going* in order to wash somebody's feet.
One view of feet-washing is that His own may be kept in separation from the contamination of the world. We come together in assembly to meet one another in love in the unity of the Spirit, and in doing so we meet the Lord. Our relations one toward another are very important in coming together; our feelings one towards another must be right, or else we cannot be right with the Lord. Fidelity to Christ comes out largely in refusing this world's system. I want to be a stranger and pilgrim here, true to Him, and so refuse the things of the world; we want to be here in the light of the glory of Christ, we want to have the consciousness that we are in Him and He in us. The life of the saint is with Christ in God.

READINGS AND ADDRESSES ON SOME OF THE TEACHINGS OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN (6)
@John 14: 1 - 31
It is plain that we have to look at these chapters (13 and 14) in their application to the disciples. We have to carry our thoughts back to them and when the Lord was with them. And yet it is extremely important to see what the chapters mean with regard to us, the point, the bearing with regard to us; for they have a further application to us.
Nothing can be more certain than that the coming of the Comforter meant something that would be permanent here. Nothing can be much more important than to understand the bearing of this chapter with regard to us. The primary application was to the disciples, but it also applies to us. We are left here in the absence of Christ. It all depends on the absence of Christ that the Comforter is still present. It supposes the absence of Christ. He is the object of faith in heaven, but the Comforter abides here, our stronghold and stay.
We used in system to look on the Spirit as simply an influence, but we have gained light. The Comforter is present as a Person. He is present, just as truly as Christ is absent.
Chapter 14 presents a contrast to chapter 13.
Chapter 13 shows our weakness.
Chapter 14 shows the source of our strength.
Every believer is conscious of weakness. You get weakness and strength combined in the same person. We are weak, but there are great elements of strength, elements not only of strength, but also of comfort. They are all found in the Lord -- various elements of strength well known for nearly two
{369}
thousand years; as Paul said to Timothy, who was weak and timid, "My son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus", @2 Timothy 2: 1.
In @John 13 everything was being resolved, a very great change was taking place -- Judas, Satan, and the chief priests coming together -- a fearful combination of evil, The devil enters into Judas, and he puts himself in communication with the Pharisees.
God allows a moment to arrive in the history of things culminating in a fearful combination -- treachery and the power of Satan. But another point: the Son of man was glorified. He came from God and went to God, and knew that the Father had "given all things into his hands".
If you get the elements of evil, you also get the elements of good. @Psalm 8 was to be fulfilled. There was the suffering, but He was going to be glorified. All the counsels of God are goodness. He was to be crowned with glory and honour, all things set under His feet.
The disciples were left in a defiling world. Still, at the same time their fidelity to the Lord and to one another was to be tested. Their obligation was to wash one another's feet. This brings out our weakness. We are weak when we are affected by the influences of the world; weak also in attempting to carry out the obligation of feet-washing.
In this chapter (chapter 14) I bring before you the elements of our strength. They come out in a very distinct way, "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me". The first element of strength is *faith in Christ*: "ye believe in God, believe also in me". You must remember to whom that was spoken! To a little company gathered by Christ. They had not chosen Christ, but Christ had chosen them. You may say they were a very poor choice; but they were the company the Lord chose, and if He had chosen them they were to
{370}
believe in Him. He knew them perfectly, and He was *content with their company*. Remember, they were only a few poor fishermen. The Lord could not have found anything very different in them from what He would find in us. He might have taken any dozen of us to be with Him. But He had chosen them and was content with their company; and indeed I could go further and say He had pleasure in their company.
Now He was about to leave them; but how could it possibly be that He could leave them and not think about them? He could say, as it were, If I am going to the Father in heaven I will have you in My company up there, because I have chosen you, loved you, carried you; and now I am going to "prepare a place for you ... that where I am, there ye may be also".
The Lord has chosen us, and we have faith in Him, and know that where He is there we shall be also. We may not have much place in this world, and we should be very content to have no place here; and we are better without a place here because it tends to draw our attention from the place above, the place Christ has prepared and to which He is going to bring us.
The next element of our strength is the divinely given appreciation of Christ and all that the Father has given to Him. No man can receive anything but what is given him from above. Christ is foolishness to the natural man; and hence appreciation of Christ must be divinely given. He says, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls". That would be divinely given appreciation of Christ. The first element of strength is faith in the fidelity of Christ; now that He has gone to heaven, to have entire confidence in His fidelity; and then there is very great strength in the divinely
{371}
given appreciation of Christ: "Through him we both have access ... unto the Father". In proportion as I apprehend the Son I have access to the Father.
The gentile is just as well off as the Jew. The woman who was a sinner -- her power for approaching God was her appreciation of Christ; and it is in the appreciation of Christ that we have access to the Father. The apprehension of the Son is a very great element of strength, because you have access to the Father. I am *nothing in the eye of God* save as I am in the appreciation of *Christ*: and our real measure in the sight of God is our appreciation of Christ.
The next point is in verse 16, "another Comforter". This is another very great element of strength, the presence of the Comforter. He is come. We have the record of it in the Acts. The Comforter came and the Comforter has continued. His presence is a very great element of strength. By Him we live and do, and by Him, on the other hand, Christ has His expression in christians. Christ is brought into the view of His people, and because He lives they live.
Stephen was just about to die, but he saw Christ, and he lived because Christ lived. Stephen had no real idea of dying; he hated his life in this world, but he lived because Christ lived. Christ lived "on account of the Father". He said when on the cross, "Into thy hands I commend my spirit". I may be carried away by disease tonight, but I live because Christ lives, and as to my departure I am "absent from the body and present with the Lord"; and when Christ is manifested in power and glory I shall be exactly like Him. We see Him now by the Spirit, and because He lives we live also. Stephen being full of the Spirit beheld the glory of God and Jesus; he lived because Jesus lived, and he could say, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit".
{372}
A point further. Now that the Lord was going away He said to His disciples, "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". The Lord Jesus intended to have a witness here, an expression here, to be present here in word and work. When He was upon earth He said, "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works". In the works and words of saints Christ is manifest here. "At that day" (Pentecost) Christ is present here. He comes out in His people, as the Father came out in Christ, in His works and words. Our works and words should be a savour of Christ, so that Christ should be magnified in these poor bodies, and also manifested and expressed characteristically in word and work. Are you left here just to pursue your business or to be simply in your family life? That is not the reason for which you are left here, but as vessels here on earth in which Christ finds expression, in work and word, in the power of the Comforter.
The first element of strength is faith in Christ, "Believe also in me". The second is divinely given appreciation of Christ, and the third is the presence of the Comforter, so that Christ finds expression in His people here. We live because He lives, and on the other hand He finds expression in us: "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".
Another point, another element of strength is in verse 21, that Christ manifests Himself. It is conditional. It is ridiculous to talk of loving Christ and not keeping His commandments. What is His commandment? It is really that Christ is before the soul. *Christ* is the great commandment; Christ Himself is the law. You cannot do right except as you have Christ before the heart -- no licence to do
{373}
your own will. Man's will is in principle lawlessness. If you keep His commandments the gain is that Christ will manifest Himself to you. He came into the company of His disciples; three times He manifested Himself to His disciples. The Lord manifests Himself to us in some way that is peculiarly characteristic of Himself, "He was known of them in breaking of bread"; so too in @John 20 and 21. The Lord is so capable of bringing Himself before the heart in a way that makes an indelible impression of Christ, something that is peculiarly characteristic of Himself. I speak of the capability of the Lord to manifest Himself to the one who keeps His commandments; and the manifestation of Himself will give character and direction to the one to whom He thus manifests Himself.
Another element of strength is the Father and the Son making their abode with the one who keeps the words of Christ. You are thus in separation from the world and you give no licence to the flesh. The gain is that you have the Father and the Son taking up their abode with you; you are in the Father's love, and you have Christ for salvation. Their presence and continuance is that which is peculiarly characteristic of each. That must of necessity involve complete separation from the world, and where we abide is in the Father's love, and we have salvation in Christ Jesus, but outside the course and order of this world. But we have the immense gain of the Father's love and the salvation which is in Christ Jesus; He is our strength and our "strong tower".
The apostle laboured that the saints might "obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory", @2 Timothy 2: 10. Wonderful thing to be here in the sense of the Father's love and in "the salvation which is in Christ Jesus"!
{374}
There *is* the love of *Christ*, but we are in the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, and we know the love of the Father.
There are wonderful elements of strength brought out in detail in this chapter: --
(1) Faith in Christ.
(2) Divinely given appreciation of Christ.
(3) The coming of the Comforter.
(4) The manifestation of Christ to the soul.
(5) The abode of the Father and the Son with him who keeps the word of Christ.
These are all elements of our strength. We are weak in the susceptibility we have as regards this world and things down here; but these are the elements of strength and we have to know and to prove these things, and they are all available to us. The great thing we have to look to is that we do violence to the *flesh* and to the *will* and to the *world*! "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world".
May God grant that we may be in the reality of these things. "Your life is hid with Christ in God". You can reckon the duration of your own life if you can reckon the duration of Christ's life!
{375}
READINGS AND ADDRESSES ON SOME OF THE TEACHINGS OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN (7)
@John 15: 1 - 27
What I seek to bring before you is the question of obligation, the obligation under which we are placed as children of God. We are placed under obligation from the fact of being children of God. For the fact of our being brought into any relationships, intelligent beings as we are, must entail obligation, and the obligations are corresponding to the relationship.
When God created man at the beginning he was set in relation to God, and thus there was obligation to God. Then when God created the woman and Adam had a wife there were the corresponding obligations. The same principle is true as regards children, masters, servants. The principle holds good the moment you get relationships established in connection with intelligent beings. That, therefore, is my point tonight. I want to show where the obligation lies.
There are three things I want to speak of. (1) In regard to worship. (2) In regard to service. (3) In regard of good works. I want to show how obligation is connected with each of these three. If we do not know what the obligations are it will hinder our carrying them out. Last time I spoke of the peculiar place the church has at the present time. Every thought of God is taken up in the church down here, so that all is maintained for God. I spoke of the thought of the flock: it is not part of the church's calling, but it is what the church is brought into incidentally from being down here. The church properly belongs to the heavenly places, and there are no flocks in heaven, but the thought of the flock is maintained in the church down here.
{376}
Now in this chapter another thought is taken up, that of fruit-bearing. The first few verses refer to a vine, which has reference to earth, for Israel was said to be the vine of the earth. Christ superseded the vine. Israel was the vine, but Christ was the true Vine, and the disciples were the branches if they abode in Him, if they brought forth fruit. It applies to the time when the Lord was here. The Lord looked on, however, to the disciples abiding in Him. The idea of the vine is given up, but not that of abiding in Him, nor of fruit-bearing. It would be a demonstration that they were disciples of Christ if they bore fruit. The church is expected to be fruit-bearing here. Israel will find their fruit from Jehovah, He will be the source of their fruit and they will then bring forth fruit to God. I wish tonight to show the secret of fruit-bearing.
There are two things I identify, and these are fruit-bearing and good works. They are certainly linked together in Scripture, and both are enforced upon us. We are to be fruitful in every good work; there they are combined. Saints are looked upon as vigorous; healthy trees bring forth fruit.
To speak first in regard to worship, in that connection I read @John 4: 21 - 24. Now I do not see that we are placed under any obligation to worship, and yet it is not well if we do not worship. It has become a part of the divine system. People think they do duty to Almighty God on Sunday, and then do duty to themselves the rest of the week. God will not exact worship. The woman says, "where men ought to worship". The Lord never uses "ought" in that connection, but "the Father seeketh such to worship him", and further He shows what is essential to the worship of God. Every condition for worship is there. What was set forth figuratively in times gone by was no longer in figure. That which
{377}
was prefigured had come to pass; the approach is equal to the revelation.
You will never apprehend the mind of God in regard of everything except as you see it in Christ. You see perfection in Him, both as regard revelation and approach. There were two great principles in connection with the tabernacle, the one was the ark and the other was the priest, but the system was imperfect, for it was only figurative; and when man came to act failure came in immediately, Nadab and Abihu offered strange fire.
Revelation is no greater than the approach. God has been fully revealed in Christ, and in Him, too, man has gone in to God. Our High Priest has gone in. He has touched the mercy seat, and then you have perfection in every way. There is no approach to God but by the High Priest, but the High Priest has gone in in virtue of His own blood to give us a footing with God in Him. I speak of that in connection with worship.
There is another error abroad, and that is in respect to priesthood -- that priests are so by calling; but only Aaron and Christ are spoken of as being called to priesthood. We are priests on the ground of being kindred to the High Priest, not by calling. It is as kindred to the High Priest that we can approach God; "Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father".
All worship is dependent upon the measure in which God is known and enjoyed; but it is not the divine way to put us under obligation to worship, yet it is a very poor thing if we do not worship. Worship is dependent upon the measure in which God is individually known and enjoyed. God is not worshipped by order, by arrangements, by forms, by the outwards, but in spirit and in truth: that is apart from what is formal, and in the light of revelation. We cannot have arrangements in divine
{378}
worship. It is contrary to the character of the present dispensation.
But, people may say, are we not to come together for the breaking of bread? The character of that is a witness, an announcement. It is a great witness to the truth -- Christ. It was ordained at the outset, and is, therefore, a kind of witness. It may be carried out in a worshipping spirit, but I should not like to say it is an act of worship. Worship is dependent on the measure in which God is known and enjoyed. It cannot be carried on by deputy. They who worship (that is, all who assume to) must do so "in spirit and in truth". But worship is not exacted, and yet it is a poor thing if worship be not rendered. If God were known He would be worshipped. When the Lord made Himself known to the blind man he worshipped Him.
Now in regard to service, a great many people make a good deal of service. I regard service as a great privilege, but I could not put it upon people as an obligation. I admit special cases. The apostle Paul had a special dispensation committed to him, and he was under obligation to carry it out. So, too, Archippus, who had received a ministry, had to see to it that he fulfilled it. But service as it applies to saints generally is a matter of spiritual privilege conferred on them individually. You do not worship God by the mere fact of coming into the meeting. You may have to be with others for worship, for worship is not an individual act; but neither as regards worship nor service are we placed under obligation. I believe that as regards good works we are placed under obligation, (@Titus 3: 1, 2, 14). So also @Colossians 1: 9, 10: "Fruitful in every good work". The figure is taken from a tree, a tree is to bring forth fruit. It is not a sign of vigour if there are only leaves. I will tell you why good works are so important -- for the same reason as fruit-bearing
{379}
is: they are both the evidence of creation. God has brought to pass *new creation*: this is to be a witness for God down here, and the way in which new creation comes out is in good works. (@Ephesians 2: 10 and @Galatians 6: 10 - 16; "by this rule" is the rule of new creation.) Good works are the evidence of new creation, and it is in this connection that good works are enforced in Scripture. If we are His workmanship, God will have the evidence of "good works".
Whatever God may have in His mind for us is set forth in Christ, and we only learn it there; but as regards us, there is nothing true of any believer save what is true in Him. The importance of that lies in this, that all is *vital*.
You may make up your mind to this, that there is nothing true of you except what is true *in* you. Everything is given to you in the witness of the Spirit, and if given to you thus, there it is in vitality. I take it up in regard to justification. There is no justification except in the witness of the Spirit. My justification is in Christ: hence it is by the Spirit.
It is in the witness of the Spirit that I have justification. Take the blessing of eternal life. Man reaps eternal life in the Spirit. Every blessing given to us lies in the witness of the Spirit, and if so it is given to you vitally, and hence only what is true *in* you is true *of* you. There are many things true *for* you. All that is set forth in Christ as man is true for you, but only what is true in you is true of you. I desire you to weigh these things. It is important to think these things out and to consider them, for they are of vital import.
The principle is true from the initial blessing, forgiveness of sins, to the highest blessing. You cannot be in *Christ* without Christ being in *you*. You must take one side with the other, and hence you get vitality at once. "Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ
{380}
be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness". Everything in the gospel is vital, because all is given in the witness of the Spirit. You get thus the ground of fruit-bearing and of good works. The Spirit is also a mighty power in the believer. He brings us into the realisation and enjoyment of everything God has for us, and the issue is in the way of good works. Good works are very important. I see this in three circles.
(1) In Christ's circle, which is the believer's true home circle; your proper home is not the domestic circle. The idea of your home in Scripture is Christ's circle. In early days, in times of persecution, the saints found their home in Christ's circle. Now that (sphere) circle is the sphere of fruit-bearing and of good works. Take a believer isolated from others, being shut up in a prison -- he would not have much opportunity of carrying out his desires to do good works.
(2) Then there is another circle -- the domestic circle, the home circle. In that sense a believer is looked to to show piety at home and to requite his parents; he is to be marked by good works at home; he is to be marked by fidelity in that circle.
(3) Further, there is a circle that is in connection with God's government down here: I do not say in the world. "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers". A child of God is not to be radical or lawless.
Good works become a testimony to God. We are known here as preferring the knowledge of God and Christ, and good works are a testimony to that. The Lord put the disciples under the obligation to love one another, and that they might go on and bring forth fruit. God puts us under an obligation to do these things. There must be vitality, because Christ is in us. The vitality is to come out in a
{381}
practical way. First of all in connection with the Spirit's sphere. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace. The Lord puts us under solemn obligations to love one another. "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ".
Now, what is the secret of fruit-bearing? Scientists say human life could not exist on any other planet except our own because the forces which are necessary to human life, and upon which it is so dependent, are so peculiar and complex; they do not exist, so far as we know, on any other planet save this. God has constituted peculiar and complex conditions which are just suited to human life. If this be true physically, I am convinced it is equally true spiritually. If you take a man as a spiritual being, new created, he is dependent upon certain peculiar conditions correlated to one another. If you do not recognise these conditions there will not be much life. Now human life is dependent upon rule, atmosphere and light. If this be true in natural things, how much more in spiritual! Every inch of the body is subject to the law of gravity. So you must, in every part, be subject to Christ. The apostle says, "legitimately subject to Christ". We are married to Another, even to Him who is raised from the dead, so that we might come under His influence and that there should be no assertion of our wills, and then there will be fruit-bearing. We are thus under rule.
Then there is the divine circle, and there Christ is. There is a circle upon earth of which Christ is the centre, and if so Christ influences that circle. The disciples lived in and breathed that atmosphere -- no assertion of their wills, rights or tempers; thus they were under rule, and they also found their proper atmosphere under the influence of Christ.
Then another condition, and that is being in the light of divine love in its application to you; not as
{382}
in heaven, but as you are down here. "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us". No spiritual life can subsist without these three conditions. If God has wrought in us, He has likewise formed the conditions in which we can live. The point for us is to live in these conditions. If we get into the world we shall get out of the atmosphere; if we get self-willed we shall get away from rule. Our responsibility is to abide in the conditions essential to life, and if we do, the result will be we shall be fruitful in every good work. We have to accept our obligation as to this.
It is important to apprehend where God has put us on the ground of obligation. Worship and service are not put on the ground of exaction, but if we do accept our obligation and are fruitful in every good work, then God will have His part, He will be worshipped. There are obligations, and they are expressed in regard of good works and fruit-bearing, but both one and the other are based on the evidence of healthy vitality. Whatever is given to us is given in the witness of the Spirit, so that everything in us is connected with Christ and is marked by vitality. We are under obligation to prove that all is vital, and we do so in the way of fruit-bearing and good works.
{383}
"UNDER HIS FEET"
@Hebrews 2: 8
I cannot conceive anything more important than the apprehension of the truth as connected with the world that is coming; people are accustomed to take it up as immediately all applying to us, they do not "see afar off", as Peter puts it: to see something beyond us. All God's ways developed in Christ.
The moment sin came in, God came in and presented the seed of the woman who was to bruise the head of the serpent; then a little further on we get the seed of Abraham blessed with the blessing of Abraham, and then still further on we get David speaking, as in @Psalm 8 and quoted in this chapter, in connection with the Son of man and all being put under His feet.
The Jews raised the question, "Who is the Son of man?" This @Psalm 8 is the solution of the question. He is the head and centre of all God's ways. Everything has been accomplished in Him. He is the crown of all God's ways -- all things are put under His feet. As Son of man He is set over all things. Now what marks the present moment -- and it is important to apprehend it -- is the present place Christ is in, and how far God's purpose has been accomplished. The world to come is hid, as it were, under a cloud; but it is there, and we see all connected with the accomplishment of God's purpose in this chapter. In due time the world to come will be manifested, and I will tell you why the world to come is not in display yet, God is bringing many sons to glory. Man as man is not in accordance with His glory, but if the glory of God is to be displayed, God is going to bring man in for the display of His glory. We get the idea of it in the heavenly city, it is to be the expression of the glory of God, and
{384}
to be that it must be *according* to God's glory. He is bringing many sons to glory -- they are to be the vessel for His glory. The rights of the Son of man are in abeyance just now. God *does* see all things under His feet -- we do not see them yet. In chapter 1 it is God who says, "Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool", and in chapter 2 we can say we see Jesus crowned with glory and honour. Now I want to say a word regarding all being put under His feet. The book of Revelation is full of this, and shows us the means God will take to bring this to pass, as it says, the kingdoms of this world will come under Him, and He will reign for ever and ever.
I want to refer here to the ground on which God will take up the world to come: we get it in @Revelation 4 and 5. God takes it up mediately in Christ. Two very important principles in which God asserts His rights are seen here: there may be vested interests or rights in His providential ways now, but when God comes in in His own rights He will not look at man's vested rights -- all that will be ignored.
Now the first principle is on the ground of creation, that is referred to in @Revelation 4; the second is on the ground of redemption, and that is chapter 5. Both these grounds are taken up in Christ: in @Revelation 4: 11 you get the ground of right by creation, and in @Revelation 5: 12 you get the ground of redemption. These two grounds belong to God. Redemption has to come in to bring in the rights of God. God's rights have to be vindicated, and the One who has done all to accomplish this for Him is the Man Christ Jesus. This is extremely important, for the assumption of man is everywhere and is so great, man would claim everything for man; God will come in to take up His own rights and set aside man and his rights. It is a wonderful thing, beloved friends, all that *has* been effected for
{385}
God, and it is only waiting the moment to be displayed. Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, and we believers see Jesus crowned with glory and honour, and all we wait for is the moment of display, for all has been effected; God has effected what is essential for His glory, that is the object of what the apostle brings out in the latter part of this chapter.
Our weapons are in the power of God: He is greater than man, and man is totally powerless in God's presence. I think we get a wonderful picture of it in the children of Israel and the Red Sea, that which was their safety in their way through it: "the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left", and the Egyptians following, the waters returned and engulfed them, and there are many other similar instances in Scripture. God will come in and take His own way, and in @Revelation 6 we get some of these ways referred to, and it shows the means He has at His disposal -- conquest, civil wars, famine, pestilence, the beasts of the earth. Then there remains bringing many sons to glory, the vessel is for God's glory because God displays Himself in the effect of it coming out in the heavenly city. God is forming that now, if you look at this chapter, like unto His brethren, and the point is that this would have no application if the "world to come" were here.
There are three thoughts in my mind that I would like to refer to. (1) Christ as Leader; (2) as Sanctifier; (3) as High Priest. In the light of these three things we come into acquaintance with Christ. He spoke in @John 4 of the living water He was able to give, and the well of water, to my mind, is increasing appreciation of Christ, and if we are in the enjoyment of this we shall never thirst. You may depend upon it there can be no appreciation of Christ apart from the Spirit of Christ. The only
{386}
way of appreciating Christ is by the Spirit of Christ, and if we have the Spirit of Christ our body is dead for sin. (@Romans 8: 10.) What a great thing to know Christ as the Leader of our salvation! He is made perfect for that through suffering. When He was born we read of the aged Simeon taking Him in his arms and saying, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart ... for mine eyes have seen thy salvation". He was *God's* salvation; again in Acts we get God's salvation spoken of as light to the nations. In Him God's righteousness has been accomplished, He has come as God's salvation, and salvation is liberation from the power of everything hostile to God. He is the Leader of our salvation, He has reached His place. He stands in salvation, salvation is made good to us: we are saved in hope, for we look for the Lord Jesus Christ.
That is a wonderful verse: "In me ye ... have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation". The world has been overcome. Few of us overcome the world, but depend upon it, beloved friends, there is salvation for us, and He is the Leader of our salvation perfected through suffering. If you and I are to enter into the joy of the Lord, it must be through increasing appreciation of Christ -- we are kept in salvation. But then He is the Sanctifier, sanctification is positional. In chapter 10 we get, "By the which will we are sanctified"; it is no question of its being progressive: positional means for us that we are set apart for a holy purpose. As it is said here, "are all of one".
Now turn for a moment to @John 20: 17. This passage gives us the idea of sanctification; the disciples were separated from the world -- the Jewish system was the world to them, and they were taken out of all that, and in the message sent through Mary we get the idea of sanctification and the thought of association with Himself brought in.
{387}
Christ was not going to take up His rights: "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". We get sanctified positionally in @John 17, and that we are sanctified with Him -- the place we have before God in Him.
Salvation was completed, peace brought in and sanctification brought in in associating them with Himself, as it says: He "is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption". (@1 Corinthians 1.)
Then we come to the High Priest, another light in which Christ is made known to us. Attachment to Christ solves every difficulty for a Christian. The disciples may have been very unintelligent, but they had very great attachment to Christ; you can give them great credit for that; the real key to intelligence is *attachment* to Christ, where that is, when the exposition of Christ comes in, there can be intelligence, and as it comes out in the day of Pentecost, boldness and intelligence were displayed in a wonderful manner, they had a most wonderful capability for applying what had reached them through attachment to Christ. They entered into the reality of salvation and they had sanctification.
The last point is a faithful High Priest. Priesthood is based on atonement and righteousness, it has nothing to say to sins. The High Priest must be the offering Priest, and in the case of Christ, He was the victim: the attachment is to the offering Priest, though He is the High Priest; the offering Priest is the High Priest, righteousness being established. It is a blessed thing to think of Christ sitting down in peace. The riddle of all the confusion sin has brought in is solved, for we know a spot where there is no confusion, and Jesus as Man set down there. The world says, 'Might is right': but none can unravel the confusion where man's will works, but there is one way out of it all, and that is in Christ.
{388}
Our hearts can rest where Christ is, He is salvation, sanctification and High Priest. He suffered being tempted; there was no temptation inwardly in Him, but temptation brought suffering to Christ; but then, now He is able to succour them that are tempted. The Lord succoured Peter when he fell: "I have prayed for thee". He is a merciful High Priest. Christ has reached the goal, and that goal is ours, and He stretches out His hand for us and gives us a helping hand on the road, and I cannot doubt as we realise that, our hearts are drawn to Christ where He now is. In that way He is objective, but then Christ is in the hearts of His people down here, and He gives the well of living water springing up to everlasting life, and He is the antidote to everything we find contrary to God here. He can thus become everything to our hearts.
{389}
UNITY
@Ephesians 4: 1 - 32
The two chief thoughts that are presented in this passage are unity and completeness, and these two go together. Unity in the true sense cannot be unless there is completeness. In the case of man and wife they are complete, and they are one. In the universe there is unity and completeness, unity pervades the system (the sun, moon and stars), but intelligence is lacking. They move in relation to one another perfectly and exactly, but they are not themselves intelligent. But in the case of man and wife there is unity, completeness and intelligence, and in the body of Christ you have the three also.
I want to bring before you the thought of unity and completeness with regard to Christ: all is working to get unity and to the measure of the stature of the completeness of Christ, that really refers to the church (see chapter 1: 22), the fulness of Him that filleth all in all. The church is His completeness -- nothing is lacking. Eve was the completeness of Adam, there was no quality lacking that was in Adam; but with completeness you get unity, and unity is not incompatible with individuality, as may be seen in man and wife. There is a contrast between objective unity and subjective unity. Objective unity is seen in verses 4 and 5, it is what is presented to us; subjective unity is seen in verse 13, it is what we arrive at. In verse 4 it is one body, one spirit, etc., unity is brought forward so as to enforce the exhortation to endeavour to keep the unity. Everything around us is seen to be in great confusion, there is neither unity or completeness, so it is a great thing to come back to the truth that there is one body. These truths have to be held abstractly;
{390}
we have to stand apart from these systems of man because we see the truth that there is one body, one Spirit, etc.
We have to take account of the truth of divine Persons; the presence of the Spirit is a great reality. It is sad to stand apart from the great bodies around us, but it has to be done: if we are to endeavour to keep the Spirit's unity we must separate from them, because we see that there is one body, one Spirit, etc. Till we all come in the unity of the faith, the gifts are directly given of Christ: officialism will not do. Undoubtedly there is much gift buried in the systems around, but gift is there, and it is given by Christ. Whatever gift there may be in christendom it is a witness to an ascended Christ; all gift has come from an ascended Christ, and the thought is found in the expression "that the Lord God might dwell among them". Gift witnesses to an ascended Christ, therefore gift is of great importance as witness to Him. All these gifts exist or have existed, and all witness to an ascended Christ. They all give proof of the ability of Christ to fill all things; the sun fills our universe, there is nothing hid from the heat thereof, so Christ is able to fill all things. He descended into the lower parts of the earth, and the One who ascended is the One who descended. He descended, He laid down His life; this is applicable only to Christ, not to us; the great point is, that the One who descended is now ascended: the same ability or power is seen in Him descending as in Him ascending. As the Son of God it is more wonderful for Him to go into the lower parts of the earth than for Him to ascend. He went into the grave for the will of God, and that morally was greater even than ascending. Christ -- the term implies *fulness*, and He *fills*; all fulness was pleased to dwell in Him, that God might be made known to man, but He also fills; go back to the thought of the sun that fills
{391}
the universe with light and warmth, so Christ fills the moral universe with light.
@Luke 2: 8 and end of chapter read. In the first of these passages you get the thought of heaven -- glory to God in the Highest, and on earth peace and good pleasure -- all this is presented in Christ, He is able to fill earth and heaven; but in the passage at the end of the chapter He is seen full of divine intelligence; now as to the thought of Christ filling all things (@John 20: 19; @Acts 2: 44; @Revelation 21: 22), these passages give an idea of Christ filling all things; in @John 20 you only get a small circle, but He fills it with peace, joy and the Holy Spirit; Christ is able to fill all things if He could fill that circle, that is clearly seen and seen directly when He rose from the dead, righteousness was there in His death, and peace and joy and the Spirit, they were brought into attachment to Himself. In @Acts 2 the circle is greatly expanded, but Christ filled that circle, they overcame all the natural tendency to selfishness that there is in all of us. What a blessed scene! that circle was filled with divine light, they had passed out of lawlessness into attachment to Christ, and as a result were shining as lights in the world. In @Revelation 21 we see all filled with Christ, the whole city is pervaded by a light greater than the natural light; the nations bring their glory into it, and waters flow out of it for the healing of the nations; kings, etc., walk in the light of it. You must see thus that Christ is able to fill all things. He that descended -- that was a mighty stoop -- He has ascended and He has given gifts; ministry is dependent on this, not on officialism. Gift only it is that can bring light to bear on the moral being. Gift is given to bring us to unity, to unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God. All ministry must act on us individually. I would not be connected with anything that would not do for God; but
{392}
what I want to see is piety in individuals; we want to be before God in secret, and then the effect will be seen in our lives; we shall come out as light in the world, and we can only do this as we are in the shining of Christ. Gift has great importance, because it is really the virtue of an ascended Christ.
{393}
THE RESURRECTION
@1 Corinthians 15: 1 - 58
There is one thing which must strike everyone in reading this passage, and that is that christianity depends wholly on Christ risen from the dead.
The first part of the chapter is a declaration of the gospel which he preached among them, and it is a declaration made to saints.
It is quite a mistake to think that when we have believed we have done with the gospel, it is when we have believed that we are led on in the gospel. God begins with the gospel, but His object is to bring us into the holiest, and that we should know the holiest as a present thing. This is the definite line upon which He is leading us. Christians are not really safe for walking down here till they are prepared to enter the holiest, and they are not often prepared to enter the holiest because there are things that must be dropped if you enter there, and they are not prepared to drop them. There is a preparation needed by us in order to enter the holiest, and that preparation is effected in us by the Spirit. There is a great gain for us in entering the holiest, and God's thought is to lead us into the holiest down here.
The first thing of all is the gospel, you want to start fair, and here the apostle declares to them the gospel that he preached. Christ died and He was buried and He rose again. And as in Adam all die so in Christ all are quickened.
It says here that He "died for our sins, according to the scriptures". This is a very wide aspect, similar to @Luke 24, repentance and remission preached among all nations. It is not the sins of christians merely -- it resembles the passage in @1 John 2. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not only for ours
{394}
only, but for the whole world. It is on the line of the scriptures, as also in @Luke 24.
Then we get that He was *buried*, everything after the flesh came thus to an end and was put out of sight. Now in Him raised from the dead according to the Scriptures, a new chapter is opened up: He is separated from every link after the flesh. He comes out in resurrection that He may have a new relationship with man. He occupies a new place or position as last Adam in regard to man; as Man risen He stands in a new relationship to man, namely, Head. The covenant with Israel is broken, as we get in @Zechariah 11, in the two staves. Beauty and bands being broken, He is now the Head of every man. The last Adam is a life-giving Spirit, holding living water at the disposal of every man. It is only in owning Christ as Head that man gets forgiveness of sins, and then living water. If His name is not believed in there is no forgiveness of sins. He is Head in name, He has to be effectually Head to every man.
In @John 3 you get the Son of man lifted up, and in @John 4 you get living water, but there is a distinction; in @John 3 He becomes the object of faith to *every* man, whereas in @John 4 He gives the living water to those who *ask* -- it is more limited. Every man is responsible to believe on Him; but it is imperative that a man should believe on Him if he is to get the living water. He *is* the Head, but He is to be the Head effectually to us, that is, that we may live by the Head now, and on the other hand that we may be dead to that to which He died. There are things that He will never have anything to say to again, such as law, sin and the world -- these are the things that we are to be dead to now. There is a remarkable verse in @John 15: "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin". The coming of Christ was a test, and man
{395}
declared himself in regard to God; the coming of Christ brought this out.
@1 Corinthians 15: 19 (was here specially read and referred to) has reference to a life outside this life -- an order of things outside the life here. Among the men of the world you find many a one that is upright, but he is not characterised by righteousness and holiness of truth: *that* one is a christian, and as to obligations down here even a christian is best, that is, he is the best husband, best wife, best servant, etc. The end of Ephesians or Colossians shews this, yet after all the christian lives with God outside of all obligation down here. My privilege is to live with God outside the course of things down here. Thus the christian is looked at as dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Life in Christ Jesus is outside the course of things here. If you are alive to God in Christ Jesus, you are dead to sin, dead to law and dead to the world.
Do you see Christ? I ask. "The world seeth me no more; but ye see me". Christ is in the vision of the christian -- an object in our hearts, which the world does not see. He is a real object: He said, "because I live, ye shall live also". We want to know something of the conditions in which He now lives. The two disciples in @John 1 asked, "Where dwellest thou?" They saw *where He dwelt*, and we want to know the conditions in which He now lives. He is the Firstfruits of all that in which *life* consists. Where He lives there God is all. If you do not live in Christ you do not really live at all -- all is death around us.
The great point to be exercised about is to *see* Christ. "Ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also". In the Lord's presence the disciples felt joy and safety, though they were not intelligent they must have had much happiness, but it was a happiness which was outside the world altogether. He had
{396}
no place in the world, nor had they. It is our privilege now to live in Christ, and we shall get happiness and safety, but it is outside the world.
You recognise now the true position of things -- all is changed here with regard to God: the judgment of the world is shewn, and Christ, as Head for man, raised up. Our privilege is to have Christ effectually as Head, and live by Him. You see Christ and you live by Him. It is in the presence and coming of the Comforter that you see Christ, but it may rebuke you in many things down here. We wait Christ's advent, and then we shall be like Him in everything.
{397}
IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD EVERY NATURAL THOUGHT IS REVOLUTIONISED
@Luke 18: 1 - 43
Ques. What connection have these two parables?
F.E.R. The early part of the chapter shews that in the kingdom of God every natural thought is revolutionised. The widow and the sinner without righteousness and the child without strength all come into the regard of God: the widow is heard for her importunity, and the children are received. It is extremely important to see what has the regard of God down here; it is not the rich man.
Ques. What is the difference between this and chapter 11 where you have importunity brought in?
F.E.R. It is the same principle. The early part of the chapter connects itself with the end of the preceding one. The chapter is apparently divided: the first eight verses belong to the previous chapter; it is the elect of Israel that are literally referred to. It refers to the coming of the Son of man to avenge His elect. It is extremely important to see what God regards down here.
You get a new subject at verse 31; the point of the blind man is, he confesses Christ as the Son of David; then in the beginning of the next chapter the Son of David is in the house of the sinner. I think it gives instruction as to what it is that will really bring God in. "Shall not God avenge his own elect?" It is what commands His regard down here, and then you get what is the great hindrance.
The publican is justified; you have to come down morally to his level and to the level of children. The kingdom of God has come in to test everybody; it has not come in power and glory, but to test everybody, people are found out where they are. You
{398}
have to receive the kingdom to come into it. On the other hand, the Pharisee did not want to receive it. The rich man wanted eternal life in addition to to what he had; he was not prepared to give it up. What lies at the bottom of all these things is self-righteousness; all connect themselves with a lawless world, and the kingdom comes in to deliver people out of the world. The point is whether people are low enough down to come into God's kingdom.
What I understand by it is the rule of grace, the reign of grace. The talent is what Christ has left in the hands of the servants. A man must be divested of his riches to enter into the kingdom. I think the truth is that the link must be severed with this evil world in order that he may enter the kingdom. The kingdom of God is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, not eating and drinking.
The kingdom is brought in that eternal life may be known. You could not get it without it, in order to hold evil in abeyance, Satan bound, death swallowed up in victory, etc.
In order that eternal life might come in you must get the kingdom. The soul must come under the power and authority of God to be free of that of the enemy, you cannot get eternal life without that.
The prophets are all full of the kingdom, more than eternal life; the great point is, it comes in that all evil may be held in abeyance, that man may be able to live under the influence of God. There will not be the extinction of the enemies in the millennium, but all the forces held in abeyance; that necessitates the kingdom, victory rules. How will you get free of the power of the enemy? By the authority of God, in order that you may reach eternal life. Sin is reigning outwardly by death now, and now we get the thought of God, that grace might reign through righteousness; it is true to faith now, Christ
{399}
is Lord, to us He presents all the power and authority of God, and therefore it is of great comfort to me. I am strong in the Lord and the power of His might; it is a great thing to know the consciousness of the Lord.
The Lord said to Paul: "My grace is sufficient for thee". The Lord delights to put forward what is nothing and weak in this world, that it may stand against all the power of evil, "the little child". Every natural thought, all that we have learnt in the world, is completely revolutionised in the kingdom. God has chosen the foolish things of this world.
The thought of kingdom in my mind is not so much connected with the world, but with the power of evil behind the world. The Israelites got clear of Egypt, but Satan wanted to bring them back. We want to be strong to resist the enemy, not to be brought back to fall down to the level of the world.
The kingdom of God is a means to an end; people ought to be set on reaching eternal life. The thought of eternal life was becoming prominent when the church was going to the bad, and I believe it to be a great safeguard for us, that we may escape Babylon and Egypt.
The kingdom is the means to that end. Egypt is the natural world, the world of man's nature; Babylon is the world of man's lust. The masterpiece of Satan is really Babylon, the mother of abominations. The church lost the rule of the Spirit, and was carried away to ecclesiastical Babylon. No system in the world has such power as popery. Balaam raises the question of association, which is a very great snare to people in the present day -- people keep up links.
The young man would have been well pleased to have had eternal life with his riches. Riches are an abomination in the sight of God; it has all sprung
{400}
up in this world. The principle of Scripture is that the rich man disperses.
Men get to love riches; you cannot watch men without seeing that. You will not get an accumulation of riches in the world to come, it is only in the present world; they measure things by appearance, not morally. If a bad man gets riches men do not neglect him, he gets honour. In the kingdom of God everything is measured morally, that is the great comfort. The rich man has the responsibility of using his riches as a steward; he cannot throw them away, it would only add to the confusion: the point is to make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness.
The Lord loved the young man. There are many things that you could love. See a mother with tender affection for her children; I think that you would love it, and the Lord loved it.
In the constitution of man there is a great deal that is very beautiful; it is a great mistake to overlook traces of God's handiwork in that way.
The world would be a perfect pandemonium without it; the terrible mischief is that man is under the power of the enemy and cannot free himself. It is a perfect impossibility for a rich man to enter in as such: he must become small. The Lord knew perfectly well the great place and power that riches had over the heart of man, but God knows well how to bring him down. If he has a child taken it breaks him, and all that he may come into the kingdom as a little child.
God knows how to break the power of riches over a man; the kingdom will not be any man's debtor. If they leave all they will get compensation. I never lost anything, but some people remain half in each and never come into the good of either. A man gains much more in the present time by getting
{401}
out of what is artificial into what is real. The "manifold more" is in what is real, not in what is artificial. People live in appearances, but they are not real. The point is, I am not taken in by what is artificial, it is only counterfeit You want what is moral, that which will stand in the presence of God.
{402}
THE FATHER THE SOURCE, THE SON THE CENTRE
@John 5: 17 - 27
Rem. May I suggest @John 5 in connection with God's work in the soul in view of another world?
F.E.R. You get here the fact of God working, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work". Then we get the character of the work, "The Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father". The Father is the source; the Son the centre. I think if you do not take that into account you will scarcely understand the teaching of the chapter. The works spoken of do not come out now. The Jew had had experience of the work of God, interposed many times in delivering power on behalf of the people; but the works spoken of in this chapter go beyond that.
Rem. Quickening is really the result of power.
F.E.R. They had no experience of that; they will experience it. They had works which will have their results in another world; they are not of this world, but of another world.
Ques. "My Father worketh hitherto". What is that?
F.E.R. I think from the time that sin came in the Father had in contemplation another world of which the Lord was to be the Head and Centre.
Rem. Any one getting light, it would be in view of that world.
{403}
F.E.R. We see God was working all through. When sin entered the world, the world hung upon one man.
Rem. The world of which man was head was a failure; death came in in consequence of sin and there was no way out of that but resurrection.
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. "If one died for all, then were all dead".
Rem. If God is to have another world it must be in resurrection. He is working for that end, and now He has got a Man.
F.E.R. He has got another Man. The world all went wrong because the head of it went wrong. We have the world -- millions of people -- and every man doing what he can for the world in the confusion in which it is.
Rem. It is all in connection with the world, so to speak, gone out of God's hand.
F.E.R. Yes. The beginning of sin coming into the world was that the woman did not refer to her head; she acted according to another dictum, and thus was the ruin of the world brought about.
Ques. The idea of quickening here -- is it actually resurrection, or the soul entering into it in a moral way?
F.E.R. I do not believe it is one or the other. I think power is in exercise in connection with that world. It has not to say to the present time.
Ques. Do you mean that raising is one thing and quickening is another?
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. They are quickened out of the sleep of death.
F.E.R. Yes. Quickening is used in connection with Israel. I think they are raised and then quickened.
Ques. Is the idea mortality swallowed up of life?
F.E.R. I think Israel will be quickened.
{404}
Ques. In what way does the Son quicken whom He will?
F.E.R. In connection with His coming. I think that is the effect of the coming of the Lord. He will quicken *whom He will* -- not all. There is another thing -- judgment; if all were quickened there would be no judgment.
Ques. What difference is there between the Father and Son quickening?
F.E.R. God is the source of all -- only the Son takes the place that properly belonged to the Father. I think the great point of the chapter is that the last Adam, as the Son of God, comes in in life-giving power.
Rem. The Father had worked in the past, now all is committed to the Son.
Ques. Has it a present application?
F.E.R. No, not exactly. I think the present application is, he that heareth My word has passed from death unto life.
Ques. What about hearing the voice of the Son of God?
F.E.R. Well, I think that is true now; hearing the voice of the Son of God is the great present testimony. They hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear live. I think the Lord drops the idea of quickening here and speaks of the testimony of the moment, and of what the effect of that testimony would be -- he that hears lives.
Ques. "He that hears my word"?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Then you make a difference between hearing the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear live?
F.E.R. Yes. So far as I see, the quickening is divine power; hearing the voice of the Son of God is really hearing the testimony.
Ques. What do you make of @Ephesians 2?
{405}
F.E.R. There you get quickened together with Christ. I do not think it is so absolute as here. I think quickening can be taken in a limited way at the present time, in point of affection, so that you are capable in that way for association with Christ. I think you get quickening in real power connected with the advent of the last Adam -- a quickening Spirit. In fact, quickening is perfectly explained in @1 Corinthians 15, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming". I think that makes quickening plain. In Ephesians and Colossians it is taken anticipatively.
Ques. Is it advancement in the divine nature?
F.E.R. I think that is in it. In coming together in the assembly we are capable in point of affection but not as to our bodies; for instance, we very soon find that a meeting will run out.
Rem. Unless we are like the Lord in body it cannot be otherwise.
Ques. Is it the body here?
F.E.R. It says, "quickens whom he will". It implies, as one might speak, that He has choice. It is election really.
Ques. Do I understand that it is applied to the body more particularly?
Rem. It says in another place, "quicken your mortal body".
F.E.R. I think the point of the passage is quickening *whom He will*.
Rem. The man in @John 9 was one who heard the voice of the Son of God.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; he heard the testimony.
Ques. Is it hearing His voice in death in @John 5?
F.E.R. Yes. I think it is a peculiarity of the voice of the Son of God that it involves the death of the
{406}
Son of God. I think it is in death you get His voice. It is in death that He speaks.
Rem. Then it is in resurrection He is declared to be Son of God.
F.E.R. You might say in death His voice was silent, yet it is there He speaks loudest.
Ques. Do you mean that to go into death He became man?
F.E.R. No. I mean He brought life and it came out in death. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life": that is connected with the Son of man lifted up. It is in His death that you hear the voice of the Son of God.
Ques. "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".
F.E.R. Well, I think He becomes the gathering point of all.
Ques. That involves death, too?
F.E.R. Yes; He says so expressly: "This he said, signifying what death he should die".
Ques. Is not the great point, *who it is* who went into death?
F.E.R. Yes; the great testimony was in death. I think, to speak reverently, God came into the place of death. He came to meet man in the place of distance. Man was under death as the fruit of sin. Christ came into that place. He took it upon Him to make amends to God. He said, "Thy law is within my heart". He undertook to make amends in regard of man to God. And the One who made amends to God is the expression of God's love to man, therefore you get the testimony of righteousness and love. There you get the mercy-seat. There is nothing so profound as the death of Christ. It is extraordinary how people will look with reverence on pictures of the crucifixion and all that kind of thing, and be
{407}
affected by what is material, and yet have no conception of the moral bearing of the death of Christ. It is beyond expression. If it could be written the world itself could not contain the books, if it could be expressed, but it is not possible.
Ques. In what way do we hear the voice of the Son of God?
F.E.R. I think when God looks down He sees everything as under death. "If one died for all, then were all dead". What a voice that has! *All were dead*; that is a voice. Christ's death proved that all were dead. Then they that have heard live.
Ques. Would you say it was a definite point in man's history?
F.E.R. I think so. The force of it is, the testimony was in the world, and if any heard it, they lived.
Ques. Would you say that hearing is a proof that life is there?
F.E.R. I would say that life is the *result* of hearing.
Ques. Has it anything to do with being born again?
F.E.R. New birth is previous.
Rem. The quickening is life.
F.E.R. It is involved.
Ques. Is it quickening to life?
F.E.R. As quickened you are looked at as being made alive out of death.
Rem. How often new birth has been taken as the same as quickening.
F.E.R. I think the appreciation of God's love is the starting-point of life. When sin came into the world the love of God came out; it was in love God gave His Son. Until a person has the appreciation of that love, you cannot talk of him living.
Rem. The death of Christ makes that known.
F.E.R. His death is the great witness of it.
{408}
Rem. The effect of it is to carry you beyond the place where sin has power.
F.E.R. That is it. He that heareth My word -- he has passed out of death into life; he has passed into another sphere, another region.
Ques. Is that what we are to understand by quickening a man to life?
F.E.R. I do not think that goes far enough. I think quickening in its full sense is connected with the coming of the Son of God.
Rem. Actually we are not there, but morally we are there now.
F.E.R. When the Son of God comes He brings in the glory of God. I leave this scene to enter upon another, a scene of which the Son of God is centre.
Rem. And in that sphere you are outside the sphere of responsible life down here.
F.E.R. I think many people would be helped if they understood that the house of God is connected with the "land", not with the "wilderness". When you get the High Priest, the High Priest touches us individually but that is not the house of God. When you get the house of God, properly speaking you get Christ as Minister of the sanctuary. The true tabernacle I have no doubt was pitched in connection with the land.
Ques. You mean by the land, the place of God's purpose?
F.E.R. Exactly; the place of God's purpose. It has often been noticed that the idea of the temple is connected with the kingdom. When you pass beyond the kingdom into the eternal state, the tabernacle comes into view again -- the tabernacle of God.
Rem. "And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory ... And I will dwell among the children
{409}
of Israel, and will be their God" (@Exodus 29: 43, 45). That would be the time you speak of.
F.E.R. Yes. Look at @Ephesians 2, "And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus". That is verse 6; then lower down in the chapter we get, "And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ... in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit". I think that is all connected with the land.
Rem. I think it makes a great difference not connecting it with the wilderness.
F.E.R. From this passage and from the Epistle to the Hebrews, I think we get the impression that the house of God is connected with the land.
Ques. With the assembly?
F.E.R. We find in the world a great system of profession which has sprung up in connection with God's testimony in the world which God recognises in a way. At the same time, while that is the case, and we recognise it, we see that the household of God has its own proper character.
Ques. The household of God is more what belongs to God Himself?
F.E.R. I think it is possible to apprehend the two things. No one can deny the great system of profession, but I do not think that is properly the house of God.
Ques. What is the first Epistle to Timothy?
F.E.R. I think you get it there in its proper character.
{410}
Rem. I suppose it is more the shrine or inner sanctuary, what was part of the whole, but not the entire part. In Revelation we read of an outer court being given over to judgment; the temple was for worship.
F.E.R. I think we have the outer thing in christianity; we have the great system of profession which will come under judgment; at the same time we have what was prefigured in the temple.
Rem. The inner part was really where the Lord did not go. He could not be a priest on earth.
Ques. Do you not think we ought to be occupied with the spiritual, moral character of the thing, which is the real thing, while the outward profession has gone to decay?
F.E.R. I have no doubt of it.
Rem. The Spirit occupies us with what is moral.
F.E.R. There seems such confusion around us, but what a comfort it is in the midst of it to remember that all that does not alter the purpose of God. The kingdom of God may have become like a tree with the fowls of the air lodging in its branches; that may be what the external system in the hands of men has become; but at the same time the kingdom has its own proper character, and to enter it a man must be born again. The same is true of the house of God.
Ques. Would you say it is more the character of the church as the assembly of God which abides today?
F.E.R. I think it abides, but I do not shut my eyes to the great outward profession. I do not deny that I am in it, but at the same time it is a great matter to see what is under the eye of God, which is unseen by man. Even christians do not see it, but God sees it. There is a great difference between what God has wrought and what man has wrought.
{411}
Rem. I suppose that is the difference between 1 and 2 Timothy. The great house in 2 Timothy is not the house of God at all.
Rem. I think you have said that John's writings give moral characteristics which abide when what Paul had begun had broken up.
F.E.R. In a day of confusion like this when there is no hope of putting the confusion right, it is a great thing to get insight into where there is no confusion.
Rem. I think it is very interesting to distinguish between what God has wrought and what man has wrought.
F.E.R. What is really for God is His own work.
Rem. And that abides because it is of Himself.
Rem. What is important for us is the effect of the word of God in ourselves. I may build upon something apart from the word of God.
F.E.R. You see men follow after one system, whilst God has another.
Rem. That is really Babylon and the heavenly Jerusalem.
F.E.R. Yes. God builds one, men the other. One will go, the other abide. I think it is a wonderful thing to get hold of the household of God, and to know that God dwells there. And then another point of importance connected with it is that *in God's house Christ has a place*. Christ is Son over God's house -- God's household -- that is the priestly company. I think every one in God's house is a priest.
Rem. That is Aaron and his sons.
F.E.R. Yes; Aaron and his sons constituted God's household. God's light is there. I think a great point of God's household is that there is light there.
Rem. You will not find it anywhere else.
F.E.R. Quite so.
Rem. That I suppose is what really is the basis of fellowship; at least what we are brought into is fellowship in the light.
{412}
F.E.R. Quite so.
Ques. How do you place the hymn, 'Where love shall find its rest'?
F.E.R. In one sense that is right, and in another sense it is wrong. The hymn refers to the future only, not to the present.
Ques. Is it not our privilege now?
F.E.R. I think it is. What is referred to here is, "He that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me ... is passed out of death into life". I think passed into life in a sense is passed in that way into the Father's house. We enter into the house of God at any rate. So the apostle says, "Ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God".
Ques. Is that the household of God in @Hebrews 3?
F.E.R. Exactly. The figure is taken, I have no doubt, from Aaron's house. It is taken really from the tabernacle. The explanation is given later on. We are become companions of Christ.
Ques. They fell in the wilderness?
F.E.R. The point is the household did not fall.
Ques. Where is the household of God in @Hebrews 3? Is that the wilderness?
F.E.R. Well, I do not think it is properly. You know the warnings are in connection with the people -- warnings apply individually; as an individual you are in the wilderness. When you come to companions of Christ you are not in the wilderness. As a matter of fact we are in the wilderness and there we get the warnings.
Ques. That would be to test if we were really entering into it?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Is the way we get into it hearing the voice of the Son of God?
F.E.R. Yes. I cannot think of anything much more important than this, that God has begun
{413}
another order of things in the lifting up of the Son of man. The Son of God went down into death. He met everything in death in order that He might come forth in life. If He comes forth in life He really brings in a new world with Him.
Rem. "On this rock I will build my assembly" -- My assembly.
F.E.R. Yes; *My* assembly. He must come out of death to bring the world with Him.
Rem. I think it depends on who He was. If He had not been the Son of God He could not have come out.
Ques. When you say 'the world', what do you mean?
F.E.R. Well, He brings out the church, He brings everything out of death; He brought you out.
Rem. Everything was under death.
Rem. He does not bring out anything without death.
F.E.R. Oh no. In death He brings out everything that is for God.
Rem. That is the point, everything for God.
F.E.R. I think the church is looked at as the first-fruits. Israel will come out of His grave -- the gentile too.
Ques. Would @Psalm 22 come in here?
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. In connection with Christ now you would say we are out of the world condition.
F.E.R. Resurrection is the principle of the world to come. It must be so. Death is upon everything here, the best as well as the worst. Well, if God is going to bring to pass another world, it must be by resurrection. In the nature of things it must be outside the system of things here. Who is he that overcometh the world? He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God.
{414}
Rem. It was impossible for Him to be holden of it.
F.E.R. Death could not hold Him. He entered into it to come out of it. He says, "No man taketh it from me ... I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again". "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".
Rem. And having come out of it, He can lead the believer out now.
F.E.R. It is one thing to come out in that way, and it is another thing to come out to judgment. Whatever comes out of death in Christ is for God. It is in that way a continuation of the resurrection of Christ. I think it is most striking in regard to Israel: "Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake". They come out of death. Whatever is for God comes from the grave of Christ.
Ques. Is that what the apostle says in the last chapter of Hebrews?
F.E.R. Exactly. The great Shepherd comes out of death.
Rem. I think it is clear it must be God who causes the dead to hear.
F.E.R. You may preach as impressively as you like, but it is not your voice that makes anybody "hear" -- it is God's.
{415}
THE SPIRIT IN THE BELIEVER
@Galatians 6: 1 - 18
This chapter comes in as a kind of supplement to this epistle. In the previous chapters the apostle had gone over the ground that he had purposed. Here he maintains the same ground, that is, that the Spirit is set against the flesh. There are few truths less understood by christians than what hangs on the presence of the Spirit. This latter, although not the foundation of christianity, is the great characteristic of christianity, and nothing is owned of God save as it is of the Spirit. We accept the fact of His presence here, but often fail to apprehend what hangs upon the fact. The cross has judicially ended the flesh for God's glory, and the Spirit excludes it practically, so that the eye of God should not rest upon the flesh at all, but upon that which is the fruit of the Spirit.
Here in this chapter the apostle goes farther as to christian state than he does in other parts of the epistle. You get eternal life touched, and also new creation. (See verses 8, 15.)
I recapitulate the subjects we had on previous occasions, and then touch on what the presence of the Spirit involves, and what He will lead us into. In chapter 3 we get the light of the gospel, that is, the revelation of God's purpose. We are all sons of God "by faith in Christ Jesus". In the light of God's purpose we are such. Then in chapter 4 we get the power which has come forth to effectuate the purpose of God, that is, the Spirit of His Son, and at the end of the chapter we get the testimony by which we are spiritually formed -- "Jerusalem above", the light of a glorified Christ. It is the testimony by which we are formed, and if we are so, we shall not be strangers when we get to heaven.
{416}
Chapter 5 shows us the great principles of christian conduct, liberty and the Spirit. Liberty realised in deliverance from principles such as sin and the world, in order that we may be free to serve one another, and then the Spirit is the power of walk. The flesh and the Spirit are mutually exclusive. The glory of each respectively is, adultery and love. Then in chapter 6 we get important principles. "Be not deceived; God is not mocked". God always stands to moral principles, and is never diverted from them. What a man sows he reaps; this is true in the world and true to christians. He who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap life eternal. It is the setting of the Spirit against the flesh all through. If you want to prove the power of the Spirit you must exclude the flesh.
Now I want to speak for a moment of the power of the Spirit. In Old Testament times the power of the Spirit was here, but was not exactly set against the flesh. I will explain what I mean: I look at flesh in two lights; first, as the principle of evil and corruption in man; secondly, as mere natural force. And in this latter sense in Old Testament times the Spirit helped the flesh. Samson is an illustration of this. "The Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him". In Old Testament times the flesh was being tested, and consequently it was not yet the day of the Spirit. Flesh is evil; and flesh is natural power. This latter is of no avail for God, because it is at the disposal of an evil will. The principle which rules the natural power is not to be trusted. When the Lord was here the Spirit *abode* upon Him. That was new. He had come on occasions upon David and others, but the Spirit descended and abode upon Christ, and He was thereby marked out as the One "who baptises with the Holy Spirit" and this baptism took place at Pentecost. But the oil was on the
{417}
blood, the witness that the flesh was condemned, so that the Spirit was now given to dwell in the believer.
The Spirit has come down here to entirely exclude the flesh. Stephen in @Acts 7 set forward that the flesh under every dealing of God had been proved perverse, as witnessed in breaking of law, persecution of prophets, killing of Christ, and resistance of the Spirit. Every testimony from God was rejected, and the flesh was condemned in the cross, and the Spirit of God came down to give effect to this practically in the believer. The work of God in us *cannot* now be carried out in *natural power*. The Spirit is here to exclude the flesh entirely. The Spirit does not energise man's natural power, but is here to be the one sole power to the saints.
Now another point in this chapter is this, that the great office of the Spirit is to carry those in whom He dwells up to the source from which He came. There is a great distinction drawn in Scripture between Christ and the Spirit. Christ came to an unbelieving world. He inherited a recognised name on earth -- Son of man -- Son of God. He was presented to men "after the flesh". In the sermon on the mount, the principle is of association with Him in His recognised place on the earth. Now the Spirit did not come after the flesh, but came when Christ is no longer known after the flesh. The Spirit did not become incarnate nor come to an unbelieving world, "whom the world cannot receive". The Spirit came to carry those who had believed to the source from which He came -- the Father.
Christ was the supreme object to the hearts of the disciples, and the Spirit came to conduct their hearts where He was glorified. "He shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you". The Spirit continues with us -- this is characteristic of His being here. He came when Jesus was glorified to make good what the Lord had said, "I ... know my sheep,
{418}
and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father".
The sphere of eternal life is not down here, it is where Christ is. "This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent". Where can you find the Father and the sent One? They are not here, they are in heaven, and the Spirit conducts you to them. Eternal life is the divine Persons known; not as They were in eternity, but in the place They have taken in grace. Eternal life is within the reach of faith. Which are you going to lay yourself out for; eternal life or corruption? If you live to consider yourself, you will reap corruption, but if you sow to the Spirit you will reap eternal life. This is akin to @John 4, where we have the well of water springing up to eternal life. I do not ask you, 'Have you the well of water?' but I ask, 'Does it spring up, or is it choked?' If it springs up you will be led in spirit outside the whole course of things here. Your interests will be all outside of this scene. There is unbroken rest alone where the Father and the Son are. If I am carried to that scene I am fitted to come into this scene where there is no rest. Eternal life is to know the Father and the sent One. The scene of rest to the believer is where the Father and the Son are and where God's purpose is enjoyed and the power is displayed by which He has given effect to it.
Now another point. (See verses 12 - 15.) In this passage I see an intimate connection between flesh and the world, and flesh can take a religious character. It can adopt a garb or uniform to gain a religious character in the presence of man, but this does not avail with God. The apostle could say, the world had died a shameful death (been crucified) in his eye, and so, too, the apostle had died a shameful death to it. The world had crucified the Lord of glory. It is the flesh that would maintain a religious
{419}
character before the world; the Spirit will not support any one in this attempt.
Then we have in verse 15, "For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision; but new creation". Nothing will meet the state of things down here but the character of God -- new creation. In times gone by, circumcision might have availed a Jew in the presence of a gentile world, but now in an evil world that has rejected Christ, the testimony is of Christ Jesus. It is a Man of another order. New creation is the new man, the character of it is after God, in righteousness and holiness of truth (@Ephesians 4: 24). The character of God came out in Christ; you get it presented in @Matthew 5: your righteousness must exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees. Now it is loving your enemies. This is the character of God. The new man is "*after God*", and this is the only way in which evil can really be met. All this depends upon the work of the Spirit in the believer. The apostle speaks in the epistle to Titus of the renewing of the Holy Spirit. That is what the Spirit effectuates in you; having received the Spirit we get the truth of new creation, and it is after the character of God. The apostle adds, "as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them". How many of us are prepared to accept the exclusion of the flesh, that God has set it aside in *all* that it is, and not only in its corrupt state? I have nothing else for God, nor for service save the Spirit. He is the only power by which there can be produced what is "after God". All must be "after God" now. It is the character of God in the christians, as we get in @1 John 3 -- righteousness and love. But to this end we must be formed in it, and this is as we know God as He has come out in Christ. The testimony is not beyond the measure of what we are, and the Spirit is ever
{420}
bent upon carrying forward the work of grace in the believer.
I commend @Matthew 5 to you. Righteousness according to God, so that they might bear the character of their Father which is in heaven, that they might come out manifestly in His character. It is very important for our souls to lay hold of what hangs upon the presence of the Spirit here. Christ is no longer after the flesh, and the Spirit is here to exclude all that is of the flesh in the believer.
JOTTINGS FROM PREVIOUS LECTURE
In chapter 3 we get *light*; in chapter 4 the formative power of the Spirit. It would be of no avail to me to be brought into the light unless there were a corresponding power to form me according to the light.
God has sent forth His Son that we may have the light of His purpose, and He has sent forth the *Spirit* of *His Son* that we may be blessed in the reality of it. Then at the end of the chapter we get the *system* by which we are formed -- Jerusalem above -- Christ in glory; Man entirely according to God's pleasure, and *that* Man loves us and we are formed by Him.
In chapter 5 the great point is walk, but first you get *liberty*.
The power of the Spirit is to maintain us in liberty; the instant the flesh begins to work we get into bondage, and bondage belongs to the flesh -- to Ishmael.
{421}
CONDUCT SUITED TO THE DOCTRINE
Notes on the Epistle to Titus
In Timothy the great point before the mind of Paul is the maintenance of the doctrine; in Titus it is the conduct suited to the doctrine, what are called "good works". Titus was among a people that were morally very degraded. The truth is evidently commended or otherwise by the practice of those who hold it. Here the doctrine is to be adorned, and, as has been frequently noticed, that is spoken in connection with the lowest grade of society, the slaves.
One would judge that the connection between doctrine and piety was not being fully maintained. The apostle speaks of the truth which is according to godliness, or piety. I think piety is the true test of how far the doctrine is effective in people; it shews the measure in which it has taken root in them.
Piety is not exactly conduct, but refers more to the habit of the soul. "Therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe"; it is that kind of spirit. There is great danger because of the amount of doctrine which is current among us, for if it is held apart from piety it may be a very mischievous thing. Piety is not exactly practice, but it is practical. It is the acquaintance of God that issues in practice. The original is commonly translated "godliness", but that does not exactly express the idea, for we read of piety to parents: "Let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents", @1 Timothy 5: 4. What is the good of a man's boast of orthodoxy if he cannot practically trust God? The doctrine is not effective in him. A man's piety indicates his measure, not that which he knows. Doctrine held alone makes a man conceited, and there is not the tone about him which a pious man has.
{422}
My great pleasure in going to the book of Psalms is that they are so very expressive of piety, trusting God in difficulties, and under pressure, and such like. Now the full light has come, but it will not do to take occasion of that to lose piety.
There is nothing ecclesiastical in this epistle; nothing about the assembly. Bishops and deacons are recognised, but as caring for the saints.
The epistle has much the same character as those to Timothy; for instance, the apostle speaks of himself in each, "in hope of eternal life". It is wonderful to me that with God there should have been the thought of eternal life before death came in. It was purposed in Christ, but it was impossible that it should come to light before death had come in and been annulled. Adam in innocence was alive, yet he had not eternal life according to the thought of God. He had a life which might be forfeited, and was forfeited. The whole scheme and thought of eternal life connects itself with the second Man -- Christ. Wherever eternal life is, in heaven or earth, it takes its character from Christ. Adam never took his character from Christ. As far as I know, the one point of similarity between Adam in innocence and Christ was the total absence of evil. The church is the fulness of Christ, which no other family is, but none the less every family takes its character from Him.
The acknowledging of the truth which is after piety is the great point of the epistle. It is not quite what we understand by acknowledging, but rather clear knowledge. Other teachings were coming in to corrupt the saints, "Jewish fables, and commandments of men". The rabbis allegorised everything, and so completely got rid of all that was real in Scripture. One of the greatest dangers by which we are beset is the tendency to accept what has been handed down. Truth may in the first instance have
{423}
been set in forms which were harmless and were sufficiently sound; but it became in that way stereotyped, the forms were handed down and accepted by others, and eventually instead of being an expression of the truth, they become in the hands of many, a perversion of it. These accepted forms are liable to become a standard of doctrine.
"In due times manifested his word through preaching". His word is the expression of His mind. A man's thought is hid in himself until he makes it known, but when he makes it known his word is the expression of his thought. What is spoken of here was in the counsel of God, but when it comes out it is His word.
Titus was left in Crete to set things in order, to ordain elders, etc. The word "bishop" should be "overseer"; it is one who overlooks the flock. "Elder" refers to age; "bishop" to oversight. In the first instance elders were no doubt taken from the elder men in general.
"As the steward of God"; that is, as having charge of God's house, for a steward took care of the house during his lord's absence. It would be a very serious injury to the house if the stewards were not blameless. Then he was to maintain the truth though not a teacher.
What I look for in a teacher is a certain kind of originality, by which I mean that he gets his own proper apprehension of divine things instead of simply going on the line of others. An elder could follow up that which he had been taught. Gifts were moving about, but an elder was local; it was of importance, therefore, that the elder should hold fast the faithful word as he had been taught.
The mouth of gainsayers was to be stopped. I have known people to come into a meeting thinking that because there was a certain sort of liberty it was a place where they could speak even though it
{424}
was to the edification of none. Such a thing should be seen to. Surely there ought not to be any greater check than the presence of Christ. If we believe that He is present, we should be very clear indeed that in seeking to instruct saints we are in touch with Him.
Besides teaching there are the manifestations of the Spirit. The word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, and such like, are not exactly gifts, but manifestations of the Spirit. They are spoken of in @1 Corinthians 12 and with a view to check the idea of clericalism. The manifestation of the Spirit may be in a member of the body who is not at all conspicuous. If you attach too much importance to gift, you may have such completely overshadowing everything else in the assembly and shutting out the liberty of the Spirit.
If a teacher is right his great object is to give the saints an intelligent understanding of Scripture. We do not get truth from man; it is only by the Spirit. I think God provides for the maintenance of a *living* line of teaching for the church. In @2 Timothy 2: 2 there are four generations, a succession of living witnesses in the power of the Holy Spirit: (1) Paul, (2) Timothy, (3) faithful men, (4) others also.
The character of the aged men spoken of here (chapter 2) would be the natural effect of the grace in them. I think there is a danger of taking up christianity as if we were under law. The exhortations of Scripture are like sign-posts; they confirm the one who is going on, and if in any uncertainty they direct him. I think you may safely say that no person can carry out the precepts of Scripture unless he is under the influence of the grace of God. The love of God is that we keep His commandments, but this supposes that we are under the influence of His love, and then it comes out in this way, we keep His commandments.
I understand by "sobriety" that a man has a right estimate of himself (@Romans 12: 3). There are few
{425}
people who have not naturally inflated thoughts of themselves. A man should think of himself according to the measure of his faith.
Titus was to be a pattern among the saints. Nothing can be of greater importance than that the servant should be the expression of the truth. A man has weight by what he is and not by what he says. Paul could say, "Thou hast fully known my doctrine, *manner of life*, purpose", and exhorted Timothy, "Be thou an example of the believers". If a man is not this he has no power in teaching. A great responsibility rests upon us. With the light we have the question is raised as to how far we realise the truth. We should be formed by the truth.
I do not think it is a bad sign that the study of prophecy is not prominent. @2 Peter 1: 19 gives us its true place; it is as "a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts". I do not think that special attention to prophecy will give much light as to it; you must have the light of Christ on prophecy. I would rather see men get a true idea of the church. The scope of the New Testament is much larger than that of the Old. The Old is not nearly so difficult to understand, because it is occupied with God's government and the earth. When you get the knowledge of the New Testament the Old is largely detail. Take for instance the work of Christ: you get the great facts in the New, but if you want to get hold of details you find them in the sacrifices of the Old. To any one who has the light of Christ the great principles of prophecy are not difficult. There may be some difficulty in the particular interpretation of figures, symbols, but the great principles are not difficult. I should be sorry to have any one neglect the reading of prophecy in private, or any part of the word of God, but those who have made
{426}
prophecy a speciality never have understood it. Christ in the heart of the christian is the day star.
It is remarkable that the beautiful exhortation at the close of chapter 2 should come in connection with the lowest social grade. The great contrast is striking, "not purloining", and then, as a reason, "that they may adorn the doctrine". Nothing can be much lower than purloining; and you step from that to the highest.
The blessed hope and the appearing are identical. In Scripture it is the appearing that is usually looked for. Christ looks for the rapture and the saints look for the appearing. @John 14 ("I will come again, and receive you unto myself") is on Christ's side, not ours.
Lawlessness ("iniquity", verse 14) is looked upon as the great principle that rules in the world. The man of sin is the lawless one. (@2 Thessalonians 2: 8, "that Wicked".) The most lawless are the scientific men of the day, because the principle they go upon is that no limit can be put upon the human mind. That is lawlessness, because it shuts out revelation. It is as much as to say that God cannot reveal Himself, for if He sees fit to do so, it sets a barrier on man's mind. The act of Adam will culminate in Antichrist. It has been said that man has set himself up to be a rival of God, and the full expression of that will be in Antichrist. Christ comes in to make known to the heart of man what the love of God is. You never get confidence without love. You will never confide in a person unless you see that he loves you. The love of God is the backbone of the gospel; it is the secret of all that has come to pass. A good text to preach from is @John 3: 16, but to preach from it is to preach from *God's* standpoint, not the sinner's. You must bring home to man the sense of responsibility to God, and when that is awakened what meets it is not love, but grace. The first thing apprehended by a man is grace, then he is justified, and then the
{427}
Holy Spirit sheds abroad the love of God in his heart. My idea of the love of God is that it will never be satisfied until it has you with Himself. But the first acquaintance any man gets of God is of grace. No one can know God in His own nature but by the Holy Spirit.
John's gospel goes on the ground that man has rejected Christ, and it is the great broad principle that applies at all times. Then the wonderful thing to me is the love of God to the world. It is not shewn in blessing the world, for it is set aside and under judgment; but the door to eternal life is open to every one, not the Jews only, but also gentiles; it is "whosoever believeth in him".
I think that the redemption is actual deliverance, bringing us out, though of course the price was paid when He gave Himself for us. God has saved us for His own pleasure.
{428}
THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
@Galatians 5: 16 - 26; @Galatians 6: 1 - 3
My object on former occasions has been to bring before you certain principles by which people are powerfully affected. Many things by which we have imagined ourselves to be affected have not affected us deeply; but three things to which I have referred, namely, the light and the revelation of God, and the love of Christ, and the power of the Spirit, do very powerfully affect us.
I judge that we have all been greatly affected by the recognition of the Spirit's presence here, both as in the individual and in the assembly. In fact, it has changed our thought about everything, and the result of our apprehending the presence of the Spirit has been great. He dwells in a two-fold mode: with the saints, and in the believer. "He dwelleth *with* you, and shall be *in* you".
I will shortly recall what we have had previously before us. Man by the fall lost God; though having a conscience he has not by nature any light about God; this is the condition of every unconverted person, even though he call himself a christian, Now the object of the gospel is to enlighten man as to God. There is no greater expression of the grace of God than that He should have come out of His place to make Himself known to man. The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel; grace reaches man through righteousness. The gospel brings the strong impression of the righteousness of God, as seen in the cross, and this is the moral foundation laid in every believer's soul. A babe is one who is "unskilful in the word of righteousness". When I speak of righteousness I mean the righteousness of God. Sin is intolerable to God, and He has removed it; it is gone from before Him, and gone with the order of
{429}
life to which it attached. It is gone in the righteous One. This is the first great truth in the gospel. Now another element comes in, and that is God's power. While the gospel brings the sense of the grace of God, it reveals Him in His attributes of righteousness and power. Mercy is not righteousness. The character of God is absolute, so there can be no deviation from any of His attributes; He does not shew mercy at the expense of righteousness; and hence the need of the death of Christ.
I have referred also to the influence of the love of Christ, and to the various ways in which that love is expressed to us. His death expresses it. Then we have the activity of it in him as Priest. The moment I accept the obligation of righteousness, and have yielded my members as instruments of righteousness unto God, Christ supports and succours us. We are "married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God". He is also the minister of the sanctuary, the firstborn among many brethren, leading us into the Father's love. Then finally, we have the love of Christ as connected with the testimony of saints down here. "As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love ... This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you".
The apostle Paul was greatly affected by the love of Christ; it constrained him. The love of Christ is peculiar; it must be a great factor in the heart of a christian. We cannot speak of the love of God in quite the same way. We do not speak of God coming down for us into death, nor of His sympathizing with us. There is an intense personality in the love of Christ and this thought does not necessarily minister to sentimentality; we have not to imagine all sorts of things about it in a carnal way. We have to accept it in the way in which Christ has expressed it in His death and in which He now acts towards us.
{430}
Now I come to my present subject: the Spirit is a potent influence in the believer. There was a time with most of us when we had no sense at all of the Spirit as dwelling, and when the truth was brought to us that the Spirit was here in the absence of Christ, it affected our pathway greatly. We began to see that the sects and systems around would not do at all. The Spirit was shut out by human arrangements. Nothing has affected me more than the fact that my body is the temple of the Spirit of God. We have been accustomed to regard the Spirit rather as an influence under which a man could do remarkable acts, as we see in men in Old Testament times. The consequences of an indwelling Spirit are momentous. It involves the complete displacement of the flesh in the believer. "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts".
The contrast between Christ and the Spirit is this, that Christ did all the work *for* us, the Spirit does all *in* us. The Spirit never takes exactly the place of a servant, as did Christ. Christ took that place on earth, and retains it in a sense for ever. He serves us now, and will serve us eternally, like the Hebrew slave whose ear was bored through with an awl and nailed to the door-post. We find in @Luke 12 that Christ will occupy the place of a servant in heaven; He will minister to the joy of His people, not washing our feet as now; this is His present service.
The Spirit has come to take complete control; the believer's body is like a house under entirely new management. There are several figures employed in Scripture in speaking of the power and influence of the Spirit; He is a well of water springing up (that is not the idea of a servant); He is also spoken of under the figure of oil, a dove, tongues of fire.
It is to be recognised as a point of fundamental importance that what is true for God in the death of Christ has to be made good in the believer. There
{431}
are three types presented to us in Scripture of the death of Christ, namely, the blood of the passover lamb, the Red sea, and the brazen serpent; God's righteousness vindicated, the enemy destroyed, his power broken, and sin in the flesh condemned. Now all this, having been effected for God, has to be made good in the believer, and it is not always quickly effected in us. How is the righteousness of God made effective in us? In your becoming servant to righteousness you are no longer the slave of sin. We have become servants to that which was vindicated in the cross. The death of Christ has thus become effective in us.
The Red sea is also a type of the death of Christ; it shews the destruction of the enemy in death. Death stood as God's judgment between man and God, but the death of Christ, where the judgment was borne, has become the testimony to us of the love of God. The only way by which man could ever come to God was through bringing a witness of death. Abel came in that way; he brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. The reason of this is simple -- death lay on man, hence man could not approach God except by the recognition of what was upon him. When God came out to man, He came out through death, the death of Christ, and therefore it is now not the expression of His judgment, but of His love. The rod of God divided the waters of the Red sea and the power of the enemy is gone. The death of Christ is thus the way to God. If I am in the enjoyment of the love of God, death is no terror to me. The power of the enemy was really broken when Christ died, but it is broken for the believer when the love of God is shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Spirit given to him. The Holy Spirit brings the sense of God's love.
Light is in itself comparatively a cold thing, but the sense of what the light brings is warmth. Sense
{432}
is the consciousness of it. When we get the warmth of the love, then it is that the power of the enemy is broken in our souls. That which delivers from the fear of death is the sense of the love of God, for the love of God gives the sense of distance having gone.
But further, there was in the death of Christ the condemnation of man's state; flesh was set aside in the sight of God, and with the intent that God might impart the Spirit to the believer. The Spirit of God as an indwelling Spirit will not tolerate the flesh: "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh". The flesh retains reminiscences of what we have been accustomed to in the world, but the Spirit is against the flesh, so that we should not do the things to which we are prone. The Spirit is not an influence nor merely a power; in the believer He is a "well of water springing up into everlasting life". He begins at the bottom and His purpose is to displace completely the flesh. The apostle shews in @Galatians 5 very nakedly what the works of the flesh are, and what is the fruit of the Spirit. Then follows, "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts". I call that normal to the christian. The Spirit works in this way; He brings in the sense of the holiness of God. The cross displayed His righteousness, and the resurrection His power, but the Spirit gives the sense of what God's nature is -- His holiness and love.
A person is very largely coloured by the associations in which he lives. The Holy Spirit works in us in this way. He brings in the sense of the love of God; this means an entirely new association, If suddenly placed at court with the queen, we should not many of us feel at ease; but we are brought into association with what is of God, and the work of the Holy Spirit is to form us according to the associations in which we are set. He does not simply set Himself against the flesh to free you from the
{433}
dominion of sin, but He forms you completely anew by the new associations which are around.
The Spirit is an energy in the believer -- a well of water springing up -- a fountain to take complete possession of the believer. His proper work is to form us in the divine nature. The fact that we have actually a divine Person dwelling in us to bring to us the sense of God's holiness and love, and to form us according to that, is all very profound.
Think of the grace of God in which He has come out, revealing Himself to man as light that man may know Him, and then the love of Christ adapting itself to us in the circumstances in which we find ourselves down here and leading us into His own blessed circle above, and then the presence and power of the Spirit emancipating us from the dominion of sin, and forming us by the new and blessed association in which the grace of God has set us. Monks shut up in religious houses had an idea of mortification of the flesh, but they had no idea whatever of the Holy Spirit as forming the believer by divine light in the divine nature. It is the seeing this that delivers the soul completely from asceticism. The believer is not only dead with Christ, but is quickened together with Him; that is, he is made alive in Christ in the divine nature. It is in the reality of this that we enter into the truth of God's calling.
{434}
SALVATION AND TESTIMONY
@Titus 2: 9 - 14
Many who are simple in faith have not been accustomed to make distinctions as to things which differ. For instance, some minds may not apprehend the difference between light and life, yet there is a great difference, though the two are closely connected.
The sun in the heavens shines on everything in nature; so now, the light of God has come, His love has been brought out: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son". Light is the revelation of God and it is for everyone. It is like the sun that shines for everyone, so that even a blind man gets the benefit of it; as it is said, "There is nothing hid from the heat thereof". Felix was affected by the light of God, but he was not subdued by it; when a man is converted he is subdued by the light; the light shines into the heart of every one that is reached by the gospel. The correct reading of this passage is, "The grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared", and the force of it is that the grace of God brings salvation, as the sun brings warmth and heat. Light does not destroy, it leads to life, but in life God must begin. Man is baffled in his thoughts when the question of life is brought in. Life is the great subject with John; with him it is not so much a question of light as of life; a man must be born again.
In this passage there is a remarkable expression used in regard to christians, they are called "a peculiar people". I only recall one other passage which speaks of christians as a people. Israel is a people, but the assembly of God is the body of Christ; when we are looked at as a people, it is as individuals.
{435}
I want to speak this evening of salvation, and another thing which is connected with it, that is, good works, The apostle was very earnest in exhorting those to whom he wrote to be zealous of good works; he desired that they should be a people bearing a true testimony for the Lord down here. When Christ was on earth He was full of good works, He went about doing good; and if we desire to bear testimony to the grace of God we must be zealous of good works.
"The grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared". The passage does not speak of bringing salvation for the elect, but for all men. Paul speaks of the elect in writing to Timothy, saying, "I endure all things for the elect's sakes". Here in Titus we have the character of the grace of God, which has come as light into the world, bringing with it salvation. It is important to see in what that salvation consists, and also on what foundation it rests. We must bear in mind what God has effected for Himself in the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, as well as what that death and resurrection have secured for us. It is the wonderful way in which God has intervened for man, and all is effected in One who is Himself a divine Person, the Son.
Let us look at what God effected for Himself in the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. The first thing is the removal of the man that was an offence to Him. The first man, the lawless man, could not please God; he could not be reinstated, he must be removed, and the blessed Son of God took the place of that man vicariously, as a sacrifice on the cross, in order that He might remove that man from beneath the eye of God, and, consequently, the first man is no longer seen by God. The witness of Christ having done this was in the blood, for "the blood is the life". The blood bears witness to the
{436}
fact that the first man has disappeared in judgment from the eye of God. The man that was an offence to God has disappeared, and in resurrection there is before God a man of another order. Christ was not of the first man, but He entered into the place of the first man and went into death, and came forth from death as man. He was the same morally when He came out of death as when He went into it, there was no change in Him. But in resurrection we see death annulled, and the kingdom established in Him. The resurrection of one man from the dead is a proof that God has gained the victory.
Now all the blessings of the kingdom are established in Christ; He is Lord of all. When on earth He could say in reference to Himself, "The kingdom of God is within you". "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit". The Holy Spirit is the power by which these principles prevail. God's righteousness has been maintained and vindicated, the kingdom of God is established in the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit is here to maintain its principles in those who are upon the earth.
Salvation consists in the appropriation of Christ as Lord. We have to appropriate Him thus because He is not yet reigning in manifest power. We have not to appropriate the government of this country in that way, because it is manifestly present and acknowledged; but the Lord is not here, He is at the right hand of God. We know Him by faith as the risen One, and appropriate Him as Lord, and thus we get the blessings of the kingdom.
If you go about in the fear of death it proves that you have not yet appropriated Jesus as Lord. In His kingdom the power of death is broken, and as a believer you belong to that kingdom where death does not rule. Have you the blessings of the kingdom, supported by the authority of the word of God?
{437}
Have you secured your title-deeds? Do not be satisfied with the mere letter of Scripture. Are we in the enjoyment of righteousness, peace, and joy, in the Holy Spirit, every day in the week, and every hour of the day? These things never lose their power for the christian, but rather become more intense as we go on; how much do we taste of them?
The kingdom of God does not belong to this world. We have to go through the world and do our business, and obey the powers that be, but these things have to do with man's kingdom, not with God's kingdom. We must distinguish between the present order of things, through which we have to pass, and the kingdom of God, and yet the blessings of the kingdom affect us in every detail of our lives here.
Now we own the moral sway of God, and we are in the light and enjoyment of what is established in the Lord Jesus Christ, so that we are able to carry out every duty as owning Him as Lord, even to the most menial service. The exhortation here is to slaves, and none of us have been so low as that. We are only in this world for a moment, and while passing on, our thoughts are to be engaged with the kingdom. It seems to me that many of the Lord's people are living beneath their position. A christian's occupation in this world may be a very humble one, very small and poor in the estimation of men, but when he is considered in connection with the kingdom of God a dignity attaches to him of which the world knows nothing. The apostle writes, "Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters ... that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things". They were not to rebel, nor even to seek their freedom, and why? Because they were in the kingdom of God. If you want to enjoy salvation, appropriate the Lord Jesus Christ.
{438}
I hope you understand that the kingdom of God is outside all that is here, so that it is said, "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord". Let it be the habit of your soul to confess Him, for thus you will get away from the god of this world. If you appropriate Him as Lord, you are out of Satan's power, and you cannot have any fear of death. For the millennium the Lord will bring salvation with Him, and it will consist in deliverance from death and all the power of evil.
Then, if Christ is Lord to us, we ought to be representatives of Him down here, and so we have the words, "We should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ". We are to be a people representative of the Lord, and zealous of good works. To help us to understand this I would refer to @Colossians 1: 9 - 11 where we find three things, which were, in a sense, characteristic of the Lord Himself, and which are to characterise us as walking worthily of Him; we are to be (1) fruitful in good works, (2) increasing in the knowledge of God, and (3) strengthened according to the power of Christ's glory. When the Lord comes He will bring these things with Him, and men will be zealous of good works; they will have the knowledge of God and the power of Christ's glory. In that day all that God is will be expressed to the world in the Person of the Son; "in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".
When here on earth He bore full testimony to God; He did the Father's works, and spoke the Father's words, and was filled with the Spirit; thus He was the full expression of God, and when He comes again He will be the full expression of God's supremacy and glory. If we look into the glory now, what do we see? Jesus! and from heaven we look
{439}
for Him as Saviour. When He comes in the power of His glory angels will be His ministers in dealing with evil, but He has power to subdue all things to Himself.
Now He looks for His people to be a true testimony to Himself, like vigorous trees, growing and bearing fruit. If we are not thus we have not the signs of health, and we shall be dwarfed. If a christian goes on well he expands, he grows by the knowledge of God, and everything about him shews it. The kingdom of God is not only righteousness and peace, but also joy in the Holy Spirit. There is a testimony for the Lord in every good work, and a growth by the knowledge of God, in fact, a true representation of Christ.
When the Lord comes again the power of His glory will be displayed in raising the bodies of His saints; but what a wonderful thing it is to be here *now* a testimony to the power that worketh in us, the power by which He will subdue all things unto Himself. "Strengthened ... unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness". Patience and long-suffering are the signs of strength. We see it all in Christ when He was here; He was ever patient and long-suffering, and He had His own joy, so that at the moment of His utter rejection by man He rejoiced in spirit. Patience and long-suffering mark Christ now, and God strengthens us that we may be patient.
To be here a testimony for the Lord we have to do with two things, the grace of God and the glory of God. The grace of God teaches us how to walk, and as we prove the power of the glory we become fruitful unto every good work. Impatience often marks us. As a man advances in years he is prone to be more impatient; declining in natural power, he likes his own way and does not like to be thwarted; but that is self. In Christ we see what is different
{440}
from this, and looking to the Lord we come out in "all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness". It is not that we are merely resigned, for resignation is a poor thing for a christian, but we are superior, we give thanks unto the Father.
The first thing that marks a person who is in the good of salvation is the appropriation of the Lord, and as a consequence he is delivered from fear. The one who fears is not in the enjoyment of deliverance, he is not made perfect in love. We enjoy salvation in the measure in which we appropriate the Lord; we walk in the light of the Lord, and in the blessings of the kingdom. Then the power of His glory is here, and this enables us to come out in moral superiority to all that is here. We look for the appearing of the glory when its power will be put forth as to our bodies.
{441}
THE WAY OF SALVATION
@Acts 16: 16 - 40; @Philippians 2: 12 - 16
It is of importance to observe that what the apostle pressed upon the saints at Philippi was that which had been pressed upon himself, and we can apprehend from him what we are to be here according to the mind of God.
There are two ways in which the christian can be viewed: namely, as in Ephesians, in an abstract way in relation to what is collective, or as in Philippians, where he is viewed individually and as running a race, The church does not run a race, but each individual christian is here in the faith, and running a race from one point to another, from earth to heaven. We run to the goal.
In regard to what we are to be here, let me say, we are to answer to God's mind. We have an illustration of this in the apostle himself; he pressed upon others what he practised himself. "Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you".
First of all we have to find our true level, and that is low enough. In our chapter it comes out in Christ. The death of the cross was man's level. The Jew was disobedient to death and under the curse of a broken law. Christ became obedient to death, the death of the cross; and each one of us has to come down in mind to that, because it is the true level of every one, and is the way of our deliverance. We are permitted to see how Paul came down to this level. He could say, "I am crucified with Christ". He apprehended that Christ, in grace and obedience, had come down to the cross, and was in mind identified with Him. Now, the end for which Christ came
{442}
down to the cross was this: that another world might be introduced in the place of this one, and in @Hebrews 11 we find that faith always had in view the world to come. In the world to come there are three features which appear in our chapter, (1) glory to the Father, (2) Jesus as Lord, (3) everything bowing to Him.
It is evident that this world is not for the glory of the Father, but, on the contrary, it is a system in which man seeks his own glory and not the glory of God. There is a world in view where the Father's glory is secured, where Christ is Lord, and where the confession of Him as Lord is universal. In the meantime, while we wait for that world, we have to accept the cross. Christ does not revive this world, because His object in going into death was to bring in another world altogether. He is not Lord for this world. He is the Lord of glory, entirely unknown by the princes of this world.
It is painful to man to come down to his level, and no one could thus come down if Christ had not been crucified; but Christ having been crucified makes it possible for one to say, "I am crucified with Christ". If we do by grace come down to our true level, we are only accepting what really belongs to us. Christ came there in grace in order that we might be enabled to accept it, and if we accept it the result is deliverance. We disappear from the world.
When a man is converted he properly disappears from the world's stage. As unconverted, being God's enemy and doing the will of the flesh, one's place was under the curse, the curse of a broken law. The flesh cannot be changed for God, and therefore the man must go, and in order for that we have to accept our place, the death of Christ; but in the acceptance of His death we get salvation from the influences here.
{443}
Many christians have accepted a place in the world, but in doing so they have never been free from worldly influences. If a man occupies a place on this world's stage he is bound to be affected by its influences. To be a disciple is to be free from every influence here. No influence of this world could affect Christ. He overcame the world, and we are free by being disciples. Influences are subtle and indefinable. They are satanic and worldly; they are, so to speak, in the air, and we feel them at every moment, and in reality to be on the world's stage is to be under them. The only way to be free is as crucified with Christ. He died that we might accept that place, and thus obtain salvation. A man free from influences has salvation. Salvation is to be free from bondage. Israel were saved from the Egyptians, and we are saved from influences in the world. Christ has said, "I have overcome the world".
The prison at Philippi was a low place, and the apostle Paul was not the kind of man to be cast into a prison. Government is for evil-doers, but it was from prison that Paul was to be exalted. No one would have thought that to be cast into prison was the way of exaltation from God; yet it was so. Christ was exalted from the cross, and the thief alone knew it. Paul was exalted from prison, and it was proved in that they prayed and sang praises to God. Their spirits were so free from bondage and from every influence that they could praise God.
They were in prison because of God's testimony and we see in them the characteristics of Christ coming out. Paul and Silas were not murmuring and disputing. They were lights in the world morally, holding forth the word of life, and were conspicuous as such. Their hearts were light, and they shone out as lights to the jailor. We see in the apostle here the expression of his exhortation to the saints, and this is to come out in us. We are to be free from
{444}
worldly influences, and the only place for this is crucifixion with Christ.
In a world where there was nothing morally for God, Christ accepted crucifixion to bring about another world, another order of things for the glory of God the Father. The Spirit of God is here, and He brings us to righteousness, holiness, and eternal life. Righteousness is the maintenance in integrity of every divinely established relationship. Holiness must be maintained in a world of defilement. Evil is repugnant to holiness. Grace brings us to righteousness, and holiness is connected with love. If righteousness and holiness are maintained in the believer, then he is without rebuke.
Paul was brought to prison for rebuking evil. If we are in the new man we are without rebuke, because he is created in righteousness and holiness of truth. The Jew, gentile, and christendom are all crooked and perverse. The flesh cannot be otherwise. We are to be lights in the world, holding forth the word of life. Man without light within himself cannot shew it out to others.
We are kept by light because it exposes all. Christ is light to us. The word of life is Christ; it is the testimony committed to us. We can present to men Christ, the Head of every man. He has met every liability of man in order that He may impart living water to man.
Paul preached the word of the Lord to the jailor. We see in Paul the moral excellence of christianity coming out. He was brought into the reality of salvation from influences here, and we, having put on the new man, are to come forth as children of God.
Christianity is morally excellent, because it is of God. It is not in mere dogma. Any christian with a sense of what the flesh is would desire to be delivered from it in order to be exalted morally before God.
{445}
God would have all this to be fulfilled in us now. Israel had to go down to the Red sea to acquire salvation, but in our case we acquire it by going down to the cross, Christ having first gone there to make it possible for us.
{446}
THEOLOGY
I suppose that theology concerns itself not simply with the question of what God is in an abstract way, but of what He is in relation to men. It involves, therefore, the revelation of God. Indeed, it would be difficult to see how there could be any such thing as theology if there were not a revelation. In christendom there are few who deny revelation; the great question that exists is as to the mode of the application of that revelation to men. As to this there are great and essential differences of mind.
We may divide christendom into various great parts, not all owning one another, but all existing as a matter of fact. There is the Roman Catholic Church, though this is rather a contradiction in terms, because by the designation 'Roman' it is no longer catholic. Then there is what may be called the Episcopal Church, outside of Rome. Then there is Protestantism. These three would include pretty much all christendom.
Now in the first of these, that is, Roman Catholicism, the idea is of the authority and infallibility of the church, so that it is a ground of faith to men. And there is not salvation out of the church. The idea in that system is that it stands, so far as the priesthood is concerned, outside of the world, but as exercising power over the world. It is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth. This is the position that it has arrogated to itself. Celibacy is held in the priesthood, and in those devoted, in order that they may be separated from the common interests of society, but the object is to give power to the church so that it may dominate the forces of the world; that it may command the temporal power. It would control everything, education and training of the young especially, and extend its wings over all. Its idea would be that none could live without it.
{447}
As regards the application of revelation, Rome would not encourage the study of Scripture, but would cast people on the support of the church system, which provides all that is necessary for them. To be attached to the system, and to make use of that which it provides is all that is required. There are no moral exercises essential. A man might be a good churchman enough without them. What is essential is the maintenance of the exclusive authority of the church in all things. In fact, it is confidence in a system that speaks with the authority of God. I think that such is the character of Rome, and it has never abated its pretensions.
As regards the Episcopal Church there is no such central authority as Rome, nor would such submission be claimed to a system. The main feature is the authority of the clergy, which is derived from the idea of apostolical succession. With this there is the importance of sacraments, which would, I suppose, be accounted as essential to salvation. The application of the revelation is through the sacraments. A mental apprehension of the truth would be accounted a secondary matter. It is evident that there is a material idea pervading such a system, because there is a positive value in the sacraments apart from the spiritual state of those that partake of them. Whatever might be the moral condition of a man's mind, he might derive benefit from the sacraments. And as the administration of these depends on the clergy, priesthood is the pillar of the system. The apprehension in the soul of what is in the mind of God for man, as set forth in Christ, is a matter of small importance. Hence it is difficult to see how there is in it anything really vital in character. It seems to me that sacraments are of all moment in it.
Now Protestantism is difficult in character, though many things in the Episcopal Church may be retained. The point in Protestantism has been the
{448}
maintenance of the authority of the Scriptures as above all authority of church or clergy, and at the same time the responsibility of every one in respect of faith of the Scriptures. I have spoken here of the character of Protestantism as at the outset. It has now sadly degenerated. It has not been free from the taint of materialism, and the spirit of rationalism, as giving importance to the human mind, has crept in largely.
As regards the former, this materialism is not in so gross a form as in the Episcopal system, where a substantive value is placed on sacraments, but it is more subtle. It consists in the thought that it is possible by faith to possess things of which the value is not known in the soul. It is plain that this is a material idea, in that it places a substantive and not simply a moral value on the things. To take an example, it is a common idea that a person may by faith possess eternal life without knowing its value. Such a thought of life is material. It may exist in natural life, as evidently in animals, but not in spiritual things. This seems to me a common error among Protestants. The source of this is that faith in doctrine is called for, rather than faith in divine Persons. There is a large leaven of dogma in Protestantism. On the other hand, Protestantism has become pervaded by rationalism, which is clearly not moral, but mental. A man but little touched by the knowledge of God may be a rationalist.
Now the important point is, what is the truth in contrast with all the above? I judge it to lie in the apprehension by faith of what is in the mind of God toward man, as perfectly expressed in Christ. Every thought of God toward man is bound up with the character of God, hence all these thoughts are expressed in Christ, the Son of God.
What follows is that as each such thought is seen there is corresponding increase in the knowledge of
{449}
God Himself. As this knowledge of God is added to in the soul, a greater insight is gained into the thoughts of divine love toward man. We are built up morally in the knowledge of God, and are increasingly capable of entering into His thoughts man-ward. It is by this growth that the Spirit enables us to appropriate to ourselves these thoughts of God, and thus it is that we can be said to possess the things that are spoken of. They are entered into morally, and thus become our own. Thus, though I may see that there are great thoughts in the mind of God manward, I do not claim to possess what is contained in any of these thoughts, save as I enter into it according to my spiritual growth.
It may be questioned how a man can ever claim to be a christian if he is thus slow to take the ground of possessing anything. My answer would be that he is entitled to take the ground of being a christian when he believes in Christ, and thus sees what is in God's mind toward man. We are not called on to believe anything about ourselves, but that which is set forth in Christ. It is when these things are appropriated, in the understanding of them, by the work of the Spirit in the believer, that they can be said to be possessed. There are thus two great steps, the first is faith, which means the apprehension of God's mind toward man in Christ, and then spiritual growth by the knowledge of God, which gives the capability of entering into God's thoughts, so that they become the possession of the soul.
I think it will be evident how different this is from the Romish idea of faith in a church and its authority, or from the Episcopal idea of the value to be attached to sacraments, and consequently to those who alone can administer them, or from Protestantism, with its insistence on faith in doctrine, and the claim to the possession of things of the value of which the soul has no sense, but which are said to be
{450}
possessed on the ground of faith of dogma. Nothing can be more important than to maintain the moral character of christianity, in which every blessing for man is bound up with the apprehension of the character of God, and cannot be entered into save as God is known.
{451}
THE UNSEEN OR THE FUTURE, WHICH IS IT?
@2 Corinthians 4: 17, 18
The apostle Paul says in @2 Corinthians 4: 17, 18, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal". This appears to me to raise a question worth considering, namely, whether our minds are taken up with unseen or with future things. Very many christians are much interested in and occupied with future things -- such as the restoration of Israel, the disposition of the world according to prophecy, the millennium, and other truths of the future. These things may have a certain moral effect in unsettling us in regard to the present -- showing us that there is an appointed term to things in the world -- but it cannot be imagined that they will produce at all the same profound effect as the light of things which exist; and such are unseen things, of which faith is the conviction.
There is a vast system of things of which sight and sense are unconscious, but which are veritable realities, and which, by their moral power, will supersede the existing order of things. It appears to me that it is God's way to build up a system and order of things, outside of the activities of man and the world, which awaits the displacement of all that is seen that it may be in due time displayed. These are the mysteries of God. A mystery is something which exists, but is not yet displayed.
The foundation of the system of which I am speaking is righteousness accomplished and declared in redemption; the principle of it is resurrection, that is,
{452}
the setting aside of the rule and power of death; and the power and expression of it is Christ at the right hand of God, and the Holy Spirit down here.
The "world to come" is brought into view in the truth of the kingdom, which is seen in Jesus crowned with glory and honour. He has gone into heaven, and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to Him. It is in the confession of Him as Lord that we have salvation -- salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us. He is in power on the resurrection side, and in confessing Him as Lord we are waiting to reign in life through Him; and the worst that can happen to us down here only brings us to the Lord. Thus the kingdom is not future, but a great present reality, though unseen; the Father has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love. There is no darkness in the kingdom, we are light in the Lord, and walk as children of light. Thus we have security and light in the kingdom in the midst of a world of bondage and darkness; righteousness, peace and joy are assured to us in the power of the Holy Spirit. We have a high priest cognisant of and sympathetic with our infirmities, and a throne of grace where we can obtain mercy and find grace for seasonable help. We see in all this something of the character of the kingdom; and, further, there is in it an inheritance; all that which appertains to Christ as man, of which the Spirit is earnest. The apprehension of the kingdom in its true and blessed moral features is thus of great present value to us. It is not a myth or imagination, but a substantive reality.
Connected with and depending on the kingdom are the temple and the house, for the Holy Spirit, who has come to make good the kingdom, is dwelling here. He has not come to the world, but to
{453}
continue with the saints, and is in them. Hence we have the obligation to holiness and to unity. To recognise the presence of God dwelling here by the Spirit is the way of deliverance from the ecclesiastical order which obtains around us in christendom, and falsifies the character of christianity as taught in the Scriptures. We are brought back thus to that which was from the beginning.
The existence of God's house is a matter of profound importance as a basis of fellowship; and all corporate responsibility flows from it. If we fail to apprehend it, I do not see anything for us but acquiescence in christendom as it is.
But, further, we have the new covenant and Jerusalem above. These are also dependent on Christ at the right hand of God and the Holy Spirit down here. Christ is the Mediator of the new covenant, and at the same time the spirit of it. The disposition of God towards us has in Him found its full and perfect expression, and this after death has come in to set aside the covenant that previously existed, but failed to satisfy God. Christ at the right hand of God is the seal and approval of our righteousness, while in His death there has been perfectly expressed the love of God towards us, and the Spirit who witnesses to Christ being at God's right hand, sheds abroad in our hearts the love of God. Now it is this covenant that constitutes the Jerusalem above, and gives its value to it in the eye of God. Jerusalem which is now was constituted by the legal covenant, symbolised by Hagar, and is in bondage with her children; hereafter it will be reconstituted by the law being written in the hearts of the Jews. Meanwhile, Jerusalem above has come in, being constituted by the Lord and the Spirit, and is thus, in its proper character, the vessel of heavenly light and order. We are its children, walking in the liberty which
{454}
is the consequence of the knowledge of God. All this is present though unseen.
But there is one point further which is connected with the headship of Christ. He having made peace by the blood of His cross in the removal of the man that was offensive to God, has taken the place of Head of all principality and power, that through Him all might be reconciled to God; and as such He is given as Head to the church, which is His body -- in regard to which reconciliation has now been effected. Now the body, though in a sense unseen -- a mystery -- exists. The company of the sanctified ones has been formed -- the brethren of Christ, in the midst of whom He sings praises to God. We are come to the assembly of the firstborn, which are written in heaven; the body of Christ is here, in which He, the Head, is known and expressed, the fulness, of Him that filleth all in all. There is another thought connected with this, namely, that He has given us an understanding that we may know Him that is true, and we are in Him that is true. We have come to that sacred circle which is in Him that is true, morally outside of the wicked one and of the world. "He is the true God and eternal life". We have thus reached the scene where eternal life is now known.
I do not pursue the subject further. The truths of which I have spoken are bound together and form part of that vast system of existing unseen things, in which God is glorified and will be displayed.
{455}
APPEARANCES OR REALITIES
@John 10: 1 - 30
My point on a previous occasion was the passing of the soul from appearances into realities. If christianity does not mean that, it is nothing. The world system would be impossible apart from appearances. The maintenance of appearances is not of God, and yet man lives in appearances (@Psalm 39: 6). In any condition of things set forth in divine light we must get realities. The moment God shines out in divine light there will be an end of appearances. Christianity professes to be founded on the revelation of God, and thus leads out of appearances into realities. I have no doubt that the first principle of the departure of man from God was lawlessness. Another thing follows upon this, namely, uncleanness. But God did not allow man to be without a conscience at the fall, and so it has come to pass among men that lawlessness and uncleanness cannot be allowed to come out publicly. Hence these things have to be covered up by appearances. Man is both lawless and unclean. @Romans 6 shows this: "as ye have yielded your members in bondage to uncleanness and to lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now yield your members in bondage to righteousness unto holiness". (New Trans.) Realities must, on the other hand, be built up on righteousness and holiness. In having our fruit unto holiness we come into realities. You could not get them otherwise. Society is founded on appearances not on realities. The light of God in the soul brings one under rule. We see this brought to pass in the case of the blind man in @John 9. He came into realities in believing on the Son of God. Now we get two things in chapter 10 -- the knowledge of God in connection with Christ as the door and the knowledge of Christ as the Good Shepherd. A great deal is bound up
{456}
with the door, and a great deal with the Shepherd. If a man gets into realities things in the world become revolutionised to him. Judaism was maintained in appearances, and so too was heathenism; people did not think they were sacrificing to demons. The light of God coming in to bring in realities must necessarily make a breach in the great world systems of religion. Everything hinges on our having come to righteousness and holiness. We must find out what these things mean from scripture.
The blind man entered in by the door, he believed on the Son of God. We are entirely dependent on Him for all light as to God. We know nothing at all of God's attitude towards men save as it is revealed in Christ. There can be nothing more important for man than to know what God's attitude towards him is. If God had not found peace in Christ as regards man, man could not have peace with God, nor forgiveness of sins. God's righteousness towards all means the rights of His mercy. The grace of God brings salvation to all men -- the door is opened to all, Christ is the legitimate way for entering. He is presented to us as the revelation of God. Then the witness of the Spirit makes things personal to the believer, you cannot get things in personal application any other way. Now into what do you enter? You enter into the region of realities, or of divine influence. That is a great point. Being saved and finding pasture is all dependent on divine influence. The influence of the sun on the earth is beneficial; so is the influence of God on those that enter in. This sphere can only be apprehended by faith. All christians have come under divine influence, and it is the way in which God has made Himself known to us, and hence we get the effect in Titus, "that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world". No
{457}
one can find salvation except in the sphere of divine influence, nor liberty either, nor can pasture be got except in this way. There is none in the world. Christ came out that we might go in to the sphere and scene of divine influence. Do not be content with anything short of that. To realise blessing depends on the knowledge of God, and of His attitude towards us in Christ.
Now turn to verses 11 to 16: "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep ... there shall be one flock, one shepherd". Here is another important question, How are you to get character? This entirely depends on the knowledge of Christ -- no one really gets character save in that knowledge. Orthodoxy is mainly in appearances. Many people pass muster as orthodox without much reality. But character has to be got from Christ. The sheep ought to be like the Shepherd. This is the moral idea. Israel took their character from David. The word "good" describes the Shepherd, and the sheep should have this character. "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father". Paul apprehended the love of Christ to himself by the Spirit and could say, "Who loved me, and gave himself for me". The Lord had His own proper knowledge of each of His disciples. He knew each according to what each was -- John, Peter, Mary Magdalene, Paul. The Spirit gives us to apprehend the knowledge of Christ in personal application. Nothing will stand against the assaults of evil save the personal knowledge of Christ. Mere orthodoxy is useless here. The fruit of the knowledge of Christ is that you know His goodness. Let me press not only the importance of the soul being within the sphere of divine influence, but that it might know Christ as the good Shepherd. Do we appreciate the gift of living water?
{458}
Then there is one flock, one Shepherd. This sets us in unity down here. A flock does not give the idea of ecclesiasticism; but I refuse to be identified with anything here which tends to deny practically the one flock and one Shepherd. Then we get eternal life, the first element of which is divine influence, and the second the knowledge of the Shepherd. "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent". Christ is not quiescent in heaven, He is doing great things down here. He is the Minister of the holy places. He knows every one of His sheep -- in their dangers and proclivities. The Lord knew John and Peter better than they knew themselves. So he knows us and serves us that He may conform us to Himself. If christianity is worth anything at all, it means the passage from appearances to realities. Anything that is of God must have that effect. The universe of bliss of which Christ is the Centre and the Sun will set this forth.
{459}
(1) THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHRIST IN ROMANS
@Romans 3: 21 - 31; @Romans 16: 25 - 27
Rem. You have said that every epistle presents Christ in some distinct way, and that the sum of these give the testimony of the Christ. We thought it would be nice if you would take this up in detail in the different epistles. You said that Romans presented Him as the mercy-seat; we might take up that tonight, and see the distinction between cleansing by blood and cleansing by water.
F.E.R. One great point is that what was kept secret in ages gone by is now made manifest to the nations for the obedience of faith. What was hitherto mystery is now made manifest. For instance, all that was set forth in the furniture of the tabernacle was mystery, it was not made manifest. There were figurative representations of certain things, but all was in mystery. The *witness* was there in them, but the meaning of them was kept secret. Now we have the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery, and all is made manifest.
Ques. Made manifest in the way of testimony, I suppose?
F.E.R. Yes, in the way of testimony. While the Lord was here upon earth everything looked on to the work He would accomplish, and to the place that He would take; but now all is accomplished, and Christ has taken the place that God intended He should take, and therefore everything is made manifest. Things were veiled while Christ was here in flesh -- *He* was veiled; but now all the work is
{460}
done, redemption is accomplished, Christ exalted on high and the Holy Spirit given, everything is made manifest. The apostle Paul comes in to this end, and he desired the prayers of the saints "that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel". The glad tidings were concealed in the Old Testament, they were not made known.
Rem. And those who wrote the Old Testament knew that they wrote for another age.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Does it not say the gospel was preached to Abraham?
F.E.R. What we get in regard to Abraham was the general idea that in him should all the nations of the earth be blessed, but even that was all mystery.
Rem. What is presented today is preached with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven.
F.E.R. Quite so. We have now the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat, and everything is made manifest in connection with the place which Christ has taken. If you take the sum total of the way in which Christ is presented in the various epistles, you have the testimony of the Christ. Romans is the moral beginning because there we have the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat. The preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery is the ark of the covenant; and then God has set Him forth through faith in His blood as a propitiatory -- a mercy-seat. You could not have the mercy-seat apart from the ark of the covenant; it formed the cover of the ark.
Rem. God must secure His own glory before there could be anything for man.
F.E.R. Yes. The Righteous One has come in, and has accomplished righteousness, and founded upon that we have the mercy-seat. Christ is not
{461}
only personally the Righteous One, but in Him there is redemption, and the mercy-seat is based on that. God puts Himself in relation to the universe in Him.
Ques. Is that what the tabernacle shadowed?
F.E.R. Yes, the tabernacle foreshadowed what we get brought out now in the New Testament. It is important to recognize that in Romans we get Christ presented in a way that is peculiar to Paul, that is, as the last Adam. We are told in @1 Corinthians 15 that the last Adam is a life-giving Spirit, and that is brought out and enlarged upon in Romans. He has come in in the value of His own righteousness -- in the value of accomplished redemption -- every liability has been discharged, and the mercy-seat is founded on that.
Ques. Does the expression "in his blood" give you the idea of every liability met?
F.E.R. Yes, the Righteous One has discharged every liability, and He now imparts the Spirit; He is the last Adam, the life-giving Spirit. As someone has said, there is excess; it is not only that liabilities have been met, but the last Adam is a life-giving Spirit; He communicates living water. The Lord did not speak to the woman in @John 4 about her liabilities, but He said a great deal to her about the excess, He told her that He would communicate living water.
Rem. A great deal of preaching does not go so far as that.
F.E.R. Well, I am afraid there is a good deal of preaching that leaves Christ out, though that may seem a hard thing to say.
Ques. If they do not preach Christ, what do they preach?
F.E.R. The work of Christ; but it is the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery that is the testimony.
{462}
Ques. Will you say a little about the preaching of Jesus Christ?
F.E.R. The revelation of the mystery is the preaching of Jesus Christ as the centre and beginning of the universe of God. The tabernacle was the pattern of all things, as we get in @Hebrews 3, but what was the centre of the tabernacle? The ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat. The tabernacle figuratively presented Christ in relation to all things; He is the One who will fill all things. The great point of the gospel is to detach people from this present world, and to attach them to Christ. No one is free of the world or free of lawlessness, until he is attached to Christ. The expression "all things" conveys the idea of a moral universe, and that universe was prefigured in the tabernacle; its beginning and centre is Christ, and the object in preaching is that souls may be detached from the world and brought into attachment to Christ as the beginning and centre of the moral universe.
Ques. Is it not important to present His work also?
F.E.R. If Christ had not done the work He could not have taken up the position of centre of the moral universe. We must present Him in the value of His work -- in the virtue of the blood of the everlasting covenant. People come into the sense of forgiveness, and think they have the Spirit as the seal of forgiveness, but that does not go far enough. The preaching of the gospel is not simply for that, but that persons may be brought into attachment to the One who is the centre of the moral universe.
Ques. Would you say what you mean by attachment and detachment?
F.E.R. As the effect of sin having entered the world, man has become lawless in regard of God, but he has also become involved in the world system
{463}
like the children of Israel in Egypt. The world is made up of the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life; it is not of the Father. Now the point of the gospel is to detach man from that system, and to bring him into bond to Christ who is the beginning and centre and sun of the moral universe. We come into attachment to Him just as the planets are in attachment to the physical sun.
Ques. Do you mean that in mind and spirit you are free of the world?
F.E.R. Yes, and brought into attachment to Christ by the Spirit. If a man has the Spirit of Christ, then he is in Christ; if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.
Ques. Is it possible to get free of the world except by apprehending Christ as the centre of another system?
F.E.R. I think not. That brings us to the distinction between purgation by blood and purgation by water.
Ques. What is the difference?
F.E.R. Purgation by blood is that a man may be free to approach God, but purgation by water is that he may be free of the world. The cleansing by blood gives a man a purged conscience, and sets him free to approach God.
Rem. That side has been a good deal pressed that men might get the knowledge of forgiveness, but I do not think we hear much about the detachment side of things.
F.E.R. Well, I have grave doubts about the way in which forgiveness is sometimes preached. People get forgiveness at the present time in the witness of the Spirit. Forgiveness may be preached universally as setting forth what is in the mind of God for all men, but as to the individual apprehension of forgiveness, we come into it by the witness of the
{464}
Spirit. A man wants forgiveness that he may approach God, that he may have a purged conscience. You cannot serve the Living God without a purged conscience, and the object of forgiveness is that you may approach the Living God.
Ques. On what ground does one get the Spirit?
F.E.R. Consequent upon the belief of God's testimony. God's testimony has come out to men, and they are being tested by that testimony, and it is a very serious matter to reject it, but the testimony has no particular application to *me*, or to any other person; it is the setting forth of God's mind to every one alike. But in believing the testimony we get the witness of the Spirit, and we have forgiveness in the witness of the Spirit. "in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit".
In the case of Israel they will get the forgiveness of sins administratively, so that they may have a happy life down here upon earth in the very place in which they were sinners. They will be forgiven that they may serve God without fear in righteousness and holiness all the days of their life, and all will be based upon the mercy-seat.
Ques. Is the witness of the Spirit to the forgiveness of sins internal, or through the word?
F.E.R. The witness brings home the word to me, but the witness is internal.
Ques. Is it possible to have the witness of the Spirit, and not be attached to Christ?
F.E.R. No; because the Spirit attaches to Christ, and we are joined to the Lord in that way. We receive living water, and are attached to Christ as the last Adam.
Ques. Does the cleansing by water come in subsequently to the cleansing by blood?
F.E.R. I think baptism is the figure of cleansing by water; the reality is the moral power of the word in the soul by the Spirit.
{465}
Ques. In dealing with troubled souls it is often found that the real difficulty is the question of their sins. How would you meet such?
F.E.R. Well, to a timid soul I would say, Why should you be troubled about your sins when God's mind is forgiveness of sins for every man? Christ is the expression of it; He is the mercy-seat because God is addressing Himself to men in Him, not in prophets nor in any other man. Christ is the pledge of His mercy to all men; in His name repentance and remission of sins are preached. Christ is the last Adam, and the last Adam is the mercy-seat, and the mercy-seat is founded upon the Ark of the covenant.
Rem. And now the preaching goes forth with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven.
Ques. Might not the preaching be defective, and yet have power with it?
F.E.R. I am very thankful that conversions do not have to wait until the preaching is perfect, but if we are wrong I think we ought to desire to be set right.
Ques. Do you think that defective preaching dwarfs souls?
F.E.R. Well, that used to be said when I first came into fellowship. I am sure that people are very much affected by first impressions. Mr. Darby used to say that to attempt to build on a revival conversion was like trying to build on the edge of a knife.
Ques. Will you say a word as to the place of repentance in connection with the proclamation?
F.E.R. You present the glad tidings of repentance and remission of sins. The object in preaching repentance is that men may come into the forgiveness of sins. Man is under obligation to repent; I would not weaken that for a moment; but God has opened the door for repentance to man. If there were no forgiveness of sins there would be no door
{466}
of repentance open to man, God's mind in regard to every man is forgiveness, and Christ is the pledge of it. If it were not so there would be no door of repentance. You could not preach forgiveness without repentance, but Christ is the mercy-seat, and in Christ God is propitious to every man, and that opens the door of repentance to every man. I would not say that God is propitious to an apostate, but apart from apostasy God is propitious to every man in the world.
Ques. Do repentance and faith go together?
F.E.R. Yes, they are bound to go together. The goodness of God leads to repentance, and the moment the testimony of forgiveness is accepted repentance comes in. When God approaches man He always comes on the ground of forgiveness of sins, because that is what man needs; then the recognition on my part that I need forgiveness brings me to repentance. There is no true repentance apart from faith. Before the prodigal said, "I will arise and go to my father", there was evidently faith in his father. Unless he had some idea of his father's forgiveness he would never have gone home.
Ques. Is Christ the subject of the testimony?
F.E.R. Yes, Christ is the testimony. Scripture speaks of the testimony of the Christ. It is the testimony of our Lord because He is the Administrator, but the testimony is of the Christ. The Christ is the expression and pledge of the mercy of God towards all men. He is the centre and sun of the moral universe, but He is that because He is the expression of God's mind for all men. I have been thinking of it in connection with @Luke 10. He sees Satan as lightning fall from heaven, and then He says, "Rejoice that your names are written in the heavens" and then afterwards, "All things have been delivered to me by my Father". The moral universe is delivered of the Father to the Son, and
{467}
"no one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal him", The Father is revealed by the Son, and then you get what I was speaking about, that Christ is the witness and pledge of God's mercy. He shows mercy, and then He says, 'If you have found your neighbour, go and do likewise'. The Good Samaritan has come in, and in result the mercy of God is going to fill the universe. Jew and gentile will both come into blessing on the ground of mercy; the Good Samaritan is the pledge of it. The beginning of the moral universe is showing mercy, and it ought to begin there with us also.
Ques. You would say that those whom Christ fills must do likewise?
F.E.R. Yes. "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful". The Good Samaritan has come in as the pledge of perfect goodness and mercy in God, and if you have found your neighbour, "Go, and do thou likewise". Christ has come in as man's neighbour, to give the impulse to mercy, and mercy will yet fill the universe.
Ques. Are the glad tidings of the Christ the same as the testimony?
F.E.R. It is the Christ presented as glad tidings. The particular way in which Christ is presented in Romans is as the One who declares God. That is the point of the mercy-seat.
Rem. And in order to secure man for Himself.
F.E.R. God has declared Himself, but in such a way that He secures man for Himself. He declares His righteousness in the forgiveness of sins so that He may gain the heart of man.
Rem. So that now everything is open to man.
F.E.R. Yes; God has declared Himself in the mercy-seat, and put Himself in contact with man. Then we have to consider another point, and that
{468}
is, "But that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens". The One who descended is the same One who ascended. That is, in Him we have the witness that God is declared on the one hand, and of the Priest on the other. He ascended as having led captivity captive, but the epistle to the Ephesians identifies the One who ascended with the One who descended. The declaration of God is perfect in Christ having descended, and approach to God is perfect because Christ has ascended. His priestly access to God is as great as the declaration. We come in as kindred to the High Priest, like Aaron and his sons. "Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father".
Rem. In having these two things God has obtained all that He set Himself for.
F.E.R. Yes; if you look at Christ you have both perfectly; the only way is to look to Christ.
Rem. So it says, "Consider the Apostle and High Priest".
F.E.R. You may depend upon it, that is an uncommonly good thing to do; you never get much good from considering yourself.
Ques. What is the difference between the gospel concerning His Son, as in chapter 1, and what we have here, a propitiatory through faith in His blood?
F.E.R. Everything hangs upon who the last Adam is, and the last Adam is the Son of God, a life-giving Spirit. He came of David's seed according to the flesh, but He is declared to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead. It is only the Son of God who could come on that line; He must have the Spirit of life at His disposal, so to speak, if He is to communicate it. Christ is the last Adam, and you must identify the
{469}
last Adam with the Son of God, for only the Son of God could dispense the Spirit.
Ques. Can you not find the testimony in Genesis? You have said nothing as to that book.
F.E.R. Well, you could not find Christ presented there as the sun and centre of a new system. It is in Exodus, where we find the ark of the covenant, and all that was connected with it, that we get a figure of the testimony of the Christ. Exodus is God's approach to man, and Leviticus is man's approach to God. Redemption had not come in even in figure in Genesis, but when redemption came in figuratively in the case of the children of Israel coming out of Egypt, God gave a figure of the whole universe which He would establish. There are hints of what God would do, as in the promise to Abraham, "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed", but after all it is only a hint.
Ques. Is the testimony always as to what is going to be displayed?
F.E.R. Romans all goes on the line of what is going to be displayed. The first part is that the effect of God's glad tidings in the declaration of His righteousness is to bring the church to light, but in connection with their reigning in life with Him. Then chapter 11 shows how Israel will be brought in again on the ground of mercy. Eternal life will be the reward of those who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory, honour, incorruptibility; and wrath will come out from God on those who do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness.
God has been pleased to declare in Christ the rights of mercy, and the fidelity of His promises; Christ is the expression and pledge of both. He is the pledge of mercy because He has accomplished redemption, but there shall come a deliverer out of Zion who shall turn away iniquity from Jacob, and Christ is the pledge of that too, it is a wonderful
{470}
thing that God has come out in mercy, and that the testimony is the rights of God in mercy, and the Spirit of God has come to bring men into attachment to the moral centre which God has provided. It is in that way that men are delivered from this present evil world.
There will be a universe characterised by the righteousness and faithfulness of God. Everything will be put under the feet of the Son of man; the moral light of that universe -- the righteousness and faithfulness of God -- shines forth from Him. All that is declared in the mercy-seat.
Rem. In the tabernacle everything came under the anointing, and I suppose that all things will come under the anointed Man.
F.E.R. Yes, everything comes under the power of the Spirit. The *Lord* is the test of the christian; the testimony presents Him as the Christ, but the one who believes the testimony confesses Him as Lord.
{471}
(2) THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHRIST IN 1 CORINTHIANS
Rem. We thought it would be well to continue the subject of the testimony as seen in the epistles, and that we might now take the first epistle to the Corinthians.
F.E.R. We had Romans last time, but we really ought to have taken Corinthians before Romans. There is much more positive ground in Romans than in Corinthians, and the gospel is further developed. In Romans we begin with the mercy-seat, which speaks of all that God purposes to establish; but the point in Corinthians is the wisdom and power of God by which God has intervened to bring to nought the things that are, and at the same time to establish all that is of Himself. Of course there must be the two sides. God intended on the one hand to bring to nought certain things, and we see the way in which He did it; but on the other hand He intends to *establish* certain things.
Certain things existed here by which men were affected and governed, and these things had to be brought to nought. The Corinthians were not clear of the influences which dominated men; they were under the influence of the world and of idolatry. It is a wonderful thing to think of what christianity effected; it did what nothing else could have done; it brought to nought all the influences that affected men. Philosophy was brought to nought for one thing; it may not have governed the mass of people, but it governed many, and it was brought to nought. We have got accustomed to the presence of christianity here and we fail to see the greatness of the
{472}
revelation of God, and its mighty effect in overturning the influences that existed here. The philosophers of those days were not fools, they were men of very great activity of mind; but the light of God in Christ came in and brought their philosophy to nought.
Ques. Is it not a solemn thought that the very influences which were brought to nought by christianity in its purity are now found passing under the name of that which at first destroyed them?
F.E.R. Yes; they have revived because christianity has been corrupted. It is dreadful to see how these things have reared their heads. The moment the presence of the Spirit was ignored things went at a fearful pace. The rise of ecclesiastical rule followed upon the setting aside of the Spirit of God. That is quite sufficient to justify one in standing apart from systematic christianity; in those systems there is no place for the Spirit of God, and there is no hope whatever of amendment, they are going from bad to worse. The clerical element is really the rule of man in the house of God, and that is deadly.
Ques. Might not that come in even among us?
F.E.R. Yes, but who are the *us*? You must stick to your individuality, and not make too much of the company. We seek to walk together, but we ought to resist the idea of forming a community of any kind. This would not weaken exercise as to the desire to rule. Self-judgment ought to be maintained by each one of us.
I very much admire the way in which Mr. Darby went on; he went on himself, and if others walked with him well and good, but if not, he went on. He felt the path to be a very individual one. He did not go with those who said it was all up. You can never say that, because the Spirit of God is here, and while He is here it will never be 'all up'. None of us will ever be left completely alone; we walk together in
{473}
the light of the relationships which exist, and cannot be broken, but we must maintain the idea of individuality. The church as a whole is here; it is obscured, but it is here, and the only place we can take in connection with it is the individual position; we could not build up a sect.
Rem. You do not mean to say that our consciences cannot take knowledge of those who are walking uprightly?
F.E.R. If christians are not going on rightly, I cannot walk with them. I am bound to walk with those who follow righteousness. You might get a state of things which necessitated our stepping outside of it. I am afraid of maintaining a low state of things, and forming a community.
Rem. The breaking of bread identifies you with others.
F.E.R. Yes; you go on in the light of the church, but even with the breaking of bread I would like to maintain the sense of individuality. I am thankful to find others with whom I can walk, but my fear is the practical forming of a community with its own interests, missions, and so on.
Ques. What do you mean by a community?
F.E.R. A body of people held together by certain things, and having their own separate interests -- practically a sect.
Ques. How does that bear on the unity of meetings in a certain city -- London, for instance?
F.E.R. It is all simple enough; you must be guided by the truth, and act in the light of the church. You have to follow faith as well as righteousness, and following faith involves acting in the light of the church.
Ques. Do you commend to those known to you in a place?
F.E.R. That is the idea of the thing to me, and so it was with Paul apparently.
{474}
Rem. There are christians there in whom you have confidence.
F.E.R. Quite so.
What we get in this epistle is the bringing to nought things that existed, things that held man spiritually in bondage; but then, on the other hand, things of vital moment are brought in; the temple and the body are established down here, and there is victory over death. This is the effect of Christ having come; the temple and the body have been established here in the power of the Spirit, and it is really a continuation of Christ down here. The temple is the seat of the oracles of God, light and truth are there; but the body is that which diffuses light and truth.
Ques. Is the body necessary to the temple?
F.E.R. Yes, necessary for the diffusion of the light. It is just the difference between John and Luke; in John's gospel Christ's body is the temple, but in Luke He is the anointed Man that He may preach. In John all the light was there, His body was the temple of God, but another thing was needed, and that is a Man anointed to preach the gospel.
Ques. In what sense were the Corinthians an expression of the temple?
F.E.R. They had the position of privilege because the Spirit of God was there; it was characteristic; but the body comes in more for the diffusion of light. Provision was made not only that the truth should be here, but that it should be diffused; there must be the two things.
Ques. How would you account for his bringing in the thought of responsibility in connection with the temple?
F.E.R. The temple was the standard, and that impresses in a solemn way the sin of those who corrupted it. Light and truth are connected with the temple; the thought of the house is more social. The idea of the oracles is connected with the temple, and
{475}
the temple was formed by the Spirit of God, and hence the very great responsibility of corrupting it. The temple would be corrupted, I should say, by the introduction of evil and corrupt principles.
Ques. Can you find the temple today?
F.E.R. There are great difficulties today, but we have to accept that the temple is here. The oracles are dependent upon the Spirit of God. There is no doubt that those who give place to the Spirit of God in the present day have got a good deal of light. The ablest men in system have got very little light; but you will find light with those who have accepted the presence of the Spirit, and have acted on it.
Rem. If people cleave to system, and are determined to go on with it, how difficult it is to impart light to them.
F.E.R. Quite so; and if they seem to have a little light, they play with it and lose it.
We have not got the tabernacle today, because the tabernacle represented Christ as He was down here upon earth; but the temple was built by David's son, and had a permanent character. Christ speaks of His body as the temple; they would destroy it, but He would raise it up. Then the thought of the temple is carried on to the church, and there again it has the thought of permanence; it "increases to a holy temple in the Lord". In a sense the saints at Corinth were locally the temple of God, but if you look at the thing abstractly, it is the whole building fitly framed together, which grows to a holy temple in the Lord. The last verse of @Ephesians 2 is more the house character. The tabernacle was continually taken down and had to be carried about; it was not permanent. Permanence is connected with the temple; the ark of the covenant was carried into the temple and placed there. God employed the figure of the tabernacle because He had to move with the
{476}
people. They had not come to the land, and they had no city, but God moved with them. There must be a city before a temple; there was no city in the wilderness, no permanent order of things, but David brought the ark up and established it in the city of David. The wilderness does not describe everything for us, for we have a divinely-appointed Centre now in the presence of the Holy Spirit.
The tabernacle set forth typically the principle of divine ways, but all these things are continued in the temple. It is a wonderful thing that the temple is here, that the oracles are here; it gives a living character to the whole thing. It is not simply that we have the Scriptures, which is a matter of vital moment, but we have things vitally and livingly in the Spirit. The great thing is to retire into the region of the Spirit from all that is of man, and specially from all that is of the religious man. A great deal of what goes on in christendom is very attractive to religious flesh. I would not like to go into a cathedral, because I know what is in me; there is that in me which may be acted on by what goes on there. These things have a very bad effect on people; they are sensuous and impress the religious imagination. The great thing is to retire from all such things into the region of the Spirit. Human sentiment is a dangerous thing, because there is much in it that pleases the flesh. I think we allow much that is pleasing to the flesh, but the important thing for us is to get into the region of the Spirit.
Ques. What did you say as to the Scriptures just now?
F.E.R. I was contrasting it with the fact that the temple is here, the truth of God is here livingly in the Spirit. We ought to hold tenaciously to that; the Spirit is the truth. But Scripture is divine; you cannot separate between the Spirit of truth and the Scriptures.
{477}
Rem. If you are in the realisation of the truth of the temple of God and the living oracles, it will save you from any idea of a party.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; it gives enlargement because it takes in all the saints of God; it makes one greatly dread attempting to form any community or sect.
Rem. So that the more individual you are, the wider you are.
F.E.R. Yes, exactly. You comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height. You refuse to take account of anything short of what is here in the unity of the Spirit, all that is for God here.
Ques. Are you not afraid of getting into the habit of praying for your own concerns rather than for all saints?
F.E.R. I am very much afraid of it. It would give an entirely different character to our prayer meetings if we prayed for all saints. We are not concerned to keep brethren going; the great point is that the truth should be here, and the truth is for the whole church. If God has given us any little bit of light, it is for the whole church, and we ought to keep that in view.
Ques. You would not set us praying for all the organizations in christendom, would you?
F.E.R. No, but I would pray for all saints and for the truth. I do not know how the truth is to reach them; it is very difficult to tell how things work with God, but if a stone is thrown into the water, it makes many widening circles, and I think the truth spreads much in that way.
Rem. A brother was saying that he looked very largely to written ministry to reach people.
F.E.R. I quite think so too, if we get to God in prayer about them.
{478}
The tendency of our minds is towards forming an order of things according to Scripture with all its varied interests, and when this is accomplished we think we have secured a very fair representation of the truth, but that is not what God has called us to. Mr. Darby said that if brethren were witnesses to anything they were witnesses to the ruin of the church. The ruin is here, and the very fact that we stand apart from the great organizations around us is a protest against them.
Ques. How does that apply to those who have left us?
F.E.R. Well, they have refused to walk with us, or we with them, as the case may be. Nothing would make me walk with the followers of Newton. It is a question of righteousness, and the same thing applies to Bethesda. Mr. Darby and others gave good and sufficient reasons for separating from them, and the course which they took was simply a question of righteousness. When the question was raised about Christ, the Spirit of God took a certain line in order to maintain the truth as to His Person, and He very largely used Mr. Darby to this end. Their course was in the way of purging themselves, and so it is generally now; it must be so in the present state of things. If you find that you cannot walk with people in the truth, you purge yourselves from them.
The temple and the body are two very comprehensive thoughts: the temple gives the oracles, and the body is for the diffusion of truth. In natural things light was created before the sun, but there must be something to put the ether, or whatever it is, in vibration, and the sun does that. The oracles are all here in the Spirit, but then the light has to be put in movement, so that it may be diffused and reach others, and in that connection the body is brought in here. It is the anointed vessel that the light may be diffused.
{479}
Rem. Any gift is for the good of the whole church of God.
F.E.R. It is for man; man is in the view of God. God has established the temple, and light has to be diffused for the benefit of man. God would have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
Ques. Do we get anywhere here the way in which the light is diffused?
F.E.R. "But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit. For to one, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom ...", @1 Corinthians 12: 7 - 11. All the gifts are here in the disposition of the Spirit, and they are here that the truth may be diffused.
Rem. The diffusion demands spiritual energy.
F.E.R. Yes, because all is entirely dependent upon the Spirit. The body is the anointed vessel; "so also is the Christ". In the church to which I belonged years ago there were two thousand three hundred people, many of them really converted, and a great number of them might have been used of God to help others, but there was no place for them; they were all shut up, because only the clergyman could minister.
Ques. How did the truth of the body come in correctively to the Corinthians?
F.E.R. They were dropping down into a kind of clericalism, giving undue place to particular leaders, but it might have been that they were not the leaders appointed of God.
In John's gospel His body is the temple, but in Luke He says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me". Both these things are true of Christ. There must be diffusion if the truth of God is to be known. The recognition of the presence of the Spirit, and of the truth of the body, has tended greatly to the diffusion of the light.
{480}
Ques. How does that bear on our individual pathway down here?
F.E.R. If you have part in the anointed vessel, and have partaken of the manifestation of the Spirit, you are responsible not to cloak the light but to use it. You must take good heed to your ways.
Rem. Much more has been brought out of late as to the temple than formerly.
F.E.R. The fact is, people knew about the body long before they knew anything about the house. The truth is, that the oracles are in the temple, but the body is the divine provision for the diffusion of the light.
Ques. If we get the truth out of order, has it to be re-learnt?
F.E.R. Well, things have to be readjusted; there must be a constant process of readjustment as we advance in the knowledge of the truth.
Rem. I suppose the truth of the temple has continued right through the history of the church, in the dark ages for instance?
F.E.R. Undoubtedly the temple was there, and the body was there; in spite of all the darkness the Spirit of God was here.
Ques. Would you contrast the thought of the body now and the heavenly city?
F.E.R. I do not know. In the body you get detail, whereas the heavenly city gives the idea of the church as complete. The heavenly city is like the sun which rules by its beneficent influence; but the body is the bride, and I would not like to say the body ceases. I think service is connected with the body, and service remains in the day of Christ. Just as we have gained ground now in the knowledge of Christ, shall we exercise a wonderful influence then. If you are appointed to rule over ten cities, or five, it means that you are to affect those cities by the beneficial influence of what you *are*. When the saints
{481}
come out with Christ to reign, they will have an extraordinary influence on the universe. But with the body now, and the gifts in the body, there is the beneficial influence. My point is that it is not so very different really.
Ques. Would you touch on the victory over death?
F.E.R. The fear of death is an influence by which men have been largely affected, but we can say, "Thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ". Every influence which dominated man has been set aside. Philosophy and idolatry and superstition are influences which have dominated man, and they have their source in principalities and powers in heavenly places, but all have been brought to naught. I have no doubt whatever of the existence of an unseen world, and people here are affected by what has its source in the unseen world. I am convinced that man did not invent idolatry; the conception came from the unseen world; and so with many other things, such as the worship of saints, and the system of mediators. But Christ reigns that He may be victorious over every foe, and death is the last enemy to be destroyed.
{482}
(3) THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHRIST IN 2 CORINTHIANS
F.E.R. The point in 2 Corinthians is ministry. There is not much about ministry in the first epistle, which brings out more what God has been pleased to establish down here, but in this epistle the main point is ministry. The first six chapters are taken up with the apostle's ministry, and great prominence is given to the ministry of the new covenant and the ministry of reconciliation.
In the first epistle the thought of Christ does not go beyond resurrection, but here there is an advance in the presentation of Christ. "Whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us". Then in chapter 3 we get, "looking on the glory of the Lord"; and chapter 4 goes further, and speaks of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. If the light of Christ is thus brought in, it is in order to conform us to it.
Ques. If the first epistle only goes as far as resurrection, what is the connection of the temple and the body?
F.E.R. The first epistle brings out what God has established here by the Spirit, the first principles dependent upon the presence of the Spirit, and that is an essential part of Paul's ministry, if the Spirit is here the temple and the body are here. It is not taking into account the state of the saints, but what results from the presence of the Spirit. These are first principles in connection with the presence of the Spirit.
But when we come to the second epistle, the point is ministry, which is intended to affect the saints.
{483}
Paul brings in further light in the ministries of the new covenant and of reconciliation, and the object of it all is that the saints may be conformed to Christ.
Rem. So the first epistle had done its work in preparing them for this.
F.E.R. Undoubtedly. They had to recognize the first principles in connection with the presence of the Spirit, and a very necessary principle to enforce in those early days of christianity was the holiness of the Spirit. You may depend upon it, that if people disregard the holiness of the Spirit, they will get no further light. Here the apostle was free to give them further light because they had repented and judged themselves. I am very confident of this, that people, that *we*, want first principles. It has struck me very much of late that we live far too much in appearances, and we need to get into realities. The foundation of all realities is the righteousness and holiness of God. We want a more real sense of what God is morally, and to be in accord with Him morally; if not, there is bound to be unreality. At the beginning there was no idea of keeping up appearances; Adam and his wife were naked and were not ashamed, but when lawlessness and impurity came in, it became necessary to keep up appearances. You get the idea in the fig-leaves; they made themselves aprons because they had consciences, and the world has lived in appearances ever since. People are not what they appear to be; appearances are kept up in a thousand ways. But we want to get into the region of realities, and to be in suitability to the righteousness and holiness of God. If you get back to first principles, you can afford to go in for realities, you can afford to be what you really are. The world is full of unreality; it appears pleasant enough to the flesh, but it is a world of unreality, and we have to find it out. The great thing for us is to get into the region of realities,
{484}
where all is based on the righteousness and holiness of God.
God has revealed Himself in righteousness, and it is to have its effect on us so that we depart from lawlessness. Lawlessness prevails amongst us to a large extent. If you are controlled and ruled by Christ, you are free from lawlessness; but for this there must be abiding in Him. "Whoever abides in him, does not sin", @1 John 3: 6.
Ques. Is not that what we desire to go in for?
F.E.R. Well, I do not see very much of it. People do what they like, and go where they like, and read what they like; but that is not abiding in Christ. The Spirit would maintain us abiding in Christ, and in that way keep us here for God's will. You never find people moving to a worse locality, they move to a better one, and do it as a matter of course; but the question is, what is suitable to Christ? Is Christ merely a name or a doctrine to us, or is He the sun and centre of all to us?
Rem. But I thought we were beginning to get on a little bit.
F.E.R. Well, I should be very thankful to see the marks of it. I would like to see self-denial, and a real interest in the testimony of Christ.
Ques. Might not lawlessness enter into service even?
F.E.R. Undoubtedly, it may enter into anything. I was speaking of it in connection with our getting into the region of realities. We need to be built up on the righteousness and holiness of God; the apostle exhorts the saints as having put off the old man, and having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness.
Ques. Does the apostle's ministry in 2 Corinthians come in to this end?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; it is to lead us into the practical displacement of flesh that the Christ may
{485}
be everything. The effect of the ministry of reconciliation is that the old man is practically displaced, and Christ is everything, so that "if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation" (chapter 5: 17).
Rem. And new creation is what is for God.
F.E.R. Yes, it is what is *of* God and *for* God, so that God has complacency in the work of His hands. When God created the heavens and the earth, He "saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good". New creation comes in that there may be a man in whom God is complacent.
The first elements of the gospel do not go beyond the death and resurrection of Christ. The gospel is defined at the end of Luke, "thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem", @Luke 24: 46, 47. All that is based on the death and resurrection of Christ, and is taken up in @1 Corinthians 15, but when we come to the ministry of the new covenant, it carries us on to the thought of the glory of the Lord.
Ques. What is the thought of the glory of the Lord?
F.E.R. To my mind it is like what the sun is in the physical universe; all the glory of the physical universe is centred in the sun; the planets shine simply by reflected light. I know no better illustration than this, and it is one the simplest person can understand. What the sun is to the physical universe, Christ is to the moral universe; He is the Sun of righteousness; all the glory is in Him, and He sheds the light of His glory upon all that come into that universe. We need to get into the light of Christ; it is a great thought that He is the centre of that universe. We know something about the physical universe, but what we need to know about is the
{486}
moral universe, and the glory of it. All the glory of God is there, and Christ sheds His light upon every family. I suppose the planets would represent different families, and every family will reflect the glory of the Lord. You remember what it says in @Isaiah 60: 1, "Arise, shine! for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee". Israel will come into that moral universe, and under the shining of that light; the glory of the Lord will rise upon her, and she will reflect it.
Rem. We come into the presence of the glory of the Lord now.
F.E.R. Exactly; we already form part of the moral universe by the work of the Spirit. The glory has its own proper effect, and we are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Lord the Spirit. We have come into the shining of the Sun, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon us. We get in this way a knowledge of the new covenant. The new covenant is like the sun in the heavens; the sun is God's covenant in regard of man, it is the pledge of the mercy of God to man; men get the benefit of God's sun all over the face of the earth, and it is the witness of divine goodness. Rain is dependent upon the sun, for without the sun there would be no rain; the moisture is evaporated by the sun which comes down in rain. The Lord gives a hint of all this when He speaks of their Father in heaven making His sun to rise on the evil and on the good.
If you take up the Pentateuch, you get the thought of the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat. The new covenant is the expression of God's will towards man. The righteousness of God is the rights of His mercy, witnessed to by the law and the prophets.
Ques. What is the connection of the first five chapters as to the thoughts of ministry?
{487}
F.E.R. The points as to ministry which the apostle takes up are very essential. You get the new covenant, which is God's disposition towards man, and then reconciliation. In Luke's gospel we come to the good Samaritan before we come to the prodigal; we have to go on bit by bit. The ministry of reconciliation was committed to Paul, and then the man in Christ is caught up to the third heaven; that is the moral effect of the ministry.
Ques. Do we not get three different thoughts in Luke's gospel in chapters 7, 10 and 15?
F.E.R. In @Luke 7 you begin with the gospel, the knowledge of God's mind towards man. Then chapter 10 brings Christ into view; it is the appreciation of what Christ is; He is everything to you. Then in chapter 15, it is what you are for God. You must learn what God is for you before you can learn what you can be for God. In the new covenant I learn what God is for me, but in the ministry of reconciliation I learn what I am for God.
The righteousness of God is towards all men. "When they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both", @Luke 7: 42. The mind of God is exactly the same in regard of all men; it is the forgiveness of sins. "*He* is the propitiation for our sins; but not for ours alone, but also for the whole world", @1 John 2: 2. A man could have no possible right to stand before God if he did not see that. Then you learn how Christ can come in and bind up your wounds, and pour in oil and wine, and set you on His own beast, and take care of you. Christ is really dispensing the grace of God. But the prodigal goes a step further, and learns what he can be for God; he is for the Father's complacency and pleasure. We cannot reach this before we learn the other. If people do not know what God is for them, how can they know what they can be for Him? Someone wrote to me the other day, saying that he found many
{488}
people who had not peace with God; but what I feel is that people may have peace with God simply as a creed, and have very little gain in their souls. The great thing is to have the knowledge of God, and that is the lack in souls.
Rem. The knowledge of God settles every difficulty.
F.E.R. Yes, it settles everything. People think they have to arrive at a certain point, and then they will have peace with God; but the real thing is to learn that God has peace with you. You must arrive at what is in His mind; and if you know that peace is in the mind of God for you, you have peace with God, and you cannot have it in any other way.
Ques. Does @Luke 23: 43, illustrate the twelfth chapter of this epistle?
F.E.R. Not exactly. Paul went up to the third heaven that everything might be confirmed to him; he was in the good of what he ministered, and he was caught up to heaven to receive confirmation of everything in view of his ministry. It was a special privilege accorded to him.
Ques. Does not the thought of a man in Christ seem to be of one who is in the good of what is unfolded earlier in the epistle?
F.E.R. Everyone who is spiritual is in Christ, but a man in Christ is a man who is in the good of Christ.
Ques. Could you not speak of the Corinthians as being men in Christ?
F.E.R. No, not exactly. A man in Christ is not a babe but a man. It is no credit to people to be babes when they ought to be men.
Ques. How would you help people to the knowledge of God?
F.E.R. It is not left to us; it is God who quickens souls for Himself. I would look to God that hearts might be attracted to desire His knowledge, every man for himself. Anyone who takes part in ministry
{489}
ought to be much exercised in connection with his ministry.
Rem. The apostle prayed that "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him" might be given to the saints (@Ephesians 1: 17).
F.E.R. Yes, exactly, and we have to look to that, too. And this is so very important, because you cannot know anything apart from the knowledge of God. You cannot even touch the elements of christianity apart from the knowledge of God; you get the forgiveness of sins by knowing that it is God's mind for you; well so far you have the knowledge of God.
Ques. How would you say we know peace with God?
F.E.R. By learning that His mind is peace towards all men; you see it in Christ; He is the Sun of the moral universe, and everything that is for man shines in Him.
Rem. I will "give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles", @Isaiah 42: 6.
F.E.R. That is a beautiful expression. We come through the forgiveness of sins to the teaching of the new covenant, and when the Spirit is given we begin to apprehend what God is for us as seen in the good Samaritan. Nothing can be more important than to see that *faith* apprehends what is general, by *the Spirit* we apprehend what is particular. The basis of the gospel is not substitution but propitiation, and that is for the whole world. Substitution is a truth appropriated by the Spirit; it is not general.
Rem. We have to appropriate substitution; it is for me.
F.E.R. Yes, and that is by the Spirit.
Ques. What scripture would you use to show that?
F.E.R. How do you think Paul said, He "loved me, and gave himself for me"? He said it by the Spirit. It is very important to see that we appropriate Christ by the Spirit, and only by the Spirit.
{490}
Ques. Do we not sometimes try to give souls what the Spirit only can give them?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The only possible witness is the Spirit.
Ques. In preaching the gospel, is it not well to show that the end before God is that men may receive the Spirit?
F.E.R. I think so.
Ques. What is the end of God in the gospel?
F.E.R. That He may be known of men, and that men may find their stay and confidence in the knowledge of God. It is God's pleasure to be known. Without forgiveness of sins a man could not have a good conscience in regard of God; he could not enjoy God if there were any uncertainty in regard to that. The gift of the Spirit is a means to an end, and the end is that God may be known in the heart of man.
Rem. God could only be known as the result of divine teaching.
F.E.R. Yes, and that is where the new covenant comes in with the element of divine teaching. In the first epistle the apostle presses the first elements of the gospel, in the second he brings in the light of the glory of the Lord.
Ques. Would not the incident of the ten lepers illustrate this?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Rem. The tenth leper was a christian.
F.E.R. Yes, representatively; he came back and gave glory to God. The nine pretty much represent christendom; people have received practical benefits by Christ, but they do not come back to Him that they might give glory to God. It is an acceptable time, a day of salvation, and men come into many external blessings by Christ; christendom is in a certain sense cleansed -- cleansed relatively; men
{491}
have come under the influence of the kingdom, and have received benefits thereby.
Ques. Is it something like @Hebrews 6?
F.E.R. Yes; only it has not quite come to apostasy yet.
Rem. It is beautiful to see how God secures His tithe in the one leper.
F.E.R. Yes, God will have His tithe.
Rem. If we only preach the relief side of the gospel, we shall get converts like the nine.
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. It is said that only makes more work for the teachers.
F.E.R. I do not know so much about that; people are greatly affected by first impressions. It is a very serious thing to preach the gospel; I do not think a novice ought to attempt to do it. One must be instructed in the knowledge of God's disposition towards man to enable him to preach the gospel. It is a fact that the apostles did not take to the work of the ministry very young, and it says of the Lord Himself that He "began to be about thirty years of age" before He commenced His public ministry. I think all that has to be regarded. A man has no right to preach anything he does not know. People think they can preach the whole of Scripture; but my thought is that no man ought to preach anything but what he is in the good of spiritually himself. "We speak that we do know", the Lord said; and I think the principle holds good for us (@John 3: 11).
Ques. Do not some people learn much more quickly than others?
F.E.R. I do not know. I do not see people learning very quickly.
Ques. What about the man out of whom the demons were cast? He went and published it abroad.

F.E.R. No one could object to one converted going and telling his friends what the Lord had done for him.
Rem. And he himself was the witness of what he preached.
F.E.R. Yes, but I think he would have been wiser if he had kept within the words of the Lord, "Go home to thy friends, and tell them", @Mark 5: 19.
You must know the Person you preach. To set forth the attitude of God towards man, you must be acquainted with that attitude. You cannot present the new covenant except as you are in the good of it yourself. You might find one who could preach very well from @Luke 10 who could not touch @Luke 15. It is a wonderful thing to have Christ before us as the Sun and Centre of the moral universe -- the perfect setting forth of God's disposition towards man.
Ques. "The light of the knowledge of the glory of God" is His moral effulgence, I suppose?
F.E.R. Yes; it is how God shines according to His mercy. The knowledge of God is according to His mercy, administered in righteousness. Mercy came in consequent upon the law being broken, and though the righteous requirements of the law are now fulfilled in those who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit, yet their knowledge of God is according to His mercy. That is the wonderful thing to my mind; God is glorified in regard to the law, and in regard to His mercy. We do not know God according to law, but according to mercy. The truth is that the new covenant has come in by a Man; it has come in by Christ, and the law was within His heart, but He was the perfect expression of the mercy of God, and He appreciated the mercy that He expressed. We take our colour from Christ; and God is known of us according to His mercy. Who of us could stand before God in respect of the law? But our knowledge of God is according to His mercy.
{493}
Rem. It is beautiful that He appreciated the mercy He expressed.
F.E.R. The Lord took up our infirmities that He might be the Vessel of the mercy of God, but He appreciated the mercy He expressed.
LOVE IS CORRECTIVE
It is important to see that love is corrective. There is no principle so exclusive as love. It excludes everything that is unseemly or unworthy. You cannot tolerate in others what you do not allow in yourself. If you are exclusive in regard of yourself you must be so in regard of others. Divine love cannot tolerate what is unseemly, but it can adapt itself to incongruous surroundings. We see that coming out in Christ Himself; He adapted Himself to the circumstances in which He was found down here upon earth. Meekness and lowliness are the outcome of love in a scene of contrariety. In heaven there will be no need of patience or endurance or meekness. It is here that these qualities are called for, and they are found in love.
{494}
THE ENTERING IN OF THE HIGH PRIEST
We are told that the law had the shadow of good things to come, not the very image of the things, hence we must not expect that christianity can be learnt from the law, however much we may be assisted by the latter in the understanding of detail.
One simple point will serve to show how little able the law was to set forth the truth. In the very nature of things under the law a victim and the priest who offered it were distinct: now it is essential to christianity that they are combined in one Person; for it is plain that Christ could not be offered by any save Himself, and no victim short of Christ would meet the case, for in no other could divine love be fully shown.
I desire to carry this contrast on to what took place on the day of atonement, on which the high priest entered into the holiest "with blood of others". He had to carry in every year the blood of the bullock for himself and his house, and of the goat for Israel, typical of the death, vicariously, of both, and incense beaten small, that thus he might be covered in the presence of the divine glory. Aaron and Israel were evidently in the flesh, and if Aaron had to approach God in His sanctuary, his approach must thus be ordered, otherwise it had been immediate death to himself. He represented his own house and Israel -- but both as being under death.
Now nothing can be a greater contrast to this than the entering in of Christ. He entered in as the risen Man, when all the work of offering had been accomplished, having found an eternal redemption. He had no need, like Aaron, to be covered by blood and incense, nor was there need for the sprinkling of blood -- for He carries in His own Person the witness of
{495}
the one offering by which all has been purged. The blood of purging has been poured out. Christ Himself is the witness of death having been effected in the fact that He is risen from the dead, and has entered in, in the power of an endless life, high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
So long as blood had to be carried in, the way into the holiest could not yet be made manifest, for there was, as yet, no resurrection from among the dead. Now all is changed -- man after the flesh has been removed in the cross, and in the removal God has been glorified, there is the purgation of all, and now Christ has entered into heaven to appear before the face of God for us.
The truth is now come to pass "by man came also the resurrection of the dead"; and in the risen Man, the offering Priest, the way into the holiest is made manifest. The point now is not seeing 'sprinkled with the blood the mercy-seat above', but a risen man entered in when all the work of offering is over, sins put away, and the judgment and curse of God which lay upon man removed in the removal of the man after the flesh. I can hardly think of any truth as of more importance than the apprehension of the risen man abiding in the presence of God, and of the understanding of the significance of this, in that the way into the holiest is made manifest on the one hand, and on the other, that the work of offering is over.
To come now to the application of this to ourselves, It is clear that if we are to enter into the holiest we must be in accord with the Man that is there, and that in our minds. As we have seen, He has by one offering met all that lay upon us by the judgment of God, and our part lies now in the acceptance of death with Him so that we may by faith enter on the ground of "risen with him", and
{496}
be suited for the exercise of priestly function, and this in the sense that all offering work is over.
But one thing is essential to this, and that is attachment to the Person of the Priest. We are quickened together with Him so that we should live in His life. He is head of the priestly house, and whatever may have been the relations of Aaron's sons with Aaron, none can separate us from the love of Christ; and in affection to Himself we are morally outside of the influences which appeal to nature, and are thus according to the glory of God, to serve Him in holiness.
{497}
THE HEAD OF EVERY MAN IS CHRIST
It may be of interest and profit to pass in review shortly the progress which can be marked in chapters 7 to 10 of the Acts of the Apostles in the unfolding of the testimony of the Christ. We reach in result a point which greatly helps us in the understanding of the moment in which we are. There can be no doubt that nothing can compare in importance with the testimony of God in the world. That testimony is comprehended in one single word, Christ. Briefly to indicate the line which I purpose to pursue, I would remark that the point in chapter 7 is the presence of Christ in heaven, and the corresponding presence of the Holy Spirit down here. In chapter 8 we have the absence of Christ from earth, and its effects on faith. In chapter 9 we see the activities of the Lord in connection with the testimony. And in chapter 10 we have the introduction of the gentile. He comes out from the darkness in which the gentiles had been hid morally. All was fulfilling what had been foreshadowed by the Lord when on earth.
To refer a little more in detail to the case of Stephen. It is evident that his testimony, and his consequent treatment, indicated clearly the mind of the Jews in regard to Christ. The breach was complete. But in spite of the darkness on earth there was an outlook for faith. All was ordered in heaven for man. Heaven was the scene of interest for man. I do not suppose that Stephen understood much about boldness to enter the holiest, but he was full of the Holy Spirit, and looked up stedfastly into heaven. He certainly saw the holiest, for the glory of God and Jesus came into his view. And evidently he was invited by heaven, and set free from the earth. He went to heaven as a messenger sent after Christ by the Jew, but he was welcome in heaven. When it is
{498}
known that man can be received in heaven, then heaven becomes the scene of our interests.
Now in chapter 8 we have the contrast to this. The glory of Jerusalem had departed, light was not there. The eunuch was returning from Jerusalem unenlightened. He was evidently a pious man desiring light on the scripture, and God sent him an interpreter. He received light in the grace of God, and instead of returning to Jerusalem, like the two disciples in the last chapter of Luke, he went on his way rejoicing. He was independent of Jerusalem; what he had learnt was that Christ had been here, but that His life had been taken from the earth. This is a matter of serious moment. For if *His* life is taken from the earth, what life can there be there for God? Hence the desire of the eunuch to be baptised, to be identified with the death of Christ. He was going into circumstances where he would not find fellowship or support, but he had been furnished with the key to the Scriptures, and he went on his way rejoicing. I have no doubt that in the present time there may be many that reverence the Scriptures who have hardly found the key to them; and if they did find it, they would be freed from dependence on human order, and would, like the eunuch, go on their way rejoicing. Thus we have had the scene of interest changed from earth to heaven, while the life of Messiah is taken from the earth, and our part is to announce the death of Christ till He come.
In chapter 9 we have an advance, for we learn that the testimony on earth is the interest of Christ in heaven. We are permitted to see His activity and administration. And further, He sees Himself here, in His own. It is of great importance to see that the Lord takes no place in regard to the things of earth, for as to these He sits at God's right hand until His foes are made His footstool. But His activity is in regard to the testimony on earth. God's house, the
{499}
church, commands His interest. This is God's testimony. In connection with that we see the administration, and there is no power in man to resist it. First, Saul is entirely subdued, so that he can only say, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" and then Ananias is silenced, so that he does the Lord's bidding. The authority of the Lord is irresistible, and 'nay' cannot be said to Him. Now what I have said marks this time. We have not now the raising up of apostles. But the interest of the Lord in the testimony is undiminished, and He exercises the same authority over His servants, which cannot be gainsaid. It is of the greatest interest to us to know the things in which the Lord is found.
In chapter 10 we have a further advance. We see the instruction of Peter by the sheet let down from heaven. A truth comes to light of great moment in the ways of God. Not a truth inconsistent with God's previous dealings with Israel, but with which the future of Israel must be co-ordinated. In principle we see here that Christ is the Head of every man, and hence "by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life". The gentiles were no longer to be regarded as common or unclean. According to the word of Simeon, Christ was "a light for revelation of the Gentiles". The casting away of the Jew for the time is the world's reconciliation. The gentiles are come within the reach of God's testimony. This was a great truth for Peter to learn, and it was confirmed to him by the fact of Cornelius and his friends receiving the Spirit without their becoming Jewish proselytes. Thus we have the ways of God unfolding, and in principle all was accomplished. Jew and gentile were one body in Christ. In fact, every order of man was displaced, and Christ alone remained. It appears to me important that we should see that all was complete in principle before Paul enters on his ministry, in order that we
{500}
may apprehend the unity and consistency of God's ways.
When Paul comes on the scene we have the testimony of Christ carried out to the gentiles, but nothing is added to the light which came out in Christ on earth, for the Spirit had sealed a complete testimony. But Paul enters on his service as a chosen vessel to bear Christ's name to the gentiles and the vessel is endowed with special understanding both in the gospel, and in the mystery, and is used of God to expound all that had come to pass in the presence and power of the Spirit down here.
I think there is no greater witness to the truth of God than the manner in which the ways of God were developed in the testimony of God in the world. Things apparently contradictory are brought together to form parts of one great and complete whole. The key is in apprehending the variety of the place which Christ fills as Man. Variety in detail down here all centres in Him. And the church is that in which He is set forth in every variety.
NEW RELATIONSHIPS
Abraham is our father, but we are begotten through Sarah, that is, the new covenant. We are begotten of the gospel. But there is another point brought in with Isaac; we are begotten of God's purpose, being children of promise. Isaac was the true seed of Abraham according to God's purpose and promise. It is what God brings in, we are begotten of His will. At the end of God's ways the children of the flesh will disappear and the children of promise alone remain. Ishmael was cast out and Isaac had his place in Abraham's house. Ishmael represents the
{501}
man that did not rejoice, but mocked at the sovereign mercy of God. Mercy is the ground on which God establishes everything, there is no other ground when man is lost. So Michal was like Ishmael, despising David in her heart; the sure mercies of God were with David.
It is wonderful how God sets forth His ways. In Abraham another city and country came into view. In Sarah, the new covenant, we have Christ glorified and Jerusalem above presented to us, and then we have the Spirit come down to make good God's purpose. When the Spirit came the children of God became manifest. We are governed by what we look at. If we look at Christ glorified and the world to come (and that is faith) we are governed by it, and faith works by love, love is the expression of faith.
DELIVERANCE FROM SIN
The gospel is the revelation of God in righteousness. God has come out in this way, in the light, and I cannot believe that this light of God can come home to a man's soul without producing an immediate moral effect. It is the light of grace bringing salvation, and having a teaching inherent in it. (See @Titus 2.) I think this light surely brings into the soul a certain emancipation from sin, though not complete; but the incompatibility of righteousness and sin must be seen. The next thing is that a soul accepts the *truth* of baptism -- apprehends that death was upon it, drinks the bitter waters of Marah, but apprehends that in baptism it has been buried in Christ's death -- has accepted or been placed in that position -- apprehending also the love that brought Him into that place. It obeys from the heart the form of doctrine to which it has been delivered, reckons itself dead to sin in Christ's death, and alive to God in
{502}
Christ Jesus. This brings in deliverance from sin, and is of course in the power of the Spirit, but it is the necessary moral consequence in the soul of the light of God. If God reveals Himself, every quality in which He reveals Himself must have a moral effect on those who are in the light of the revelation, and if once I accept the place of death, there is nothing for me but His power to raise me up.
If christians go on in sin and worldly ways it proves to me, not only that they have not accepted death, but are defective in the knowledge of God; they are not consciously in the light of the gospel. People want the truth of the gospel much more than we are aware of. I very much doubt if people are profoundly affected by doctrine, or position, or anything short of the knowledge of God. I think that another powerful motive also comes in and that is the love of Christ (@2 Corinthians 5: 14). The light of God makes it impossible to continue in sin, and the love of Christ constrains us to live to Him.
As regards *nature*, it is evident that the one practising righteousness is of God, and is put in contrast in @1 John 3 to the one practising sin. The two thoughts are not connected with one and the same person, and practising righteousness would go with the being dead to sin, and having become the servant of righteousness in @Romans 6 and this really results, as I judge, from the effect of the light of God in the soul. Hence the light of God *to* us really results in nature *in* us, and that is the only nature of which God takes account; and if it be not there, there is no proof of our being children of God. I think we need to be much more concerned that souls should be really in the light, and thus under the influence of what God is, than as to the position they take, or the doctrine they accept.
{503}
RIGHTEOUSNESS, LOVE AND POWER
@Romans 5: 1 - 21
I want to show you the light which God has been pleased to give of Himself in the Lord Jesus Christ, and the second thing God has made known is His thought in regard to man. As to the revelation of God, I see three great points coming out in Christ.
All our blessing and happiness is bound up with the knowledge of God. I very much doubt if you will find any one placing real confidence in God, until He is known as He has revealed Himself in the Lord Jesus Christ. The three characteristics that come out in the revelation of God are -- firstly, righteousness; secondly, love; thirdly, power. Going back to chapter 4: 22, God first makes Himself known to us in righteousness. Then from chapter 5: 5, we get love. Then at the close of the chapter we get the triumph, grace reigns; power comes in; it is the reign of grace -- the triumph of God. Grace reigns "through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord".
We can thank God for this light about Himself, because it suits us perfectly, and stands in contrast to what man is. There are certainly three things that mark man; sin, hatred, and weakness. Where is the man who is not marked by these three things? I know it in myself, and you know how true it is of you. I do not speak of what man has done, but of what he is as departed from God. He is marked by sin -- a will antagonistic to God. The full expression will be in the lawless one. Thank God it is hindered and restrained by government and by the truth, but in its full development the whole world will be in rebellion against God. It began in a very small way -- one small act, but in the Revelation we get the climax, the whole world in rebellion against God and the Lamb.
{504}
It is equally true that man's heart is full of hatred. If any one does not know that, he does not know himself. Circumstances may not have occurred to make it very apparent, but if you knew to the bottom of your heart, you would know that the principle there is hatred against God. It is the effect of the fall. Man hates God because he has a will of his own.
Thirdly, man is weak. The proof is that he dies. Where is the man that can maintain himself in life? He has to die. I cannot conceive anything more sad; man in sin, in hatred, and in weakness. When God makes Himself known, He makes Himself known in contrast to all that man is, in order that man might be able to trust God, that he might know Him as He has revealed Himself. I can trust Him because He is righteous, I can trust Him because He is love, I can trust Him because He has power. This revelation is the glory, the effulgence of God -- "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". It has come to us in the gospel, that our hearts being in the light of God as He has revealed Himself, we might be able to confide in Him. Christianity is a very practical matter, and if we have not learnt that the heart can trust God because it knows Him, we have not learnt the first principle of christianity. We cannot trust a person we do not know. I have long since learnt that in this world man is not to be trusted, he will fail you at some point; the only One who will never fail you is God.
As to the way in which God has made Himself known -- the blood of Jesus is the witness of His righteousness. Eternally, God will make Himself known as the righteous God in judgment. In the lake of fire He allows an eternal witness to exist to His righteousness, but the witness to us is the blood of Christ. It is the great witness that God has given as to what He thinks of sin. But if sin has been removed by the blood of Christ, God has given
{505}
unmistakable witness of what it is to Him. He is the Justifier, but the first thing is, He is just. The blood of Jesus is the witness of both.
The proof of love is that He gave His Son. When Christ died the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. God has come out in the revelation of Himself in love, and man can go in to God. Nothing tells us more that we are privileged to be in the light in which love is shown out perfectly than the death of Christ; by it He has made known His righteousness and His love. The blood of Christ cleanses from all sin, but that very One was the Son of His love.
In the resurrection God has been pleased to make known His power. The power of God comes in at man's weakest point. He has proved His power in raising again from the dead the Lord Jesus Christ. God has found in Him a Vessel in which He could display Himself. I put it to every one, Do you know what it is to be in the blessed light of God that has come out in our Lord Jesus Christ?
{506}
THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE SPIRIT OF EVIL
@Luke 4: 14 - 37
I want to draw attention to the forces with which we come into conflict in the world. It comes out distinctly in @Luke 4. Outwardly it may bear a different aspect now, but the same forces are at work, and with the same object. In this world the Spirit of God is acting for God, and then there is that which is in direct opposition. In the gospel of John we find the Jew opposing -- the devil working in him to discountenance what is of God. There is the same thing in christendom, or modern Judaism as it might be called, namely, the spirit of evil acting against the Spirit of God. It is of all moment to see underneath what these forces are. Stephen brought it home to the Jew when he said, "Ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye". It is an unvarying rule that the Spirit is contrary to the flesh, but apart from the flesh and not the flesh itself, there is a force in the world acting against the Spirit of God. This explains largely what we see going on in the world. God's deliverance is from the power of evil, and from that system and order of things where the power of evil operates. Idolatry is a form in which it can operate, Judaism is another, and now christendom is a system in which the power of evil can operate and affect men. Here, in @Luke 4, Satan came to the Lord, and spoke of the glory of the world being delivered to him. This world is a system where evil can operate and hold the souls of men, but there is the Spirit of God to deliver.
In this gospel you get the activity of the Spirit of God from the beginning. When the angel announced to Mary the birth of Christ, he said, "The Holy
{507}
Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God". Son of God because He was the Son of God's *power*. From the very introduction of Christ into the world we find the Spirit of God in activity. Almost contemporaneously with the announcement of the birth of Christ took place the birth of John the baptist, and in that wonderful song of his father Zacharias, we do not find him celebrating John the baptist, but the "dayspring from on high" is the burden of the song. God, he says, "hath raised up an horn of salvation for us". It all refers to Christ. The Holy Spirit had filled Zacharias that he might celebrate the horn of salvation. I go a point further, when Christ is actually born, men on earth are inattentive, but there is a great stir in heaven. Then He is brought into the temple where was the aged Simeon, filled with the Holy Spirit. God's great answer to death was Jehovah's Christ. Before Simeon saw death, he had been permitted to see God's great answer to it, and he says, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace". He came by the Spirit into the temple, there was drawing to Christ, and he took the child Jesus in his arms. All this shows the continual activity of the Holy Spirit in connection with the advent of Christ into the world. Now I pass over a certain period and we come to the baptism of Christ. He was baptised by John the baptist that everything might be accomplished, and then He is anointed by the Holy Spirit. In this chapter He is led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil -- afterwards to Nazareth where He had been brought up. In verses 16 - 21 the Lord refers to the prophecy of Isaiah. "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me". The Spirit of God was the Spirit of grace. Jesus was anointed by the Spirit to preach, that is the first thing. It was ever in God's mind that
{508}
a Man should be anointed by the Holy Spirit. He was ever bent on maintaining the testimony of God in this world. He is the Preacher of the glad tidings now. Isaiah alludes to the glad tidings in connection with Christ coming into the world. Now Christ has come bringing the glad tidings. The Spirit of God always maintained the testimony of God in the world, and that is what He is here for now. What man wants is *certainty*. He cannot have it apart from the revelation of God. No man can be certain in himself of having arrived at the truth. Certainty must depend on revelation, so the Spirit of God in grace towards man is bent on maintaining the testimony down here in this world. In prophetic testimony certain rays of light shone forth, but now the Sun has shone. The only-begotten Son has declared the Father. Man does not want to rest his hopes on something that will come to pieces. Christ was the testimony -- they "wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth". The words of grace were natural to Christ, "Grace is poured into thy lips", they are not natural to us. There could be no discord between Christ and the Spirit of God. There is perfect communion. The Spirit is here to maintain the testimony of God in the world, whether in prophetic writings, or when Christ came, but you will find that there is always opposition to it.
Remember the passage in @Acts 7, "Ye do always resist the Holy Spirit", then in verses 25 - 32 we have the Lord referring to Elijah and Elisha. By the Holy Spirit they maintained God's testimony and were resisted, so the Jews were judging Christ and resisting the Spirit of God. Men in the flesh resisted the Spirit. We have to apprehend the forces of evil that are at work. We must not be astonished to find the leaders -- "the princes of this world", men of science and intellect -- setting themselves against the Spirit of God. We can only rest on revelation, nothing
{509}
short of this, but there *is* revelation, and the Spirit of God maintains it.
At the outset of his gospel Luke writes to the one he addresses "That thou mightest know *the certainty* of those things". The Lord in His address in the synagogue brings before them Elijah and Elisha. The nation took little account of them, they were despised according to the flesh, but who got the benefit of their testimony? The widow and the leper -- both gentiles -- not the Jews, for the simple reason they were not down low enough to apprehend the testimony of God. The things of God are hid from the wise and prudent, and are revealed unto babes. The same story is repeated today, men of wisdom and learning judge of things according to the flesh.
In verses 33 - 37 the Lord goes into the synagogue, where there is a man with an unclean devil. When the Lord was here the power of evil came out through unclean spirits, and degradation and depravity accompanied it. Now the power of evil comes out in quite a different way; its working in men may be in accordance with the general state of things existing at any given time. In the synagogue the Lord by the Spirit of God rebukes the devil and commands him to come out of the man. Satan has altered his aspect now and appears as an angel of light. The attempt by men of ability to discredit Christ, and all that Christ is, is essentially antichristian. The work of the Spirit is to deliver man from that system of things in which the power of evil can work -- the great world-system; that is where man finds his glory. Do you think God will tolerate that? All glory belongs to God. If man assumes glory, it proves his system to be all wrong. How often a man in the world who is extremely wicked gets glory and honour in a marvellous way. What would the world be without ambition, emulation, and such like things? It would not suit men of the world to be meek and
{510}
lowly like Christ. What characterises the world is "the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life". The Spirit of God is here to deliver from this world-system. How? By making God known to the soul; by bringing souls into the light revealed in Christ. The apostle could say to the Corinthians, after speaking of what they had been, "but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God" (@1 Corinthians 6: 11); they were delivered from the world-system, and what then? put into relation with the One who is Head -- "members of Christ" -- as associated with Him who is the Centre and Sun of God's system of the universe of bliss. The Sun of righteousness will arise by and by on Israel, but we have not to wait for the Sun of righteousness to arise, already we are brought into God's marvellous light, and thus already placed in relation to the Sun of righteousness. Christ is also in us, and the Spirit is life because of righteousness. Do not trust the surface of things; if we want truth, we must look underneath. There is nothing new in the present course of things; the fathers resisted the Holy Spirit, the Jews resisted, and christendom resists today, but the Spirit is here in the world to deliver man from it. "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit". The Spirit brought Simeon to Christ. He has brought us to Christ and He will maintain us in intelligent relation to Christ. The earth stands in relation to the sun, but the sun shines also into the earth; there is reciprocity. Christ shines into the christian in all His blessed light and warmth, and the effort of the Spirit of God is that Christ should shine out.
{511}
ON THE OLD AND NEW MAN
I quite agree with you that the "old man" refers to the state and position of a man as born of Adam; old now, because a new one has come in, but the first man. I think the old man is gone *for God* on the cross judicially, and hence the believer can die to sin; but it is certain that the flesh is still seen as existing in the christian, though the christian is not in it. What is true for God, as the ground and basis of His dealings in grace, is to be made good spiritually in the believer. If the old man were not ended before God, I do not see how the Spirit could have been given for the forming of the new -- nor how we could put off the old man.
The christian has to put it off, but this is a question of spiritual power, and not of non-existence.
I rather question the connection of Jordan with @Romans 6. It seems to me that reckoning yourself dead to sin is the furthest point reached in @Romans 6; whereas Jordan is that death is realised to the whole course and system in which flesh lives, so that the place of spiritual circumcision is reached, and the believer enters into an out-of-the-world, heavenly condition of things in the circle of christian affections and fellowship.
{512}
PHILADELPHIA
I have been interested, in studying the addresses to the seven churches in Asia (@Revelation 2 and 3), by observing the features of a remnant character which are apparent in Philadelphia. By a remnant character I mean something which bears all the traits of the whole, without assuming to be the whole, hence in Philadelphia one can notice the way in which the true attitude of the assembly is represented before the Lord, so that what is said in regard to that assembly should be that which is properly characteristic of the church as Christ's bride.
One can understand that it is grateful to the Lord that at the close of the church's history on earth there should be a company of saints, who, recognising the church's place and relation to Christ, seek without ecclesiastical pretension or assumption to stand morally in the truth of the assembly, and thus to answer to Christ's mind.
To make the point clear it may be observed that Thyatira closes the connection of Christ with the church viewed as a whole on earth. It is strictly the last in the succession of the assemblies, and hence in the opening the Lord is brought in -- as "Son of God" according to @Psalm 2, and, in the promise to the overcomer, we are carried to the thought of authority over the nations. The kingdom is in view. The three remaining churches picture to us certain collateral moral states which are owned by the Lord, but no one of them stands in any outward or ecclesiastical sense for the church as a whole.
To Sardis, Christ is distant, and the state is such that He warns her that, except she repent, He will come on her, as on the world, as a thief in the night. Laodicea, with its pretension and self-sufficiency,
{513}
presents a state which is nauseous to Christ, and she is about to be spued out of His mouth.
In Philadelphia the case is wholly different. Philadelphia is not marked, as is Laodicea, by any peculiar character or assumption, but by features which are properly characteristic of the bride, and it is in this that the remnant character is seen. It has the features of the original. "Thou ... hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name". "Thou hast kept the word of my patience".
All that is of Christ was cherished, this is the mark of the church in its true place. Christ's word is the expression of Himself. He is absolutely that which He says. This is kept. His name is that which is set forth in Him, and this is not denied. His patience is the abnegation for the moment of His rights, and the word of this is kept. All this is proper to the church, showing how completely she is in concert with the One who is her absorbing object.
On the other hand Christ can say, "I have loved thee", and "I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth". Such words have their application not to any select company, however faithful, but are the expression of affection to the church which Christ loved and for which He gave Himself.
The more saints are consciously in the truth of the church, the less disposed will they be to assume exclusively the place of the church, but they will esteem it a great privilege to be holding to the truth of the church as morally representative of the church, and ever remembering that it is the Spirit and the bride that say, "Come!"

THE HEAVENLY MAN
@Psalm 16: 1 - 11
In studying the Psalms you will readily see that @Psalm 14 closes one part of the first book. We find there the climax of wickedness, "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt ... they are all together become filthy"; it is the climax of the depravity and contrariety of man. When the apostle is taking a survey of the condition of man (@Romans 3) he confirms his position by quotations from this psalm.
The Spirit of God begins a new phase of the subject in @Psalm 15, and we all have to learn the line thence opened out.
We have had before us two remarkable psalms, 2 and 8, in which Christ is seen as God's Son, God's King and as the Son of man. These titles constitute His name as Man, they set forth the glory which belongs to Him, and embrace the counsel and purpose of God regarding Him. The beauty of @Psalm 2 is that all is *of God*. Christ is God's Son, and He is God's King. "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion"; and "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee". But Son of man brings in more the thought of redemption, and of a new world which comes in on that ground. The burden of the first fourteen psalms is, I judge, the counsel of God, and the glory of the Lord according to that counsel; but with this, the contrariety and opposition of everything down here. My conviction is, that the more light we get in regard of God's counsel, and the vessel of it, the more conscious we become of the state of things down here that is opposed to it.
Now in @Psalms 15 and 16 we have quite another side presented. The question is raised in @Psalm 15,
{515}
Who is the man to stand in the presence of this glory? Where is the man to come from who can meet the requirements of God? "Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?" In @Psalm 16 we get the answer. There we find set forth the man who can stand in the light of God, who is suited to the glory. Blessing is to come forth to man in connection with the man who is according to God. We get the description of this man in @Psalm 16, and the psalm is applicable evidently to Christ personally. What characterised Christ is that, deriving nothing from man, all that came in by Him was morally new. Christ as man is man to perfection. He can never be improved upon. He is the last Adam -- all starts from thence, and every family in heaven and earth is named of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is a new starting-point; all has to take its character from that man, and that man is in the presence of God. I see all the light of God in Christ. He is the revelation of God, and He is man too in the presence of God in the perfection of that light. @Psalm 8 gives the thought of the *last* Adam. @Psalm 15 raises the question of the state of man. @Psalm 16 shows us the place that Christ has taken as man. It gives us thus life to God, not even what Christ was in respect of the contrariety of man, as in other psalms where man comes in and God judges, but what His life was Godward.
In the ways of God, if He were to bless man, it was not only a question of having one to whom He could entrust all authority, but a man before Him in whom Satan should be defeated and that in the scene of his power, and in whom too God would be glorified. God could have readily swept man from off the face of the earth, but His purpose was not so. His way as regards man is recovery. But to look a little in detail at the place that Christ takes, He says to Jehovah, "Thou art my Lord". He accepts that
{516}
place. He does not take the place of God but that of man. The psalm is full of life, all is morally according to God. Then He associates Himself with the saints, the excellent of the earth. He has companions. In a scene where there was "none that doeth good, no, not one", God had, I believe, in anticipation of Christ coming here, been forming saints in view of what was going to be. They took their character from Christ when He came. The Old Testament saints were formed upon promises, but then Christ was the Heir of promise. In the millennium what will mark Israel is the "law written in their hearts", but Christ is the first man in whose heart was God's law. He was the man out of heaven, "living bread which came down from heaven", and thus placed within the reach of man's appropriation. Before Christ came God had doubtless been working in view of His coming, and thus there were those with whom, when He comes, He associates Himself. Historically it refers to the godly remnant who were baptized of John, who had been made sensible of their ruin, and confessed it. They were poor things, but much more lowly than we are, for I think we have become more or less inflated with our intelligence.
In the latter part of the psalm what comes out is this: Jehovah was His inheritance, Jehovah gave Him counsel, and Jehovah was His support. He had a goodly heritage. Proprietary possession is very dear to the natural man, but Christ had Jehovah for His portion. As to His pathway here He began life in a manger, He had not where to lay His head, and He went out of the world by the cross. When questioned about the tribute money He said, "Shew me a penny". He had not one, and yet He says, "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage". He as man was in the full light of Jehovah, and having nothing as to this world, He
{517}
was content with that. Are you content with the light of the knowledge of God? Such a one lives in the sunshine of divine love.
The next point is that He did not need to turn to man for wisdom. "I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel". He could say, "as I hear, I judge". Christ as man found Jehovah enough for Him. He maintained His lot. The Lord had no wealth here, no education from man, Jehovah was everything to Him.
Then Jehovah is His support, "Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved". He lived in the light of divine goodness, He had heritage, He had counsel, and He had support. If you can say that, you are not badly off. If God is at your right hand, who is going to move you?
Christ brought the light of God into this world; but more, He was Man in that light. He was the Man who found all His resources in God. The beauty of the psalm to me is that it teems with life. The devil might come as a tempter, or as a roaring lion, but he found nothing in Christ. He was Man, but independent of man and the world, and found His portion exclusively in Jehovah. Do you want to be in that path? Christ has inaugurated it, and we are called to walk in it; we are privileged to be in the light as God is in the light.
He could say, too, "My heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope". The path ends at the right hand of God. It is not a man treading the path in haste, but the soul maintained in freshness and vigour, and finding Jehovah its portion, and this in a pathway down here.
Now this is what we get in @Psalm 16, and every family will take its character from Christ. All will be formed according to Him. The psalm presents the heavenly man, but treading the path that leads to God's right hand.
{518}
It is a great thing to see that while we have a portion in heaven, there is a path of piety down here that a man can find his resource in Jehovah.
The starting-point is Christ, and we have to be prepared to let all go except Christ. Nothing of the first man can abide, and therefore the second Man is brought in and everything is formed according to Him.
The Lord grant that we may be preserved from any legal effort to walk in that path. As we are in the light we are formed according to Christ, and then it is that we can take that path, and are prepared to find our whole resource in God.
FOUR NOTABLE THINGS
I see four points in Christ:
1. I see manhood beautified and adorned here upon earth, so that God should be glorified in man.
2. I see God glorified in man in the putting away of sin.
3. I see in the resurrection, man accepted.
4. And in the exaltation of Christ, man glorified.
Christ is in heaven, the glorified Man, and that Man is to be the glory and delight of the christian. If that is the case, then I am strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, and in some little degree I learn how to maintain the truth which God has been pleased to give us; and the only possible way to do it is by your own soul being in the blessed reality of it, and the very essence of it is that Christ should be the glory of your heart, the Man in whom you delight, your glory. Then the result will be that every blessed quality that came out in Him as man will be reproduced in the christian down here, because Christ is the Man of the christian's heart.
{519}
THE PERSON OF CHRIST
@Galatians 4: 4
The same Person abides, though the condition be changed, in His coming of a woman. He is a real Man, body, soul and spirit, but still God's Son (that same Person).
If you carry the thought of the incarnation beyond the scriptural limit, that is, form (that of a servant) and condition (flesh and blood), you cannot avoid, that I can see, reaching distinct personality, and so making two personalities in Christ, a divine and a human. These may be said to be mysteriously blended in one, the unity of the Person, but that is as great an error as if they were spoken of as distinct and apart in Him. The mystery of the incarnation and the true sense in which the union of God and man can be spoken of is that in one and the same Person God was made manifest to man (in flesh), and man was presented for the good pleasure of God. Unity of Person, or indivisibility, is not, I believe, a thought found in Scripture.
@John 3: 13 and @John 6: 62 are simply the Lord speaking of Himself, as commonly, under an official name. Every scripture which definitely refers to the incarnation speaks of it as the assumption by Christ of a form or condition. One who is in Person divine and existing in the form of God emptied Himself in grace and took on Him a form and condition not commensurate with the greatness of His Person. But the Person never changes (so J. N. D. says), and any line of teaching that gives the idea of change in any way as regards the Person is, to my mind, dishonouring to the Son, and interferes with what He calls "My glory", @John 17: 24. 'His complete person' is an expression I do not at all like.
{520}
I only now add that if 'human condition', "bondman's form", 'likeness of men', "flesh and blood", do not describe what the Son took in becoming Man, it raises the question, whence did the rest come? I should certainly have thought that what was spiritual was of Himself. Certainly there was no creation in Him, as in us, of an intelligent moral being (in which the true idea of "person" lies), for we are "the offspring of God".
The idea of union, or unity of Person, appears to me to have greatly clouded in people's minds the truth of incarnation.
In the expression, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit", I judge that the Lord takes up an expression suited to the position in which He was. But it is the Person who left the condition, which He had assumed, to take it again, and not as flesh and blood but still as Man, and meantime He was in paradise.
ETERNAL LIFE IN ITS PRESENT FORM
As I understand eternal life in its present form it is our living by Christ in the power of the Spirit, in a new position and relationship before the Father, to which He has given us entrance by His death. We are thus morally outside the flesh and the world, in the Son -- a new sphere. (@John 6: 54; @John 12: 31, 32.) Hence even faithfulness down here, and walking in patience and grace and relative duties, though they give occasion for the display of the Spirit of Christ, hardly connect themselves in my mind with eternal life. That is displayed in @John 17: 3.
{521}
EXTRACT ON THE GOSPELS
I have been thinking a little of the stupendous fact of the Son of God having become Man -- and the results flowing from it. He could not by so doing change His Person (though, as J. N. D. has said, He in love left His first estate). Hence in Matthew He is Jehovah, Emmanuel, in relation to Israel; and in John, the only begotten Son, in relation to the Father; and in neither gospel is there any record of ascension. He could not, so to say, as such, be exalted. But in Mark He is in the form of a servant -- and having served in humiliation and weakness, He is taken up to the right hand of God to serve in power. In Luke we have Him in the likeness of men, and having entered on humanity at the weakest point and gone down in the suffering of death to the lowest point, He is raised in the condition suited to the new place for man above all principality and power, and a cloud receives Him out of the disciples sight. So that though position and condition are changed, everything in Him abides; and as servant and Man He is highly exalted.
THE KINGDOM, THE COVENANT AND THE CALLING
God is not teaching people that are opposed to Him; you must come under the sway of God. God is going to have honour here when all will be subject to Him.
The heavenly city has a very conspicuous place in the world to come. It is the centre of God's rule. There are certain things connected with the heavenly city in the millennium which are not connected with the eternal state. There are two descriptions of the heavenly city in the Revelation and they differ considerably.
{522}
All the measuring, and the names of the twelve tribes in the gates, all that is connected with the millennium, not with the eternal state. Scripture says, They shall no more say, "Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord ... and I will remember their sin no more". Grace does not tolerate man's will; it does not now; "if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother" you come under discipline. Grace reigns *through* righteousness; it will not tolerate man's will. Now it is a kingdom not seen, in the millennium it will be a kingdom seen. Christendom will be judged on the ground of the kingdom.
To believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is no small matter; you accept the word simply on the testimony of God, but it involves a very great deal. You leave Egypt, the power of Satan, to be under the sway of God. Peace with God was enjoyed when they were on the other side of the Red Sea. They had perfect security from the enemies because *they* were lost in the depths of the sea. The Spirit has been given in order that the kingdom may be made good in our souls.
But the wonderful thing is that death is the way to God, instead of being the way to judgment. We pass to God through the death of Christ. There is the consciousness in the soul that you have passed from death to life. If we realised more the help we get from the priesthood of Christ we should avail ourselves more of it.
"Minister of the sanctuary" is God's side.
In connection with the kingdom you apprehend the house, that is, the Spirit is here, and consequent upon that we get divine teaching. The new covenant is divine teaching; it is the Spirit of God teaching us what the mind of God is towards us. It is equivalent to a man making his will. The covenant exhibits
{523}
what God's mind is toward us. If I made a will, the way I dispose of my property would disclose my mind. The new covenant is the mind of God towards us, and the Holy Spirit makes it good to us. God says, I will have nothing more to say about sins, "their sins and iniquities will I remember no more". The new covenant is disclosing His mind, and that is love.
The "calling" is described in one word, association with Christ, that is the meaning of the calling. No one can change his individuality but by the power of God there is another individuality. A man has a certain set of individual characteristics, and those are changed, "not I, but Christ liveth in me". You get another individuality stamped upon you, and that by the power of God. The new individuality is Christ.
The old covenant was from Jerusalem in bondage -- Hagar; the new covenant from the Jerusalem which is above (@Galatians 4).
"No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us", @1 John 4: 12. By the very fact of being in divine love ... the light of God comes out in us when God's love is perfected in us. In the consciousness of divine love you are conscious of association with the One who has expressed that love. God's love consciously known by us is expressed in our love one to another.
In the epistle of John you have:
<ol>
<li>Fellowship, that is the lowest point of christian life.</li><li>Growth, varied degrees of apprehension.</li><li>Life of privilege, that is what you are to the Father.</li><li>What God is in you.</li><li>Eternal life, we are in Him that is true.</ol>
{524}
THE LORD'S PATHWAY
It has been said in regard to the Lord Jesus that His path in this world was a path of activity in obscurity, and that is very much the path in which the christian is called to walk with God. It was in measure fulfilled in Enoch, and I think our testimony is the testimony of Enoch. The more faithful we are, the more we shall be disposed to bear testimony that the Lord is coming with ten thousands of His saints. Christ is at the right hand of God, crowned with glory and honour, but is not always to continue there; He is coming again. There is grace for man in the meantime through the gospel, but the church bears testimony to the coming of the Lord in judgment, because it is in accord with God's mind.
TRUE WISDOM TO HONOUR CHRIST
@John 12: 1 - 31
God takes care that there should be a full witness to Christ as Son of God, Son of David and Son of man.
Mary's thought in her act goes really beyond death; Christ was her life. A man tries to distinguish his life: if he is a man of the world he is right to try to distinguish his life by getting on in the world. Mary was wise, she honoured Christ and she is distinguished by this, for the Lord says of her that wherever the gospel is preached her act shall be spoken of. This act of hers was the moral sequence of sitting at the feet of Jesus and of hearing His word. Christ was her life in the matter of His being everything to her. So with us, Christ is our life, and
{525}
it is well when all that we have is devoted to Him, our speech and all that is true wisdom.
A christian really wants to pass out of sight himself, but when opportunity offers he should honour Christ. Mary gave her all -- she did what she could; the widow also who gave her two mites, she did what she could. The ointment was a sacrifice, so what we have is devoted, it is a sacrifice. Martha would have been wise to do as Mary did; Martha, as seen in this chapter, may have learnt her lesson: it says she served, and she did not complain of Mary not helping her, but Mary is the one here who is distinguished, and that because she honoured Christ. Mary's act drew out the thoughts of the disciples, it was *waste* in their view, and many a christian is judged in that way. Why not devote your energies to benefit the world? The true way is to honour Christ, for no *real* good is done to this world except by Christ.
It is a real waste to try to benefit the world in any way except by Christ, but if you distinguish Him there you do the best for the world. You may be impelled by man in some way or other, you need to analyse your motives as to whence the impulse comes, that thus you may be impelled by divine influences and not by human.
Christ has brought us to the revelation of God, and people ought to have a great deal more joy in connection with this revelation than they have. It is so blessed to have got such a revelation of God. Mary was held to Christ; the Spirit was not yet given, but she was held to Him. In Him there was the testimony of God brought to her, it was this that held her to Christ. All was divinely ordered, she did the right thing at the right moment. The Lord appreciated it: He said, "She hath done what she could"; He appreciates everything done to Himself. Mary was misjudged even by the disciples.
{526}
You must just go on and not try to vindicate yourself; christians who are going on with the world will misjudge you, but the spiritually-minded christians will be with you. We read of Abraham that he was to walk through the land in the length and breadth of it, but we get also the depth and height. Paul prayed for this for the Ephesians, but really for the gentiles, and there must surely be some result accruing to us through his prayer. Mary did a good thing at a suitable moment -- for His burial.
Christ is our life, and therefore we ought to be exercised as to distinguishing Him rather than ourselves. Speech should not be used for distinguishing ourselves, but if used for distinguishing *Him*, then we shall be out of sight as a result.
The great rule is, Christ is our life, and therefore it is true wisdom to honour Him.
Then we get the Lord entering Jerusalem, and there is testimony rendered to Him as Son of David and King of Israel. He claimed it in the way of testimony; what the prophets had spoken of was claimed in the way of testimony, this is often seen. So now we claim inheritance in the way of testimony, we are to be "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might". He is Head of all things, and we claim inheritance in that way for Him. God's way is to claim all in testimony; God gives ample and full testimony before He comes in in a decisive way. The present moment is a very peculiar one; our testimony is to Christ as Head, before His headship is asserted publicly. Christ has come in as last Adam and Head of all things, and we want to be in the witness of it before God comes in in a decisive way. The testimony to Christ as Head will tend to bring out antichrist. If there were a united testimony to Christ as Head, it would tend to bring a crisis, and antichrist would be set up. The enemy takes his cue from the testimony, he will set up anti-christ,
{527}
and then God will have to come in in judgment and bring Christ in.
What is set forth in Christ is God's thought for every one. Witness is the result of affection, and you then do the right thing at the right moment. Separation from the world morally is most important for us, not separation from men, but from the principles of the world. Christ is our life; this, too, is most important; a man's object is his life; if Christ is my object, He is my life. As to eating with a ruler, if you eat you put yourself under his power, he has invited you for a purpose, and he will take you in, therefore put a knife to your throat: you must not be affected by the man's principles.
We must not avoid men, but you want to be prepared; in such cases it may be best to be aggressive if you are courageous. Man's civilities are to be avoided, you put yourself under his power: you want to be faithful to Christ. In early days in Acts Christ was their life.
Christ did not avoid men, but He did not touch their dainty meats. He could speak straight to them; how beautiful to see the Lord in the houses of those whose thoughts were completely contrary to His own, as in @Luke 7 in Simon's house, and see also how faithfully and wisely He spoke! (@Luke 14). There was no fear or favour of man there, and what came out in His death illuminated every act of His life; so in the Supper, it is "This do in remembrance of me"; in His death God was brought in and man was put out, *so* call Him to mind: when they saw the principles that governed all His life, they would call Him to mind, for those principles were fully seen in His death, where God was brought in and man was put out.
{528}
THE SERVANT JUSTIFYING HIS WORK
@Acts 11: 1 - 30
We see here that the servant of the Lord has to justify his work as well as carry it out; Peter had to justify it before the apostles and brethren. In any unusual work going on today the servant has to justify it before his brethren, as we see in chapter 14, verse 27.
No servant can take a ground of independence. It was an unusual course of Peter in chapter 10, which God would have to be justified before the saints. The servant of the Lord now takes his direction from the Lord, but that will not lead to independence, he justifies himself before the saints. A servant has to be guided by the general judgment of the saints. As to what Peter actually did, it was that God showed him, in the sheet let down from heaven, what the situation was, and all Peter did was to recognise the situation. The blessing of Abraham was gone out to the gentiles: that was what Peter had to recognise. It is important to put before people the *blessing* side of the gospel, and not the mere *escape* side. Peter only made known what was already true in Christ. He was used to show that the door was opened to the gentiles. The nations had received the word of God, and the nations had received the gift of the Spirit, and in verse 18 it is to the nations God hath granted repentance unto life.
Cornelius was just brought in to show what the situation was; the gospel today makes known the situation. A man gets repentance unto life; directly he gets his eyes open as to God he must be brought to repentance. It is the goodness of God that leads to repentance.
The prodigal arrived at a judgment of himself in the presence of the goodness of God. If God were not
{529}
revealed in grace there could be no turning to God. The reconciliation of the world (@Romans 11: 15) is seen in the sheet let down from heaven, not the world there in the sense of "all that is in the world", but in the way of contrast with the Jews.
Redemption has come in to enable God to take up *all* men. The *promise* could only be effected by redemption, because man lay under judgment and death.
In his going to Cornelius Peter was very wise, for he took six brethren with him. Cornelius and his house were to be told of God's salvation, were to be brought into salvation. The expression "added to the Lord" seems to be added to Him in the way of *profession*.
The Greeks were gentiles, but the Grecians were Hellenists or Greek-speaking Jews. The wisdom of God was seen in using Peter, a Jew and the minister of the circumcision, to open the door for the gentiles. In the case of Saul of Tarsus, Ananias was indisposed to go to Saul, and Peter was indisposed to go to Cornelius, but the Lord was overruling all. Then we see that it was happily accepted by the church at Jerusalem, and they send down Barnabas.
The christian is one who professes Christ; it may have been at first a term of reproach, but it is adopted by the Spirit, as we see in Peter: "if any man suffer as a Christian". Antioch becomes a special centre of the activity of the Spirit.
He is made Lord and Christ, and then you get His activities: He directs His servants, converts Saul of Tarsus and opens the door to the gentiles. The Lord, gone up on high, does all this.
{530}
NOTHING IN THE TRUTH BUT CHRIST
@Hebrews 8: 1 - 13; @Exodus 29: 42 - 46
There is nothing in the truth, beloved friends, but Christ. Christ objectively is everything for the saint. He is the true God to begin with, and, on the other hand, He is the perfect expression of God regarding man -- God brought into contact with man, "For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". Here is the Man, therefore, the Mediator "between God and men, the man Christ Jesus".
In the truth there is nothing outside of Christ. Christianity has been made to accommodate itself to suit man. The Lord foresaw all this and gave His disciples the parable of the kingdom of heaven where the woman took "leaven" and mixed it with three measures of meal, till the *whole* was leavened. The whole was leavened, and the Lord foresaw what would become a religion that suited the world.
A very common idea in christendom is that a man does not need to be converted. We know that that is pretty much the common idea, and if we take stock of the leaders and rulers in christendom, such as the clergy, many of them are unconverted men and scoff at the idea of conversion. In a general way conversion is spoken of as connected with the heathen, but in the sense we are accustomed to use the word it is scoffed at. Christianity has been accommodated to man -- with outward formality, and carried on by the clergy so that it should make the least possible demand on man.
In the truth Christ is the object, and in everything in connection with it. Everything is set forth in Him. Then, on the other hand, a saint is the reproduction of Christ in the power of the Spirit. This is a very important point. I know there is no perfection in saints, but in what is presented in Christ for saints you do get perfection. God found fault with the first
{531}
covenant, "For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come ... when I will make a new covenant". Christ presents, on the one hand, the perfect revelation of God, and, on the other, man is perfectly presented to God. When we look at ourselves there is no perfection. You and I are perfectly aware of that. But what we have to remember is that Christ is the truth. I just refer to that in passing.
We want to be brought into bond with Christ; we are all lawless till we are brought into bond with Christ. Scripture says, "if any one has not the Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him". I quite allow that there is a work antecedent, but what I want to press is, that there is no attachment to Christ without the Spirit, and what has brought us into attachment to Christ is attraction to Him. We may be very poorly attracted, but we must be attracted to Him before we can be attached to Him. Beloved friends, on the one hand Christ is the perfect expression, of righteousness, and on the other hand He is the vessel of God's mercy to man. It is very wonderful. The secret is, that being the righteous Man, He suffered for man.
He was the vessel of mercy, too, it came out in the pathway of His life here; it was all perfect righteousness, and then there was the ministry of mercy down here to man, "doing good" in every detail, for God was with Him. Now I want to pass on to what is the purpose of Christ in regard to His people.
His purpose is to conduct us in to God "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God". I view that expression "bring us to God" morally. I think I am quite justified in this. Those attached to Him are brought to God. Then, having been brought to God, we have to come out as witnesses for Christ.
Now one word as to our experience of this. Many
{532}
speak of being brought to God in their conversion, but it is much more true to say that God is brought to them then. The love of God is shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit -- they receive the Spirit, and in a certain sense when the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts it is much more God being brought to them.
Just look for a moment at a verse in @Exodus 15, "The Lord is my strength and song ... he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation"; then again in verse 13, "... led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation"; then verse 17, "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established". Any one reading these verses will notice a difference in them. In verse 2 it is the idea of God dwelling with His people, then the same thing in verse 13, corresponding to the Holy Spirit given unto us. God's holiness resides in the habitation of His holiness. Then in verse 17 there is an added thought, they were to be brought into the Sanctuary which His hands had established. A great many may think I refer to heaven, but I do not mean heaven, but that we may be conducted into the land of promise. That is God's purpose for us at the present moment, and all the objects in that land of promise are presented to us.
Now, beloved friends, I just throw out these thoughts for your consideration. God's great thought in regard to Israel was that He would be served. Turn to @Exodus 29: 44, 45; we get two distinct things here: "I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office. And I will dwell among the children of Israel". It was an inner thing as regards Aaron and his sons, He would make
{533}
Himself known to them in the sanctuary. He would be approached by them. The children of Israel did not approach. God did make Himself known to Aaron and his sons; all the service of God was in regard to the tabernacle. The priests compassionated the people, but that was not their service. Scripture in the hands of man is turned to account for his own ends, and the tendency is to be satisfied in bringing Christ down to the level of his own things. If the priests had been always occupied with the things of the people, their ailments and what not, the service of the tabernacle would have suffered, but the priests were sanctified to minister to God. The mass of Israel did not understand it, but the priest ought to have done so, and that his place was in the service of God, in the place where He was to be served in regard of things for His own purpose. I would not care to eat my food without giving God thanks for it; at the same time I plainly see if God is to be served aright it is not in regard to man's things but in regard to His own things.
Everything in the tabernacle was typical of things yet to come, and it is in regard to those things God has to be served. In the tabernacle there was the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat, the candlestick, the table of shewbread; and it was in regard to these things that Aaron and his sons had to serve, and in connection with these things the service of the tabernacle consisted -- and it was God's thought that man was to be brought in for His service, figured by Aaron and his sons. There can be nothing more important for us to get hold of.
It is a great contrast to see how things are carried on at the present moment in christendom, where men are in prominence and things are done suitably to themselves; what pleases man takes the place of what suits God. The tabernacle was not set up on that ground.
{534}
I do not think for a moment that the children of Israel understood what was implied by it, but if the service of the tabernacle was carried out according to God the people had the benefit of it, and when the tabernacle got corrupted the people suffered.
A great many people may read Leviticus and know very little of its true meaning; so Israel in the presence of the things then carried out according to God's orders would know little of their real meaning, but these things were written "for our learning", and we can in a kind of way understand the meaning of them. The service of God which was proposed was not for the people as they were then, but is applicable to the ways of God in a time to come, and shows how that God would have a people to serve Him, that by a way opened by Himself He could have man go in to Him into the holiest.
The priests did approach, and it was for God's pleasure. The failure of man only brings to pass God's purpose. "The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest". The going in of the sons of Aaron was entirely on the ground of their being the sons of Aaron, they had to be kindred to the one who was called to be priest; and so it is with us, we are not called to be priests, but we go in with One who is called and as kindred to Him, and thus Aaron and his sons are figures of Christ and the church, sanctified to God's service.
Now there are two or three points I should like to show you in the gospels where Christ identified His disciples with Himself that they might be with Him. Look first at @Mark 3: 13, He "calleth ... whom he would ... he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach". Why, do you think, were they called to be with Him? Nothing but to conduct them in, and then they were sent to witness for Him. If we have not been conducted in, we are not very fit
{535}
to preach. The point in regard to our service is, that we have to be fitted by God for it by being conducted in to Him. Many have taken up levitical service before they have been conducted in as priests. Let us pass on to @Luke 14: 15, then verse 22, and also chapter 20: 22. Now, beloved friends, I should like to make one remark in regard to the gospel. It presents things to us as a rule as individuals -- not so much of the company in view. I point out one or two leading landmarks.
In @Luke 7 we have the two debtors, but the Lord addresses Himself to the woman at the end of the chapter and says, "Thy sins are forgiven ... go in peace". He evidently does not conduct her in, she has to go on in her wilderness pathway. So, too, in regard to the parable of the good Samaritan -- the man is picked up and left at the inn. An inn is for people travelling on the road; he is left there, but cared for. But now, when we come to chapter 14 we get the house, and the supper is prepared for a great many to be conducted into it; "compel them to come in, that my house may be filled", and then in chapter 15 the prodigal is seen brought into the house sitting with the father, in complete suitability to him. The elder brother was outside. Then at the end of the gospel you get the thief on the cross; to him the Lord says, "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise".
Now you will notice there is distinct advance in the gospel. A woman sent on her way through the world in peace, a man placed in an inn by the roadside amply cared for, a prodigal brought in in suitability to his father, really in reconciliation, and then the thief assured "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise". In the end we find the thought of Christ coming out in His blessing the disciples as He went up to heaven, and He has sent down the Holy Spirit
{536}
from heaven, thus identifying His people with Himself in the place where He has gone.
Now look at @John 14: 1 - 10. Here He again tells His disciples He will receive them, "that where I am, there ye may be also". It was to be in His Father's house -- connected peculiarly with His Father -- so that they might be in the place of approach to the Father. All His ministry had been to lead them into that place. All the time He had been so expressing the Father, they were not up to their place of privilege, and one of them says, "Shew us the Father". It is impossible to know God except by approaching Him, and if we are in the place of approach an immediate response will be given. "We love him, because he first loved us". We can be conducted to the Father's heart, and that is in the Father's house. All the gospels are alike. In chapter 13 the Lord speaks of "part with me", part with Him where He went. That is the thought in all the gospels. What thought else could He have had but to make God known, so that they might get near to God?
Now, beloved friends, I want to touch upon the Lord's present activity for us, His service and ministry. Turn for a moment to @Hebrews 7, "such an high priest became us"; and then to chapter 8, He "is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle"; then verse 6, he hath "obtained a more excellent ministry". Now, there is one thing a believer can be said to have literally, that is, the forgiveness of sins in the witness of the Spirit. A great deal more, I know, but I am prepared to allow that everyone can have forgiveness of sins in the witness of the Spirit: "being justified" -- a purged conscience. But then, what is qualifying you for God's service? I will tell you, what answers to it is what we find in chapter 8, "A
{537}
minister ... of the true tabernacle". I take it the true tabernacle was pitched on the day of Pentecost. The Lord pitched it, and man had no hand in it whatever; it was the work of the Lord, and the Spirit sealed it by His presence.
Now I venture to say that the holy places are to be found in this tabernacle. There it is that God dwells and walks, and He has got a ministry there among the saints -- they are all going to be offered up to God -- but the ministry goes on with that end in view. In this chapter we get "a better covenant". Did you ever consider what that covenant was? It is now a faultless covenant. It is Christ! Two things made up the covenant: (1) the law written in the heart, that was true of Christ. (2) Then God shall be known in mercy and Christ was very well known in that way.
The one great thing in His ministry for us now is to conform us to Himself, to qualify us to serve God. "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one". The activity of His ministry indicates divine teaching, so the details of the law come out in the love of God and love to the neighbour. The righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled. God is going to be glorified in us, and to all of us God should be known in His righteousness and in His mercy in redemption. God is known by the rights of mercy.
The more we know God as expressed in the death of Christ, "the cup of blessing", the more really qualified we are for His service. We are the subjects of mercy looking for the mercy of God. Christ has His own great place, but He took part with us that He might identify us with Himself where He is as the true Aaron in God's rights of mercy. Christ brings us into His presence in entire accordance with Himself. The result will come out: all the vessels suitable for His holy use. The vessels are all real
{538}
believers, and all His ministry is to conform us in mind and spirit to Himself. The result will come out when He will present the church "to himself a glorious church". It will then be entirely according to Himself.
Aaron's was a very poor ministry. It is for us to present Christ as we get practically conformed to Him. When we come together in assembly it is to bring the holiest with us, morally qualified for the service of God, and this comes to pass in greater appreciation of Christ, to bring a little of His sunshine with us, whereas the tendency is to get back to the forms of the first tabernacle and to expect a service prepared for us. This is a very poor kind of thing, and it would be better to give it all up than to continue such a thing. We want to come to what is true, and the effect of His ministry is to qualify us for what is true.
May Christ be more appreciated by us! Everything in Christ is true and pure, and He acts in the rights of mercy. All is secured in Him and in accord with His mind, and if we are in accord with Him we shall be so with one another.
NOTE ON 2 CORINTHIANS 5
As to the manifestation of verse 10 it seems to refer to believers, as also in @Romans 14, "So then every one of us", though we have other scriptures as to all being judged. His thought is that it will be a very speedy matter and that its purport is to bring each one in perfect agreement with the Lord's estimate of our pathway; all one's life would pass before one in a moment of time as a drowning man is said to review his whole life as he goes under water. So
{539}
it will all be seen in the light of the Lord and His estimate of it, got before the kingdom. It was this then that acted upon the apostle, and knowing the terror of the Lord he persuaded men.
The bottom is as it were reached here (verse 14), all were proved dead since One had to die for all; but then there are those who live, who share in the risen life of Christ: for He is the only Man actually risen, and that being the case we should know what it is to live unto Him who died for us and rose again; therefore we now know no one after the flesh. Mary would have known Christ after the flesh, but was stopped by the words, "Touch me not". New creation is connected with resurrection, not necessarily ascension! The old order has passed away, the new order has begun, and in that sphere all things are of God, who has reconciled us.
He has on His side removed (by death) every atom of that which made a distance between Him and us; and now the word of reconciliation was given to the apostles, and its practical bearing on us is that we too should be in accord with God's mind as to the extinction of ourselves and all being of Himself. That seems to me to be a great thought in reconciliation -- that our minds should be reconciled to God's mind, to His thought as to Christ; He has but Christ before Him. It is an eminently sanctifying thought because the allowance of any little atom of the "first man", that which God has condemned, will not do. That would show we are not in full union with the mind of God, since He condemned it in the death of Christ.
{540}
THE TWO COVENANTS
@2 Corinthians 3: 6; @1 John 4: 9 - 19
We have two covenants spoken of which only become valid in death. A covenant is an instrument which makes known God's disposition, and it becomes valid by death. The first covenant only became valid by death -- the blood of calves and goats. The new covenant is established in the death of Christ, the death of the Testator, so the disposition of God toward us is shown out. The new covenant becomes thus a means of teaching the disposition of God toward us. There is a great contrast between the two covenants: in the first, man after the flesh was recognised and God was hid. In the second, man after the flesh was annulled and God was revealed. In @2 Corinthians 3 the apostle speaks a good deal about the veil.
Moses could not use plainness of speech, and he had to put a veil on his face; the apostle did not -- he used great plainness of speech. God is no longer veiled or hid. The allusion as to "Lord" is more or less in reference to Jehovah of the Old Testament, so you must consider it as equal to *God* -- not of the letter, but of the Spirit, and the Lord is that Spirit; it is not now that we want to be taken up with the terms of the new covenant, we want to get the spirit of it. If you have not the spirit of the truth, the letter would not be much use to you.
The Lord is that Spirit, the nature of God gives character to the new covenant; it is God who commends His love toward us; His disposition toward us is now shown out. That is the *spirit* of the new covenant and that is what the apostle laboured to present: "who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit". It is the death of Christ which shows out God's
{541}
love and His disposition towards us, so if you want to know really what the new covenant is you would look at the death of Christ, not only to @Hebrews 8.
In @1 John 4 you have brought out what it is to live in the presence of the love of God. If the believer goes into the world, he is not living in the presence of the love of God. @1 John 4 has no reference to us as to heaven, but as to our life down here. The children of God are looked at in this chapter as in three positions. Firstly, verse 9, we were in *death*; secondly, verse 16, in the believer's *pathway*; thirdly, in verse 17, in the day of *judgment*.
The love of God annuls death really; death could not stand in the presence of the Lord, who was the expression of God. Your mind must be in accord with the death of Christ. So the apostle could say, "I am crucified with Christ"; his mind was in accord with the death of Christ, and again, "They that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts": you are in accord with the death of Christ, and you cannot indulge the flesh in the presence of the love of God, and you live by the Spirit, and by the Spirit the love of God is shed abroad in your heart; it is the Spirit that makes that love good in *your heart*; the death of Christ *showed it*, but the Spirit sheds that love in the heart.
"In this was manifested the love of God" -- all began with God; when we were dead we were to live by the Son of God, so the apostle says, "I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me" -- that we might live by Him. Then there is the second point: "we have known and believed the love that God hath to us" -- this is present and is in the believer's pathway here. God has His eye upon us, and all that is in our hearts has to be brought out in the way of discipline; as in Israel, all that is in our hearts has to be brought out, but it is that He may do us good at our latter
{542}
end. *God* knew all from the beginning, but He wants *us* to find it out, and He passes us through discipline that *we* may find out all that is in our hearts.
Then, thirdly, there is the question of the day of judgment. All will come under review at the day of judgment, but love is made perfect with us that we may have boldness then. There is no *death* in the passage -- death has no power in the presence of the love of God. You can even have boldness in the day of judgment; all has reference to the present -- "We love him, because he first loved us"; all began with God.
The new covenant really is extremely *simple*; it is a covenant that is pervaded by the love of God. It is man after the flesh annulled and God revealed. If saints are hankering after the world it *is* difficult, but not if a saint really desires to go on.
{543}
FOUR READINGS ON HEBREWS (1)
@Hebrews 1: 1 - 14; @Hebrews 2: 1 - 18
F.E.R. The whole epistle to the Hebrews is built up on the two @Psalm 2 and @Psalm 110. Other psalms are quoted in regard to Christ Himself, but in general the epistle is built up on these two. Christ is the Son of God, and He is exalted to the right hand of God, and He is Priest there. Chapters 1 and 2 are more built up on @Psalm 110. We get first in this epistle that the throne of God is established in a Man at the right hand of God. "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom"; then, in chapter 2, He is the centre of a company in rejection.
Ques. Will not the quotation from chapter 1 be said to Him in the world to come?
F.E.R. It is said to Christ now. It is not manifest, but He has the name, and the renown. He is made better than the angels. The name is inherited. It is embodied now, and identified with the glorified Man. What is not yet displayed in any public way is true to us now. It is important to see that the throne of God is established now in a Man; God is working now in regard to the world to come. Things are provisional for the moment, but God is working all in view of the world to come.
Ques. What is the object of this epistle?
F.E.R. It is to make manifest the present position of things connected with Christ at the right hand of God, and what He is doing now upon earth. In order to understand what God is bringing to pass on earth it is necessary that you should see what is established in heaven. Eventually the earth will be governed by what prevails in heaven.
{544}
Rem. You get that in Revelation. What is transpiring in heaven is given, so that you may understand what is going to take place on earth.
F.E.R. What is established in heaven comes to us now in the way of light, so that we may walk in the light of it. God is bringing many sons to glory, and the display of what is established really waits for that. The Holy Spirit has come down meanwhile to report the glory of Christ.
Ques. Is it the same as beholding the glory of the Lord?
F.E.R. Pretty much the same. He is appointed Heir of all things. He hath obtained a more excellent name than angels. You get His glory in that way. Christ, not angels, is the Head of all things. Angels could not put things on the ground of redemption. It is the Son of man who puts all on that basis; the throne is based on that. There are all these quotations, and prophecies, but all are established and centre in Christ now. They are not prophetic, but they have their accomplishment in Christ -- the One in whom God now speaks. We want to know the greatness of the Speaker. The Son is the One in whom God is speaking, and not only to Hebrews.
Chapter 1 is brought in that we may know the greatness of the Speaker. God has been revealed, and so, too, is all His mind in regard of man; that is what has come out now in the Son. Our part is to apprehend the direct way in which God is speaking. It is testimony, but in view of display, and it is by the Son. It is a time of testimony, but the testimony is quite peculiar; it is "in Son" that God speaks. It is a last word, for it is a testimony antecedent to display. "We see not yet all things put under him. But we see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour". All is established in a Man at the right hand of God; the throne is established there;
{545}
but meanwhile, before it is displayed, He has a word -- a word as to what is to be displayed.
The time is peculiar; the important point is to apprehend the present position of things. The casting-off of the Jew is the reconciling of the world. That is true now provisionally -- it is not displayed yet, but Christ is Head of every man, and on the part of God in regard to Christ the world is taken up in the way of reconciliation. That is the position of things; Christ is Head of every man; God has seen fit to take up the world in that way.
Ques. What will bring that provisional state of things to an end?
F.E.R. When antichrist comes in, then God will interfere. The present position of things is that the world is on the ground of reconciliation. For the time being the gentile is grafted into the olive tree; the blessing of Abraham has come to the gentiles in Christ Jesus. The fact that Christ has gone to the right hand of God has brought about a change in the position of the world in regard to God. It is now on the ground of reconciliation, that is, a provisional state of things; it is not final. Nothing could be final until the coming of the Lord. While Christ is hid, all must be provisional. It is a time of testimony, and things are not displayed; but when they are displayed, all will be final, because things will have come to an issue.
In connection with Christ, and the place of Christ at the right hand of God, you get the reconciling of the world. It is not that the state of the world is changed, but that, on the ground of accomplished redemption and Christ exalted to the right hand of God, as a consequence the attitude of God is altered. As far as God is concerned, it is presented to man; if man receives the testimony, then he receives the reconciliation, and then it can be said, "you ... hath he reconciled". The word of reconciliation could
{546}
not go forth unless there was reconciliation there. Christ has been able to take up a certain position in regard to men, having borne the liabilities of men, and so God has been able to take up that attitude in regard to the world. If men do not accept Christ as Head, they declare themselves defiant of God, and of Christ. Whatever be the attitude of God in regard to man, it is equally true that men are declaring their attitude in regard to God and Christ.
Ques. "That the world through him might be saved"?
F.E.R. Had Christ not come in, there would be nothing but wreck and ruin for it. Sometimes 'world' in Scripture refers to the system around, while sometimes it is used as referring to the people. "God so loved the world", that is the people; "Now is the judgment of this world" -- that is in the sense of a system. "The whole world lies in the wicked one" -- that is the *system*; but the reconciling of the *world* has reference to men. The word of reconciliation is in view of bringing man into it. People have to get into the light of the grace and present position of Christ. All is dependent upon one Man, and the relation of that one Man to all men.
It is important to see the bearing, not only of what Christ has effected, but the consequence of what He has effected in the place He now occupies at the right hand of God. In the holiest you get an apprehension of the mystery of Christ; it is where the secret is learnt. The Spirit of God presses on the Hebrews to hear the word spoken on account of the greatness of the Speaker in contrast to prophets and angels. The Speaker is on the line of prophets; it comes as testimony.
We are going on to the rest of God, but on the way certain privileges are open to us. The calling, the heavenly calling, is to reach Christ in glory. We
{547}
do not reach glory until Christ comes, but meantime there are certain privileges, such as entrance into the holiest. Divine supremacy is established in Christ -- in a Man at the right hand of God. Our privilege is to enter the holiest. You never can learn the divine resources of the love of God, unless you go in and learn the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat. We draw nigh to God to learn the resources of God -- the wisdom by which God accomplishes all the purposes of His love.
The love of God shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit given to us, is the beginning of it; but then in drawing nigh you find all the recesses of that heart. The more you know the resources of divine love, the more able you will be to preach; but you have to preach the preaching that He bids you, and that is what you are told to preach. You are not told to preach all that is in Scripture, but you have to preach and testify what you are commanded. The preaching should be confined to what the Lord commissioned.
Ques. What is the "great salvation" in chapter 2?
F.E.R. Salvation is what is inherent in Christ Jesus. You find salvation in Christ, not in Adam. People want to get assurance of salvation where they are, without changing their ground; whereas God's way is that it lies in the transfer from Adam to Christ. "In Christ Jesus" is another system. The great point is to come to the reality of salvation. We should not be content with the faith of things, but to get the *reality* of them. Faith gives the light, but the Spirit gives the reality. All for us is realised in the power of the Spirit; but more than that, what the Spirit is bent upon is the building up of a Man -- Christ -- in the believer, and everything is realised in that inward man. Salvation practically lies in that Man; the secret lies in the Man whom the Spirit forms in us. The Spirit of God is really building
{548}
up a man in every one of us. We never can get salvation in the absolute sense save by the Lord; we look for the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour.
Ques. "By grace ye are saved"?
F.E.R. That is in contrast with their being quickened together with Him. They were in the life of Christ, and hence he could say of them, "by grace ye are saved". The first blush of salvation to anyone is when he comes into the place of Christ's association, and to the renewal of the Holy Spirit. It is like Noah, who stood on the other side of the waters of the flood, on a new regenerate earth. As to us, we realise it in being brought into Christ's circle. In order to realise salvation people want to leave all the religious worldly systems. These systems are really part of the world; you are saved out of the system where the enemy can work and affect people.
Association is a great secret, so you must not leave out the renewing of the Holy Spirit as well as the washing of regeneration. They had come out into a clean place, where things are according to the Spirit of God. God will not connect salvation with this world; you have to come out of it, and to get into a clean place where the Spirit of God is; there salvation is found. Hereafter it will be found in the coming of the Lord, just as Noah found it when he came on to a regenerate earth. In the Holy Spirit we do actually get the regeneration, but not of course in an outward public way.
{549}
FOUR READINGS ON HEBREWS (2)
@Hebrews 3: 1 - 19; @Hebrews 4: 1 - 16
Ques. What is the thought of the heavenly calling?
F.E.R. That God is speaking from heaven; the calling is from heaven. In Christ in heaven is the perfect setting forth of God's mind in regard to man. No one enters into the thought of God in regard of man save in the apprehension of Christ in glory. When this is apprehended, then heaven really becomes the hope. God is bringing many sons to glory, but the calling on the part of God is really the testimony of Christ in heaven; that, in the very nature of it, involves companionship with Christ. It is equivalent to what you get in @Romans 8, that we should be "conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren". That is the thought of God in regard of Christ. Israel will come into their original calling by and by.
Ques. Do you not distinguish between the calling here when profession is included, and what you get in @Romans 8, which is purpose?
F.E.R. No, I do not; the calling is the same.
Ques. How is the Priest connected with the calling?
F.E.R. The Priest is essential, and He must be at the height of the calling. The point is, that in Christ in heaven you get the perfect setting forth of the calling. The Priest has gone in, but we have not gone in yet. The mind of God is set forth in the Apostle (Christ), but the Priest is the pattern of what answers to the mind of God. The Apostle sets forth the covenant; by Him all the truth came out. Chapter 1 has nothing to do with the calling; it is the setting forth of what is true on the part of God; it sets forth largely the throne. The throne of God is established in a Man, so that it can be displayed; and this is what will constitute the world to come.
{550}
God will no longer be hid behind providences. Christ is hid at the right hand of God provisionally, and the throne awaits the moment of display.
All that we get in chapter 1 is the power and supremacy of God, and all that is set forth on the part of God. In chapter 2 you get the other side: it is Christ Head over all things, so that all should take its character from Him. Chapter 1 is that the throne is established in a Man, who has accomplished redemption, and is about to be displayed. Then we get in chapter 2 Christ as Head over all things, and that involves a universe. He is Son of man, and the Leader of our salvation. But that brings in the thought of priesthood, because He is compelled to be Priest until we are in. Then in chapter 3 He is Son over God's house, and He is faithful; He will help us in weakness, but He will not tolerate will. In chapter 5 it is confirmed; He is called of God, and He learned obedience by the things He suffered, and so He has become the Author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him. You must be in accord with Christ.
Ques. What is our "confession"? Is it the consequence of apprehending our calling?
F.E.R. Yes, it is.
Ques. What is the connection between the house and the calling?
F.E.R. Well, God's house is composed of His sons, and Christ has the place of Son over God's house. The object of the house is that we may come under the teaching and influence of God. As in regard to my house; if I were a perfect father, I should not tolerate will in my children, although I should help them in their weakness. The point is that in God's house there should be God's will only, and yet that there should be help in regard of infirmity.
{551}
Ques. What is the "day of temptation"?
F.E.R. The present is the time of testing. We are all tested as to fidelity; so you get "If ye continue in the faith", @Colossians 1: 23. We are God's house "if" (@Hebrews 3: 6) we are Christ's companions "if" (@Hebrews 3: 14) -- it is clearly a time of testing. People fail to apprehend how very near "the world to come" is. It is not much in view. The apostle says the "world to come, *whereof we speak*", @Hebrews 2: 5. Having it so little before us is a weakness with all of us. The first two chapters lay down the position. The effect of not apprehending the world to come is to go on with the present world, and to connect Christ and saints with the existing order of things. If the order of things here has failed, and God's Son became Man, He does not become a patch on the old, but He becomes the beginning of an entirely new order of things. In chapter 2 Christ is on our side; He is Son of Man set over the work of God's hands. All will take character from the Son of man. Then you get God bringing many sons to glory, and the Sanctifier and the sanctified are all of one.
The great gain of God's house is, that we may come under the influence of it, as an orphan might come into a well-ordered house.
We have in chapter 1 all the preparation for the world to come; the throne of God established in a Man, and then the One in whom all is to be gathered up. We can enter into the light of it now. The "world to come" is a necessity; if you get an intelligent thought of Christ, you find that He will be displayed then. People understand the throne and the lordship of Christ, but they do not understand Christ as Head. He is the beginning of a new order, in which everything takes its character from Him. The present world has become so artificial that it is difficult to say what it takes character from, for it
{552}
has no head; but in the world to come there will be a Head capable of subduing all to Himself, and of giving character to all. Lordship and authority will come in to subdue what is lawless, but that is secondary. He subdues evil in order to come in and to give character to all. Power and authority is needful if evil be there. The world to come could not be set forth until lawlessness headed up in antichrist is put down. The kingdom eventually will be given up; it is a means to an end. The kingdom is established so that all that is of God may thrive; the power and authority in that way holds evil in check. It is a great thing to be "strong in the Lord", then you are prepared to combat evil.
Ques. Will there be headship in the eternal state?
F.E.R. I cannot see how it can be otherwise: there will be no need of the kingdom, but all that of which Christ is Head must be maintained by the Head. Christ will give character to all, in all that He is. Imagine a universe that is characterised by meekness and lowliness of heart! Christ was meek and lowly, and the world to come will take character from Him.
The confession of Christ as Lord is to keep you from the power of evil. The day of temptation is still continued. We tempt God by the exercise of our will. Israel tempted God by their lust; they would not go forward to the land, and they would go back in heart to Egypt. We are liable to the same; it is a question even in regard of those in fellowship, will they go forward or not? We are recognised as being God's house, on the ground of holding fast -- it is put here in that way.
Ques. "We which have believed do enter into rest"?
F.E.R. Well, God has *His* rest, and we can enter into His rest. God has abounded in all grace to us, having made known to us the mystery of His will, to
{553}
head up all things in Christ, and in that sense we can enter into rest. The strict application is to the future, but there is the sense in which we do enter into rest; it all goes on the principle expressed in the familiar verse:
<blockquote>"O love supreme and bright, <br>Good to the feeblest heart. <br>That gives us now as heav'nly light <br>What soon shall be our part!" </blockquote>
The bulk of people have no idea of what God's rest is. God is entitled to rest; He rested from all His works. We have only thought that the rest of God was marred by the fall of man, but God will yet be complacent with the work of His hands. In becoming Man, the Son of God has entered the bounds of God's creation. He takes up all that creation, and it is in His taking up all, and all gathered up in Him, that God can be complacent with the work of His hands. We can be in the light now of all that God has secured for Himself in Christ. We can enter into what is behind the veil. I think if you enter the holiest you will touch the rest of God, at least you will touch the *secret* of His rest. The rest of God I admit is still future as to the display. Christ will come in again as "the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God". God will rest when all is in accord with His love.
In the epistle to the Hebrews everything is living, and therefore departure is departure from the living God. The force of the expression the "living God", could not have been understood until Christ came in. The beginning of it is the *Son* of the living God; then you get the *Spirit* of the living God, and the *church* of the living God. If God is the living God, then all that is to come in contact with Him must be living. So we are to purge ourselves from dead works.
{554}
There is the danger, contemplated here, of becoming apostates. The company is looked at as in the profession; but if they turn away, they prove they are neither the house of God nor companions of Christ. Reconciliation is what brings in the rest of God; it is in the fact of all being reconciled in Christ -- all brought into divine complacency -- that God can rest. We have to take into account what comes out in chapter 3, Christ is faithful. Moses was faithful in God's house; he did not deviate, he did not supplement divine directions. Now Christ is Son over God's house, and He is faithful; His faithfulness is that He came here altogether for the will of God, and therefore He will not tolerate our wills. He is faithful. He cannot deny Himself, even if we are not faithful; Christ will not compromise; He will not accommodate Himself to our wills. The ways of believers often indicate an idea that Christ will accommodate Himself to them; their ways express it practically. Saints are often found pursuing some object in the world, and they think that Christ will accommodate Himself to them. No; He will "abide faithful"; He will not tolerate what is not according to God.
Righteousness and faithfulness are intimately connected. "Righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins". If you pursue a purpose here which is not according to Christ, He will not accommodate Himself to you, and then there is danger of your turning away.
The fidelity of Christ is to keep our hearts in the light of His own things; and therefore He sets Himself against all that tends to obscure our vision. His intercession is *for* us, but against what diverts us from Him.
Ques. Does it suppose that those who fall are real believers?
{555}
F.E.R. Oh, no. Real believers do not fall in the wilderness; they may fail to enter into the good of the land now, but the fidelity of Christ will eventually bring them in. Christ searches us now by the word of God. We have to learn to find out our motives; they have to be discovered to us; and the word of God comes in to discover them to us. Even when motives are not all bad, they are often mixed. We want the eye "single", and not to be moved by mixed motives: then the whole body will be full of light.
It is a very great thing for our souls to get into the light of what God has established in Christ, and to remember that being in God's house we have to do with One who is faithful; it seems to me a poor thing to be unfaithful to One who is faithful. "When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee", @Proverbs 2: 10, 11.
The apostle prayed that saints might know the expanse of divine glory, the breadth and length and depth and height of all that centres in Christ. Christ is faithful, but at the same time He is a merciful High Priest -- it is very beautiful; "we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities". Both His mercifulness and His faithfulness make Him attractive to us. He is "a merciful and faithful high priest". Every right-minded person would value the faithfulness of Christ.
Ques. Does "consider" (chapter 3: 1) mean meditate?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; the word of God is what searches.
Rem. It is like @Psalm 139, "Search me, O God".
F.E.R. We get diverted, even when we desire to pursue what is right, and therefore if right-minded we would value His faithfulness. The searching supposes the possibility of will being at work; and if so you want that made manifest. We do not want the
{556}
Priest for that. Will at work needs detecting; wilful people do not come to the "throne of grace".
Ques. What is the difference between mercy and grace?
F.E.R. Mercy is that everything is taken into consideration, circumstances and everything; and at the same time you get grace to support you. People make a mistake, and think that if they supplicate God in a difficulty He will come in immediately. That may not be His way, but "the end of the Lord ... is very pitiful, and of tender mercy". We have to wait for the end, and meanwhile He will give grace.
{557}
FOUR READINGS ON HEBREWS (3)
@Hebrews 5: 1 - 14; @Hebrews 6: 1 - 20
F.E.R. Hebrews is not like a gospel to the gentiles, it is the final appeal to those who were in relation to God as His people. It is like a last word, and has a peculiar character in that way. The great subject of the epistle is that of approach to God; the epistle is addressed to any who would hear. God has spoken to us in these last days in His Son, so you get, "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh". (Chapter 12: 25.) The Speaker is entirely exceptional. He was not like a prophet; as the Apostle all the power and authority of God are presented in Him.
Ques. Does the epistle contemplate any who are not professed believers?
F.E.R. No; it contemplates those who have heard the word. In James they are taken up on the ground of faith in Christ. Here they are supposed to have fled for refuge to the hope set before them, and to be partakers of the heavenly calling. God had nothing to say to the gentiles by the prophets in a general way, but to Israel. Now He speaks in the Son. It all goes on that line. In chapters 1 and 2 we get the Apostle and the High Priest. As the former, He represents God manward; as the latter, He represents man Godward. We have to apprehend both in Christ.
In chapter 1 Christ represents all the power and authority of God, the throne of God is there, but in chapter 2 we see Jesus crowned with glory and honour. God took the man most distinguished next to Moses, that is, Aaron, to represent the people Godward. Christ is representative Godward of those who have listened to the word. We have to "consider
{558}
the Apostle and High Priest of our profession". There are points of similarity, but also of contrast, between Christ and Aaron. It is very important to get Christ into view as the Apostle and High Priest: Consider him! If you do not appreciate the Apostle and Priest, you cannot appreciate the position. The Apostle brings the world to come into view, and the Priest shows the character of approach to God.
Rem. The world to come is in view, and we can draw nigh.
F.E.R. Yes; that is it. It is involved in the Apostle and High Priest. In the Apostle the throne of God is established, and therefore you get the world to come brought into view; and the High Priest is the One who is crowned with glory and honour, and the way of approach is open. All is established, and all is morally prepared for the world to come. Christ has made purification of our sins, and has sat down at the right hand, and then you get the psalms fulfilled, "Thou art my Son", @Psalm 2: 7. "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever", @Psalm 45: 6. "Thou art the same", @Psalm 102: 27. All that brings the world to come into view. The world to come is when the government and power and authority of God is displayed; then all providence comes to an end, and God is displayed publicly. When God comes out, He puts aside the veil of providences and displays Himself in public government. That could only be in a Man, but then the Man is there. Morally the world to come is there because Christ is there.
The great thing is to have your attention fixed on Christ, and not simply on Christ personally, but Christ officially. Often pious people have Christ personally before them, and that is right so far; there is a great deal of real piety connected with it, but it is a great point also to apprehend Christ officially.
Ques. What about the Holy Spirit speaking? (Chapter 3: 7).
{559}
F.E.R. If you consider the Apostle and High Priest, then the next point is the house of God, over which Christ is Son, and the Holy Spirit speaks there. The Spirit is here consequent upon Christ being Son over God's house, and to the end that the history of Israel may not be repeated. We come into the place of Israel on the earth; they were the people in relation with God. The flesh has been set aside in the death of Christ. Hence you get the house of God and the Holy Spirit here, and therefore the flesh must be set aside in us, so that the history of Israel may not be repeated in us.
Circumcision is the seal of righteousness; that is a first principle; the putting off the body of the flesh is circumcision. I very much doubt a person's righteousness if there is not the putting off the body of the flesh. Circumcision is by the Spirit. The disposition of the natural mind would be to say, I am justified, and that is enough. I say I admit it, but you must have the seal, and the seal is circumcision; and if you have not the seal, I begin to doubt your righteousness.
Ques. What is a seal?
F.E.R. It is a witness, a proof on the part of God. A man must have the seal, that is a first principle. In chapter 3 we have to consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession. The history of Israel will not be repeated. If circumcision is not accepted, and the flesh not refused, you can never think of approach to God. If it is accepted, then the next point in chapters 5, 6 and 7 is that you must be in accord with the Priest. The first principle of connection with the High Priest, as a question of approach to God, is that you obey Him. Chapter 5 gives the qualifications of the High Priest. He did not glorify Himself to be called a High Priest, and He learned obedience. The next step is to be brought into moral accord with the
{560}
High Priest, and the first principle in that is that we obey Him.
We are not priests by calling, but by being kindred to Christ. The sons of Aaron came into priesthood because they were kindred to Aaron. We have to prove our genealogy, and our genealogy is proved by our having His Spirit. Priesthood in christendom is a perfectly foolish thing; it is a farce. A man is made a priest by the hands of a bishop being laid on him; the question of kindred is not raised. They would repudiate any link with Aaron, and they do not think of Christ.
Ques. What is it to be "made perfect"?
F.E.R. It is not used in a moral sense. Christ goes through the path and takes things up graciously for us, and is qualified in that way to be Priest for us. We have to be in accord with Him, and so we have to obey Him. He took up a certain path in view of priesthood, and now He has become "the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him". We have in that way to be in accord with Him. We get His call on the part of God (verse 5) and in verse 8 we get His qualification.
Ques. What is the difference between the offering Priest and the High Priest?
F.E.R. He was offering Priest in death. He is High Priest at the right hand of God. The High Priest never offered a sacrifice except on the day of atonement. It is when Christ was called to sit at the right hand that He was saluted as High Priest. The great point for which the High Priest is brought in is to determine our approach to God. Approach to God is determined by the High Priest. In chapter 7 you get the introduction of a "better hope" by which we draw nigh to God. Priesthood, in our case, hangs largely on sonship. In Hebrews God is bringing many sons to glory.
We are called to glory so that we may come out with glory. We go in, but it is that we may come out glorious as the 'holy city'. The foundation of going into the holiest is glory. The holiest is moral.
Ques. What is "bringing many sons unto glory"?
{561}
F.E.R. Glory is the result. "Rejoice in hope of the glory of God" is going in; but it is that we may come out. The church comes out with the glory of God, Christ takes us right in. "I will come again, and receive you unto myself". It is an important point that Christ takes us right in. God is bringing many sons to glory. He is like the Great Chamberlain, as it were. It is part of our glory to be taken in. Glory is the climax; and it is that Christ comes and presents us before the Father as His companions.
The great point in the introduction of the high priesthood of Christ is in connection with the drawing nigh to God. He does sympathise and help us in our infirmities, but the great point is that we may be in accord with the Priest, so that we may draw nigh. The first point in which we are to be in accord with Him is to obey Him. He learned to obey, and we obey. We get it in @John 15. Christ kept His Father's commandments and abode in His love; and we are to keep Christ's commandments, and so abide in His love. The first feature, therefore, is obedience. We obey as He obeyed. The apostle could say, "as ye have always obeyed", @Philippians 2: 12.
We want to be in accord with Christ. He kept His Father's commandments, and surely it is well that we should be in accord with Him, and keep His commandments. I know no commandment but Christ; He is commandment to me. A mother might say to her child, I am a commandment to you, if you want to be in accord with me. The work of the Spirit of God is so to attach you to Christ that every movement may be His commandment to you:
{562}
"to me to live is Christ". He says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments". Thus I accept the truth of obedience because Christ obeyed. He kept His Father's commandments. We are sanctified to the obedience of Jesus Christ.
Ques. How do you understand "author of eternal salvation"?
F.E.R. It is a contrast to temporal deliverance which Israel had. We are brought into "eternal salvation" that we may serve God without fear. In chapter 6 the great point is that the period of law has become blank, and we have to get back into line with the fathers. "That ye be ... followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises". You have to get away from legality. We had obedience in chapter 5. In chapter 6 it is a question of faith and patience. It is all in view of building up the soul, and you are not to be "slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises". The whole period of law had forwarded nothing. There is the building up a man, the apostle would not have them babes, but that their senses should be exercised to discern good and evil. We are to go on to perfection. Young children do not discern evil. I have suffered from two defects: one was lack of moral training, and education. The discernment of good and evil is largely a question of moral training.
The apostle is bent, in chapters 5 and 6, on building up a moral being in order that he may be in accord with the High Priest, and in chapter 7 that we may draw nigh to God. If people go on all the week without any thought of obedience, or faith, or patience, and then come on Lord's day morning with the thought of drawing nigh to God, it is a moral impossibility. We have taken up things formally, instead of morally. It is not a question of giving lectures, or expositions; the great point is to
{563}
get to the moral intent of the Spirit of God. The real power lies in the work of the Spirit in souls. The Hebrews needed to be taught first principles; they needed milk instead of solid food. If you have a dull audience, you cannot bring things out. An unsympathetic audience hinders a speaker.
Ques. How does hope enter within the veil?
F.E.R. What had come out from heaven was a report by the Holy Spirit, and the report had been taken up, so there was a hope in heaven when all failed on earth. What it meant on their part was glory. The wonderful thing is this: when Israel rejected Christ, it came to light that God had other purposes to fulfil, but God opened the door to Israel on that ground, and the remnant became the church -- all within the veil. If you attempt to make it anything on earth, you have falsified it. "Within the veil" refers more to the fact of Christ being hid.
Ques. Veil of providence?
F.E.R. All that men can see are God's providences, but all that God has to give lies behind.
Ques. The report is what is behind?
F.E.R. Yes; but then that requires faith.
{564}
FOUR READINGS ON HEBREWS (4)
@Hebrews 7: 1 - 28
F.E.R. The epistle proper begins in this chapter; the previous chapters are introductory and bring into view the great principles of the world to come. Chapter 1 is the throne of God established in a Man; in chapter 2 we get the Head under whom all things are to be put; then in chapter 3 we get the house of God, over which He is as Son. In chapters 4, 5 and 6 we get the state of those to whom the epistle is spoken. In chapter 7 priesthood proper begins.
It is most important to see the relation of the church to the world to come; we get the object of entering in, and the great point is to enter in, so that we may be instructed in the mystery of Christ. No one can enter into the holiest without being in accord with Christ. The Melchisedec priesthood was first, not the Aaronic, and Christ comes in, in that connection, "a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec". That order of priesthood would not fit in with the law, and the law would not fit in with that order of priesthood.
The great subject of the epistle is that of approach to God. A new system involves a new priest. If another priest is brought in, it means another system. Christ as Priest brings in the day of the Spirit -- the law came in under the Aaronic priesthood; but the Spirit is given in connection with the Melchisedec priesthood, and it is by the Spirit we draw nigh to God. The "better hope" comes in in connection with Christ, but we have no link with Christ as Priest, save by the Spirit. You do not get the new covenant until chapter 8.
The point in chapter 7 is that the Priest determines the manner of approach to God. No one
{565}
under the law could approach beyond Aaron, and approach to God now takes its character from Christ, who is Priest after the order of Melchisedec. The One who is made Priest is the One to whom God said, "Thou art my Son". Then again at the end of this chapter we read, "... maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore". There was a thought of approach under the Aaronic priesthood, but it was very limited. They went into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of God. The brazen altar was God's approach to the people, but it was no question of their approach to God. The law was only a shadow of good things to come, but though there was undoubtedly under the law the thought of approach to God, it was all ceremonial, not moral. The book of Leviticus is occupied with the subject of approach; the approach was accompanied by a great many difficulties, but the thought was there; for the law had a shadow of better things, but made nothing perfect.
The "better hope" is connected with the place Christ has taken up on high. Christ has taken up a place above, and God is bringing many sons to glory, and so we have a "better hope".
Ques. Why a "better hope"?
F.E.R. "Better" is an expression characteristic of Hebrews. We get better promises, a better covenant, and so on. It is all *better* -- it is a comparative idea and it is in contrast to something else. If you get approach you get perfection. Perfection is brought in because approach is brought in. The hope is, I believe, Christ in heaven. The Hebrews had fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before them. Christ in glory is the full expression of God's mind in regard to every man. When the fulness of time was come, God sent forth His Son. We are to hold fast the confession of the hope. It is the disposition of all
{566}
of us to give up the hope. For the saint everything is bound up in Christ -- Christ is our hope; we are looking for Christ to come in, and for all that is consequent upon this. Christ is the Centre, and Beginning, and Head of another system. You get the thought even at the end of the Old Testament: "shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings?" @Malachi 4: 2. But then there is a great system connected with the Sun of righteousness. The saint comes into the shining of Christ, and so Christ is the hope of the believer.
Melchisedec is King of righteousness and King of peace. There are two things essential to the world to come: that is, the King and the Priest. In the time of David you get the king, and Zadok the priest. In the latter day the covenant is to be between both the King and the Priest. In the past God took great care to keep the king and priest separate and distinct; they could not be combined until Christ came in. Then you get the counsel of peace between them both, and He shall sit a Priest upon His throne, and in that way the world to come is brought into view. In the time of Uzziah the king, the priest withstood him when he attempted to offer sacrifice (@2 Chronicles 26: 16 - 21). Christ will be a Priest upon His throne for Israel and the earth. The King is on behalf of God. He represents the power and authority of God, and the Priest is on behalf of man. You must have both for perfection. There must be a point of attachment for man in the establishment of the kingdom. For us the Priest is to carry the attachment of our hearts, and apart from that He is not of much avail to us. It is by the Priest we draw nigh to God. The Priest to us is the One who loved us, and gave Himself for us, and He has gone to the right hand of God to carry our affections there, and it is in that way that we draw nigh to God.
{567}
Ques. Why is "saving" connected here with the Priest?
F.E.R. Because the intercession of the Priest may secure you the arm of the Lord. It is the result of intercession that we get support and succour, and therefore it is not difficult to trace the salvation to the Priest.
Ques. Saved by His life?
F.E.R. I should take it as the Priest. In @John 4 you get the priesthood of Christ. The place which Christ has taken as Man at the right hand of God is connected with His imparting the Spirit. Salvation was connected with the advent of the Spirit; so we get, we are saved "by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour", @Titus 3: 5, 6.
It is proper to a believer to draw nigh to God: "By the which we draw nigh unto God", @Hebrews 7: 19. Drawing nigh to God is dependent upon our state, and our state is formed by the Spirit. The Spirit gives us the appreciation of Christ, and that is the Spirit's work; it is by the appreciation of Christ that we draw nigh to God. Christ is the One who came out to bring us the light of God, and He has gone in as Priest, and as we appreciate Him we draw nigh to God. The thought of drawing nigh to God was in the law which was the "shadow of good things to come", but now we can draw nigh. Christ has entered in as Forerunner, and thus, we draw nigh to God now by the Spirit. It is the knowledge that Christ is going to take us in there that gives us courage and confidence to draw nigh.
It is very important to apprehend that the great point of priesthood is the question of man's approach to God; we draw nigh to God in proportion to our appreciation of the One who has gone in as our Forerunner. It is our appreciation of Christ that
{568}
makes us acceptable to God. God measures every one of us by our appreciation of Christ. Drawing nigh is not a question of the Lord's day morning, it is a question of the habit of a believer's soul; it is individual. Every saint is a son, but to be a priest you must be qualified, and the qualification for drawing nigh now is our appreciation of Christ. The great point here is our entering in now.
Rem. Drawing nigh to God is our enjoyment of the liberty we have with God.
F.E.R. Yes; that is it. We appreciate the One who brought us the light of God, and our appreciation is what makes us agreeable to God, and in virtue of which we draw nigh. If we come together as believers only, we may have a happy meeting, but we should come together as priests; priests are those that draw nigh to God. The idea in the Romish church is that the priests are those who perform the service of God. That is right in a formal way, but we want it in a spiritual way.
Appropriation follows appreciation, and assimilation follows on appropriation. The great point for me is that I have an effectual link with the One who is at the right hand of God, and that link is by the Spirit. The priesthood has been too much limited to the thought of succour and sympathy. Even in the Aaronic priesthood Aaron's proper function was to attend upon the tabernacle; the great function of Christ as priest is to bring us into the sanctuary. Christ would liberate us from every influence and tie that we may be free to serve Him. "Let my son go, that he may serve me". How could we get on unless we have a living link with One on high? Apart from that we drop down to a religion of the world. The truth is, we have received the Spirit, and the Spirit is the link between us and the One who brought the light of God.
{569}
Simeon appreciated Christ; he could have worshipped Him. We have Christ in our arms by the Spirit in a much more real way than Simeon had, and surely we can say, "Lord ... mine eyes have seen thy salvation". We may not wish to depart, as Simeon did, but we would draw nigh to God. I think Simeon wanted to depart because he saw there was rejection here and no present glory. Is not Christ as real to us as He was to Simeon? Simeon had Him in his arms, but we have Him by the Spirit. I like wonderfully the thought of Simeon having the child in his arms.
Christ is the One who came out to make God known to us, and He went into death to make that revelation complete. Now He has gone to the right hand of God, and has sent down the Spirit; and by the Spirit we appreciate Christ, and so draw nigh to God. It affects me to see how little appreciation of Christ there is. When people appreciate things here, and say there is no harm in this and that, it only proves to me that there is little or no appreciation of Christ.
{570}
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE REVELATION IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN AND IN HIS EPISTLES
I think it is of the utmost importance to apprehend the distinction between the revelation in the gospel of John and in his epistles.
In the gospel it is the unfolding of what was true (revealed) in the Son and in the Father amid the darkness of this world, tested by it, but comprehending it not: and yet a silent work going on underneath, drawing souls to the Son.
In the epistles the point is, what is true in Christ and in us -- first manifested in Christ -- now that redemption is accomplished and we are in the light as God is in the light. The Son is the source of it, and we have it in having Him.
I would add that eternal life is not what Christ took in becoming man (being made of a woman), but what He brought into manhood -- the living bread come down from heaven. At the same time in the epistles the truth of His Person as divine is most jealously guarded.
{571}
BAPTISM AND THE LORD'S SUPPER
@Romans 6: 1 - 4; @1 Corinthians 10: 15 - 17
Ques. It speaks here of baptism being unto death, is that the utmost limit?
F.E.R. Yes; there is no resurrection in it. I think that when we are led on to the true christian place, as dead and risen with Christ, we come back to baptism. In a certain sense, death and resurrection must go together. You are not left in death.
Children are baptised unto death, with the intent that they should walk in newness of life. They are baptised in view of that.
Ques. I suppose you had in your mind the scope and bearing of baptism and the Lord's supper?
F.E.R. I think the two things are not clear in the minds of many. They do not see the difference in import between the two. If I am baptised, I have no say in it. Saying is consenting. A man cannot baptise himself.
There is only one scripture where you get that the individual does something. "Arise, and be baptised, and wash away thy sins", @Acts 22: 16. The individual is looked at there as the consenting party. You must put the responsibility upon the actor. It is not so much responsibility as privilege. If any one had a chance of washing away his sins he would do it. It was his privilege to identify himself with the christian company. The responsibility was with the actor. The command is to the baptiser. It is a commission to some one to baptise.
Ques. Who would you baptise if you baptised adults?
F.E.R. I suppose those who accepted the testimony. I am speaking of what things were in their normal state. Those who were baptised, accepting the testimony, had their place at the Lord's table.
{572}
There was nothing more expected from them. Having received the testimony, and being baptised, they were qualified for the Lord's supper. I have felt the position of brethren here is peculiar. Properly speaking brethren have nothing to do with baptism. What I mean is, we have been called out in the midst of christendom, a baptised community. It is not an assembly matter.
Rem. I see your point. It is no part of the testimony in that way; it has nothing to do with brethren.
F.E.R. Yes; all we have to do with it is to rectify omissions. Sometimes with regard to people coming into communion, the question is raised as to whether they have been baptised, because there are certain parties in christendom where people are not baptised. In that case we have to rectify the omission.
We get the negative side in baptism and the positive side in the Lord's supper. That is, baptism is what we have done with. In the Lord's supper it is not what we have done with, but what we enter into with regard to it.
Ques. You press it on a soul as a privilege if he wants to come to the Lord's table?
F.E.R. Yes; it has been a help to many to see that the responsibility of baptism rests on the baptiser. Many look on it as an act of obedience. It was the general idea amongst ourselves. What lay at the bottom of it was the lack of apprehension of the truth of the house, not the body. Baptism makes it individual. Baptists have the idea of the body and not the house. In the Church of England they have the idea of the house and not the body.
Some have the idea that it is a means of grace. It was that that showed me the difference between what was right and what was wrong. If my child were at the point of death, I should not have it baptised. I should only care for baptism on the supposition that my child is going to live. Then it has to
{573}
die. Baptism is dissociating. You dissociate yourself from what you have been identified with. I not only dissociate myself but my children.
Ques. What was John's baptism?
F.E.R. It was dissociating them from an untoward generation.
Ques. How old would you baptise a child on the faith of a parent?
F.E.R. As far as the child is under the control of the parents. Very few christians have the sense that they are living in a world where Christ is rejected and on which the judgment of sin has been pronounced. If they recognised that, they would be ready to dissociate their children from it. It is a question of subjection and control. If a parent has his house in such a condition as it ought to be in, he is the head of the house, and there is no difficulty at all. But if children are brought up to be consulted in a variety of ways, the probability is that there will be a tussle over it.
If it were apprehended that there were two spheres down here, one where Christ has a place, and the other where Satan has a place, there would be no difficulty about it. The difficulty in the present day is because the two spheres have become so intermingled. I question if there was much difficulty about it at the beginning. Now the world is so mixed up with the professing body, that you cannot distinguish.
Rem. No; not outwardly, only morally.
F.E.R. Still, to learn anything about these things you must go back to the beginning. You must not get your idea of things from the confusion, but from the beginning.
Ques. Now what about the other side -- the positive? I think what you said about its being dissociation is important.
{574}
F.E.R. When we come to the Lord's supper, it is really the entrance into proper christian place. As regards worship, and so on, "We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle", @Hebrews 13: 10.
Ques. What is the meaning of being partakers of the altar?
F.E.R. That you are in communion with it. You are not committed to it; it is not administered to you. In the systems it is not their own act; it is not "the cup of blessing which we bless". It is administered. They have really put the Lord's supper on the footing of baptism, and not on the ground of communion. I admit the title of every believer to the Lord's table (as a matter of fact they are not at the Lord's table). The one who breaks the bread is simply the mouthpiece of the assembly; he does not administer anything; it is an act of fellowship. It is open, as the Lord may guide. "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?" It is corporate; it is the communion, the communion of the whole body -- the church.
Ques. What is the force of @1 Peter 3: 21: "the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us"? There seems to be a positive advantage to it.
F.E.R. Yes; I think so. The effect of baptism was that they came into the place where they were entitled to a good conscience, and where alone it was to be found. Children of believers are dissociated in principle outwardly from the world. It is in view of their being brought up in the nurture of the Lord. With regard to the Lord's supper, they have not communion there because they are baptised.
Ques. Is there any connection between circumcision and baptism? As circumcision was applied to all Israel, is baptism applied to all christians?
{575}
F.E.R. I believe with regard to proselytes, they were both circumcised and baptised.
Ques. Was not baptism the mark of death on them?
F.E.R. Circumcision would not apply to the household; it was only the males who were circumcised. It meant the whole strength was separated to God. It is not exactly a figure of baptism. I think the great idea of baptism is this: it is the recognition of the claims of Christ, not simply on the person who accepts the testimony, but on all his. I not only accept the authority of Christ for myself, but for all who belong to me. I recognise the extent of His authority. I dissociate them from what Christ has died to. I use His death to that intent. If there is a positive side to it, it is that I recognise the proper domain of His authority, not only extending it to myself, but to all that He has given to me. I bring them into the house, not the body.
Rem. Many have a difficulty because there is no positive scripture to show that you must baptise your children.
F.E.R. I think it is because they fail to recognise the two distinct spheres in the world, the one where Christ has His sway, and the other where Satan has sway. If they recognised these, their difficulty as to baptism would disappear.
I remember J.N.D. saying what brought the flood of baptist ideas in amongst brethren was the reception of William Street. It was a Baptist Chapel which came in as it was. It was really the same establishment under new management. Very few saw the truth of the house; they had an idea of the truth of the body.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the house and the body?
F.E.R. When we come to scriptures which take up the question of the household, there are two
{576}
characters which Christ has here: He is *Head* and He is *Lord*. If you want the idea of the *body*, it is connected with Him as *Head*; if you want the idea of the house, it is connected with Him as *Lord*.
There are only two epistles which take up the relative duties of fathers and children -- Ephesians and Colossians. What we find is, as long as the apostle speaks of the assembly, it is *Christ*. The moment he comes to the relative duties, he speaks of *Lord*. On the ground of the house, not only children have a place, but slaves. The apostle is setting forth the whole sphere as to Christ, bearing on the Head. Then His place as Lord, that takes in children, and so on.
What comes closely home in connection with baptism, is to give authority to the name of the Lord in your own household. It is positively the case in some of the households of the saints, they do not begin the day with family prayer. They cannot expect to get on much. My conviction is that we as parents have much to do with the failures of our children. They are as keen as possible to find out what is reality with their parents.
{577}
THE CHRISTIAN IN THE LIGHT OF GOD
@Romans 8: 1 - 17
In considering the force of any portion of the Word it is important to bear in mind that truth forms one complete whole, and that while we learn it in parts, it is the Spirit's work to form it as a complete whole in our souls. We may have keen enjoyment of some particular passage of Scripture, but at the same time we want to get understanding as to the way in which various parts form part of one scheme. It is therefore important to be enabled to put together the various parts.
In this epistle (Romans) there are three chapters of which the object is evidently to *present God to us*, namely, chapters 3, 4, 5, while the next three chapters, 6, 7, 8, present what the christian is *for God*. We have necessarily to learn first what God is as revealed in the gospel, in the economy of grace; and hence chapter 3 presents the righteousness of God, as witnessed in the blood of Christ; chapter 4, the power of God as set forth in the resurrection of Christ, and chapter 5 the love of God as shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit given, and it is in this way that God has been pleased to reveal Himself to us; and I think that we learn things in the order of Scripture. We do not learn the love of God first. No! We are sinful, we have to learn His righteousness, made known in grace and not in judgment, and it is this which the gospel reveals. (@Romans 1: 17.) It is the first thing which God impresses on the heart of the sinner. The blood is the witness that God is righteous, but it is the ground, too, on which God can in grace justify, so we read, "that he might be just, *and* the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus".
{578}
Then in chapter 4 we get the great truth of the power of God, and that displayed in raising Christ from the dead. It has thus operated to His glory.
Then in chapter 5 we have the love of God, of which the death of God's Son is the proof; and which we know when the Holy Spirit is given to us.
These chapters present thus the full revelation of God to us, and it is by this alone that the heart of the believer is affected. The effulgence of God, the knowledge of His glory, for which God had shone into the heart of the apostle, is the light of the gospel, and this is the foundation which in his ministry the apostle laid in souls. (@1 Corinthians 3: 10, 11.)
Now in the three succeeding chapters, 6, 7, 8, we get, as we have said, the completeness of the christian's place before God. They give us a true idea of christianity, placing the believer morally outside the world and the course of it.
Chapter 6 is the new platform. The believer is privileged to reckon himself dead indeed unto sin and alive unto God in Christ Jesus.
In chapter 7 he is married to Christ, raised up from the dead to bring forth fruit to God. Christ is the law to the believer, the pattern or model on which he is formed.
In chapter 8 we find he is not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, and the Spirit is the power by which we are formed subjectively. We are, so to say, in the grip of God, to be formed in something completely new, in which we had no part before. What we are to live in is sonship, and we come to this in the end of the passage I read. (verses 14 - 17.) To this end Christ had to become Man and to accomplish redemption, and redemption being accomplished, we "receive sonship", @Galatians 4: 4 - 6.
Life is that by which a creature enjoys the position in which he is placed of God. God has been pleased to set us in the place of sons, and sonship is that
{579}
I am in the light of God's love and responsive to it. This is the meaning of the cry, "Abba, Father".
To refer again to chapter 6. There, as I have said, you are to reckon yourself dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. The principle of the world is sin, Sin is seen in that everything here ends in death. "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin". Most people connect sin with the idea of something gross, but this is not the thought of Scripture. The 'man of sin' is the lawless one. Sin is the principle in man which refuses the restraint of God. The leaders of thought in the present day claim absolute freedom of mind and to exercise this without restraint in the things of God, but perdition, which means moral ruin, is connected with this. The man of sin is 'the son of perdition' (@2 Thessalonians 2: 3.) In chapter 6 we accept death to sin, and the new platform is "alive to God" -- that means that the soul of the believer -- lives in the blessed light of the revelation in which God has been pleased to make Himself known; but then this is manifestly outside of the whole course of the world. Death is here, and this proves that the ruling principle of the world is sin. It is for this reason that the christian has to accept death to sin.
Now in the next chapter the believer is placed in relation to One raised from the dead. No one can know naturally the ways of One risen from the dead, but the believer is placed under the Son of God, under the influence of His love, that he may be formed after Him. This, I judge, is the force of being married, or joined to Him, and just as you are under the influence of the love of the Son of God (@Galatians 2: 20), the One raised from the dead, so you bring forth fruit to God. The love of Christ evidently had a great place with the apostle. "The love of Christ constraineth us", we read in @2 Corinthians 5: 14. We are to live to Him who died for
{580}
us and rose again. We have to learn His ways, the ways of One risen from the dead. If you come under the influence of His affection, you will be formed according to Him, and all that is according to Christ in us is fruit to God. This is the true line. I am not simply on a new platform, able to reckon myself alive to God, but I am placed in relation to One under the influence of whose affection fruit will be brought to God. There is no vine now on earth, but there is fruit-bearing, but not apart from Christ. I need to be under the control of His affection, so that I may be made sensible of His claim upon me, "who loved me, and gave himself for me". It is as our souls have learned His ways that we bring forth fruit to God.
I pass on to chapter 8. Here we find a point of equal importance. We have had the platform and the husband, but these would be ineffective were it not for the power which resides in the christian. Until grace works in man he is not conscious of the flesh, of the law of sin in his members, and this is concurrent with the conviction of *mind* (I do not see in this, a nature) that God's law is good. So the conclusion is, that with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin. The law of sin in the members is too strong, notwithstanding the conviction and mind as to God's law. Now in chapter 8 we get the power in the believer by which he can be free from the law of sin and death.
In chapter 6 we have seen that sin is not dead, but that the believer is to accept death to sin, so that he may be on the platform which God has formed for him. In chapter 8, on the other hand, we get the power in the christian. God has been pleased to bring in crucifixion to condemn sin in the flesh in order that He might be able to communicate the gift of the Spirit. I see the same connection
{581}
in @John 3 and 4. Man's state according to nature (not merely the principle of the state, which is sin, but the state itself), the flesh is condemned in the Son of man lifted up. Then in chapter 4 we get the well of water in the believer springing up to eternal life. The christian has to prove the power and virtue of that which God has placed within him. We get everything by the Spirit and from no other source.
This has been the wisdom of God, to bring in in Christ the condemnation of man's state -- a public expression in the cross of His mind in regard to sin in the flesh, and that in order that He might communicate the Spirit to man to emancipate him from the control of sin.
These verses (9 - 11) are brought in to teach us that we are wholly dependent upon the Spirit. It would be wrong for the believer to say he could not do the things that he would; he is "not in the flesh, but in the Spirit", if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in him. Then also Christ is in him, and that by virtue of his having the Spirit (verse 10). Then we get "the Spirit is life". The question here is of living to God, and in this sense, the Spirit is *life*, because of righteousness. Then he will get final quickening as to his body, because of the Spirit indwelling him. Thus you have three things:
<ol><li>A power in you greater than the flesh.</li><li>Christ in principle in you.</li><li>The hope of quickening of the body.</ol>
It is a great thing to see that we are apart from the flesh, and that all our relations with God are carried out in the Spirit. We can do everything down here to the glory of God, but none the less our relations with God are not in eating and drinking, they are *in the Spirit*. It is a great thing to be able to retire from the outward, from the duties and details of daily life, to the inward in the Spirit.
{582}
How is my heart made acquainted with the love of God or enabled to cry, "Abba, Father"? It is by the Spirit. My relations with God are all maintained in the Spirit.
It is most important to apprehend the wonderful place which the Spirit takes. He is the Spirit *of God*, because He sheds abroad the love of God and He is the Spirit of God's Son because He cries, "Abba, Father" in the believer.
In verses 13 - 15 the point is that we are not debtors to the flesh, for the principle upon which God gave the Spirit was the condemnation of sin in the flesh. We have everything to anticipate from the Spirit. If we want liberty we have it in the Spirit. There is a power by which we can mortify the deeds of the body and thus live. If we want privilege we have it in the Spirit. The Spirit is the Spirit of sonship, for He is the Spirit of *God's* Son. Here we are viewed as children, which is the recognised place and relationship in which we are set as down here in association with a rejected Christ. We are suffering with Him and we anticipate being glorified with Him. We are the objects of the Father's love according to the prayer, "that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them", @John 17: 26. This is the compensation we get for being in association with a rejected Christ.
The *power* of christianity is the *Spirit*, but the *substance* of christianity is *love*.
God has made known His love, and it is in the Spirit that we enjoy it; and in this connection it may not be inappropriate to notice the way in which the blessing of the believer is bound up with the Persons of the Godhead as now revealed.
In view of the glory of the Father, the believer is to walk in newness of life; he is married to Christ, raised up from the dead, to bring forth fruit unto God; and he is in the Spirit as being indwelt by the Spirit of God.
{583}
THE CONSTRAINT OF CHRIST'S LOVE
@John 21: 15 - 25; @2 Corinthians 5: 14, 15; @Ephesians 3: 18, 19
What is it that makes a man devoted is a question that must interest every christian. It is the love of Christ. No man or woman is effective for the Lord here except as under the influence of that love. It is not quite the same thought as the love of God, for that is a more general idea (@John 3: 16); the love of Christ, if you can understand the expression, is a little more personal in character.
In the passages I have read there are three men, who were all apostles, but very different from one another, yet each under the influence of the love of Christ, and I want to show the effect of it in each case.
I first take Peter, as in @John 21: 15 - 17. To him the Lord said, "Lovest thou me?" No one can doubt that Peter loved Him, the Lord owns it, but his defect lay in thinking too much about his love. No one ever loved Christ unless he was first under the influence of Christ's love; but Peter gave himself credit for being pre-eminent in this, he thought he loved Christ more than all the others, and that was the reason for the Lord's challenge, "Lovest thou me more than these?"
It is a serious thing to talk about our love for Christ, for in so doing we bring upon ourselves the challenge to show it. Peter had not shown it, for he had denied the Lord with cursing and swearing. But he did love Him, and the Lord interceded for him and he was restored in conscience and heart, and then the Lord challenged him to give expression to his love. Three times the challenge was repeated, until he has to say, "Thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee". He had attached too much importance to his love to Christ, and had been
{584}
taught by bitter experience that he could not rightly trust anything in himself, but only that which is in Christ. Then I have no doubt he responded to the challenge, for, with martyrdom in view, he laid out the rest of his life in feeding and shepherding the lambs and sheep of Christ. In that way he proved that it was the effect of the love of Christ to him.
Now I take John. He did not talk about his love to Christ, but he traded on Christ's love to him, and that is a much safer thing. Peter rested in his own love and broke down and denied the Lord. John rested in Christ's love and lay in His bosom. He got as close to Him as he possibly could, and the Lord did not resent it. He was near enough to speak to the Lord, and to hear His voice. It was like Mary, who got near to Him to hear His word. I venture to say that there is not one of us who would not be delighted to have a word from Him; but He does not speak to people at a distance, you must be near Him if you would have a word from Him.
Now notice how the love of Christ acted upon John, the disciple whom Jesus loved. "This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true", @John 21: 24. It was in this way he proved his love to the Lord. As an inspired instrument he recorded the words of Christ, and it was his pleasure to do it. He was so under the influence of Christ's love that he could not write what was untrue. He wrote the incomparable gospel. The others are beautiful and perfect in their place, but they do not bring out, as John's gospel does, the love of God and the love of Christ.
How did Philadelphia prove its love to the Lord? By keeping His word. To them He says, "I will make them ... to know that I have loved thee".
{585}
Now, turning to @2 Corinthians 5, we find that what characterised Paul was devotedness to Christ as he had seen Him. The other apostles had not seen Him in the same way. As the risen One in glory He appeared to Paul, making him deeply conscious of His love, and also that outside Him everything was death.
The christian accepts death, drinking the bitter waters of Marah. He is thus shut up to Christ; the One who died for him and rose again is before his soul. So it was with Paul. He went to a further extent in it than we can go, as he said, "Henceforth know we no man after the flesh"; he was apart from the power of all human relationships and affections. He was under the constraint of the love of Christ, and went through trials and persecutions, suffering the loss of everything in this world, to gain Christ.
So we have these three men, diverse in character, and each having his own peculiarity, yet all under the influence of the love of Christ.
The love of Christ first touches us in death. We have to go back to what is presented in baptism. We were all in death, and He came into death. His doing so did not make all dead, but proved all to be dead. The heart of every one ought to be affected by the thought of the love of the Son of God which brought Him into death, the judgment of sin, where we all were. He came into it that we might rise from it, and live to Him who died for us and rose again.
The feebleness of many lies in failing to apprehend that man is under the judgment of God; they refer judgment wholly to the future and fail to understand that every man is *now* under death. Let a man have what he may in this life, he is under death. Death is the great leveller, putting all on one common platform. Men are quite sceptical about it, looking upon it as natural decay and not as the
{586}
judgment of God. But I see that Christ came into death. It was not on Him, but in love He came into it, and He did so that He might establish upon us an incontestable claim, the claim of love. We are accustomed to give other claims a great place, but every claim should give way to this, for He died for us that He might have an absolute claim upon us down here. The apostle responded to it, and we ought to respond to it also.
But that is not the end of the love of Christ. Look at @Romans 8: 33, 34, which I connect with @Hebrews 7: 24. My object in doing so is to show how the love of Christ comes out in intercession. The first proof of His love is in death, but now He lives, and intercedes for His people. Thus He saves us to the uttermost and we are more than conquerors. This is a point of all moment to us, for we should all like to be more than conquerors. We become so through His intercession, and that is the expression of His love. To Peter He said, "I have prayed for thee". What dictated that prayer? Peter had not asked Him to pray for him; but the Lord loved him and prayed for him. And so for us He intercedes because He loves us, and thus whatever may confront us we may be more than conquerors through Him who loves us.
Priesthood is a very blessed thought to me. The high priest carried the names of the children of Israel upon his shoulders and on his breast, the place of strength and affection. Intercession is the fruit of affection, and we are through it supported down here. In Israel's case there might be a lapse from the change of high priest, but Christ is priest in the power of an endless life. We have always the same High Priest, who is able to save to the uttermost. He ever lives, and He intercedes because He loves, and thus we are preserved from being swamped by things down here. You cannot be a
{587}
happy, devoted christian except as you are under the influence of this love.
In @John 14: 1 - 3 we have the climax of His love, He brings us to the Father's house. We were given to Him by the Father, as it is beautifully expressed in a hymn:
<blockquote> "Thou gav'st us, in eternal love, <br>To Him to bring us home to Thee". (`88:1)</blockquote>
We are placed thus between the Father and the Son, the gift of the Father to Christ with this object, that He might bring us home to the Father's house, and the love of Christ will have complete satisfaction when He has us there. He tells His disciples that He is leaving them, but He goes to prepare a place for them, and will come again and receive them to Himself.
Now that is still future, but I will tell you what He does in the interval, He brings us to the Father's heart. His love is not satisfied with anything less. He has declared to us the Father's name, and makes us to know that we are loved of the Father as He is loved. "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them", @John 17: 26.
We are only fitted for the assembly in proportion to our love. We could not be there without faith, but we are in touch with Christ in love. He is in touch with the Father, and His part is to conduct us to the Father's heart as it will be His part to conduct us to the Father's house.
I have noticed these three points, but you cannot suppose that I could exhaust the subject of the love of Christ. There is first His claim as having died for us, then the fruit of His love as seen in intercession for us, then He conducts us out of the world to the Father, that the love wherewith He is loved may be in us. Thus we can understand the prayer of the apostle that I read from @Ephesians 3.
{588}
If the saints all knew the love of Christ, there would be a perfect expression of Christ down here in them, just as God was perfectly expressed in Him. "No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us". (@1 John 4: 12, with which compare @John 1: 18.) It is the nature and character of God coming out in the saints down here, and that is the great idea of the prayer in @Ephesians 3. Since Christ has been here in testimony nothing short of Christ will suit God, and therefore the church is to be filled to all the fullness of God, but the secret of this is, "and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge".
Light or doctrine does not make a man devoted; love does so, for the great object of devotedness is Christ Himself, as it was with Mary when she sat at His feet, or with John when he lay in His bosom. May the Lord give us so to know His love that we may be close enough to Him to get a word from Him. It is a great thing to be near Him. He draws us close to Himself that He may cause us to know the Father as He knows Him, "that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them".
{589}
ON ETERNAL LIFE
(written by F.E.R. in June 1902)
Difficulties have arisen in the minds of some whom I esteem, as to certain expressions in the American notes on the subject of eternal life, but I think that the root of them lies in not apprehending how the scriptures on the subject present themselves to my mind. I may be right or I may be wrong, but any way, it is not at all a question of any thoughts of my own, but of the way in which Scripture is apprehended, and I think that those that find difficulty might try to look at things as they present themselves to me before refusing them. I do not in the matter in any way make light of the work of God in the believer, but on the contrary insist on it as that by which alone eternal life can be entered into, but the point with me is that what is wrought in the believer is not spoken of as eternal life, but is the preparation or the means by which he enters into it. A man is born again, is enlightened by the gospel and is then sealed by the Spirit, and it is then by the Spirit he enters into eternal life. This is in accord with Scripture, which teaches that the living water that Christ gives is in the believer a well of water springing up into everlasting life; that he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life eternal; and again, that being made free from sin and having become servants to God, we have our fruit unto holiness and the end eternal life. These passages show conclusively that the work of God IN US is not spoken of as eternal life, but as leading to or ending in it. It is a great point to apprehend this.
Then comes another point, that is, as to the part faith has in it. The passage, "He that believeth on

me hath everlasting life", is quoted, and so it is said that eternal life is had by faith. It is certain that no one has it without faith, for a man must have been enlightened by the gospel in order to have the Spirit, but the teaching of Scripture is not that a man gets it by faith, but that the believer is the person who has it. I might say, by way of illustration, that a member of Parliament votes because he is a member. This is true; it is his qualification to vote, and yet it is not the cause of his voting. This is because he belongs to a party and votes according to that party; that is the immediate cause of his voting, though I might well say that a member votes. A believer has eternal life because he is a believer, that is his title or qualification, but the immediate cause of his having eternal life is that he has the Spirit. It is that in him which springs up into it. He has eternal life as being a believer, so that I say the believer has eternal life, as I would say the member votes, but, then, he needs the Spirit to enter into it, as the member needs opinions or party to lead him to vote. His opinions are not his title, but they are his power, so having the Spirit is not the title to the believer, but faith which apprehends Christ in whom eternal life is.
This leads me to another point as to faith, namely, that one is not called upon to believe anything as to oneself, but faith apprehends what is true in Christ. I am not called upon to believe that I have eternal life, but that eternal life is in Christ for man -- that He is it. Scripture is explicit that eternal life is in Christ -- it is God's gift in Christ, and when faith is there, the seal of the Spirit is given so that we may appropriate what is there in Christ for man. It is ever there, and Christ is no poorer by our appropriation.
This is a very important principle. I do not want to believe anything about myself in particular, but
{591}
what is in Christ for all men and, therefore, for me, and this faith is sealed by the Spirit and then begins the principle of appropriation, and this goes on as we advance in the knowledge of God, and so that all that God gives is morally in accord with Himself. Redemption is according and suitable to His grace. Salvation is according to His mercy and eternal life is according to His love, and as we apprehend these principles in God, we are enabled to reach our own blessings. It is certain that eternal life is constantly spoken of in Scripture as something to be entered into; the question therefore arises as to *what* it is that is to be entered into. The power or qualification to enter into it I have already spoken of. This is the springing up of the well of water in the believer. What is entered into is said to be eternal life. It must be something external to the believer or he could not be said to enter into it. He enters into it in soul. I might illustrate it in this way. When a child is born it enters into the elements of life which it finds existing, such as rule, atmosphere and light; and these things are life to the newly-born infant, without them it could not live. Had there not been sin man would doubtless have lived in them for ever, but the fall brought into the state of man the principle of non-continuance. Thus what is life to the infant, and without which even Adam could not have lived, is apprehended by us as objective.
Now, in spiritual things the same principle is true -- the believer is born of God and in this way is qualified to enter into the appointed conditions. Just as the newly-born infant has a body subject to natural laws, lungs that can take in the air, eyes that can enjoy the light, so the believer, being born of God, is capable of entering into the conditions of life which God has appointed. These are, as in
{592}
natural things, rule, atmosphere and light. Rule is found in abiding in Christ, so that the believer is delivered from lawlessness; he does not sin because he is under the law or influence of Christ. Atmosphere is found in the christian circle, where the love of Christ pervades all, and in that the believer is delivered from a world of hatred and death. "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren". Light is found in the perfect setting forth of God's disposition towards us in Christ, made good in us by the Spirit; Christ is the proof of what the love of God towards us is. We have thus seen what are the elements of life, and it is *in them* that eternal life consists, and they are there for us to enter into by the Spirit, and in entering into them we are conscious that we have eternal life, as we are told by the apostle John.
There is another point as to which objection has been raised, namely, the application of the thought of eternal life to earth. I certainly am unable to find any scripture that connects it with heaven. It may be said that Christ is it, but this is in its application towards earth, and the principles of which I have spoken as making up eternal life properly apply to earth, such as rule, or kingdom, the bearing of which is towards earth. If Scripture anywhere speaks of eternal life in connection with heaven, I shall certainly receive it, but wherever it is spoken of, it appears connected with God's ways on earth. In Matthew, Mark and Luke it is connected with the coming age and John gives it a present application. I therefore prefer to take it up in that light. It has been said that I limit it, but this is not my thought, but to put the thing in its proper connection, and I cannot attempt to restrict the power of God to bring in other and, in a sense, better things, in heaven or in the eternal state. He says, "I make all
{593}
things new". I cannot pretend to say what He makes, but I have no doubt there is an ascending scale of blessing. I trust that it will be seen from the foregoing remarks that I have no design to depart from Scripture, but rather to gather from it what is the true idea of eternal life.
