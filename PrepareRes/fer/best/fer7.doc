THE BREAD OF GOD
@John 6: 47 - 71
I have it a little on my heart to seek to unfold, as God may enable me by His Spirit, the verses we have read in this chapter, which are more especially connected with the appropriation by the believer of the death of the Son of man. I need hardly say that this connects itself very intimately with the blessing of eternal life, into which the believer is brought.
I would first say a few words as to the general place in this gospel of these two chapters, the fifth and sixth.
There is a certain development in the truth that runs all through the gospels. There was more than one side in the Person of the blessed Lord, and we get this opened out by the four evangelists. In @John 5 Jesus is presented to us as the Son of God acting in divine sovereignty: "The Son quickeneth whom he will". And then again: "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son". The great point of chapter 5 is that the Lord Jesus exercises divine prerogative. God is the Judge, but all judgment is committed "unto the Son: that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father".
But in chapter 6, what is brought before us is the form in which eternal life was presented to men; it is an incarnate Christ, the true bread from heaven, the Son of man, sealed by the Father, who gives His flesh for the life of the world. This is the great point that the Lord presses in this chapter.
The Jews claimed to be the people of privilege. They say: "Our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat". But the Lord answers: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven;
{2}
but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world". An incarnate Christ was the form in which God presented His Son to man to be received; and a humbled Christ is food for the believer. He adds, "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life". If the Jews had really discerned the grace of His humiliation, that He really was the Son of God, they would have had eternal life, but they must have gone on to appropriate His death. I have no doubt this would have been the case, but it is not my subject tonight. I wish rather to look at the absolute necessity for the death of Christ for us, and our appropriation thereof.
Most of you will remember these words in the first epistle of John: "There are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one". They all bear witness to the fact that God has given to us eternal life. But they also bear another witness, and that is, that if we have eternal life, it is not in Adam; it is not in ourselves it is in Christ. And that, I believe, is the teaching of the epistle; and this is how the epistle connects itself with the passage that I have read. It was when the Lord was dead that the blood and the water flowed forth; and the Spirit was not given until He had gone back to the Father. So that I do not get one of these witnesses until death has come in.
I question in my own mind whether we realise the solemnity of the fact that death has come in; and that, not death in ourselves, for, if it had been, we should have been for ever lost; but it is the death of Christ.
But I wish to say a few words more about these three witnesses. I believe that you will find that the whole of John's first epistle ranges itself under these three heads: the consequences of the water; the
{3}
consequences of the blood; and the consequences of the Spirit.
The first two chapters are rather the result of the blood, for that is what gives us title to be with Him. God Himself is always light; but the witness about God to Israel was that "Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was". *Now* the witness is: "If we walk in the light as *he* is in the light". God has come out in light, and Christianity has brought us into the light in which He is. It is not conditional. God has brought us "out of darkness into his marvellous light". This is not attainment; it is the privilege of every believer. "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin", and gives us the privilege to walk in the light as He is.
In the third chapter the question is the nature; that which is the product in the believer of the word. "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures", as the apostle James says, and Peter: "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever". So here we get that we are the children of God, and that, "He that practises righteousness is righteous, even as *he* is righteous". It is a righteous nature, which has its manifestation also in love; love that enables us to "lay down our lives for the brethren". It is a wonderful thing! We may not enter into it, but still there it is plain in Scripture. And men may not be able to see it in us, it may be obscured, but still it is there; it is the same nature as in God Himself, it is divine.
Then comes the third witness, the Spirit. This is the result; it follows on the water and the blood. An entirely new thing has been brought in, a new creation, and this is accompanied by the Spirit. The consequences of the presence of the Spirit are brought out in the fourth chapter.
{4}
The first is intelligence. The apostle says, "Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit". We know it because God has given to us of His Spirit, and He does not take away His Spirit. We continue in God and He in us. Besides this, the Spirit is here for testimony; He witnesses that, "The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world". Both these are the result of the presence of the Spirit of God in the believer. I have said thus much in preface, and would now add a few words on the passage I read.
The Jews were stumbled at once when the Lord spoke of giving His flesh to eat, and I do not wonder at it. "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you". This was the test. You may meet people who pretend to have life towards God, but if they do not know what it is to have eaten "the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood", there is no life in them. I need hardly say how much Socinianism there is in the present day. The death of Christ is slighted as to the solemn judgment of man's state effected in it. Now the Lord puts it as a test for the state of souls. "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you". If you have not part in death, you have not part in life.
There are three things brought out in our chapter about the Son. First, He has become incarnate. Second, He dies. Third, He goes up to heaven again, where He was before. Now the Lord was talking here to people who were setting up religious pretensions: "Except ye eat", you are clean outside the whole thing. You have no part in life if not in death. The old state is death, as children of Adam; the new is life in Christ, but through death. As to the Christian, it does not say that he has life in him, but life in Christ.
The next verse is not so much a test, as it is a proof. "Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath
{5}
eternal life". His death is the food of life. The eating in this verse is, I judge, an habitual thing. It is not a thing that is done once for all. And I ask, Is it not a privilege to feed on the death of Christ? I do not mean at the Lord's table on the first day of the week, I mean as the habit of our souls every day of our lives. It is an individual thing. Has not God brought in the death of Christ upon everything? From the cedar wood to the hyssop! I do not say it is our only food; for we have also the humbled Christ, the manna; but we do feed on the death of Christ.
And while contemplating, and a blessed contemplation it is, the death of Christ, in His perfect love to the Father, and in His triumph over evil, we have a part in what is eternal, in what never began and will never end. This part in life with Christ is what we are brought into; and when the time for display comes, He will raise us up. If, as having life, we delight to meditate on the death of Christ, Christ will raise us up at the last day! What a blessed thing! It is a present association with Christ, and the display and the glory are at the last day.
In the next verse we have a further statement. If we eat His flesh and drink His blood, He continues in us and we in Him. We have an eternal part in Christ; and, if I may use the expression reverently, He has in us. A person may in a sense have a part for a time in Christ, and then go away; but it is not this; here it is 'continue' as we get it in the epistle; it is a present and continuous, eateth and drinketh.
But more than this. It indicates a condition of dependence, for the life is only in Him; and the word 'continue' implies dependence. I have eternal life up there in Christ, and Christ is in me down here before the world. Christ did not present Himself to the world, but the Father; and so with us. We continue in Christ, and Christ in us. And if you want to
{6}
know what a Christian is, I can say it is Christ. People sometimes talk and think much of proprieties. Thank God, we have done with proprieties. And what tends to distinguish us -- that which ought to characterise a Christian down here -- is Christ, and that is what I seek. God does not value anything else but Christ in His people. It is what is before the mind that forms the person. If it is Christ that is before you, Christ will come out in your life and ways.
There is one more clause: "As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me". I can only say as to this verse that I dare not expatiate on it. Indeed, what could I say about it? I little understand what it is for Christ to live on account of the Father. All that I can say is that the very same character of life as that of the Son is the life of the believer, and that inseparable connection with Christ is ours. In this passage there is not the thought of the body. It is life only that is before us. But life is essential to the truth of the body, and it is in this way that John is necessary to Paul; John gives us the life; Paul gives us the life in one body; @Colossians 3. We cannot well appreciate church truth if we do not enter into what John teaches as to the life.
And then we have this closing expression: "This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever". The Lord reverts to what He had been saying in the previous part of the chapter. He knew very well that He was going on to death, and He insists, on the way to it, that He was the living bread which came down from heaven, "that a man may eat thereof, and not die". I do not doubt at all, if there had been a single one of those poor Jews listening to Him that could, in faith, have seen the Son of God through the humble exterior of the Lord Jesus Christ, that he would have had the
{7}
blessing, in anticipation, though, as I have said, he must needs go on to the death. It is a great thing to get into God's thoughts. The pretensions of man in the present day only move one's contempt and sorrow; but that a Man could stand upon earth and say: "I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever" is marvellous! Death has now come in, and life is the result. Is not that worthy of God! The death of Christ is presented to man as the way of life, and feeding on it is a proof to the believer that he has got eternal life. Take the simplest soul that you can, but find it delighting in meditating on the death of Christ, and it is to me a proof that it has eternal life.
The seed of the life is in Christ, and it is a dependent life, as we have been seeing: "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me". If you could take away Christ, you could take away the life of the believer. But you cannot take away Christ, for Christ is God.
It is a great thing for our souls if God, by His Spirit, establishes us in the understanding of this truth, and gives us to realise what a marvellous thing it is to be in the hands of Christ! To know that we are going to be the subjects of His mighty power, and that He is going to raise us up at the last day.

LIFE AS PRESENTED IN SCRIPTURE
@Psalm 133: 3; @Romans 6: 22; @John 17: 3
I have doubted sometimes if it be sufficiently seen that, when life is spoken of in Scripture, it is presented to us as a moral state into which one is brought through faith (the just shall live by faith), to which the nature begotten in the believer of the Spirit by the word necessarily answers. This moral state is formed by, and dependent on the way in which God is pleased to reveal Himself. The contrasts in which life is presented to us in the word may serve to the elucidation of this. I think the mistake has been made of viewing life too much according to natural ideas, as a sort of deposit in the believer -- though indeed there be a seed of God in him -- but in viewing it in this way, the moral character and import of life appears to me in measure lost.
Two or three passages will show the contrasts to which I have referred. In @Psalm 133: 3, life for evermore is the explanation of "the blessing", and it is identified with Zion, and therefore with all the moral force of Zion. "There the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore". In @Daniel 12: 2, eternal life is contrasted with shame and everlasting contempt; in @Matthew 25: 46, with everlasting punishment; in @John 5: 24, with a state of death, and so too, in @Romans 6: 23. These passages are of moment, not exactly as describing what life is, but as showing it to us in contrast either with death as a moral state in the present, or with shame, contempt, and punishment in the future.
I may here notice the moral sequence which we find in @Romans 6: 22. It begins with liberation from sin and bondage to God, it goes on to fruit unto holiness,
{9}
and the climax is eternal life; there is evidently a moral progression here, though it doubtless ends in glory. And this brings me to another point, namely, the kind of persons who are spoken of as passing into life, of whose course down here life may be regarded as the consummation. In @Matthew 25: 46, it is the righteous. In @Romans 2: 7, it is those who, by patient continuance in good works, seek for glory, honour, incorruptibility.
Now I think it will be evident that life thus regarded could not be viewed as existing, so far at least as man's participation in it is concerned, until the necessary conditions should be there according to God. I do not, of course, intend to give always to life, as presented in the word, precisely the same force. This must be ascertained from the particular context in which it stands. Hence, in the Old Testament, it doubtless refers to a state of blessing to be enjoyed on the earth under Christ, when the law is written in the heart; while in the New, it is *in* the Son of God, Christ Jesus, carrying with it relationship and inheritance in Him, and is the fulfilment of God's eternal purpose.
Now for the display of life it is plain from Scripture that two conditions were necessary; the first was the manifestation of life, of and according to God, in a man, the sphere of it being properly in glory, and this in One who is a quickening Spirit, the second Man, out of heaven; the other was the removal of sin from before God, and that in such a way as that the glory of God might come in where the full power of sin had been; and with this was the condemnation of the state of the first man. Now in the incarnation of the Son of God, the first condition was, in measure, fulfilled, and the second pledged. He was the living bread come down from heaven, and the bread that He would give was His flesh, which He would give for the life of the world.
{10}
I will endeavour to trace a little the way in which eternal life is developed in the writings of the apostle John. In @John 17: 3, its character and privilege are described by Jesus Himself as the knowing the Father as the only true God, and Jesus Christ His sent One. This indicates at once its moral character, and renders it manifestly inseparable from the Son. Now what was necessary as from God was really present when the Father was manifested in the Son, become Man; but there yet remained to be accomplished the setting aside of the flesh that man might be wrought for the blessing; and to this I suppose the Lord refers in speaking of the brazen serpent in @John 3. Nevertheless in the manifestation of the Son there was something far in advance of all that had ever been before. Light had come in as to the portion which the grace of God had in reserve for man. In @John 3, the Lord speaks of eternal life through the giving of God's Son as the witness and expression of God's love to the world, and it is into the enjoyment and joy of this love that the believer in the Son is brought. This is eternal life, and is far beyond any question of kingdom. In @John 4, the worship of God as Father is spoken of, the result of the living water in the believer; it springs up unto everlasting life. Thus we have God known in His love, and worshipped as Father in Spirit and in truth. In chapter 5, it is the effect of hearing the voice of the Son of God, and there is the consequent passage from death unto life. Here, as I have before shown, it is an entire change as regards the state of things in which a soul lives morally. In chapter 6, the Son of God incarnate is presented as the bread of life -- the bread of God -- and the way of life for man was to eat of this bread; all the grace of God was seen in the form in which the life was presented to man. At the same time He would give His flesh for the life of the world, and His death of necessity became the test of faith. Except they ate His flesh and drank His blood they had no life
{11}
in them, and the Lord warns them that His words must not be understood in a carnal sense, for they were spirit and life. The true secret underneath all, was that the Father was drawing souls to the Son; and in an incarnate and crucified Christ faith has a portion given and enjoyed in communion with the Father and the Son. And this is eternal life, which for us will find its completion in resurrection at the last day.
I think the passages cited show that the idea of life, in the first revelation of it in Scripture, is a moral order of things into which the believer enters through grace, where wholly new objects are presented to him, which he is capable of enjoying in virtue of a new nature implanted in him. And the same thing is evident in the first epistle of John, where the believer is viewed as being in life, enjoying the knowledge of the Father and the Son -- born of God that he may enjoy it -- having confidence with God, knowing the love of God, into the enjoyment of which he is introduced, and delivered from fear because love is made perfect with us, "because, as he is, so are we in this world". And, in chapter 5, the apostle reverts to the fact of the eternal life being in the Son, and ends with the expression, "He is the true God and eternal life" that is, that eternal life means a new order of things, so far as man is concerned, true only in the Son, and in believers as abiding in Him. The boundaries of the land of Israel's inheritance might be limited, and there might be a limit to the subsistence which the land could afford; to Christ there can be no limit; the extent and area for blessing, so to speak, and the power to maintain those blessed are illimitable. In the writings of Paul, life is viewed rather as a display in the future, in which God's eternal purpose for man's glory will find its accomplishment. It was promised in Christ before the world was; it is now brought to light by our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled
{12}
death; and grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Thus, though the apostle recognises the present power of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, and exhorts Timothy to grasp eternal life, yet he speaks in general of eternal life as the consummation of the believer's course, but which is at the same time the fruit of God's eternal purpose. It is all the difference between a state of life in Christ in glory, and a state of life in blessing on the earth under Christ. The apostle Paul, speaking of life more in display, connects it with Christ in His present position in glory, rather than, as is the case with John, with the Son become Man.
There is another point, in connection with what I have said, of considerable importance, and that is, that life, as to man's participation in it, is in Scripture commonly linked with faith. The necessity and fact of new birth is constantly spoken of in the word, and in Peter the gospel is said to be the word by which it is produced; but it still remains true that faith is the way of life, and this is of the highest moment, because, though a soul may not in believing be very intelligent as to the import and moral bearing of faith, it really means the receiving of Christ, and the consequent renunciation of self and the world. What is done administratively in the putting off the old man and putting on the new, is really effectuated morally in faith in Christ crucified and risen. A soul is thus committed to Christ, in principle owning that, as to its own condition, it is lost; and having thus been drawn of the Father to the Son, the Spirit is received, the power and witness of the state of life and blessing in Christ, into which it is brought. My impression is that it is in this way life is presented in Scripture; not so much as a deposit in the believer, though indeed Christ lives in him in the power of the Spirit, but as a state of blessing, whether in Christ in glory, or under Christ on the earth, into which a believer, conscious
{13}
of his own state of ruin by nature, is through grace brought, and for which he is wrought by the power of God.
May the Lord give us to know the greatness of the blessing.
{14}
PIETY
@1 Timothy 5: 4
The employment of words in Scripture is an interesting subject of study. Words in common use amongst men, and recognised as conveying certain general ideas, are employed to communicate thoughts in connection with God, with the consequence that the revelation of God imparts to the words a peculiar force of meaning which is not found in dictionaries, and which can only be learnt from Scripture itself. A word of this kind is 'piety'. It appears in the Authorised Version only in @1 Timothy 5: 4, the original being in other cases rendered 'godliness'. Piety, however, unquestionably conveys more correctly the idea. The Scripture employment of the term has one point in common with the dictionaries, in that it refers it both to God and to parents. The dictionaries differ among themselves, some explaining it as bearing (reverence, respect, etc.), and others as discharge of duty, conduct, etc. The object of the present paper is to seek to present the force with which the word is used in Scripture.
It is doubtful if its precise equivalent is to be found in the Hebrew scriptures -- the expressions which most nearly approach it being probably the word commonly rendered 'fear' of the Lord (see @Psalm 111: 10; @Proverbs 1: 7), when speaking of a quality, and that translated 'saints', or 'godly' (see @Psalm 4: 3, etc.), when referring to a class of persons. In the New Testament the expression is in two instances applied to persons not as yet in the enjoyment of Christian privileges. (See @Acts 10: 2 - 7)
As piety is presented in the first epistle to Timothy as the antidote to different forms of evil which the apostle by the Spirit foresaw would corrupt Christianity,
{15}
it is important to ascertain what is intended to be conveyed by it. At the outset then I would say, it is a quality generated in the heart by the sense of benefits received from one rightly entitled to reverence and affections. It would hardly be an obligation on the part of parents to show piety towards their children, or masters towards their slaves; the converse would hold good. Piety is not like faith. The latter is the reception for once and for all of a divine testimony, or the substantiation of things hoped for and conviction of things not seen. Piety is rather a growth in the heart, stimulated by the knowledge of the goodness of the one who is its object. Practically it may perhaps be defined as the exercise of reverent affections in a spirit of grateful confidence. It brings the comfort of the knowledge of God into present things, supporting in endurance, and tends to that quietness and rest of spirit which leave the mind free to find its occupation in the things of faith.
Having thus given the general idea, I proceed to show how piety is presented in detail in the epistles, as opposed to the forms of evil anticipated by the apostles. The first of these is spoken of in @1 Timothy 4. It is not looked at as universal, but 'some' would in the latter times depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats. I suppose that the end proposed by such commandments was, by depriving the body, to attain the subjugation of evil. The practical result was to introduce a class of separatists, not in the power of the Spirit, the remains of which may be seen to this day in popery and the like. However plausible the end proposed, the means by which it was to be reached were very bad. In addition to the legality involved, there was a still greater evil in the slight thus cast on the beneficent provision of God for the creature. The Christian is still in the place of the creature, and whatever mercies
{16}
God may have ordained for the creature are not to be refused, but received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
Now in piety there was the recognition of this -- the confidence begotten by God's grace -- and hence it was the safeguard against these commandments which falsified the character of God. The blessed God who has bestowed the greater benefits does not withhold the lesser. There is, too, in piety that warmth and nurture of soul in which lies the secret of keeping in subjection the body. A well-nourished soul is the real security against unruliness of body. Hence Timothy is exhorted to exercise himself rather unto piety -- the range of its value being far greater than that of bodily exercise. The working of it is that instead of practising abstention in a legal way from mercies which are God's provision for the creature, the soul rests in the confidence of being specially the object of God's kindness and care, and finds piety profitable unto all things, having promise of life, of the present one, and of that to come. Thus reverent affections and happy confidence, perhaps amid labour and reproach, are set forward as against legality and asceticism, by the spirit of which souls would be withered.
But if on the one hand, piety recognises God's beneficence even to all men, and accepts His mercies with thanksgiving, it refuses on the other, to run in the ways of the world, in pursuing present advantage, and so leaving the place of dependence on God. In this way it guards against another form of evil which has pervaded the church, and which, we learn from @1 Timothy 6, originated in heterodox teaching, and insubjection to wholesome words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wholesome words tend to health in the soul. If the Lord has said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you", it is a wholesome word, which should settle the whole question of "these
{17}
things" for the disciple. But where the spirit of self-will and insubjection wrought, there came in, not only questions and strifes of words, but a sense of the importance of worldly gain; and piety came to be regarded as a means to this end -- "holding gain to be the end of piety". Now the gain in piety is not prospective -- to be sought or schemed after -- but present. Piety with contentment is great gain, and for the simple reason that the soul has for its resource God and His goodness. It may be a question as regards ourselves whether there is not a deficiency in point of piety. In the midst of the influences of the world, we are seduced almost imperceptibly into walking in its ways, ordering our business and our homes according to man. Individually, our piety is our testimony, since it results not only in maintaining a path of separation from the world and its ways, but in bearing witness to those around that a living God is, to us at least, a blessed reality, and a resource as to present need.
I conclude with a remark or two as to the way in which piety is introduced in 2 Timothy and 2 Peter. In the former, the apostle refers to the state of evil which would be prevalent in the last days, when men would be marked by passions and evils as gross as had existed in heathenism. They would, however, have a form of piety, but denying its power. And the teachers and those that would exercise influence over weak and superstitious minds would arise out of this state of things. Thus, unbroken will and unsubdued passions, all the darkness of the human heart, might be covered by an exterior of affected humility and self-abnegation, which would gain a reputation for sanctity in the eyes of the uninstructed, but would be only piety in form, and not in spirit.
In 2 Peter, piety is in one case coupled with life, and in another with holy conversation; and in the chain which is found in chapter 1: 5 - 7, piety follows endurance, as brotherly love follows piety. What I
{18}
understand by it is, that endurance on the part of a saint is not stoicism, but marked by the spirit of affection and confidence toward God; so that, whilst enduring, the heart may be kept fresh and warm; and then, where true piety is, that the soul, whilst right in its attitude God-ward, should be mindful also of the obligation of love toward the brethren. Each successive quality is adorned and added to by that which follows.
{19}
NEARNESS AND CONFIDENCE
@2 Timothy 1: 12; @Ephesians 2: 13
It is of all moment that we should first clearly understand the things which are distinctively characteristic of Christianity, and then see how they affect us in our pathway through the world. It is in this pathway that the faith of saints is practically tested. Many of us would like to find some unvarying rule by which, in the midst of church difficulties, to steer our way; while, as to circumstances, we should be well pleased to see, as another has said, a full supply for every need within our reach. Neither the one nor the other is at all likely to be the experience of saints if going on with God, since there would in either case be but little call for the exercise of *faith*, or of moral perception. The question then arises, Are we to be dismayed by the anticipation of troubles in the assembly, or of pressure in our individual path? What is the antidote? The answer is *confidence* -- and confidence is the effect of nearness, having its source in the knowledge of God: "I know whom I have believed". Nearness may be spoken of as the peculiar characteristic blessing of Christianity. Now that redemption has been accomplished, and Christ is exalted as Man to God's right hand, God has begun to effectuate the purposes of His will, and in this the heavenly takes precedence of the earthly.
The two great parts of God's will are constantly before us in the Hebrews, in the distinction between the sanctuary and the covenant. As being for the moment God's people on the earth, Christians come incidentally into the blessings of the new covenant; but the calling is as priests to serve a living God in the sanctuary. Every part of the New Testament coincides in showing nearness to be the peculiar portion
{20}
of Christians. The beginning of the gospel of Luke is that God has approached man where he is in such wise as that the pious Simeon could take the infant Saviour in his arms. The Son of God had come down into man's place and circumstances. The end is that the risen Lord takes the repentant thief to be with Him in His place. He first visits man here in grace, and then, in virtue of His work, takes man to be a resident with Him in paradise.
In John we find not only the manifestation on earth of the eternal life which was with the Father, but also the work of the Father who was seeking worshippers in spirit and in truth, and was drawing to the Son, that the Son might introduce those drawn to Him into the blessing and privilege of eternal life; and this not deferred, but present, though the communion of His death was essential to it. He that ate His flesh and drank His blood had eternal life. As He lived because of the Father, so he that ate Him would live because of Him. The place suitable to this was the Father's house, to which He would bring His own; but meantime the Comforter would come, and in that day they would know that Jesus was in the Father, and they in Him, and He in them.
When we come to Paul we find more definitely the new place for man in Christ, and the truth of new creation. The expression "in Christ Jesus ... made nigh" in @Ephesians 2: 13, may mean dispensationally, in contrast with the previous place of Gentiles; but the climax of the teaching is that God has made Jew and Gentile to sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the coming ages He may display in them the exceeding riches of His grace. But already we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Jesus.
Now no expression is more remarkable than this -- to have boldness with God, and liberty with confidence. It is a condition of things which could exist only where
{21}
the Spirit is, and certainly conveys the idea, that we have to do with a God who has pleasure in being approached, and who sets Himself to encourage those who have the privilege of approaching.
In the Hebrews we are on somewhat different ground, and it is important to remember that no shadow in the law contained the very image of Christian privilege. There we find that though believers have, as being incidentally a people of God on earth, a throne of grace, the calling is that they are sons, whom Christ is not ashamed to call brethren; and that, as a priestly company, they already have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, to serve the living God. We not only receive, as Israel will, the effect of Christ's death in forgiveness here, but we must go through that death into the marvellous light of God's presence, into which flesh has no entrance.
Now here are privileges which properly belong to heaven, and to those who have the Spirit of God's Son. They are the proper inalienable portion of saints now; and our life down here being, as it were, an incident in the ways of God, is subordinate to our heavenly privileges. We miss the mark if we attempt to reverse the order. More than this, it may be doubted if any saint who has tasted the blessing of nearness, and the peculiar delight of boldness with God, would care to attach much importance to life and circumstances here, save as they give him opportunity of doing God's will in patience, and having part in the ministry of grace. And the touchstone of things now is not how they compromise our character in the eyes of men, but how they affect and hinder our sense of boldness and liberty with God.
Now where we fail to walk in the enjoyment of our privileges, the spirit of distrust soon finds place in the heart. On the other hand, there is a warmth in nearness which nourishes confidence, and if we ask anything according to His will, we know that He heareth
{22}
us. It is thus we are enabled to go fearlessly through the world.
In the presence of difficulties in the assembly, saints are often puzzled and overwhelmed by a cloud of writing and talk; what we need is to be so in the enjoyment of liberty with God, that we maintain confidence; the result is, that we instinctively gain a sense of what is according to God, and a moral judgment often of spirits as well as of words. The Lord had, as one may say, His intuitions from above (@John 5: 30), and we have to try the spirits whether they are of God, because everything is not now to be trusted. The same spirit of confidence applies to difficulties in the individual path of saints. The secret of ability to endure is confidence in a living God, who is the Saviour of all men, and especially of them that believe -- a confidence that leaves all with God, in the sense that from the outset He has laid out all our pathway down here, having in view an end that is worthy of His goodness. There is no other secret of health and comfort in the soul of the saint, and it is in the liberty of nearness to God that this secret is learned.
May the Lord awaken saints to the sense of their privileges, that the Father's house may be the fitting climax to their experience here!

THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FATHER AND THE SON¦
@John 17: 1 - 3
I dare say, beloved friends, some may wonder at my taking up such a passage as this to speak from. In fact, I feel some hesitation myself. There are many parts of Scripture which one would not have the same feeling about at all, but one has some difficulty about taking up such expressions as these -- the prayer of the Lord. What I read is part of the Lord's prayer; some of us have been accustomed to think of something else as the Lord's prayer, but this is really the Lord's prayer. One feels some hesitation, as I said, in taking up part of the Lord's prayer as the subject of an address; but it is only with the thought of bringing out two or three points which come before us in these first verses.
What I first wanted to lay down as a principle, is this: the greatest blessing God has conferred upon us is the knowledge of divine Persons. It is the greatest blessing God could confer upon a creature; no other blessing can come up to it. I do not think anyone can contest that for an instant. If I think of what our future is to be, we come into an inheritance; but whatever we come into in that way is below us. Naturally it is so. Suppose I was heir to a great estate now in my father's possession, and constantly heard it said all this was to be mine; I should say, I have a privilege much greater than that, I have the privilege of knowing my father. If things were not altogether out of course in the world, people would think so. They would consider the privilege of intimacy with one's father greater than any advantage one could come into by being the son of his father. When I look at divine
¦Notes of a Lecture given at Quemerford in July, 1889
{24}
things, I see there is no blessing God could confer upon a creature to be compared to the knowledge of Himself in the blessedness of His own nature and His own thoughts; for that is what is involved in the knowledge of God. Poor sinful creatures that we are, we are called to heavenly blessing, to the knowledge of God Himself as He has been pleased to reveal Himself in His blessed Son.
That is the first principle I want to lay down before I touch these verses; and then another thing, namely, that the blessings that belong to us as Christians, lie completely outside this world of sense. I do not doubt there are many things we enjoy down here, such as justification and peace, and the sense of acceptance. More than that, God has given to us the Holy Spirit to conduct us through the wilderness, the pathway down here. We have grace ministered to us in our circumstances day by day. How could we get on without it? And not only that, but mercy. Mercy and grace are not precisely the same thing: the Christian has both. As the children of Israel had manna for their daily necessities, so I have grace ministered to me for mine. We are the recipients of a thousand mercies from God to us down here, as the Lord said to His disciples in regard to temporal necessities, "Your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things". Do you not think you have the care of God in your pathway here? Do you not remember what the apostle says: "Therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour (Preserver) of all men, specially of those that believe"? I ask the poorest Christian here tonight: Do you not think God cares a great deal more for you than for those who do not believe? He is the Preserver of all men, *specially* of those that believe. That is the care of God for His people. We are subjects of that. The Lord told the disciples not to be careful for the morrow, what they should eat or
{25}
what they should drink. He says, Your Father knows. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you".
I only just bring this forward because it is of all importance that we should apprehend and understand the care of which we are the subjects down here. I do not believe there is a single thing which exercises me, that is not a care for God. You remember the exhortation: "Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you". I should be very sorry to get into an unreal Christianity; and it would be that, if we failed to see the care of God for us down here. But my point tonight is, that the privileges that belong to the Christian, his proper portion, are outside this scene altogether. These blessings are ours by faith, made good to us by the Holy Spirit; it is not that we have not the power to reach them, but they are outside this world of sense. Suppose a Christian dies, what is the effect of death to him? He goes nearer to his blessings. Suppose it were possible for a saint to die in the millennium, he would go away from his blessings, they will be all upon the earth; but with a Christian it is totally different. If I die, I simply go to where my blessings are; I go to the scene to which my blessings belong. The blessings and privileges which God has given to me are completely outside this world of sense; and whatever may be said about it, the highest of these lies in the knowledge of God Himself. Who were the most privileged class in Israel? The priests. They had no lot nor inheritance among the people. What was their portion? They had access to God in a figurative way (not really), and they were the only class who approached God. It was the highest privilege God conferred in those days. What are we called to? To have access to God, as we read in Ephesians: "Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father". That is the peculiar privilege which belongs now to the people of God.
{26}
Now I pass on, beloved friends. I merely lay down these two principles: the greatest privilege you can possibly have, consists in the knowledge of God, as He has been pleased to reveal Himself in the Son; and the blessings peculiar to the Christian are outside this world of sense altogether.
I want to dwell upon the first of these verses, and then to show you how the third verse connects itself with the first. "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent". I desire to show what it is to know the Father, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, His sent One. I will speak a word or two at the end as to the capacity, but now I want to speak about what the blessing is in itself. The Lord prays these words (He speaks here as a divine Person): "Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee". He, the Son, prays to be glorified, in order that He may glorify the Father. I wish that God might enable me to make plain, in some degree, the force and meaning of that verse. It is a very great verse. He was no longer to be here in humiliation: He prays to be taken out of humiliation; to be glorified, that He may glorify the Father. One word about the Father. It is a great thing to know the Father, to understand what God intends to convey to us by the name of the Father. There is nothing connected with the name of the Father in Scripture but pure grace. Scripture keeps every other thought apart from the name of the Father. There are things connected with the name of the Son that are not in connection with the Father's name. For instance, judgment is not connected with the Father's name, but is with the Son's, because He, as Son of man, has been humbled. I remember we were once pretty much taught that the Son was for us, and God, as Judge, against us; but Scripture brings before us a very different idea in connection with the name of the
{27}
Father. I beg you to bear in mind, that the thought in Scripture connected with the name of the Father is pure grace. All the counsels of grace flow from the heart of the Father; "As the living Father hath sent me". If you were to go through the whole of the gospel of John, and find every place where "the Father" occurs, you would, I think, find in every one that it is connected with grace. "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work". I hardly know a more precious verse. Do you remember the occasion of it? The Jews were reproaching Jesus for breaking the sabbath. That was His reply. The Father had been working ever since sin came in. He began then to work in grace. We do not see the Father in creation. The Father is the name of God revealed in grace. There never would have been a bit of grace for man, or a hope of salvation, if the Father had not begun to work when sin came in.
When the Son was here, what was the Father doing? He was drawing to the Son. "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him". The Father was drawing to the Son, that souls might be blessed by the Son, that He might bless them, because they were given to Him of the Father. There was, what I might call, the most wonderful administration of grace when the Lord Jesus Christ was here upon earth: the Father drawing to the Son, and the Son delighting to bless those who came, because the Father had drawn them. He delighted in them; He appreciated them, because they were given of the Father. "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out". Why? Because they were drawn to Him by the Father.
Two or three other expressions I refer to: "My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven". The Jews wanted a sign, and said their fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. Jesus answers, "Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the
{28}
bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world". Then, too, I recall another passage in @John 4: "The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth". This is the necessity of what God is; but as to the activity that was going on Jesus says, "the Father seeketh such". I bring these quotations forward to prove my point, and it is a very important one, that Scripture takes care to keep the Father's name connected with grace. All the counsels of blessing belong to the Father. It is a great thing to see the glory of each divine Person. Each divine Person has His own peculiar glory. Counsels belong to the Father. The Son says, "All things that the Father hath are mine", and again, "The Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth". I want you to see the thought connected with the Father's name, and that He is the source of all the counsels of grace.
Now the Lord says, "Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee". What do you think that means? It is not the same thing as the Son of man being glorified, "crowned with glory and honour", as in @Hebrews 2. Here it is the Son of God: "Father, ... glorify thy Son". He prays that He may be taken out of the condition of humiliation into which He had entered, and to be glorified, that He might glorify the Father. How would He glorify the Father? I will tell you: by giving effect to all the Father's counsels of grace. That is the idea which is connected with the Son. He says, "I come to do thy will, O God". He has become the sent One in order that He may accomplish God's will. He is what we may call the Agent, the One who effects all. If He is to give effect to these counsels He must be glorified. He could not give
{29}
effect to them in humiliation. He came down here in humiliation that He might put away sin; but He is no longer here in the place of humiliation. He was down here, and, in a sense, His glory was veiled. It is no longer so now: He is glorified, that He might glorify the Father. These are the thoughts connected in Scripture with the names of these blessed, divine Persons. "The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world". He is the source of all these counsels and we have the Son now glorified to give effect to them.
I pass on now to verse 3, to speak for a moment about the Father and the Son. I wish I knew more about it! I wish I were more in the power of the Holy Spirit to bring it with more unction before you. The great thing is to find an attraction in these names. I think people need to be attracted, to be drawn from the influence and power of things here, and I wish I could present the attraction in the names of the Father and the Son! It is a wonderful thing, that when sin has come in to spoil everything here, we should find there were counsels of blessing in the heart of the Father, the thought as it were of reconstructing everything -- of new creation and all connected with it; and then the Son comes down here in humiliation, taking part in flesh and blood, going down to death that He might put away sin, and then be glorified in order to give effect to all these wondrous divine counsels of the Father; and these counsels are bound up with our blessing, and the blessing of the world too. It is indeed blessed to know this in the midst of this world of ruin and sin. It was wonderful for the Lord to be able to say to a poor woman: "The Father seeketh such to worship him". Sinful, degraded as you are, you are not below the notice of the Father. "My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven"; but He had also to say to the Jews, "Ye also have seen me, and believe not"; and then, there had to be the silent
{30}
work, the drawing of souls to Jesus by the Father. You may depend upon it, beloved friends, heaven will be a wonderful scene; I quite admit we enter into heavenly joys now by anticipation, but heaven will be a wonderful scene, where the Father will be fully known, and the Son, too. These blessings belong not to the earth but to heaven, where the Father and the Son are known without a veil.
"This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent". This is what we are called to! The highest and greatest privilege to which we are called, is to know these divine Persons. To know is a very great word. It does not mean to know there *are* such divine Persons, but as we say in natural language, I *know* such a person: that means, I am intimately acquainted with him, I delight in his company. That is the idea of 'know' here. "This is life eternal, that they might know thee". The Father was to be known as the only true God; and who is the Father? Such a One as I have been trying to bring before you -- the Source of all the counsels of blessing. I often think, when we are in the presence of the Father, whatever we are before the Father, originated in His heart; and it is not only the knowledge of the Father, but of "Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent". I do not think the disciples, when the Lord Jesus was on earth, could completely know Him; and for this reason, His glory was veiled. It could not help being veiled, because of the condition in which He took part as Man down here. But His glory is not veiled any longer; He is glorified; He is taken out of that condition into which He entered down here; He is risen and glorified. And now it is, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent".
I ask every one here tonight, how far do we enter into this? How far do we appreciate that this is the
{31}
privilege and blessing God has conferred upon us? There are many things we rejoice in. People rejoice in the knowledge of salvation, and rightly; and they rejoice in hope of the glory. But what I desire to bring before you is, your present privilege (for it is *present* and not future only), that we should know the Father, the Source of all the counsels of grace, and the Son, who is become the sent One to give effect to all the Father's will.
Two or three other points I desire just to speak of -- our side of it, as I might call it, as to our capacity, and so on. I do not think one could ever understand it, without apprehending first, the position in which we are placed; and the power and capacity God has given by which we can enter into this privilege: for I need hardly say, no creature, as a creature, could enter into it for a single instant. The point is, we are to know the Father and the Son in Their own circle, if you can understand the expression. It is not as the angels know God; they do not know the Father and the Son. The Lord said, "In heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven"; but they do not know the Father in the sense of this verse. You must be in that circle, as the apostle John says in his epistle: "That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ". I do not, of course, mean to say but that the Father has His glory, and the Son His glory; but we are put into that circle. How are we put into that circle? Do you remember a verse in @John 1, "As many as received him, to them gave he power (title) to become the sons of God" etc.? Jesus has given us title to that place (we could not have it without title), the One who died because of what we are; the Son of man lifted up, who has borne the judgment of our state, that He might bring us into His own relationship as Man with the Father. You get it all brought
{32}
out in @John 20, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God". You see that the first thing which He does, as risen from the dead, is to place the disciples in the same relationship as Himself with His Father, and His God. He puts them into this circle and family privilege. Scripture tells us of other families in what one might call the economy of blessing; but I speak of this one family privileged to enjoy communion with the Father and the Son. The first thing is relationship. The youngest babe in Christ that has the Spirit, cries "Abba, Father". I admit it; but I do not think every babe appreciates, and enters into this knowledge of the Father and the Son, as we get it in this verse of @John 17. It belongs to them, the youngest and oldest alike; but to enter into it involves faith, and the knowledge of deliverance. All this belongs to every Christian. Faith in Christ belongs to the babe; deliverance by the death of Christ belongs to the babe as much as to the father, but I question if the babe enters into it as the father does. A very good thing if it were so, but I do not think it is so.
Realisation is a very good word, because you realise what belongs to you; so that with the blessings of the Christian, everything belongs to every Christian alike, but very many Christians may not have realised what belongs to them in the gift of God; but it is none-the-less the gift of God to all alike. It is a very great thing to enter into the enjoyment of this circle of blessing. I ask every one here tonight, Do you know what it is to enjoy fellowship with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ? Manifestly that is outside this world. You have to go in the power of the Holy Spirit by faith outside this world altogether. It is the greatest blessing that God could confer upon us, but it is completely outside this world of sense.
I have spoken about the relationship Christ has
{33}
given us as children; and there is another thing -- the divine nature. I must be according to God as to nature -- one in nature with Christ. If I am not according to the Father and the Son in nature I could not know Them. If I had only human nature, even if it were perfectly pure, I could not know the Father and the Son in this way. We have the nature: it is not only that Christ has given to us the relationship, but the nature. The Son quickeneth whom He will. He quickens after His own order. He gives us a nature suited to the relationship in which He sets us.
Then there is a third thing needed, and that is *power*. We have that, too. The Holy Spirit is power. After the Lord, in @John 20, had conferred upon the disciples relationship, He gave them power. "He breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Ghost". All these things belong to every Christian: every Christian is brought into this privileged circle by the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ has gone to the cross, in order that He might close up my history here; He bore the judgment of my state, so that He might bring me into relationship with His Father and His God. That is what He has done for every believer; every believer is entitled to know it, is set in that relationship; the nature is given by the quickening power of the Son, and the Holy Spirit is given that we may not only have the nature but the power. It is the Spirit of God's Son that is sent forth into the hearts of Christians. As Paul says, "Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father".
Well, now, dear brethren, I feel my great inability to bring the Father and the Son before you according to what I may call Their own proper attractiveness, and indeed it is only the Holy Spirit who can do it; but it is a most wonderful thing to me to think that the Father should have been pleased to reveal Himself in the
{34}
Person of His Son, in the midst of this sin-stricken world. Knowing what the world is, knowing what I am, it is blessed indeed to know what counsels of grace have been in the heart of the Father from all eternity, and that the Son should have become the sent One in order to accomplish all this. "The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world". And here are we brought into all this privilege now -- everything given to us to qualify us for it. We could not have the knowledge without the relationship: and not only the relationship, but the nature and the power also given that we may have fellowship with the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.
I should be inclined to insist strongly upon the importance of faith and deliverance. I do not mean simply the acceptance of the work of Christ for us; that is the beginning; you would not be a believer at all without that, of course; but what characterises the Christian is present faith in Christ. He is to me the Object of faith, and governs my soul because He is; and by His death I am delivered from this present evil world. The link is broken. You will have to go through this world. I quite admit it; but I am sure it is a great thing to realise that you are free from it; it has no claims upon you. I do not care about my status in this world; it is not of moment to me. I pass through in the grace of God, but I am free of it, because the grace of God has set me in a heavenly state and relationship before Him.
I pray God in His grace to come in (if I have not made things clear, and very likely I have not) to present to you the attractiveness of the Father and the Son, that you may know all the blessings in Scripture connected with the Father's name. Christ not only declared the Father, but He manifested the Father's name; @John 17: 6. The wonderful truth that came out was that God could stand in relationship to a man as Father. Jesus manifested His name. I can now
{35}
say, Father; I know Him in the consciousness of His love to me, and I know Him, too, as the Object of my love. Scripture takes the greatest possible pains, as I have said, to keep clear the Father's name from everything but thoughts of grace. Then, too, if you think of the blessed Son: who became Man that He might bear the judgment of our state, who as Son of man was lifted up, and, having glorified God, is Himself glorified, in order that He may give effect to the Father's counsels of grace.
It is only a little while, and all these wonderful things will come to light. We are privileged to enter into them now by faith, but the time will come when these eternal counsels will be fully displayed, and then in heavenly courts we shall rejoice eternally in the knowledge of the Father, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, His sent One. That is the circle to which you and I by grace belong. Our blessing is bound up with the knowledge of these blessed, divine Persons, and the nature and the power is given to us by which we may enjoy this knowledge, which the Lord speaks of in this verse.
Beloved friends, have you ever been really exercised about it? People ought not to remain just upon the threshold of Christianity. Forgiveness of sins, and even the gift of the Holy Spirit, is the threshold, as it were. The point is, to *go in*, to enter into the house -- the circle into which you are brought by grace, to enjoy fellowship with the Father and the Son. We could not know these divine Persons if God had not been pleased to reveal Himself to us.
May God really give us exercise of heart about it, that we may not go on grovelling here, but that we may have grace to go within, and know these blessed, divine Persons where They are at home, if I may so speak. It is a great thing to know a person at home. You never know people till you know them at home. Christ was not at home down here, He was in a foreign
{36}
scene. Now He *is* at home, and we have the power to know Him *there*. We have the relationship, the nature, and the power. Then what do we want more? We want *faith*, and we want *deliverance*. It is not that they are not ours, but we are slow sometimes to accept them.
May God exercise our hearts! I assure you I am exercised about it, and about the miserable, low state of the people of God. How they grovel down here!
May God stir us up, beloved friends, that we may enter now into what is to be our blessed and eternal portion!
{37}
THE FATHER'S THINGS
@John 16: 13 - 16, 23, 28
I do not think there is anyone who would not admit that we can recognise in the New Testament what might be called two parts in the ministry. Paul speaks of it distinctly; there was that which he ministered to those not established, and what he ministered to those who were 'perfect'; he did not minister to the unestablished what he ministered to those who were 'perfect'. "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect", whatever the word 'perfect' may mean; I do not go into that now. One point distinguishes one part of this ministry (I do not quite like to speak here of ministries) from the other; namely, that what he ministered to the perfect were "the deep things of God"; what we are accustomed to understand by that is, that he ministered to them the counsels of God, the things God has purposed for His own glory -- our glory, too, as far as that goes. In connection with that he brings forward the subject, not of what saints *had*, but of what they *were*. The condition of a vast number of souls is, that they need to understand deliverance; they do not apprehend the meaning and power of the work of Christ as deliverance. They know it as justification, but I do not think they know it as deliverance. So long as they are in that state, I do not doubt the apostle would talk to them, and we ought to do the same, of what they *have*; but with the others, the 'perfect', it is what they *are*. When I come to God's purposes, and look at saints in reference to those purposes, it is no longer a question of what saints have, but of what they are in relation to them. In Ephesians it is, "May grow up to him in all things". That is not what I have, but what I am. Growth is in what I am for God. "Holding the truth in love", and so on. I think, in
{38}
another line, we get both things brought out in this chapter; @John 16. The Lord tells the disciples what the Holy Spirit will do. He is referring to the time of the Holy Spirit, and is telling them what He would do. On the one hand, He would bring before them the Father's things that were the Son's; and on the other hand, they would have the freest access to the Father in the name of the Son. I want just to suggest these things. I do not feel I can give a very orderly address, though each of the subjects is vitally important. If we intend to go on, that is what we have set before us.
One thing is very noticeable in this chapter, and distinguishes it from chapter 14. You do not find in it a single 'if'; not a single condition introduced; it is a chapter of privilege; it brings before us God's sphere. It is not a question of our responsible walk, or anything of that kind; it is the sphere of the Father's things which the Holy Spirit is to bring before the disciples; and what marks the end of the chapter is, that they would have the freest access to the Father in the name of the Son. You will find all the latter part of chapter 14 is conditional; it is all on the ground of their walk down here, I can understand it. The great subject of chapter 14 is comfort; and even what comes out -- the Son manifesting Himself and the Father and Son making Their abode with saints -- is all as comfort in the pathway down here. Therefore it is, in a certain sense, conditional on our keeping Christ's word. It is not attainment or anything of that kind; it is all simple. But if they were going on in that pathway, the Lord brings to their minds the comfort they would have in it. But here (chapter 16) there is nothing conditional. You get, if I may say so, the free power of the Holy Spirit, but it is in connection with the sphere and range of the Father's things; and this is what I want to say a word about for a moment.
{39}
Jesus says, "All things that the Father hath are mine". He says of the Holy Spirit, "He shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you". If I understand the expression at all (and I only suggest it), when the Lord speaks of "all things that the Father hath", it brings before us the whole universe of bliss, the Father's purpose, which is to be filled by the Son. Another point is, this has been revealed to *us*; it is *real* to us. I could hardly say the same thing when the Lord Jesus was down here, although He did say, "All things are delivered unto me of my Father"; but now He is exalted, glorified; and therefore the whole range of the Father's counsels comes to us as truth. That is a very great expression, "He will guide you into all truth". You say, You are leading us on to the ground of imagination! No. I would seek to lead you on to the ground of *faith*. Christ is in glory; everything is established in Him. I am not dealing with imagination, but I would seek that our souls may understand that expression; "All things that the Father hath are mine", and all the range of the Father's counsels and purposes which He will display in His blessed Son, who is glorified. That comes to us in the way of *truth*. It is for faith, and not something to minister to imagination. It is revealed by the "Spirit of truth". "He will guide you into all truth". He would bring before the hearts and minds of the disciples the whole range of the Father's counsels. That was to be the world in which faith was to live.
I should like to say a word in connection with this. This present world is not truth; the principle of the world is not truth; there is nothing truthful about it; the world is a great falsehood, there is no doubt about that. The god and prince of this world is a usurper. We have to pass through it, and the Spirit of God carries us through it, and the grace of God keeps us, and we experience many a mercy of God as we pass
{40}
through, but the character of the world is false. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, everything false and evil, nothing of truth in it. The prince of the world is, as I said, a usurper. There is nothing of truth in this organisation which we are accustomed to think of as the world. But everything is truth in the Father's universe; the Father's world is what *is* truth. All the counsels and purposes of the Father are to be fulfilled in the Son, on the ground of redemption. He has exalted Him far above all heavens that He may fill all things. Christ has not only cleared the ground, but He is going to occupy the ground He has cleared. He fills the whole of God's universe. That is what the Father has purposed, and what will be accomplished in the Son; and the pledge of it is, the Son is no longer here in the place of weakness, but in the glory of God, in the highest place, as we get in the next chapter: "Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee". He was to give the fullest effect to all that was purposed.
That was what the Spirit of truth was to bring before the minds of the disciples. If we are in the power of the Spirit, that is the world in which faith lives. It is not a world of imagination, but a world of truth. Christ is in the place of power and glory. If we are living here in the faith of Christ, in the power and energy of the Holy Spirit, I have no doubt faith will delight itself in this vast universe of bliss. We sing of it sometimes
<blockquote>"Of the vast universe of bliss,<br>The Centre Thou, and Sun". (`11:4)</blockquote>
Not only is He the Head of it, He is to fill it all according to God's counsels. He is the Lamb of God; He has died for it all. He takes away the sin of the world, and He establishes the universe according to God, and fills it with blessing. He brings us to a scene of blessing of which He is the centre and glory.
I only say that much to bring in the latter part of
{41}
the chapter. We may put ourselves in the place of the disciples in this chapter. We find ourselves in the presence of God's counsels. The first thing is this Jesus goes to the Father. He says, "A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father". A puzzle to them! The reason He gives is of all moment -- "because I go to the Father". We should say, naturally, that would bring to an end their seeing Him. But no; His going to the Father really meant their going to the Father. He did not go back to the Father merely for Himself. He did go back to the Father; His place was there. He might have gone alone for the matter of that; but He went back in the value of redemption, and so made a way for us there. His going there means our going there. We have free access to the Father. He says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me". And the first thing that comes out here is this: He is gone to the Father, and we now have joy, *because* He is gone to the Father. That is a wonderful thing. Not only are the whole range of God's counsels revealed, but we have access to the Father, as the apostle puts it, "In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him". The Holy Spirit not merely conducts us through our responsible life down here, but maintains us in liberty with the Father, in the name of the Son. "Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father". Jesus went to the Father. Because of that they would have joy; they were not to lose Him. It is a wonderful chapter, as opening out a new order of things. They had known the Lord Jesus down here, coming down, if one might so say, to the level of their weakness. They had valued His company; He had revealed to them the Father's name. But this chapter is in contrast to all that; it opens out the range of divine glory. He was going to the Father,
{42}
and because of that they would have liberty there.
I come to another point; and mark, there are no 'ifs' because it is a question of the free power of the Holy Spirit. He connects us with this new order of things. "In that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full". It is illimitable; and why? Because now we find ourselves in connection with the scene that is to be filled with the Son. "My name" -- that Name represents the Son in His absence; and whatever we ask in the name of the Son, the Father will give it to us. But we must lay hold of the first principle of the chapter, that the Son is to fill God's universe. The moment has not come for that (in display), but the Son is to fill *me*; we are to be filled with Him, and now we have the freest liberty to ask whatever will promote the Son in us.
It is a blessed thing to go to the Father in liberty. I am bent upon one thing; I do not want to do the best I can for myself in this world; in fact, I do not care so very much about this world, but I do care that the Son should fill me, that He should be promoted in saints. I want Him to displace everything in me that is not of Himself. It is practically "as the truth is in Jesus". The "having put off ... the old man ... and your having put on the new man". There is the displacing of the one thing to make space for the other. The great point is, that the Son should be promoted in me, and the same in every other saint of God.
If you want to seize the idea, I think you must get hold of the first part of the chapter, that is, all the counsels of God centred in the Son. The counsels are of the Father; the accomplishment of those counsels is by and in the Son; the Holy Spirit indwells the believer, and gives effect subjectively in the believer to those counsels as established in the Son.
{43}
It is just those two thoughts I desire to bring before you: what the Spirit of God would do in the disciples; the world of faith He would bring before them. Truth is a real thing, and these counsels of the Father are revealed and made true to us by the Spirit of truth. "He will guide you into all truth". What a thing it is to live in the presence of this wonderful revelation; to be led by the Spirit of truth into these eternal divine secrets! And then to know what the Father desires us to be; what the Lord desired for His disciples down here, that He might be promoted in them; whatsoever they asked the Father in His name He would do it.
I cannot improve the world, but I can seek that the Son should have His fullest place in me, and in every saint, and that everything else should be displaced. There is a complete end of the old man in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ; and all that has to be worked out, practically in detail, in every one of us. We want conscience, as we have heard, that the truth should do its work practically, and that the truth, as in Jesus, should have its place -- the disallowing of the first man, that there should be the fullest room for the Son in our hearts.
I only want to indicate these two thoughts in this chapter of deepest import; it paves the way for the prayer in the next chapter; chapter 17. Chapter 14 is the comfort of the Holy Spirit; chapter 15, the testimony of the Holy Spirit; but in chapter 16 the Lord shows what the Holy Spirit would do in bringing before the minds of the disciples this new and wonderful order of things established in Himself.
May God give us to apprehend our place in this realm of faith -- to *live* there. It is not a question of what we have; we have everything. It is a question of what we are to grow in, and of what is to be promoted in us by the power of the Spirit of God.

THE DEATH OF THE LORD
1 Corinthians
It has been observed that in the first epistle to the Corinthians the apostle reverts continually to the death of Christ, while in the second epistle, the glory of the Lord seems to be that which is occupying his soul, and is the standpoint from which he speaks. It is quite remarkable how the death of Christ is interwoven in the treatment of each succeeding subject in the first epistle; and it would seem that, in the application of that death to the Christian conscience, a sort of progress is observable; and this it is desired, with the Lord's help, to bring under notice.
It is evident that there were many things in the state of the Corinthians calling for correction, and these defects are in general dealt with by pointing out their inconsistency with the death of the Lord, which is to the Christian the test of things, whether in himself or in the world. Further, there can be little doubt that the levity with which the death of the Lord was regarded, accounted in some degree for the toleration amongst them of some who denied resurrection. For had they entered into the varied import of Christ's death, they must have apprehended the necessary consequence (morally) of Christ's resurrection; and the resurrection of Christ is the pledge of the resurrection of saints, as well as of the judgment of all men.
The apostle begins in reference to the schisms existing at Corinth, and the tendency to attach importance to men and to human wisdom. He recalls the great, and one might almost say, exclusive, subject of his testimony among them -- Christ crucified. The great groundwork laid by God had been, that in sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
{45}
He had condemned sin in the flesh; man's state as in the flesh -- the old man -- had in the cross been brought to an end judicially before God. While this is the foundation of grace, it at the same time declares that man is good for nought, whether for wisdom or for righteousness. Hence the folly of glorying in men. The want of apprehension on the part of the Corinthians of the import of the cross of Christ, hindered the apostle unfolding to them the hidden wisdom of God. But the defect had not been in the testimony presented. Many a Christian accepts Christ's death as the ground of forgiveness, who knows little of its meaning as the judgment of the flesh and the world system with it. Still the testimony presented had left no room, nor given any excuse, for the exaltation of men.
But to pass on to the next reference to the death of Christ, which is found in chapter 5. Here the question is as to the character of the assembly, and so of each member in it. The assembly were the people of God at Corinth, and Christ their passover had been sacrificed for them, and this was to become the test of their state. They could not connect the passover and the old leaven. They must be in suitability to it -- must, as a redeemed people, keep the feast with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. This is to characterise us during the complete period of our sojourn here, for we must remember, that the things typified by institutions of periodical recurrence under the law, are to the Christian constant and characteristic. We see thus that, as the cross of Christ was the cutting down of man in his pretensions, so that we should not glory in men, the sacrifice of Christ is the test of character in a redeemed people.
The next distinct allusion to the death of Christ is found at the close of the subject treated in chapters 8 - 10. The question raised was as to the liberty of a Christian to perform an act, or to enter into an association
{46}
that might be construed by others into an acknowledgement of idols. The apostle, while maintaining Christian liberty, in his conclusion enjoins the most rigid withdrawal from idolatry. He speaks to the saints as to wise men, and presses on their attention that the cup of blessing which they blessed and the bread they broke, was the fellowship of the death of Christ. He does not speak here of the position which a Christian occupies as having been committed to Christ's death in baptism, but of the habitual participation of that in which Christ's death is symbolised, and in which act, intelligent appreciation of, and delight in that death, are expressed by each and by all -- the fellowship of the saints, as one body in the death of Christ. This made evident the impossibility of fellowship with anything that was an object of worship in Satan's world, a system which includes many things venerated by men. The Lord who had died would have no part with Satan, nor allow His people to raise any such question between Himself and Satan. We see then that Christ's death is the true test of objects here that claim the homage of men.
Finally, in chapters 11 to 14 we have the correction of disorder in the assembly as convened, and the first point has reference to the Lord's supper. Here it is that the Lord's death is brought in in the most touching way. The commemoration of it, according to the order of this scripture, appears to be the introduction to spiritual exercises and manifestations in the assembly; and lightness in this commemoration is wholly unsuitable. The failing, in eating, to discern the Lord's body, arising from lack of self-judgment, brought in chastisement. The spring of becoming conduct in the assembly is suitability in spirit to the Lord's death, and the first occupation there, is remembrance of Him in death, the affections responding to the love manifested in the giving up of His life for us. This is indeed a suitable prelude to the exercise of
{47}
gifts in love to, and desire for, the edifying of His members here.
To sum up, we have seen that the death of Christ is the test of human pretensions, of character, of associations, and of fitness in the assembly. It forbids the exaltation of man, and the allowance of the old leaven in the saints. It demands rigid separation in the whole body from idolatrous associations in Satan's world, and calls for self-judgment on the part of all in the assembly as gathered. Saints are to bear the impress of it in every circumstance. In every sphere, and in all its ways the assembly is to be free from conformity to man.
A word is added, in conclusion, on a point already indicated. It must be admitted, that any person having any degree of spiritual apprehension of the reality and meaning of Christ's death, would be impressed with the necessary sequence of His resurrection. He must be the first to rise from the dead; and once the truth of His resurrection is accepted, there is little difficulty as to the resurrection of the saints. This is the line of argument in @1 Corinthians 15, and we may conclude that lack of conformity in the Corinthians to Christ's death was the secret of the allowance among them of a denial of resurrection. Saints are established in the faith of the latter, in having in their souls the solemn and practical bearing of the former.
{48}
THE GLORY OF THE LORD
@2 Corinthians 3 - 5
There is avowedly and manifestly in this epistle a contrast to what is found in the first. The apostle's mouth was open to the Corinthians, his heart enlarged; even though the response in them was not complete. He is free to bring before them the wonderful nature of the ministry, and the way in which the vessel is fitted for and maintained in the ministry.
The ministry, as presented in these chapters, refers to the gospel. It does not go on to the mystery, to our union with Christ and with one another. But the basis of the gospel is enlarged beyond what is found in Romans, where the groundwork is the death and resurrection of Christ. The light, here, is the glad tidings of the glory of Christ. The knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ has shone forth as light. Evidently, the prominent truth is of the elevation in which man, in the Person of Christ, has, so to say, been installed of God; and this glory is producing its effects now on those looking at it.
We have seen, in a previous paper, how, in the first epistle, the death of the Lord is continually introduced as being, for a Christian, the test of everything here; and this must indeed be so, seeing that it is the one point where truth as to everything has been absolutely expressed. The exaltation of man on earth and fleshly leaven in the saints are rebuked by it. In the second epistle we have the great idea presented to us of the glory of the Lord as the standard, and conformity to that glory as the end now for man. This is, manifestly, a completely new order of things for man.
In chapter 3 of this epistle, the ministry, that which marks this epoch, is presented to us. It is an accepted time; a day of salvation. Not the establishment outwardly
{49}
of the new covenant in the way of public relations with an earthly people, but the introduction of an era in which the blessings (in principle) of that covenant are ministered here, with the view of forming a people for the glory of God.
Instead of there coming from the place of God a demand on man for righteousness, there was the ministration, as from God by Christ, in effective power, of the Spirit and righteousness of that which fitted and qualified man for God Himself in His own place -- that which is embodied and expressed in the last Adam, the quickening Spirit -- and the result is that the believer, having received all from there, can look at the glory of the Lord and be conformed to it in moral and increasing superiority to all here. That glory is connected in his thoughts with grace, and not with law, with giving instead of demanding. God is known in a new way, as Jesus said to the woman of Samaria, "If thou knewest the gift (giving) of God".
Now in the glory of the Lord there is, as in the glory in the face of Moses, the witness and proof of the divine origin of the covenant; and hence the apostle made no secret of this glory. He obscured it neither in walk nor word. If his gospel was veiled, it was veiled in them that were lost. If we would understand the nature of the ministry, we need to be instructed as to the glory of Christ: that glory is, in truth, its sanction. All has to be learnt in what has been effected in Christ, and this is the substance of the testimony. In Him, man has been taken from the lowest place (sin having been put away, and God glorified) and exalted to the very highest. Christ has been exalted far above all heavens, to fill all things. He has secured for man a heavenly order and place, and Himself rests in it. He is the image there of God. The Holy Spirit has come to bring report of His glory, and works here in power by gifts for the deliverance of man and for forming him according to Christ. Further, in this
{50}
exaltation is seen the glory *of God*, His peculiar blessedness. He has raised up man out of death in the virtue of redemption, and set him in heavenly glory. Satan and man pull down and destroy. God raises up; @John 2: 19. It is His peculiar and blessed prerogative to bring man out of death, the fruit and judgment of sin, in heavenly suitability. In this is displayed the power and glory of God; @John 12: 28. The testimony of this illuminates and certifies the ministry of the new covenant. The knowledge of the exaltation of man in the Person of Christ in the efficacy of redemption, and the glory of God displayed in it, are the assurance to the soul of the reality of the blessings ministered from Christ. He has reached the glory from the lowest place, where man is in nature, and is in the highest in the interests of man; to deliver him from everything that He has Himself overcome, and to conform him to Himself there. We can understand thus the ministry of the Spirit and righteousness.
There are two other points that come before us in this connection. First of these, are the motives that were effective in the apostle to maintain him suitably in this ministry. If God wrought specially by him in the introduction of this era of heavenly blessing, it had to be made manifest that the power was of God. The vessel must be broken, that the light might shine out. The apostle had to be practically divested of all sense of human competency, and set free from the influence of worldly motives, to be the instrument in carrying out this ministry. He must be independent of every influence, and of all fear of consequences, carrying his life in his hand, confident in every condition. We see how all this was effected and maintained in him by the power and grace of God.
Further, in dealing with men, he must himself be alive to the realities which men have to face, so as to be in a condition to persuade men. He had to deal, practically, with consciences and hearts -- the moral
{51}
elements in man. If men were to find in Christ their life and righteousness before God, it could not be without exercise of conscience. They had to be brought under the fear of the Lord, and to a sense of their state of alienation from God. Here was the point where the apostle was brought, practically, into contact with the moral elements and necessities in man, persuading and beseeching. Not only bearing testimony of the blessings existing for man in a glorified Christ, but dealing with men in reference to their state, beseeching them to be reconciled to God. At the same time announcing to them the great groundwork of this ministry of reconciliation, in that God had made Him, that knew no sin, to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. Thus we find, that underneath the fact of Christ having been made sin, lay the wonderful conception of divine grace, that men, once wholly controlled and characterised by sin, should become the expression of this divine righteousness before the heavenly principalities through all eternity, and should be made His God's delight as regards righteousness.
Such are the glad tidings of the glory of Christ, the blessed answer, to His having been made sin, and the pledge and assurance of what is in Him for man, through grace, and ministered through the inspired word of the apostle.
{52}
THINGS OLD AND NEW
@Galatians 3
What I want to bring before you is the way in which God has seen fit to present Himself to us in respect of His purpose. This is a point of moment, especially at a time when Christianity is in decay in this world. The house of God has been corrupted in the hand of man, and has become a great house. The grace of God has been neutralised to a large extent in Christendom by mixing gospel and law. But if this is recognised in the soul, the point for us is to fall back on the purpose of God, for it is impossible that God can be diverted from His purpose. Behind the testimony in the early days of Christianity, God had His purposes. In @Luke 24, the Lord gives the apostles their commission: "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem". That was the testimony in which God saw fit to approach man. Forgiveness of sins and inheritance are the two terms of God's testimony. But behind this testimony, God was setting to work to accomplish the counsel of His will. The name of God was blasphemed through Israel, but God will accomplish His purpose in Israel. The name of God may be blasphemed -- and is largely blasphemed -- through Christianity, but God will surely accomplish His purpose in Christianity. He cannot be diverted from it; and therefore, in a day of ruin like that in which our lot is cast, it is highly important, for the establishment of our souls, that we should enter into the apprehension of the purpose of God.
Now, when God speaks of His purpose, you commonly get the expression in Scripture, "in Christ Jesus". Christ Jesus is the vessel of God's purpose.
{53}
Anyone can readily see the difference in speaking of Christ as Lord and Saviour, and the presentation of Him to us as the vessel of God's purpose -- the expression and revelation of it. It is a wonderful thing that God has made His counsel known to us, His counsel in a living Man. You could not learn it simply by reading the scripture; it is made known to us in a living, glorified Man.
Every promise of God is in Christ Jesus, and He is presented to us so that our hearts may receive instruction in the counsel of God. All will see the importance of being instructed of God. If I saw what God's purpose is concerning me, I would not desire to thwart it or to hinder it; I cannot further it; but I think it is very possible to hinder its effectuality in one's own soul. The Galatians had begun in the Spirit, and now the apostle had to say to them, "Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?" What is the truth? The truth is the expression of God's will. We have the letter of the truth in Scripture, but the Spirit is the Spirit of the truth. It is a most important thing for us to know the truth; the Lord said to the Jews, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free". When you get an insight into the counsel of God, and all that is contained in His will, the practical result in you is that you are brought into liberty, and then your anxiety will be not to thwart His purpose.
I hope that you will take in the thought I have referred to, namely, that when God speaks to us as to His purpose, you get the expression, "in Christ Jesus". It occurs two or three times in this chapter. One instance of it is in verse 14: "That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ"; and again, "For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus".
Now, there are certain blessings which, as Christians, we get down here, which are incidental to our being
{54}
on earth. For instance, we get the forgiveness of sins, and this in Christ; but the counsel of God's will is something of a different order from that. The calling of the Christian is involved in the counsel of God's will. What I have as a man down here, the forgiveness of sins and the inheritance, is incidental to me as in the place of responsibility here on earth. The counsel of God's will has its own character, and if you get into the sense of it, you reach the line on which God is working, and that is very important. The effect of it will be that you will have experience of the power of God. I think that a great many Christians have but a poor sense of the power of God, because, as to their sense of things, they are not on the line on which God is working: but on the line of His counsels, you get a great sense of His power. What power of man can compare with the power of God? God is working here according to His mighty power to accomplish all the counsel of His will.
What we get in this chapter (I am only going to dwell on two points in it) is the blessing of Abraham that in Christ Jesus has come to the Gentiles, and sonship -- in other words, things old and new. There are certain things in Christianity which are new, that never were revealed before; but there are also things which are taken up from the Old Testament. The Lord Jesus said to His disciples in @Matthew 13, after He had spoken all the parables recorded there, "Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old" (verse 52). If I speak about the blessing of Abraham, that is not new. I will tell you what *is* new about it, that is the way in which it has reached the Gentiles. But the blessing of Abraham was not in itself new. But when you come to the truth of sonship at the close of the chapter, that is new. Sonship never could come to light until Christ came. Paul says about
{55}
himself in the beginning of this epistle, "But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me". That was a very new testimony indeed. It did not form part of the blessing of Abraham, or of what God had made known to him. Abraham had his blessing, and we, too, have part in that blessing; but sonship could not be known until the Son of God became Man. When the Father revealed Christ to Peter, the latter entered into it to some extent, he got at least a glimpse of it; he apprehended the Lord in a new light. He had received Him, and believed on Him as the Christ, the son of Abraham and son of David, but now in the Son of God he had the light and expression of the divine purpose, and that was a great point to come to, because on that line, as I have said, God is working. Nothing can be more confirmatory to the soul of the saint than to get experience of the power of God.
Now, as to the blessing of Abraham reaching the Gentiles, I will first endeavour to tell you what the blessing of Abraham was. In fact it is stated here "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness". In believing God, in the eye of God, Abraham disappeared. He disappeared from the position in which he was as a man in this world, under death, but, on the other hand, he was approved of God; God took account of him for another world. He believed God. But do you think that God was going to endorse anything in Abraham? Not at all. In faith he was gone; but there was the other side of it; God counted his faith to him for righteousness. That has never come into effect yet. It will do so in another scene. Christ said, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad", and in the day of Christ, God's reckoning of Abraham will come to light. God accounted it to him for righteousness, but though he had this reckoning from
{56}
God, yet as to himself, looked at as a man in this world, Abraham disappeared. That is, I judge, the principle underlying it, and, in fact, you could not come into blessing in any other way. Take a Jew in this world, under the curse of a broken law, and the judgment of death. The law was the ministration of death; it made matters worse, it added the curse to death. Man was already under death, and the law came and added the curse. This was a terrible position for man to be in; how was man to escape it? That man must disappear. Abraham disappears, but he reappears, according to the reckoning of God. I do not doubt but that is God's way; it is the way in which, by faith, we pass out of the judgment of death and the curse.
But now, as to the way in which the blessing has reached the Gentiles. It is in Christ Jesus; "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith". The Son of God became Man, He accepted the place of the curse, and entered into the judgment according to God. This was according to the will of God. He says, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God", and in the accomplishment of the will of God He disappears as after the flesh in death. Christ died, but He reappeared in resurrection, not after the flesh, but according to the power of God. He left death and the curse behind, and He reappeared as the communicator of the Spirit. He comes out as the Last Adam and the Second Man. Death and the curse were in our cup, but Christ took the cup; He died out of the state to which it belonged, but He reappeared in the power of God's victory, and as a life-giving Spirit to men. Christ is marked out in John's gospel as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the
{57}
world", but at the same time, He is the One who "baptises with the Holy Spirit".
Well, the same principle is true in regard of us. God communicates to the believer the gift of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the proof that, as after the flesh, you have disappeared from under the eyes of God. It is on that ground alone that God could communicate the Spirit. "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you". The history of the flesh, in this sense, has for God's glory been closed up in the death of Christ in order that Christ might communicate the Spirit to men. But what I feel is that, though we have received the Spirit, it is a long time before we understand that we have disappeared as after the flesh. We have each to learn that in its own proper way, and this takes us a long time. As a matter of fact, you may be sure that you disappeared after the flesh in the eye of God before God ever communicated the Spirit to you. It was really in the death of Christ; but when it comes to the question of what is true as regards our consciousness, it is a long time before we come to that point.
When you do come to it, you are brought into Christian liberty. The Holy Spirit is the witness on God's part to the Christian that he has disappeared after the flesh, but what is true in God's eye is a very different thing from what is true in our eye. God has arrived at the truth from His side, but we have to arrive at it, beloved friends, from our side. I do not think that you get practically free of the flesh until you have first learned what the flesh is; in the same way, you do not get free from sin until you have learnt what sin is; but you would never learn these lessons if God had not given you the Holy Spirit. And when in the goodness of God we have learnt that, as after the flesh and as under judgment, death and the curse, we have disappeared, then we have reached the point where God began.
{58}
Now, take the case of the Galatians. They had begun in the Spirit, the apostle takes them up on that ground. They had believed God's testimony, and God had imparted to them the gift of the Spirit, but they had not learnt that they had disappeared from the place of men under the curse. If they had, do you think they would have put themselves afresh under the law? Who would be such a madman as that? The fact is, they had not entered into the truth. The practical working of the truth in the soul is this, that, as regards this scene, I am content to disappear; I have been buried. Our righteousness and acceptance with God belongs to another scene, another world. In this scene of sin, the true path for the Christian is to get out of sight. You were out of sight in God's eye as after the flesh when God communicated to you the gift of the Holy Spirit.
It is a great thing for a saint to know that he is accepted by God apart from works entirely. He has accepted you in regard of a scene which will be according to His pleasure, and when God reveals that scene, His acceptance will come to light. In that day you will have glory with Christ.
I think you will see the importance of understanding this principle which has been verified in Christ, that is, of passing out of sight as under the judgment and curse, and reappearing as the recipients of the Spirit. We have disappeared as in one life, but have reappeared in another. The blessing of Abraham has come on the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
What I have been speaking about hitherto, are "things old" -- the blessing of Abraham, and that side of things. The promise of blessing was first made to Abraham: "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed", and afterwards confirmed to the seed of Abraham in @Genesis 22. The same promise was made: "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
{59}
blessed". This plainly contemplates that which has now been fulfilled here, namely, the blessing of Abraham reaching the Gentiles -- not in Abraham, but in the Seed of Abraham, in Christ Jesus, in view of the promise of the Spirit.
But in the New Testament the truth comes to light that the seed of Abraham was the Son of God, and that brings in the things "new". You could hardly have learnt *that* in the Old Testament; when we read the Old Testament in the light of the New, we see many things much more clearly. The fact is, I have sometimes thought that one might put the New Testament before the Old, for it is in the light of the New Testament that you understand the Old. The prophets did not understand the prophecies; it is *we* who understand them. The Old Testament scriptures were not written for the contemporaries. Christianity is the real beginning for God. I quite admit that God had taken a people provisionally, but as to the accomplishment of God's counsels, the beginning was Christ, and the continuation of Christ is Christianity. We have come to the consummation of the ages and the starting-point is at the end of testing. God has set to work to accomplish the counsel of His will.
Now, as I said before, Christ Jesus is not only the Seed of Abraham, but the Son of God. We read in verse 24, "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. For ye are all the children (or sons) of God, by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptised unto Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise". Now, I think this, that the expression "in Christ Jesus" invariably refers to Christ in resurrection.
{60}
He is the expression, the revelation, of God's purpose. Christ was always that, but this did not come out fully until He was severed from all connection with man after the flesh. When Christ came forth out of death by the mighty power of God, then it is that you get the full light of God's counsel in man. I think you will see the force of this in connection with the apostle Paul. Paul probably never knew Christ after the flesh. He says, "*If* even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer". He knew Christ only in glory; Christ appeared to him from heaven, that is the first light which Paul ever got of Christ. And that is the full expression of God's purpose in regard to the church.
Now, I dare say some would say, But does not the expression 'children, or sons of God', occur in the Old Testament? I know it does. Adam was in a sense son of God. 'Son of God' is an expression which is applied to the angels. Israel is called son of God; you will remember God's word to Pharaoh, "Israel is my son, my firstborn". But all these expressions are more or less vague, and you must take each one in its connection. Israel had a special place on earth in relation to God, and God owns it. So, too, the angels are called sons of God. But that does not explain to you the idea of 'sons of God' as brought to light in the New Testament. If you want to know what 'sons of God' means, as we know it in Christianity, you must learn it in Christ Jesus. You get a statement in the next chapter: "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law", what for? "That we might receive sonship". God thus made known the counsel of His will. Christ came "that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship". The purpose of His coming was the accomplishment of God's will, and in that way God presents Christ Jesus as Son of God, the pattern of what we
{61}
are going to be. Was there anything like Christ until Christ came? A blessed Man, who could declare the Father's name, and was in the consciousness of the Father's love -- that is what Christ was down here. There had been men of faith according to God's heart, but in Christ is seen something totally new -- which never could have been made known until the Lord came from heaven. So Jesus said, "We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen". That was His testimony in this world. When Christ rose again from the dead, a great many things were altered, but His relation to the Father was not altered. Christ was cut off and had nothing, but this could not affect His relation to the Father. He sends, in @John 20, the message by Mary to the disciples: "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God". There was a new platform, and that was association with God's Son: He calls them His brethren in sending that wonderful message. He was the pattern of their place; if they would know what they were in the eye of God, they could learn it alone in Christ risen again from the dead. God "has predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brethren". Now, what the apostle says to the Galatians is this: "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus". There are a great many things that many Christians do not understand. They do not apprehend how they have disappeared from the eye of God in the cross of Christ; but I can say to the youngest or the most advanced Christian, you are the object of God's counsel, God has His own purpose about you, and that is sonship, and sonship is His gift. You could not become a son of God in any other way except by His gift. "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus", that is, that in Christ Jesus, God has revealed the counsel of His will in regard to us, and that is sonship. Now, mark the greatness of it;
{62}
see what the apostle says here, speaking of it: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus". All is on resurrection ground. It is only on that ground that these distinctions after the flesh can be escaped from. Sonship is on resurrection ground, and why? Because Christ is on resurrection ground. He was, as here, the corn of wheat that would have abode alone, but in resurrection there is a new platform on which He is not ashamed to call the saints His brethren. It is on that line that God is working, bringing many sons to glory. You may testify to people in this world what great things God has done for you, and has had mercy on you, but you will have but little real power in this world in God's testimony, except as you are in the light of God's calling. The lack of this is the cause of the great weakness that marks our testimony.
Now, I want to say a word to indicate to you how God is forming you according to His purpose. God puts you first into the relationship, and then gives you the Spirit of it. If you have not got the qualification for the relationship, you are not fit for it. It is the sovereign will of God that puts you in the place, but not only does He put you in that place, but He proceeds to form you for the place. And the beginning of this is, "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us", @Romans 5: 5. Sonship conveys nothing if it does not mean that I am in the love of God, that is by the Holy Spirit. If you get the sense of the love of God, you will respond to that love, but you can only enter into it as you are taught of God. Do not suppose that you are taught by me; no teaching will really stand except that which is of the anointing, which is of God. The scripture says, "They shall be all taught of God". Christians are *divinely* taught. You may be helped by the words of one or another, but nevertheless, it is
{63}
that which is of the anointing that stands, and the effect of that teaching is that you are assured that God loves you, and you then answer to that love.
Now, that is the value of sonship. Eternal relations are established between God and the Christian, the principle and character of which is, that I am the object of His love, and that I love God; and more than that, I am of a company of which God's own Son is the blessed and eternal Head and Centre. He has taken that place; "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee", @Hebrews 2: 12. He leads the praises of the assembly. All praise will be led by Christ; it is most wonderful how this opens out in the Psalms: "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee", and then, "My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation", and "I will sing unto thee among the nations". My conviction is this, that in the millennium all praise will be led by Christ. I cannot tell the manner of it, but I believe it will be. Every circle will be conscious that Christ praises there, whether it be the great congregation, or the nations. Christ is the centre, because He not only reveals God, but sustains all. The light of God has come to us in Christ, but He has taken the priestly place on man's side. We see Him taking up everything on man's behalf, so that He becomes the leader in every circle.
Now, our calling is sonship. You get this truth substantiated in the beginning of the epistle to the Ephesians. God has predestinated us to sonship to Himself. I would like Christians to be in the blessed reality of God's calling, as to their consciousness of things, and on the line on which the power of God operates. This may not be a mighty display, it is a mighty *power*. The great power of God is exercised in leading saints into the consciousness of God's love, and in giving them to respond to that love. God may put forth His power in many ways, but that is the line
{64}
on which the power of God is operating at this time, to make His love a great reality to the hearts of Christians, so that they may be a worshipping company. "I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them", @John 17: 26.
Now, I trust you will keep together the things old and new; the blessing of Abraham, and God's call into the place of sonship. Do not put things off to the future. God puts us into the relationship *now*, and not only that, but He forms us by His divine power, according to the relationship in which He has been pleased to put us.
May He give us to understand something of the greatness of association with Christ!
{65}
WHAT IS TRUTH?
I think this is a legitimate and important subject of inquiry -- and the more so as by the inquiry we are enabled to apprehend what sin is in principle. It is certain that in the coming of the Son of God into the world, the two great forces that were in conflict were the truth and sin.
Before going further into the subject, it may perhaps be assumed, that truth is, on the one side, the setting forth and expression of what is of God, and therefore in nature divine, and, on the other, the consistency of the creature morally with the position in which God has set it. It is evident that on the latter side only could sin come in, and consequently sin can never be co-extensive with truth.
In Christ we see the perfect realisation of truth. He is the truth. In Him has been fully set forth what is of God in nature and character before men; and at the same time, He has maintained before God, in true moral suitability, every position which as Man He was content to occupy in His presence. He set the Lord always before Him.
Of God, as such, it is said He is true; but not that He is the truth. In the Son is the expression -- He is the Word. Hence it is not difficult to see that Christ is the test of everything.
Now sin in its fullest character and development sets itself to oppose and resist the truth. Had not Christ come and spoken to the Jews, they had not had sin, and the logical conclusion of this resistance of the truth is, that the man of sin takes advantage of the rejection of Christ to show himself as God.
The beginning of sin was, I judge, when the creature turned to itself as an object, and so ceased to have God as such. It departed from God. That is first
{66}
seen in the devil, who sins from the beginning, and abode not in the truth. He first became enamoured of his own beauty, and puffed up, and afterwards, as it seems to me, coveted a position that God had given to man (as head and centre of a system) and had not given to an angel. Morally, Satan ceased to be in the truth of the creature. His position he could not change, but was no longer in moral accordance with it.
The same may be said of man. Being tempted, he sought to be as God, knowing good and evil. He, too, became an object to himself; self came in, and sought elevation, and he ceased to be in moral consistency with the position of the creature, though he could not alter that position. He stood not in the truth. The climax, as we have seen, is in the man of sin, the son of perdition. Backed up by Satan and worldly power, he opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God, or worshipped, and sets himself in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. He virtually says there is no God in the heavens, and man on earth is God. He has truly become an object to himself, and would be to others. He has wholly ceased to be in the truth of his position as a creature.
Now sin being such, and working in this way, it is evident that it must ever resist the truth, since in the truth there is the setting forth, not only of what God is in His blessed nature, but of what the creature should be before God. As we have seen, all this is found in Christ, and, in taking away the sin of the world, He Himself comes in as the truth. But this must be gone into a little more in detail.
The Son of God has come forth, become Man, not only full of grace and truth, but Himself the truth. This seems to point to a wholly new order of things in the universe, in that everything, instead of standing on its own footing of responsibility, will be established in and maintained by Christ. The first great step in this is in His having become Man. Though truly God,
{67}
and ever expressing here what was of God; yet, having come into the position of the creature, He never ceased to be in moral suitability to the position He had taken. Perfect God-ward, in love, dependence, and confidence, He pleased not Himself. And all this comes out most distinctly in His death. In obedience He laid down a life in which sin had no place, and on which death had no claim; but was in suffering in perfect moral accordance with the character of God, though made sin that He might remove it from before God, and be Himself eternally separated from it, that He might in result take away the sin of the world, so that there might be a new creation in those that had been of the old. Hence we have sin removed, while Christ abides, the truth.
We arrive now at this point, that all is shut up in Christ. In Him alone is the eternal security of blessing -- since in Him, not only is God's nature displayed, but everything, every position in heaven or on earth, is headed up in Him in whom it will be set forth suitably to the character of God who created it.
Hence in the millennium it is not so much man, as Christ, that comes into view. He, so to speak, covers all. All is secured and maintained in Him. He fills all in all. It is of moment to see how everything, law, old covenant, flesh, old creation, the world, have all been brought to an end before God in Christ, and that He remains who is to fill all in all. He is the new starting-point, in whose death the true judgment of God has been expressed in regard to everything, while He Himself, as Man, is the truth, the expression of what is according to God's mind as to everything, be it man, Israel, or what not.
Now Christians are of the truth, having part in the new man, which, after God, is created in righteousness and holiness of truth. This is, of course, looking at them abstractly as in Christ, born of God. In this sense they cannot sin, being the offspring of truth,
{68}
and not simply being responsible to abide in the truth; nothing can come from them but what is of the truth.
As to practically abiding in the truth, it is a question of grace, and faith that finds its delights and enjoyments in all that Christ is, so that we are maintained under the power of what is of God and divine, and morally in keeping with it.
The above is but a very bare and brief sketch of the subject, but may be of interest as opening up in measure how completely sin is to be displaced, and how in its place we have, in the coming in of Christ, the expression on the one side of what is divine, and blessed, because it is divine; and on the other, the maintenance and security of every position which God has created; the perfect triumph of truth over all.

THE CROSS AND NEW CREATION
@1 Corinthians 1: 17 - 31
I have read this scripture with the thought of bringing before you something of the great principles of God's ways. These come out clearly and prominently at particular moments, but they were always with God, they were not new. You have to distinguish thus between the particular occasions when certain things come to pass, and the principles which are enunciated in these things. Every promise of God is Yea and Amen in Christ. He is the Yea and the Amen, but the promises of God were in His mind always. The promises of God are scattered in detail over the Word, but they form part of the scheme and principle of promise. God may speak about certain things to Abraham, and about other things to David, but all the things of which God speaks form one whole -- they are not fragments and detached, having no connection. And the scheme of promises was complete when God brought to light the truth of the church. The church, though not a promise, was, in a certain sense, the completion of all; there were no more promises to come out; God has revealed all, and the church is the crowning stone in the edifice of grace.
But it is not my purpose now to go into the promises of God; I only referred to them as to the principles pervading them. There are two great principles expressed in the passage I read, which are of all moment for us to understand; they are the Cross and New Creation. These two principles are testified in Christ. So the apostle lays, in @1 Corinthians 1, a great deal of stress on the preaching of the cross; it was God's wisdom and God's power. And later on you get another thought, "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus". That is the other side of the truth. One side of the
{70}
picture is the cross, but the obverse is new creation in Christ. "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption; that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord". You are not to glory in man, because the cross has disposed of man, as we shall see presently, but you are to glory in the Lord because you are of Him.
I want to speak a little about the cross as the power of God and the wisdom of God, to show what it was in the purpose of God to effect by the cross, and more than that, what God *has* effected by the cross. I do not mean exactly in the way of the salvation of souls, but as the public testimony of God in the world. Its power is greatly hindered at the present time by the state of Christendom; the enemy has come in to thwart the testimony -- and he has succeeded only too well -- by corrupting Christianity. It is, however, important to see what it was in the purpose of God to overturn by the testimony of the cross. Anyone acquainted with the history of the world knows very well that Judaism on the one hand, and philosophy on the other, were both overturned by the testimony of the cross. It was light expelling darkness. It was in the purpose of God to do this. No doubt they have reared their heads again, but that is because the enemy has succeeded in corrupting Christianity. As long as the testimony of the cross was maintained here according to God, it effected what God intended it should effect; it overturned every pretension to light that existed, and God intended that it should do so.
The thought of the "power of God" in this chapter is that of a sign of God's intervention. The Jew looked for a sign, and the Greek sought after wisdom. The Jew demanded a sign; it was so when the Lord was here, they asked for a sign. I suppose they thought themselves entitled to it; one would judge so from their language. A sign was the evidence of
{71}
divine intervention, like the manna in the wilderness. On the other hand, the Greeks sought after wisdom. The force of the word 'wisdom' I understand to be *resource*; that is, I think, the prominent idea in Scripture in the thought of divine wisdom. Now the point is this, that the cross was both the power and the wisdom of God. It was the sign of God's intervention, and, on the other hand, it was the resource of God, and why? Because it was the divine means of saving souls. The power of God in the cross was to subdue man, and the wisdom of God was to enlighten man; that is, that man was to be enlightened by what came out in the cross. The cross was thus the resource of God.
Now, there are two aspects of the truth of the cross; there is the divine and the human side. I am not now speaking of the hand that wicked men had in it, but of what the cross was according to the thought of God. I am regarding it as being wholly of God. Christ *was* crucified by wicked men, but it was not the work of wicked men that accomplished redemption. The cross was the divine way of accomplishing redemption. The passage I read does not refer to the work of wicked men at all. Peter, when preaching on the day of Pentecost, spoke of the part that wicked men had in the death of Christ, and you can understand this, for the Jews to whom he spoke had crucified Christ, and Peter was seeking to reach their conscience. But the apostle Paul looks at the cross as entirely the work of God.
Now, as to the two aspects I spoke of, I think one is the human side, and the other the divine. One side was the demonstration of what man was as before God. In the ways of God it was ordered that there should be such a demonstration. Christ entered into man's place. Even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that was not a question of wicked men, but of divine necessity. It was necessary, for the glory of God,
{72}
that there should be a demonstration before God of the true position of man. In the cross, an expression which you get in the law, was fully exemplified: "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree". The curse had to do with a broken law. The effect of the law on man was that he came under the curse, though he was under death before. The law was the ministration of death, God never intended that the people were to have life by the law. No law was given able to quicken. The law said, "This do and thou shalt live", but in the divine mind the law was the ministry of condemnation and of death, and death and the condemnation must have been there to be ministered. But the law added this, that those who were under it and did not continue in all things written in the book of the law, came under the curse. Now, Christ was made a curse in the eye of God that there should be a demonstration of the true place of man as before God. We pass over things very lightly and never really understand what we are in the sight of God except as we apprehend it in the cross of Christ. That was our merit, our desert. My own feeling about it is that, in order to apprehend what my true place is before God, I need to learn what the cross was.
Now, there is another side to the cross that we can dwell upon -- a very much more blessed side. The cross was the foolishness and weakness of God, at all events in the eye of man. But "unto us which are saved it is the power of God". The fact is, that the incarnation of the Son of God enabled God to come in testimony into death itself, that He might reveal Himself to man. It may seem a strange thing to speak of God coming into death, but that is the real testimony of the death of Christ. He did not come into it *as God*, but became man in order that, in the way of testimony, God might come into death. The cross was thus the wisdom of God and the power of God, for it is the unmistakable sign of God's intervention
{73}
on man's behalf. I dare say you remember that when God confirmed to Abraham the promise that he should inherit the land, Abraham took certain animals and cut them in twain, and at dark a burning lamp and a smoking furnace passed between the pieces. God came thus figuratively in testimony into death to give a confirmation of the covenant. It is a point worth pondering over. Considering what man is, I do not think that he can learn anything at all about God except in the death of Christ. The first lesson that God imprints on man in regard to Himself is that of righteousness -- for His purpose is to lay in man's soul a moral foundation. Nothing can be more perfect and beautiful than the work of God in man. He makes it evident to man at the outset that sin is intolerable to Himself and that nothing can set aside God's judgment of death. It is impossible. Man's judgment may be set aside; in human things, the prerogative of mercy belongs to the queen, but it is impossible that God's judgment can be set aside. The righteousness of God is inflexible, and if it were not, you would not absolutely and implicitly trust God. It is the very sense that the righteousness of God is perfect and unalterable which really enables me to trust God. But He has proved this in His Son bearing the judgment which was upon us; the death of Christ is thus the witness of God's righteousness. It proves both that sin is intolerable to God, and that God's judgment cannot be set aside, but has been met by One competent to meet it on behalf of man. "There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all".
Now I take another point. Where do you learn the love of God? As we have seen, in the death of Christ. God came down into death, in the way of testimony. Surely the Son of God, who died, had part in divine love. I am quite alive to the fact of His having become Man. There was the setting forth before God in the
{74}
cross of what man's state and place were, but at the same time, in that same cross we get the blessed testimony not simply of righteousness, but of God's love. The death of Christ would scarcely have been a commendation of the love of God if the One who died had not part in that love. And therefore, you can understand that the cross is the wisdom of God; it shows the resource that was with God -- the means by which God could reveal Himself in love to man and yet at the same time maintain the inflexibility of His own judgment.
But there is still another thought in connection with the truth that the cross is the power of God: it is the sign, the mark, of God's intervention on man's behalf. The first sign that God gave in Christ was in the Babe. The Babe was the sign of God's intervention on man's behalf; the Son of God came into the place of the weakness of man, and that was the sign of God's intervention on man's behalf. There was no help for man in the strength of flesh. You get the sign again spoken of in @John 6. Christ was the living bread come down from heaven, the blessed expression, in humiliation, of the grace of God to man; the humiliation was morally suitable to the grace. The people wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of His mouth; they were food for man. Jesus "went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him". Such was the pathway of service of the Lord here on earth. But the cross was the greatest sign of all. In it God in testimony came into the place of judgment. Man must go, but the love of God abides. The cross is not only the wisdom of God, but it is the power of God. There is nothing like the cross; it is really God coming in testimony into the very place of man's judgment, to make manifest beyond all question His thoughts of love. The mighty power of God could not have come in except death had been there to God's glory. In the
{75}
resurrection of Christ, the One who was raised had part in the power that raised Him; there could be no attribute of God expressed in the death and resurrection of Christ, in which the Lord Himself had not part as a divine Person, though Himself proving experimentally what those attributes were. You cannot deny His righteousness or His love. The incarnation could not alter that. The effect of all is this, that when the wisdom of God operates in souls, it teaches men, just as the power of God subdues men. There is more instruction in the cross than you and I will ever take in.
Now, I want to say a few words as to the purpose of God. This was, by the testimony of the cross, to overturn every pretension to light that existed; that is, on the one hand Judaism, and on the other hand heathenism. The heathen were at the time of the gospel dreadfully debased, but religious pretension, and the pretension to wisdom, were found in Judaism and philosophy. The Jews demanded a sign, and the Greeks sought after wisdom, and it was the purpose of God to bring both to nought by the testimony of the cross, and this was done. I do not doubt that if Christianity had not been corrupted by the artifices of the enemy, the effect of the preaching of the cross would have been far greater even than it was. In our day, the principles which God intended to overturn by the testimony of the cross, have reappeared in the name and under the guise of Christianity. The great evil of the day is in the accommodation of Christianity to Judaism and philosophy. They have reared their heads in the midst of Christendom, and the power of the testimony has been greatly neutralised. The point for us is to get back to the cross. It is God's testimony as to Himself on the one hand, and as to man's state before God on the other. We see in it the revelation of God in the very place of man's judgment. What a wonderful exchange the believer makes, in his thoughts, by the cross; he exchanges himself for God, he gets
{76}
the light of God's revelation in place of himself that was under the curse. Instead of seeking to improve himself, or vainly imagining that there is some fountain of goodness in himself, he is in the light of God's goodness. God, in His grace, has given him an appreciation of Himself. Nobody has this naturally, but the Christian has it through the light of God having shone into his heart.
I add a word or two as to the closing part of the chapter, just to present the other side of the truth. God's ways were so ordered that no flesh should glory in His presence, but then, in the last two verses, we have the truth that we are of a new stock, of which God is the source: "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus". It is of all moment that the Christian should take account of himself as being of another stock. If Scripture speaks about what is of God in Christ Jesus, it evidently refers to Christ Jesus risen, and He is the source and spring of the Christian; you are of God. I suppose it may be spoken of as new creation, and He (Christ) is made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. It is difficult for a Christian to take account of himself as being of another order, because the order of Adam and the order of Christ do not correspond. When Christ became Man, He came into the order and place of the first man, but, raised again from the dead, He is eternally separated from that order, and is the Head, the Beginning, of a new order. It is most important to take into account, in our minds, what we are in Christ Jesus as outside of what we are in the flesh. In the flesh, there are many things which pertain to us which can have no connection with what is in Christ Jesus, such as natural relationships, and the like. In Christ Jesus there is not the distinction of male or female, on which relationships down here are founded. All is very different from that of which you have experience. But what we are in Christ Jesus takes
{77}
precedence of what we are in the flesh, and therefore it has to be more important in our eyes. We often fail there, and put what we are in the flesh first, and what we are in Christ second. But to put it in the language of Scripture, we have to "put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, ... and ... put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness". That is what is to rule in my ways and conduct down here. Paul says to the Galatians, "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God". When I talk of Christ Jesus, it brings before me at once the thought of a new order, and so of a new system of relationships. There is a system of relationships connected with man as God made him, and there is also a system of relationships connected with Christ Jesus, and these relationships, with the Christian, take precedence of the relationships after the flesh. The Christian has to take account of himself as of God in Christ Jesus.
Then the apostle goes on to say, "Who has been made to us wisdom from God". The object of that is to render us independent of man and man's pretension to wisdom. We know the resources of God in Christ Jesus. But He is also made unto us righteousness; Christ is our righteousness. He is further made unto us sanctification. How is sanctification to be effected? It is as you are conscious of being in Christ, and grow in grace. You have not sanctification as a matter of faith; such an idea is a great mistake. *Christ* is sanctification to us, that is, as having Him for an object. Then follows the closing word, that He is made redemption to us. All culminates in redemption. The force of the passage is to make nothing of us, and at the same time to make us independent of all the
{78}
pretension of man. The Spirit of God presses home these things, the testimony of God on the one hand, and on the other hand His work in us. We stand in a new order, and in that order Christ is everything. How far is that verified in you and me? We turn, I fear, to a great many things. Reading is sometimes a great snare to Christians; they read all sorts of things, and the things which they read are to a large extent the creation of man's imagination. I do not think such reading profits. If you want wisdom, Christ is God's wisdom, the One by whom God is going to accomplish everything for His own eternal glory. He is wisdom to the Christian, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, objectively.
{79}
CHRIST, THE GATHERING POINT NOW
@Matthew 16: 13 - 20
It is a great thing for us to know who the Person is to whom we have come. He has said, "come unto *me*". He came and presented Himself to the Jews, and had they received Him, all the blessing would have gone out from the midst of Israel, as Elisha said of Naaman, "let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel", but they rejected Him, and He accepts the rejection from His Father's hand. "No man knoweth the Son, but the Father". The Father well knew whose hands He was putting everything into: the Son who was ever in His bosom knew well what was in His heart, and is the One to make it known to us, all was in the hands of the Son. It is not now, 'come to *Israel*' as a fountain of blessing, but "come unto me", He is the bright gathering point now, not Jerusalem or this or that place, but Christ. Now He wants us to know who we have come to, and what is founded upon that. In chapter 12 He is thoroughly rejected. They attribute what He did to the devil, and then when His mother and His brethren come, He disowns the natural link, and stretches forth His hand to His *disciples*. A beautiful thing to see Him saying to us, Those are the ones I own, those who have come to Me; the same is my brother and sister and mother.
In chapter 13 the Lord is sowing a new seed in order to get a people for Himself. The parables in this chapter furnish a picture of the mystery of the kingdom. The word produces an outward aspect of things; that is what man's eye is upon, but the Lord's eye is upon the treasure. He says, I have a treasure down there in that field; to Him it is the pearl of great price. And that sets us thoroughly in the company
{80}
of the Lord; He is very dear to me, but I have learned another thing, that I am very dear to Him. Any poor sinner says -- He is dear to me, see what He has done for me, but do we know that we are dear to Him? In chapter 14 Christ's forerunner is killed. In a figure it points on to the last days, but it is the power of the world against Christ. We are not going to suppose we are to have an easy time in this world; the One precious to me is cast out, which makes this world a wilderness. The disciples come in the evening and say, 'this is a desert place', we have found that out; the Lord is rejected, all the power of the world dead against Him and we find we are in a desert place. But if the blessed One we have come to is there in the desert, we are sure to be fed, there is enough for us all, and there is not one the Lord cannot feed. We may say, 'There is very little, Lord', but the Lord was there. Do we know what it is to be in His company? The Lord is gone away on high, and they are crossing all the stormy waters of this world and apparently they are alone. But His eye sees them, and in the fourth watch of the night He goes to them. Now I learn, not merely that if it is a desert place He can feed me, but whatever the waves, He is above them. He does not make a calm here, but He shows there is a power He has which is above them all. He walks on the top, and I learn this fresh thing about that blessed Saviour. They were troubled till the word reached their ear: "it is I". Do you know who it is? Peter *answered* Him; the Lord wants an answer. "Lord, if it be thou" -- not, I would like you to give me that power, or, Will you still the water, but "bid me come to thee"; I would like to come to you. Another point He brings us to. I feel He can meet all my needs, but He presents Himself in this power of walking on the waters, and He wants this answer from our hearts. Peter had very little faith, but still he did actually walk on the water *to go to*
{81}
*Jesus*. He presents Himself in the same way in @Revelation 22 at the end of all the storm, "I Jesus". He draws our hearts. He says, "It is I" -- now where is the answer? Like the virgins, I go out to meet the Bridegroom.
In chapter 15 religiousness is what we have to meet -- the scribes and Pharisees, and at Jerusalem the religious place; and the Lord exposes the whole of their formality and brings out at the end that "every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up", the distinction between all this religiousness and the true work of God.
Verse 21. We get the transition from the Scribes and Pharisees of Jerusalem to the most cursed race upon earth. The Lord departed from Jerusalem and goes to the coast of Tyre and Sidon, and a woman of Canaan comes to Him, first with a kind of claim, saying, "Son of David", but she was not one of David's people at all. Then she pleads in a certain sense her wants, "Lord, help me", a piteous cry, but no -- He does not answer to either, "it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs". Then she says, "Truth, Lord", she takes the place of a dog, and then she gets the greatest answer anyone ever got, "Be it unto thee *even as thou wilt*". If you take the ground of debtor to mercy alone, you may have anything you desire. I have no claim, I get on the ground of sovereign mercy, and then there is nothing He won't give, a full overflowing of goodness to the worst of sinners.
Verse 32. There is a difference between this and the other case of feeding the multitude. We learn that the Lord is always the same. Jesus never could be anything but what He was. All the rejection, all the failure cannot alter Him, and this is a great comfort, for if we look at all the wonderful provision of grace the Lord gave at the beginning we may say it has all
{82}
failed; but if there have been eighteen hundred years of failure we can say the *Lord* is always the same. The twelve baskets signify the perfect order of administration. He gave all the gifts when the church was set up; it is very different now, but here they gather seven baskets full, a figure of spiritual perfection. Though we have not all the vessels of ministry, the servants of God, we can never say we have not the power of the Spirit of God to reveal Christ to us. We have no apostles and prophets, but there is the spiritual power and energy which the Lord can use to feed His people when we have not all the gifts. Now we see what a Saviour we have! In Jonah we have the Jew sent to the Gentile to bring the message of God, as the Jews ought to have done, but he gave it up, and fell into the judgment of God. The Lord points to the sky and says, You can tell Me all about the clouds, but do you not see your own sinful wretched condition ready for the judgment of God like Jonah? But that is where the church begins, we are on the other side of judgment. The Lord left them and departed -- nothing more solemn. In chapter 16 they had no bread, not even five loaves here, no resource whatever. The Lord says, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees". We always think if we have nothing to give Him He is chiding us. Ah! I have everything in Him, He is everything. He, as it were, says, Have you not Me, do you not remember the five loaves and the five thousand -- and then they saw it was the leaven of the Pharisees He spoke of, hypocrisy. There is no sin in poverty, the sin is in pretending to be rich when I have not a penny; the Pharisees had nothing but pretension to be something, but when I come to Christ I not only have everything *from* Him but everything *in* Him. Then He turns round and says: 'who do you think I am?' I could never know the deep mystery of His Person, not that He is a blessed Man, a prophet, one who can
{83}
walk on the waters, but *the Son of the living God*, except as taught of the Father.
We get here another thing: all we have had hitherto is in this world, but now we have something right outside this world. He has triumphed over death and He is building an assembly, outside of it all, against which the gates of death shall not prevail. Flesh and blood never taught Peter that He was the Son of the living God in perfect power over death. Now you see what the church is. I plant you on the rock of the confession of My own Person. I have been teaching you by your wants, and now you have this revelation of what My Person is. Verse 17: the Father reveals this to Peter. Verse 18: Christ says, Now I will say something to you; I will tell you, Peter, who you are, a stone; Christ the Rock, Peter a stone -- part of Myself, not only in My company and learning who I am, but I give you a name that tells you, you are part of Myself (*Petra*, a rock -- *Petros*, a stone), a bit of the rock. "He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one". Now we see how the church is formed. In paradise Eve was formed from Adam, and he calls her, "bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh". Christ communicates to the believer His own life; the life that the believer has is all Christ. Christ his righteousness -- everything. He calls him first by his name after the flesh -- "Simon", but now he has another name which signifies that he was part of Christ. Now we see what the church is, members of His body. We get the judgment of flesh in the Jew (religion). Judaism showed that the flesh could not bring forth anything for God, the cup and platter might be clean outside but corruption was within. Then the poor cursed woman comes and He gives her everything. Is the church out of reach of death?
There is no necessity that we should die; we have a life that belongs to heaven, and if the Lord were to come we should not die. As the Holy Spirit forms
{84}
Christ in us we have the life that belongs to heaven. We know that the Lord had to die; that does not come in here, but to lay the foundation He must die; "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone". He must clear me as a responsible man out of judgment and death, but He could not be holden of it, and now He unites us to Himself by the Holy Spirit. In His death He ends our state as children of Adam to give us life in Himself the other side of death. We have a life in having Christ, that belongs to another region and order of things altogether. One thing more, He charges them that they should not tell anyone He was the Christ, and begins to tell them that He must go to Jerusalem, that the earthly religion would put Him to death, and, "if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross". After showing what His own Person is, He begins to open out that it must be the pathway of rejection and suffering down here. Man no more likes heavenly and unseen things now than he did in the Lord's day. How far we are able to tread that path is just how far we have apprehended the Christ we believe. He brings us to a place where we have nothing but Him, as in the boat with no bread, and then His fulness shines out on our souls and we feel well, we have got something now in having Him; brought to the end of self altogether. It is not knowing all the doctrine of the church and the right way of meeting, but if I am to be in the power of the thing I must know *Him* in this way. We might gather together and read and get blessed truths, and yet have nothing really, unless we get it with Him. We often read a passage and find but little in it, and another time if lowly and dependent the Lord lets His light shine in on it, and gives us what we never had before.
{85}
GOD'S PROMISES STABLE IN CHRIST FOR HIS GLORY IN BELIEVERS
@2 Corinthians 1: 17 - 24
The passage which I have read is a remarkable one, and arises out of a charge which apparently had been made against the apostle Paul, from which he vindicates himself. I think it is evident that the charge of lightness, and want of steadfastness of purpose, had been brought against the apostle by the Corinthians, or, at all events, by some amongst them. The general state of an assembly is one thing, but there may be influences at work in an assembly, as at Corinth, sufficient to cause anxiety in regard to the assembly. They had taken occasion at Corinth of the apostle not having come at the time he intended, to bring against him this charge of want of fixity of purpose. The passage which I read is short, but the way in which the apostle deals with the matter is remarkable, and brings before us the fact that the apostle's ways were governed by the testimony committed to him. And so he vindicates himself by bringing before their minds this testimony and its proof of the stability of God's promises. A person is influenced by his knowledge of God; the knowledge which he enjoys of God, and the assurance of the firmness and stability of what is of God, is that by which he is affected, and his ways take their character from this.
Now that comes out in the passage before us. The apostle might have spent chapters in attempting to vindicate himself otherwise, but all the vindication on which he ventures in regard to himself is contained in two or three verses. If the apostle's ways were not in accordance with the knowledge he had of God, he was not worth much. And so it is in regard of us.
{86}
There are two parts in the passage. The first three verses, that is eighteen to twenty, speak of what may be described as God's side, and the succeeding verses, that is twenty-one and twenty-two, of our side. The apostle begins by saying: "As God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay". Whatever there might have appeared to be in the apostle's ways, there had been no uncertainty about his word -- that is evident. "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him amen, unto the glory of God by us". Evidently, the passage so far speaks of things on the divine side, that is, of the confirmation and establishment of every promise of God in Christ, with a special object, that is, "for glory to God by us". That is one side. Then you get our side. It adds: "Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts". The passage describes the way in which God has wrought in order that His glory might come out in us. In speaking of glory to God by us, I do not think that the apostle refers to the future, but to the present. God has contemplated that at the present moment there should be glory to Himself by us, and I believe that just in proportion as our souls are in the full light of the Son of God, and of what God has brought to pass in Him, so there will be glory to God by us. That is what God intended in the church down here. It is difficult to take these things in, in the present day, on account of the state of the professing church. Everything is so marred, so poor and weak, that it is hard to enter into the divine thought, and for the reason that you do not see the representation of that in which God's glory was to be expressed.
By way of introduction, I want to bring before you the distinction between the testimony of Peter and that
{87}
of Paul. The testimony of Peter was to an exalted Christ. That was the great power of Peter's testimony. On the other hand, the great subject of Paul's testimony was that Jesus is the Son of God. I think you have to appreciate the difference between these two witnesses in order to enter into the force of the passage we have before us. Peter and John had known Christ after the flesh, as Messiah born into this world according to promise, the Seed of Abraham and the Seed of David, the Prophet like unto Moses. I do not say but that they had more light; but when they came into the place of testimony in the power of the Holy Spirit, the burden of their testimony was that Christ was exalted. He had suffered at the hands of men, He had been crucified and put to death, but it had been by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. But now God had highly exalted Him, and the presence and power of the Holy Spirit was the occasion and confirmation of the apostles¬ word. I think everybody will recall the burden of their testimony: "Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear". The thought was of Christ having gone to the right hand of God. If you take this up in connection with the Psalms, you will see the force of it in a moment. In @Psalm 2 we have the Messiah born into the world, the Son of God begotten in time, and in @Psalm 110 David's Lord is exalted to the right hand of God. "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool". You get the history of Christ in the Psalms, and Peter and John took up the testimony according to them. They witnessed what they knew. They had been associated with the Lord down here, and were witnesses to His death and resurrection; and now the Holy Spirit had come down as the proof of His being exalted to the right hand of God, and that was the burden of their testimony. "God hath made that same
{88}
Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ".
Paul's testimony is somewhat different. The point of it is that Christ is the Son of God. This brings before us, not that He had gone to God, but that He came *from* God. Paul was the first to bring that out. You get it amplified in the writings of John, but it had no part in the public testimony of Peter and John, so far as that is recorded. It waited for a special instrument to be raised up, and that was Paul. The very thought of the Son of God was of One who came from God. In confirmation of what I have said, I quote a passage in Galatians: "But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law". We have here the thought of the sending forth. Now, if the Son of God comes forth, the point of His coming is to make God known to us. And further, in grace the Son of God came into the place and estate in which man was in regard of God. He was made sin, and became a curse; entering, too, into death. The purpose of it was that He might bring into death the light of God. He actually anticipated, so to say, everything which is upon man, and brought into death the full light of God. And the result of that is, that instead of our having to enter into all that which is upon us in its terrible reality, the revelation of God is light and life to our souls. That is what we see has come to pass in the Son of God. He brought the light of God into the place of our distance. I could not give you a greater proof of the grace of God. I think it is of all moment to see that the full light of God has come out in the death of Christ. It did not come out fully in the life of Christ. I quite admit that God was manifested in the flesh. There was abundant testimony in all the ways and words of Christ down here of who He was and who had sent Him; but it is in the death of Christ that you get the full revelation of God to us in regard of that which lay on us. God took
{89}
occasion of man's place under death and the curse of a broken law to make Himself known to us in the fulness of His love. The Lord speaks of this in @John 3: 14 - 16. You see there that the object of the Son of man being lifted up was to make room for the full light of God to come out in love. "God so loved the world". It is in the death of Christ that we learn really the nature of God. "God is love", and "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us". That is Paul's testimony. I would that everybody here might really know the full extent of the grace of God in presenting Himself to us in the Person of His Son in regard of all that which lay upon us -- the curse, and death, and judgment -- presenting Himself to us there in order that we, instead of entering into the reality of these things, might have the light of God as the life of our souls. And the application of that principle is very wide. It refers to every family, for the revelation of God will be, in greater or less degree, the life of their souls; only I would ask you just to bear in mind that you must not confound the revelation of God with man's ability, even divinely given, to enter into that revelation. Man may have more or less ability, by the grace of God, to enter into that revelation, but the revelation of God in the death of Christ stands good for all. It is a truth of universal application. I think it is in that sense that the Lord gave the commission to the apostles in the last chapter of Matthew, to baptise to the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. The revelation was good for all, for ourselves, and for Israel, and for the nations, but there may be a great deal of difference, in different families, in the power to enter into the greatness of the revelation, but, anyway, the revelation is the light of souls in every family. For instance, the way in which God presents Himself to Israel in the new covenant will be their light: "All shall know me,
{90}
from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more". It is a beautiful passage, and is prefaced by, "They shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord". Every soul will have the light of the knowledge of God, and that knowledge will be practically the life of their souls. They will have life in that light. And thus it is in regard of ourselves -- our privilege is to live in the light in which it has pleased God to reveal Himself to us, that is, in the light of His love. The office of the Holy Spirit in the believer is to shed abroad in his heart the love of God, and the Holy Spirit maintains your heart in that light, and that light becomes formative in the soul. The Holy Spirit works on that line, to bring my soul under the influence of the love of God. When it is a question of the revelation of God, it is difficult to distinguish between light and love, because the light is the love. The love of God has come to you as light, that is how we learn what God is, and this is not when we are with God in heaven, for God has already shone out in light. You may depend upon it as the truth, that the light of God is in us the formative principle, and the work of the Holy Spirit in your heart and mine is to bring our affections under the influence of love, that we may be formed for God. How do you think you are going to be holy and without blame before God in love? I judge by the Spirit of God bringing your soul under the influence of what God is; God is holy and without blame, in that sense, in love, and the Holy Spirit works to bring our hearts under the influence of what God is.
We come now to another point. "The Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, ... was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him amen, unto the glory of God by us".
{91}
That is the point from which God has started in regard to man. There is the assurance that every man will take his character from Christ. Christ is the Head of every man. It is in the Son of God that God can secure man for Himself, and He has secured man for Himself, for it is in the power of God to affect man's heart by the revelation of Himself. That is how God works so as to secure man for Himself. God has gained the victory, and for the reason that He can affect and influence the heart of man by the light in which He has been pleased to shine out. Without the work of the Spirit in your heart, that could not possibly be the case; but if you look at things as to God's outward dealings here, He affects and influences the heart of man by the light in which He has been pleased to shine forth in His Son. I fear that a great many Christians go on for many a year without coming under the formative influence of the revelation. They believe the revelation, they know their sins are forgiven, and have peace with God, but their souls do not get enlarged and expanded by the light of God, or they would, I think, be very different from what they are.
But there is another point connected with the Son of God, namely, that every promise is now established in Him. The promises of God had relation to man, whatever they were. They regarded man, and therefore, in order that these promises might be effectual, they needed to be centred at a point from which God could affect and subdue man, for it was impossible that God's promises could be brought to pass if it were not in God's power to affect man according to Himself; but that is what God *has* proved His power and ability to do; it is in the Son of God that all the promises of God are yea and Amen. If you look for a moment at these promises, they related both to Jew and Gentile. The great promise to Abraham, "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed", had relation to the Gentile as well as to the Jew, and so,
{92}
many other passages in the Old Testament relate to the Gentile. There are ample promises to the Jew, and at the same time rich promises for the Gentile. Christ is to be the "Head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me". There are abundant promises for the Gentiles, in Christ. The great promise to Abraham was connected with blessing, but we have also foreshadowed the complete victory over the power of evil -- the head of the serpent was to be bruised; then there is, too, the promise of the new covenant -- man was to be morally a reflex of God; and when that came to pass, God would dwell among men. And we have also the purpose of God to reign. God Himself was going to take the kingdom. God had the kingdom, in a sense, when David reigned in Jerusalem. Then, when the line of David became completely unfaithful, and God had to break with them, power was put for the time into the hands of the Gentiles, and we have the times of the Gentiles. But we see in the Old Testament the purpose of God Himself to take up the throne; Jehovah would reign. The kingdoms of this world are to become the kingdom of our God, and of His Christ. Now, these promises refer to man, whether it is the bruising of the head of the serpent, or the blessing of all nations in Abraham. Every promise involves the blessing of man. But then, the promises could not, as I have said, be established until there was a point from which God would affect man. Now there *is* such a point, that is, the Son of God, in whom is revealed God's love, and every promise of God is held in Him to God's glory. That is the light into which we have come -- the light of God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ, where every promise of God is established and firm, because from that point God can make man willing in the day of His power. That is what will come to pass in the case of Israel, and that is what God has done in regard of us. And now, in regard of the promises of God, in the
{93}
Son of God is the yea and the Amen, for glory to God by us, because the light of the Son of God can affect man.
And now, I just say a few words as to how we are affected. It is important to see that side of it, if these promises are to be to the glory of God by us. "Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God: who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts". The first expression that you get there is a little difficult to interpret. My impression is this, that it means attaching us firmly unto Christ. That is the work of God, and I think that work of God, as I understand it, is carried on in the hearts of the saints. God is the One who does it. The way in which it is wrought is this, that God gives Christ such a place in the hearts of the saints, as that He attaches us firmly to Him; He dwells by faith in the heart. Then, God has anointed us. He has given us intelligence in the power of the Holy Spirit, a spiritual intelligence of things. I think I can give you an interpretation of it. Look at the apostle's prayer, in @Ephesians 3: "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love" -- just notice how all the Godhead is brought into the passage: the Father strengthens you with might by His Spirit in the inner man, that the Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith -- "that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend" (that is the effect of the anointing) "with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ" (that is, that your hearts may be firmly attached to Christ) "which
{94}
passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulness of God". I think any one can very well understand that if Christ dwells in the heart by faith, your heart is firmly attached to Him; He rules in your heart. And then, you have intelligence, you are anointed, and can enter into the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, that is, into the whole range and extent of divine promises. You grasp the entire system, for all the promises of God form one grand system. The idea is not that there are a number of promises having little or no connection with each other, but that they form one grand system, of which the church is the crowning stone. All the promises of God in Christ are yea, and in Christ the amen, for glory to God by us -- that is, by the assembly. The assembly is the witness of them now, and the glory of God is expressed in the assembly, because the assembly has, and gives, the sense of the stability of all God's promises in the One who is the Yea and Amen.
Then, God has also sealed us. The seal is the mark which God has put upon us, and that is the Spirit. It is the expression, the evidence, that we are genuinely God's property. He has His mark upon us. We get the consciousness by the Spirit that we are not our own, but God's property. And more than that, He has given us the earnest of the Spirit; His Spirit is the Earnest of the inheritance and of glory in our souls. That is what God has effected on our side. What He has effected on His own side is in order that He might subdue the hearts of men by the revelation of Himself. What a wonderful company we should be if we were here in the full sense of the certainty and fixity of everything which God has promised, if our souls had power to take up the whole range of those promises! How conscious we should be of blessing if we saw the beauty of that system, everything established in the Son of God, and we firmly attached to Christ; anointed, that we might have intelligence as to the
{95}
knowledge of God; sealed, as the property of God; and having the earnest of the Spirit until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory.
Now, I think you will admit that the passage is a very profound one. It consists of only two or three verses, but it is pregnant with profound meaning. It would be a great study for a young Christian to apprehend the promises of God as one complete whole. They lie about in Scripture, but they form one whole. God could not reveal them all together; He revealed them in part here and there; but now it is our privilege to see the completeness and perfection of the whole, established and firm in the Son of God.

DIVINE LOVE AND OUR HISTORY HERE
@1 John 4
It has been said, beloved friends, that in the first epistle of John a great point is fellowship, and hence it is that we have what is hardly alluded to in John's gospel -- the cleansing of sins by the blood of Jesus Christ. But what I wanted to dwell upon is what is unfolded in this chapter, namely, the way in which divine love is connected with us in all our history here; first as sinners, then as saints, and finally in respect of the day of judgment.
And here I may remark that in @1 John 4 the great point as regards the soul is knowledge, he that loves is born of God, and knows God. And knowledge, rightly understood, is an all-important element of the blessing that is peculiar to us as Christians. The shape that our blessing takes practically is knowledge, as we see in @John 17: 3.
The chapter before us supposes an ability to know which lies in the possession of a kindred nature, and hence we have unfolded here the whole economy of divine love in its application to us. The passage is plain enough. It is not here the question of relief, but of putting us in line with the wonderful way in which the love of God connects itself with the course of a Christian all along to the end, until all responsibility is over, and God will rest in His love. The line that John takes is to connect the love of God with the believer down here. He does not see him set in heavenly places; but he is not of the world, and is in the enjoyment of heavenly things. Some have said that John does not speak of heaven. Anyway he unfolds more distinctly than anyone what is essentially heavenly, and at the same time he gives us the moral judgment of the world. He tells the young men that
{97}
all that is in the world is not of the Father, and gives them the means of forming a moral estimate of what is in the world; and the things which we have judged we are freed from the power of. If a man is not free of a thing it proves that he has never really judged it.
But to return to our chapter: we see how love connects itself with us all the way through. Knowledge, as I said before, is an essential element of Christian blessing. It is the form which eternal life takes in regard to us -- to know the Father, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, His sent one. But then it is love that knows love; and the man that does not love does not know God, for God is love. We see the character of the knowledge in @John 10: 14, 15, where Jesus says, "I know my sheep, and am known of mine; as the Father knows me, and I also know the Father". It all lies in the new being, in what we are as quickened of the Son. Apart from this the knowledge could not be, however fully God might be revealed.
There are two principal elements in our blessing; namely, the relationship which we have in chapter 3 and the knowledge in chapter 4. The relationship peculiar to John is that of children of God unknown of the world, partners of Christ's rejection. The relationship of sons refers more to association with Christ in glory.
But now as to knowledge. In verse 7 we have, "He that loveth is born of God", and, the apostle adds, "knows God". Then immediately the love of God, in its application to us, is unfolded. It is long before we really come to the acceptance of the great truth that we love God because He first loved us. We are so much hindered by thoughts of self, and what we are for God, that we are little able to look at the love of God in itself. First, we see the love in its application to us as sinners -- when there was total insensibility as to God and His goodness. Then it was that He, of
{98}
His love, sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might live through Him. And not only so, but the apostle adds, "herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins". Though spiritually there was total insensibility in our souls to God, there was at the same time responsibility, for we had consciences; and God sent His Son to meet the whole case, both as to our state and our sins.
The next point is the love that is toward us as saints. "We have known and believed the love that God has to us". Here it is love to us not as sinners, but as saints in our pathway here. The apostle had just said, "We have seen and bear witness that the Father sent the Son as Saviour of the world". Saints are viewed as being in this blessed circle, and the secrets of divine grace come out and enlarge the heart. "God is love; and he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him". I have thought that the Son by coming here, not only brought divine affections here -- for He was their object, and they rested on Him as man -- but He left them here; for He left objects of them, and hence the affections remained, resting on those who were loved with the love with which He was loved as a Man here. It was indeed a small beginning, but what great things have come out of it! The Son brought here the greatest thing he could bring -- the Father's love; and He left it here, while never Himself ceasing to be the supreme object of it.
And now, finally, we have love made perfect with us in regard to the day of judgment -- that which closes for ever the chapter of our responsibility. And here it is "that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; for as he is, so are we in this world". The object is that we may be without fear; for fear hath torment. The thought of the judgment-seat might bring some sense of fear, and that is met by the truth that as He
{99}
who is Judge is, so are we in this world. We are in the acceptance and favour already in which the One is who is Himself Judge. Every bit of fear has to be dispelled from the heart of saints; they are to be made perfect in love. And when we have reached this, it is then we are free to recognise that we love Him because He first loved us.
{100}
GOD'S WRITING IN THE HEART TO THE END OF OUR BEHOLDING THE GLORY OF THE LORD
@2 Corinthians 3
There are, in the passage before us, two principles taken up from the type of Moses bringing down the tables of the law: the first is *writing*, and the second is *glory*. The one was the accompaniment of the other. The introduction of the tables of stone on which God had written the ten words was accompanied with glory. The glory was in the face of Moses, the writing was on the tables of stone. Now, you get the antitype of that in this chapter: the writing is in the heart of the Corinthians, and the glory in the face of Christ. And what I want to make plain is the connection between the two things, for the one is really dependent upon the other; when there is the writing, then there is "beholding the glory". If the Corinthians were the subject of the writing, the writing qualified them to behold the glory. The apostle speaks of that in the last verse of the chapter: "We all", he says, "beholding the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Lord the Spirit".
I do not think, as far as I understand the passage, that the apostles were the only ones who looked at the glory of the Lord, for he says "we *all*". There is no veil now over the face of the Lord -- that is the idea of the last verse.
The two points I have indicated are of great practical interest to us. They make evident the greatness of Christianity -- what a contrast it is to all that went before, though it is the antitype of it. The writing upon the tables of stone and the glory in the face of Moses were evanescent. Where will you find the tables
{101}
of stone now, or the glory in the face of Moses? That glory was there but for a moment, it all passed away. Moses passed away; he had to die in the wilderness, he was not permitted to enter the land; and I suppose the glory passed away from his face long before he died. But the writing to which the apostle refers in the antitype is the real writing of God in the tables of the heart, and the glory with which that is connected is eternal. It is the reality in contrast to the type.
There is another important point connected with the subject, which we shall see more distinctly presently. Beholding the glory of the Lord is pretty much equivalent to entering the holiest. What the epistle to the Hebrews opens up to the mind of the Jew, this chapter opens up to the mind of the Gentile. To the Jew the idea presented was entering the holiest; here, to the Gentile, it is beholding the glory of the Lord with unveiled face. If you behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, you have entered the holiest, I think that is sufficiently plain.
I would desire first to give you the scripture idea of a veil. It is that which conceals the glory of God. You get an example of it in the Lord upon earth; the glory of God was in Him veiled. The glory of God was there, but under a veil of flesh. The Lord had taken the condition of man, in humiliation, down here. Now we have, in contrast to that, "beholding the glory of the Lord with unveiled face". There is no veil upon the face of the Lord. He is declared to be the Son of God by the place in which He is.
I will give you another illustration of a veil. Providences are a veil behind which God hides His glory. We are all familiar with the providences of God, in which a great many things come to pass in the world which are not according to God's glory. The providence of God is inscrutable. It is a wheel within a wheel -- a kind of riddle which no one can read. That came out in the case of Job. God allowed a great
{102}
many terrible things to befall Job in His providence, but the glory of God and His purpose in regard to Job were hidden behind. And so it is to this day; we see the providence of God, and the varied things which God permits in His providence, but they are no expression to us of His glory.
If you look at @Revelation 4 and 5, you see the glory of God, the throne and the One that sits upon it, and those that surround the throne. You get the Lamb in the midst of the throne, and the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders. You get the glory of God coming out there, but in chapter 6 you find horses sent forth into all the earth, symbolising providential dealings and forces that hide the glory of God. This will not always be the case; the time will come when God will no longer hide His glory behind a veil of providences; the veil will be put aside and the glory of God be revealed. The sun is always shining, but it is often veiled by clouds. And so with the glory of God; though hid by providences, it will in due time shine forth. But the Christian is able in the meantime to go behind the providences of God, and see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
I will now take up the two points, viz., the writing, and the glory as connected with it. And I think that glory must be connected with writing. The ten commandments were first spoken to the children of Israel from the top of the mount. There was no writing or record then. The people heard the voice of God, and God intended that they should hear it. I suppose the idea prevailed that if God spoke to man, and man heard His voice, man would die, but in contrast to that, idea, the truth came out that God spoke to man, and man lived. Man being under sin, and death as the judgment of God, one could understand the idea that if God spoke to man, man would die, but the contrary comes to pass.
{103}
But when Moses came down from the mount, he brought with him the tables of stone. That is, he brought down a record, and this proved that, beyond the fact of the voice of God speaking to man, a record was in the mind of God. Writing is a record. A thing committed to writing is recorded, and it was in the purpose of God to have a record or transcript of His mind. For the moment, the writing was on tables of stone. Moses brought the tables of stone down to the camp, but the children of Israel were sitting down to eat and drink and rising up to play. Moses broke the tables of stone and went up to the mount the second time, and received other tables written, we are told, with the finger of God, which he brought down into the camp and put into the ark of the covenant. What that witnessed was that the law of God must be vindicated in Christ before it could be written in the heart of man. The tables of stone were put up in the ark, they were hid there, it was the divine provision for them.
The antitype is seen in the new covenant, in which God speaks again about writing. He writes, this time, on the fleshy tables of the heart. "I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people; and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more".
Now, the new covenant is in evident contrast to the old. The old was connected with the writing of God upon the tables of stone, but the new with the writing of God upon the heart and mind of man, and this means an effective work of God in man which makes man a reflex morally of God. God works thus to make man responsive to Himself. The law was in
{104}
itself good, but if man could have kept the law, he would hardly have been responsive to God, for the love of God was not yet made known. The time of response to God had not yet come, and that is shown plainly enough in the fact of the ten commandments being written on tables of stone. The tables could give no response. The effect of the writing of God is not simply that a man becomes acquainted with the grace of God, but that man responds to the grace which is made known to him. He apprehends that God loves him, and then it is that he loves God, and is thus responsive to God.
Now, there was another point that came out in connection with the writing, viz., the glory in the face of Moses. Moses came out from God, he came from the glory where God was, and he carried in his face the reflection of the glory. His face shone when he came down to the children of Israel. It brought out this, that the writing had the ratification of glory; and signified that when the moment came for God to write in the heart of man, man would then behold the glory of the Lord. For the moment, the glory was there in type, but the people could not bear the glory, nor were they allowed to see the end, and therefore Moses put a veil upon his face when he spoke to the people, but when he went in to Jehovah the veil was taken away. You get the apostle applying this as a figure to Israel in his time. When Israel turns to the Lord, the veil, which is for the moment on their heart, is taken away, as it was in the case of Moses.
I hope you will be able to carry together the two thoughts of the writing of God and beholding the glory of the Lord. If we have the privilege of beholding the glory of the Lord, of entering the holiest, our competency to behold the glory is the fruit of the writing of God in us. It was that which enabled the apostle to behold the glory of the Lord. Do you think the bulk of Christians in the present day behold
{105}
the glory of the Lord? I doubt it. I am not unchristianising them for a moment; they believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, but I do not much think that they behold His glory. The reason is that the lines of God's writing are so poorly impressed on their hearts. Israel will be in advance of many Christians, for they will behold the glory of the Lord; not, perhaps, in the sense in which we do, but they will turn to the Lord when the law is written in their hearts and they will all know the Lord. "All shall know me, from the least to the greatest; for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more". Every one, from the least to the greatest, will have the knowledge of the Lord in that day, but then I think it is the blessed result of the law being written in their hearts and minds. Now, in the application to ourselves (for with us it is not the law written in the heart), we have something very much greater. What the apostle speaks about in the early verses of the chapter is not the law written in the heart, but a writing of Christ, ministered by the apostles, and in lines, not of ink, but of the Holy Spirit. That is, the Spirit of God is spoken of here in contrast to ink. I do not know whether you have ever noticed how an inscription is made upon marble. The letters are first cut out with a tool, but afterwards, they are lined in with ink. That is what the apostle, I take it, refers to here, and in contrast to the ink we have the Spirit of God. The lines become indelible; they are intended to be so. They are in the Spirit of God -- a permanent record of God. Now, I do not think that the work of God in a man's soul is done by an instrument. I think I can tell you to what extent God is pleased to employ instruments. Speaking in a general way, any light which man gets in regard to God comes to him by an instrument. I do not think that any instrument is seen in new birth, because it appears to me to be entirely and exclusively the work of the
{106}
Spirit of God. I think this comes out very markedly in regard to Israel in the future -- they will be born again; a nation will be born in a day. That must be the work of God; there will be no instrument employed there. But in the enlightenment of a man's soul (for that is what a man wants when he is born again) a human instrument is employed. The light exists, for the full light of the revelation of God was in the cross of Christ, but God uses human means to bring that light within the reach of a man's soul, and that is where the preaching of the gospel comes in. The commission to the greatest preacher that ever lived was "to open their eyes". When do you think a man's eyes are opened? When he is undeceived. The apostle was to enlighten the Gentiles, undeceiving them as to God. They were in the kingdom of Satan, in bondage to idolatry, and he was to open their eyes that they might "turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified, by faith that is in me".
The evangelist has to do a wonderful work. He may reason with people, like Paul did with Felix; he may persuade men, "knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men", but the great object to which all his means tend is that he may enlighten the souls of men in regard to God; in other words that he may open their eyes, that men may be undeceived by being enlightened with the revelation of God. And therefore you can understand that the more the soul of the evangelist is pervaded by the revelation of God, the better able he is to carry out his work of enlightening the souls of men.
As I have said, all the light of God has shone out in the death of Christ. The death of Christ is the declaration of God's righteousness. The holiness of God is witnessed in the cross. The grace of God is set forth in the death of Christ. And the death of Christ is
{107}
the expression of the love of God. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us". The power of God was seen, too, in the death of Christ. There it was that man's foe was vanquished. Christ is not only the wisdom of God, but the power of God. The power of man's great enemy was ended in the cross of Christ. The truth of the cross is the great stand-by of the evangelist. The more he is acquainted with the truth of the cross, the more effective he is, because by it he is able to affect men by bringing light into their hearts, and the light that he brings is the revelation of God. The evangelist's capital is the knowledge of the love of God, but enlightenment is not all. Man's heart has to be enlightened, but he has also to respond to the light, and that is where the work of God comes in again. Man's heart is not only to be enlightened, but to be so affected that he may respond to the light. If God makes known His righteousness, man is to respond to it; he becomes the servant of righteousness. If God makes known His holiness, it is that man may be holy because He is holy. And if God reveals His love, it is that man should respond to that love. But all the response which man gives to the revelation of God is the effect of God's work in him. This is not the work of the evangelist. The evangelist is employed to enlighten, but the response which the soul gives to the light is the work of God from beginning to end. He has begun a good work in us and will complete it for Christ's day.
Now, that is what I understand to be conveyed by the passage before us. The apostle could say to the Corinthians: "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart". Every line that is engraven in a man's heart is in the Spirit of God. If he loves God, it is in the
{108}
power of the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, if he loves the saints, it is in the Spirit. Everything written in the heart of a Christian is in the indelible lines of the Holy Spirit and that work never can be effaced. If I have got a great deal of light in my heart through the evangelist, that light may pass away; but if there is response to it in my heart, written in the lines of the Spirit, that never can pass away. All that is really effected in the soul of the believer is the work of the Spirit of God. It is most interesting to contemplate the work of God. God concerns Himself about every individual soul, He is no respecter of persons. He patiently carries on His work in the soul. It is very possible for you and me to hinder God, like the Galatians. The point for us is this, that, having begun in the Spirit, we should go on in the Spirit, that the Spirit of God may be left free to do His own proper work in the soul. The practical effect is that man becomes a reflex of Christ, as Christ, as man down here, was the expression of God. The Christian has put off the old man and put on the new. You could not speak of Christ doing this, though it is the truth in Jesus. Christ could put nothing off and nothing on. He was and ever will be what He is. He cannot be anything different, because, as a Man, He is morally the perfect expression of God. What came out in Him as a Man was what He is. He was the Living Bread come down from heaven. It is totally different with Christians. We have put off the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and have put on the new man, which is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth. It is all God's work -- a new creation. Now, the practical result is that Christians become the reflex of Christ, as Christ is the expression of God. When Christ was here upon earth, every blessed quality that marked Him was perfectly natural to Him. He was the heavenly Man down here, everything he expressed was of God and
{109}
according to God. And the Christian becomes the reflex of Christ, that is, he is so affected by the light God has given to him concerning Himself, so affected by the love of God, that he becomes the reflex of Christ Himself.
Being thus the subjects of Christ's writing, and having boldness to enter into the holiest, we behold the glory of the Lord. What I understand the glory of the Lord to be is that He is the minister, in power, of all that is in the mind of God. Every divine purpose is centred there; from that point everything will be set forth. If you go through the Old Testament, you will see that all the purposes of God were set forth in figure in different men. God set forth one thing in Adam; another in Noah; another in David; another, it may be, in Nebuchadnezzar. Thus, different men were used of God in Old Testament times for the setting forth of different purposes. Hence you see the feebleness of all, because there was no man then in whom *every* purpose could be set forth so that such purposes could be held as one system. There was as yet no man competent to hold all God's purposes, and, as a fact, God was dishonoured in all. Adam fell; Noah got drunk; David sinned and became liable to death; and Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold and commanded all the world to be idolatrous. But now we behold the glory of the Lord, all God's purposes centred and set forth in one Man, who has completely glorified God in regard of all that had dishonoured God. The glory of God has been secured in the very place where God has been dishonoured, and the One in whom God has been glorified is at the right hand of God, the centre of every divine purpose. He is Son of man -- He takes up Adam's dominion; He takes up David's kingdom -- He is ruler over the house of Jacob; He is Head of the Gentiles. Thus every ray of divine glory converges in Christ and is set forth to us where it cannot fail.
{110}
Now the time has come for glory; God has been glorified, sin put away by sacrifice, Christ is at the right hand of God, the centre and expression of divine glory. And now we behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, because the lines of the writing of God are in our hearts.
You are competent to behold the glory of the Lord as the effect of the writing in you of the Spirit. I am more and more persuaded that *God* does that work Himself, so that every line of writing in the heart of man should be engraven, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God.
{111}
LECTURES ON COLOSSIANS
{112}
{113}
Chapter 1
My thought, beloved friends, is, as the Lord may enable me, to seek to bring out what one might call the leading features in this particular portion of Scripture, the epistle to the Colossians. In many ways attention has been called to it of late. And it has a peculiar importance, because the special line of truth developed in it is in view of the proper testimony and service of Christians as one body on earth. I will show this more distinctly presently, but it is the peculiar character of the epistle. In order to help, I will contrast Colossians with other epistles. As I have said, the epistle has a peculiar interest if you want to know the service and testimony of saints as one body; not in their individuality. There is a great deal of our pathway which is connected with our individuality; I have to tread my path individually through the wilderness; and wherever saints are looked at as in the wilderness, it is always in their individuality. I do not see anything collective or corporate in connection with the wilderness; if you want to come to what is collective or corporate you must get beyond Jordan.
The epistle to the Colossians, as has often been said, does not contemplate Christians as having gone up into the land, but as over Jordan; they are at Gilgal, that is, in the place where circumcision is realised; that is, they understand what it is to be dead and risen with Christ in the place of spiritual circumcision, and spiritual circumcision is realised. In connection with this, especially in the third chapter, you get the saints as one body (for that is the point of view), and the character of Christ coming out in them. It has often been said, and I fully go with it, that no
{114}
one saint is adequate to express the character of Christ in its completeness; some feature or trait of Christ may be prominent in one particular saint, but if you want to get the character of Christ expressed in its fulness, you must have the whole body of saints in their relation one to another. And that is what we see in the third chapter.
Now before I pass on to what comes out in the epistle, I want to remark this: every epistle bears certain peculiar marks; and one mark which is stamped upon the epistle to the Colossians is, that it refers in a distinct way to Gentiles, it contemplates Gentiles. Other parts of the word of God, like the Hebrews, contemplate specially Jews, Jewish Christians; while the epistle to the Ephesians takes up in a peculiar way both Jew and Gentile; but the Colossians contemplates rather distinctly Gentiles. The proof of this is in the close of this first chapter, where the apostle says, "to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you" -- Christ in the Gentiles -- "Christ in you the hope of glory". And it is perhaps on that account, as being addressed to Gentiles, that in the first chapter stress is laid upon reconciliation. If you go to other parts of the word of God, where the Spirit of God is addressing Jews, you will find other distinctive marks.
Now, in speaking of this epistle in contrast to other epistles in the New Testament, I will first notice what you do not get, before I tell you what you do get. For instance, you do not get, as in Ephesians, the proper *heavenly* relationship of saints. You do not find, as far as I am aware or have looked into it, in the epistle to the Colossians, the truth of sonship, and that is the proper full heavenly relationship of saints. And it is the leading point in the epistle to the Ephesians, "Chosen us in him", we read there, "before the foundation of the world, that we should
{115}
be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto" sonship "through Jesus Christ to himself". What the epistle to the Ephesians opens with is the heavenly relationship to which we are called, that is, sons through Jesus Christ to God. But the epistle to the Colossians does not go on to that. Again, you will not find in it what you find in the first epistle of John. There the great point is the peculiar present relationship, as children, in which we stand. I do not mean to say but what sonship is a present relationship; but sonship in its scope and bearing refers to glory. We are predestinated to be conformed unto the image of God's Son, that is Christ in glory, "that he might be the firstborn among many brethren". That shows you the true idea of sonship. But what is peculiar to the first epistle of John is the relationship down here of children. I have no doubt there is the thought in both terms of association with Christ; but the thought of sonship is association with a glorified Christ; that of children is rather association with an unknown, rejected Christ. The latter is the peculiar truth which is developed in the first epistle of John; the calling of children, "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God", and in connection with this, the truth of eternal life. I do not think you will find either relationship brought out in the epistle to the Colossians. No doubt Colossians may touch John or touch Ephesians; but it has its own distinctive line, and that distinctive line is this -- the reproduction of the character of a heavenly Christ in the saints as one body, and it is this which leads me to say that the great point of the epistle is the testimony and service of the saints looked at as one body. You get it brought out in chapter 3 in the exhortations, while chapters 1 and 2 contain the doctrine which leads up to it.
Now I want to bring out a little, as the Lord may
{116}
enable me, the doctrine. I propose taking only the first chapter tonight, and I divide it into two parts. The first is the glory of Christ, which is the great introduction, the headship of Christ, if we may so say; and the second is the scheme of reconciliation which is in a way identified with His very being, and specially the reconciliation of persons which is going on at this present time.
In the second chapter the great leading thought is the suitability or correspondence of the saints to the Head. Then you come, in the third chapter, to the exhortations which show us the true character of the saints as one body down here.
Now, of course, all this demands death to the world. As long as people are hampered and hindered by worldly associations and so on, and take up the position practically of dwellers upon earth, the testimony is in measure marred. If you want to come out in this way, as part of the one body in which the character of Christ is displayed, you have to be set free from that which connects you with the course of things down here. Hence it is that circumcision comes in: we have put off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ to be vessels for the display of the character and life of Christ. But if that is to be the case you must have a practical breaking of the links which connect you with the course of things here.
Just one word more by way of introduction. You will find it peculiarly interesting to connect the epistle with @John 17: 20, of which it is the practical accomplishment, "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word, that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me". There it is, if I understand the verse aright, that the unity of saints here was to be the testimony to the world that the Father sent the Son. In Colossians the
{117}
point is the testimony of saints as one body. But then what it amounts to is this, that they become a testimony to the world that the Father sent the Son; that is, that if all the saints were walking together perfectly according to the mind and Spirit of God, the result would be a present testimony to Christ; and that is the object of this verse of the Lord's prayer in @John 17, "That the world may believe that thou hast sent me". All turns to that; the more you look into it in the word of God, the more you see that the carrying out of Christian obligations all results in testimony to the Son, that the Father sent the Son.
I do not purpose dwelling on the first part of the first chapter, as my points are, first, the glory of Christ, and secondly, in connection with it the great work of reconciliation. I do not think we attach quite enough importance to reconciliation. We have to remember that it is the purpose of God to put everything on that ground; and I think I might go so far as to say that it was the eternal purpose of God. I do not doubt for one single instant that God perfectly well knew everything which would come in in connection with creature responsibility; and I think it was in eternal purpose that everything should be based upon reconciliation; that is, upon peace having been made by the effective work of Christ. To go back to Leviticus for a moment, I quite admit that the day of atonement, which might perhaps be rendered the day of reconciliation, does not come out until the failure of the priesthood. It is after Nadab and Abihu had offered strange fire and died that God brings out the idea of reconciliation. But then, although it comes out in that way in the course of the testimony of God, I doubt not that it was in the eternal purpose of God. @Psalm 40 is a proof of it to me, because there it was in eternal purpose that Christ should become man, should take the body prepared for Him, and by the offering up of Himself lay the foundation of the will of God being accomplished
{118}
on that basis. Still it comes in in Leviticus strikingly, that after the failure of the priesthood, God reveals the great truth of reconciliation. Hence the day of atonement is the pre-figurement, the bringing out in type and shadow of the scheme of reconciliation; and that is what we have here in the first chapter.
And this has begun, although the time has not yet come for the reconciliation of *things*. Yet peace has been made and therefore God does not delay; and what is going on at this present moment, though not the reconciliation of things, is the reconciliation of persons. That is the great point of the present moment, so that the apostle can day, "You now hath he reconciled". The same thing is found in other parts of the word of God; in @2 Corinthians 5 the apostle speaks of the ministry which God had committed to him as the ministry of reconciliation, the basis of it being that "He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in him", and what the apostle was carrying out was this ministry, preaching the word of reconciliation. In Romans the same occurs, "By whom we have now received the reconciliation".
But I will refer for a moment to verses 12 and 13, in which is beautifully interwoven the thought of the Father and the Son. It says in verse 12, "Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light", for counsels belong to the Father; the accomplishment of counsels is the part of the Son, "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love". Thus we have a blessed unfolding of the Father and the Son; and further, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins". Now we come to the unfolding of the glory of the Son, "Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born
{119}
of every creature: for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father", or, as the verse might be read, "For in him all the fulness was pleased to dwell; and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself, by him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven". Now I would impress upon you one very important point in connection with the Lord, namely, that when He is presented to us in the epistles He is in general presented according to what He *now* is. There is plenty of unfolding in the word of God of what He *was*; but the point in the epistles is what is true in Christ now, what is true in Him as the risen glorified Man. If you want to understand the epistles, this is an important point to bear in mind. There is plenty in the epistles to tell you what He was; for instance, if I go to the second chapter of the epistle to the Philippians, I find what He was; that He existed in the form of God, and that He emptied Himself and took a servant's form, and became in the likeness of men; but in general where the epistles speak of the Lord Jesus Christ, they present Him to us according to what He is now, and they tell us what is true in Him now. For instance, in the next chapter: "In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily"; it could not, of course, be said that the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Him *bodily* until He became a man. Now that He has become Man, and is as man in glory, what we are told is that in Him dwells all the completeness of the Godhead bodily. John speaks also of what He is now; Jesus
{120}
Christ "the true God and eternal life"; that is what He is now as Man risen and glorified.
I only make that remark by way of preface before I pass on to speak of verse 15. What we find here is this, He is "the image of the invisible God". Beloved friends, He was eternally God; "the Word was God". Scripture takes uncommon care to guard the Person of the Lord Jesus; more care in regard to Him than in regard to any of the divine Persons, because He has become Man; and therefore Scripture is most tenacious of and careful to maintain His glory, the glory of His Person; "the Word was God". He existed as God, but when He existed in the form of God, you would hardly say He was "the image of the invisible God"; but now as Man He is, "the image of the invisible God"; for the invisible God is the invisible God, that is, He cannot be seen. But there is nothing of the invisible God that is not represented in that risen glorified Man, in whom dwells "all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". 'Image' is one of the strongest terms used in Scripture; Scripture uses both 'likeness' and 'image'; and 'image' is by far the stronger term of the two. There is no feature of the invisible God which is lacking or unrepresented in Him. But then it is all there in a man; He has taken the form of a servant, and become in the likeness of men, and is highly exalted as man, and remains man for ever; and in that Man dwells "all the fulness of the Godhead bodily"; He "is the image of the invisible God".
And then, more than that, He is "the firstborn of every creature". That is His relation as to creation. He is the 'firstborn', the One pre-eminent; just as God could say of David's son, "I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth". Firstborn of every creature is what He is in regard to creation: "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,
{121}
whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities or powers; all things were created by him, and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things consist". They all stand together by Him; apart from Him and without Him the whole fabric of the universe would fail; all subsists by Him. But the point of the passage is His pre-eminence in regard to things, that is, that no throne, or dominion, or principality or power, however exalted, can raise its head in the presence of Christ. They were created by Him, whatever they were. I could enumerate some of them, things that come out in the Old Testament, such as the king in Israel, the head of the Gentiles, the universal dominion of Adam; whatever it might be, "all things were created by him". Now mark another word, "by him and *for* him", that is, that He has a proper personal pre-eminence, a proper personal supremacy, in regard of every created thing. When the apostle speaks here of created things, he tells you what he means; he means thrones, and dominions, and principalities, and powers. "Thrones" and "dominions" refer perhaps more to what has been constituted and set up on earth; "principalities" and "powers" to what has been constituted in heaven. "All things were created by him and for him". That is His headship in regard to things.
But His headship would not be complete, if one might say so, if this were all; and we get another headship, and that is not in relation to things but in relation to persons. Now I want to call your attention to this. It says, "He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence". Here it is another character of headship altogether, and specially connected with the fact of His being man. He is the Head of the body; that is not a relation in which He stands to things, but to persons. The body is composed of persons. "He is
{122}
the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead". He is morally the beginning of everything; that is what He is in His own blessed Person in this connection. I believe that in the working out of God's ways in new creation, everything starts from the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ as man. He is "the beginning", in the virtue and excellence of His own Person. And not only the beginning, but He is "the firstborn from the dead"; He is pre-eminent among those who rise from the dead; "that in all things", as it says here, "he might have the pre-eminence"; that is, that He might be pre-eminent in regard of things, and pre-eminent in regard of persons. There is a double headship, as it were, brought out here, in order to pave the way for reconciliation; because it was according to the purpose and counsel of God that He should stand pre-eminent in regard to things and to persons. And so when the church thinks about Christ, He is "the beginning"; the church derives its life from Christ; and what is more, He is "the firstborn from the dead". And that is the truth which is unfolded to us in connection with this blessed risen glorified Man. Nothing, I believe, is more important for us as the starting point -- and it is the starting point of the epistle -- than to get the Lord distinctly before us in the glory of His Person. If anyone wants to help me, and I would wish to be helped, I would like him to inform me about that glorified Man. I want to know what He is, and what is the title He has as man to be there; because His glory there is the answer to what He effected here. The One that went "into the lower parts of the earth" has "ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things". But His ascending up "far above all heavens" is the answer to the going down to "the lower parts of the earth"; the exaltation is equal to the humiliation. The greatest reproach is to be put in "the lower parts of the earth"; and the exaltation
{123}
corresponds to it. And not only that, but I would like to know what He is in the moral qualities of His being; what that Man is that is in heaven. You may depend upon it, it is a study of eternity to know the truth of that heavenly Man; "the living bread out of heaven", as the Lord speaks of Himself in @John 6, "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven". I would like to know the grace of His Person, and to maintain in my soul, at the same time, His own proper dignity and glory as the eternal Son, equal with the Father.
But now I turn to the other point which comes out here, namely, the reconciliation -- what Christ is in reference to reconciliation. It says, "In him all the fulness was pleased to dwell, and having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven". Now, beloved friends, here we get a statement which witnesses to us the essential deity of Christ: "In him all the fulness was pleased to dwell".¦ This verse tells us what *was*, that is, that nothing was lacking there that is of the completeness of God, neither morally, nor in attribute, nor in anything else. "In him all the fulness was pleased to dwell". The point is this -- that the Son having become Man, the Spirit of God carefully maintains the glory of His Person.
¦In the reprint of these lectures the following words which appeared in the first issue have been omitted, namely: "I do not know when-that is not the point; and it does not say here 'bodily.'" Also a subsequent sentence: "It is not what is peculiar to the Son, it is only maintaining His essential deity, because all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in the Father; and so, too, in the Holy Spirit." The reason for the omission is that it has been represented to me that the Greek form of the words "to dwell" would connect the clause "In him all the fulness was pleased to dwell" with the Son as become Man. I had regarded it rather in the light of what was eternally true in Him as a divine Person.
{124}
But now I find another point which is exceedingly important; and that is how the great truth of reconciliation is connected, as it appears to me, with His eternal being. Look how the thought is carried on in verse 20. I do not know how otherwise to speak of the passage except as stating to us what the eternal good pleasure was. It does not say whose good pleasure. "All the fulness was pleased to dwell in him, and having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself". That is the great thought there, as it appears to me, connected with the Person and the glory of the Son, that in Him and by Him everything was to be reconciled to the fulness of God; everything was to be put on such a footing as that it might be for the good pleasure of God, the glory of God, that God might have His pleasure in it. It was all purposed in the Son, as far as I can see, and connected with His Person. It was He that was to make peace by the blood of His cross, and not only to lay the foundation in that way, but all things were to be reconciled by Him, "whether they be things in earth or things in heaven". It is not only a basis of reconciliation, but it is the carrying out of the reconciliation in effect, which He will do. Like the high priest, after he had sprinkled the blood on the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat, had to come out to reconcile things in detail, that is, to put everything on the basis of redemption; and that is what Christ will do. I believe He will take up everything in His own Person: He will take up the thrones, and the dominions, and the principalities, and the powers; everything is to be headed up in Him, gathered up in one in Him for God's eternal glory. It is in that way, as I understand it, that everything is put really on the basis of redemption, and everything held for the glory of God.
I can understand, too, the suitability of it. He held everything for God down here in humiliation. Nothing
{125}
could be more wonderful than the pathway of the Lord Jesus through this world; standing alone, without any kind of support from man -- for He never got any, He had to support man, but He got no support from man -- standing alone in His solitary path here, tried by every possible kind of pressure and temptation, and yet maintaining all here for the glory of God, so that nothing was let slip, nothing was lost. There was one Man stood here completely in all His pathway for the glory of God, so that at the close He could say, "Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world". He stood solitary; but He stood solitary in devotedness and faithfulness to God. Everything was secured; the glory of God was secured in His pathway as man down here; and God was completely glorified, even in regard to the question of sin, in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore I can understand the suitability, not only of everything being reconciled on the basis of the blood of His cross, but that He should hold all things to the glory of God.
I will come now to the present application of reconciliation. "And you, that were some time alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death; to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight; if ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister". Now, beloved friends, reconciliation is a very important truth to us; because if everything is to be put on the footing of reconciliation, we must be reconciled. You could not now be in any relationship at all with God except on the basis of reconciliation. God has revealed His purpose to put everything on that footing. Peace having been made by the blood of His cross, if you are to be in relationship to God, it must be on the basis
{126}
of reconciliation. But the time has not yet come for the reconciliation of things, and therefore we get the thought introduced here of the reconciliation of persons. If God had taken in hand at once, as it were, to reconcile things, you could not have had the church; but God has made room for the forming of the church, while the time has not yet come for the reconciliation of things. If you are not reconciled you do not stand in any present relationship to God at all; and, more than that, you are not justified. Reconciliation comes out, I think, prominently in connection with the Gentiles on account of their previous position: forgiveness of sins is more prominent in connection with the Jews, because they were under the law, and their sins were proved. Gentiles, as to their moral state and dispensationally, were far away from God, like the prodigal in the far country; not but that they needed forgiveness of sins as much as Jews; but in dealing with certain classes of people certain truths obtain prominence.
Now as to reconciliation, he says, "You now hath he reconciled". We have not got to wait for the reconciliation of things; if we had, we should not, as I have said, be in any present relationship with God. But, beloved friends, we are reconciled *now*; and I want to bring out, if I can, the character of reconciliation. "You now hath he reconciled", now mark this, "in the body of his flesh through death", that is what I want to bring out -- that Christ has so wrought as to put us on a completely new footing before God, death having come in upon the old footing. It is "in the body of his flesh through death". Manifestly I could not be reconciled by my death; but I am reconciled "in the body of his flesh through death". As God created man, man could never have gone into the holiest. "The first man is of the earth, earthy". The earthy man could never get into the holiest even as God made him; and to make a heavenly man out of
{127}
an earthy man, would hardly be consistent with His glory. When God created man, He made him earthy; He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul; and God saw all that He had made, and pronounced it very good. To alter that work would scarcely be suitable or consistent with the glory of God; and therefore the earthy man could never come into heavenly privilege. The fact is that God in His counsels of grace foreknew what has come in upon man. Sin has come in, and in the death of Christ God has brought in death upon the first man's state; and now we get the position of man completely altered before God. What is it here? "You hath he reconciled, in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight". It is virtually boldness to enter into the holiest. We have here suitability, personal suitability, for the fulness of God. I can dare to stand before God, dare to enter into the holiest, because I know that I am, by the grace of God, personally suitable. Christ has reconciled me by death coming in upon my first condition; and the purpose of God, in bringing in death upon it, was to present me "holy and unblameable and unreproveable" in the presence of the fulness of God. There you get heavenly footing, and not only heavenly footing, but the thought of heavenly condition; just as you get in @Ephesians 1, only in a different connection there -- eternal purpose -- "He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love". Reconciliation is thus a wonderful thing in its application to us! I look forward to the time when the glory of Christ will be displayed. Thank God, I know what the glory of His Person is; I know the relation in which He stands to all things, and the relation in which He stands to persons; I know God will fully vindicate Him, and that everything will be bowed under Him: I know, too, the part which He has in the
{128}
carrying out of the great purpose of reconciliation; and I know, too, the part which He has given to us. I bless the Lord Jesus Christ from the bottom of my heart that He was content to bring in by Himself death upon my first condition; not that I might be reinstated here -- He will reinstate His earthly people here -- but that I might be put on the footing of heavenly privilege, and might have "boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus". There it says not only "by the blood of Jesus", but "by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh". I get the same truth here: "You hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight".
Now that is your position, beloved friends, and mine. What better service could the Lord do for you than to instruct your hearts in the knowledge of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, that your faith and mine might be in that blessed Man who sits at the right hand of God; that you might know all that is true in Him there; and then that you might see what He has effected for you, to present you in the presence of the fulness of God and to present you perfectly suitable, so that you can be before God in peace, having boldness to enter into the holiest? Everything that is contrary has been removed from before God by the death of the Lord Jesus Christ, and now His thought is to present us "holy, unblameable and unreproveable". Of course, He puts it here, "If ye continue in the faith", because we have to continue in the faith as long as we are down here, and "not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven".
As I have said, we get in this first chapter the glory of Christ, and the great work of reconciliation which it is His to carry out; and our own part in connection with it, as reconciled by His death.
{129}
Chapters 1: 24 - 29; 2: 1 - 19
I read as far as I did, beloved friends, because that closes what one might call the doctrinal part of the epistle. The following verse carries us to the hortatory part. What I want to bring out tonight is what I referred to last time as being the substance of chapter 2, and that is the correspondence morally between the saints and Christ, looking at Christ as the Head. He is presented in that way in this epistle, because the apostle feared for the Colossians that they should fail to hold the Head. He does not charge them with "not holding the Head", but he warns them against the teaching of those that did not hold the Head. There was a class of persons that he speaks of here who were doing their own will in "humility and worshipping of angels". *They* were the people who were "not holding the Head"; and his fears were for the Colossians lest these teachers should gain influence over them; and the practical effect would be that they would fail to hold "the Head". Evidently the truth of "the Head" has a great place in the epistle. There are two passages in that part of the chapter which I read which show it. One is, "the body is of Christ". There is a great deal in that; it gives the character to the body. You would call it a truism to say that the body is of the Head; of course it is. But when you say the body is of Christ, that means a great deal. You cannot understand the character of the body if you do not receive that. Then the other truth that comes out is that the Head is for the body. You will say there is nothing very strange in that. No; but they are two very important things to understand if you want to know anything at all about the "calling"; the body is of Christ, and the Head is for the body.
{130}
I have rather anticipated, because I purpose coming to that more at the close; and I must go back a little to the end of the first chapter.
The apostle introduces in the first verse which I read the subject of his ministry, the second ministry. There are two ministries. At the close of verse 23 we have the first ministry; he speaks of the gospel "which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made minister", not 'made a minister' -- that is a misapprehension -- nobody else was made minister of the gospel in the sense in which Paul was. Then he goes on to say, "Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his body's sake, which is the church; whereof I am made minister" -- again, not 'a minister', but "minister" -- "according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints; to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily".
Now last time, beloved friends, I was speaking of the double Headship of Christ as unfolded in the first chapter; and also of reconciliation. Tonight, by the very necessity of what comes before us, I must speak about "the mystery"; and I want to show you an important difference of idea in the two. Reconciliation has to do with *the person*, the mystery brings in the truth of *the order*. I do not know whether everybody will understand this; but what I mean is that the mystery involves a new order; that is, that those who have part in the mystery are of a new order. I do not
{131}
see that this is so much involved in reconciliation, because reconciliation refers to my person; that is, that I personally am reconciled; and the climax of it is, that we become in Christ an expression of divine righteousness, because it is all based on this, that "He made him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in him". As Christ was made sin, and forsaken of God, in the presence of the universe, so the saints in Christ are the display of that divine righteousness in which the answer to what Christ has suffered for them is given. Paul was reconciled, or I am reconciled; as the apostle speaks about himself in connection with the gospel, "who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath committed unto us the ministry of reconciliation". That is what I mean by saying that reconciliation -- like justification -- has to do with the person. But when I come to the mystery it brings in another truth, and that is the order. Another passage will explain it. The apostle says, "the first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven". There is the order of the two men; because each is viewed as the pattern of the rest, the first man out of earth, earthy, the second man out of heaven. They are the heads and the patterns too. Then it goes on to say, "As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy" -- that is the order; "and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy" -- that is the order -- "we shall also bear the image of the heavenly". There are two orders, the earthy and the heavenly: the first man, out of earth, earthy, could not go beyond earth, because God had created him out of earth, and he was for earth. That is the first order. The second man, in contrast to that, is "out of heaven" -- the word should not be 'from', but "out of".
Now that brings me to the truth of the calling of God; and the calling of God, if I understand it, takes
{132}
two directions. One part of the calling of God is, that He calls man to glory; and the other part is, that He blesses man from glory. There is nothing at all new about that; but the distinction is important. The first calling is that He calls man to glory. If you want a confirmation of that, you will find it in @Romans 8, where it says that He has predestinated us "to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren". And I get the same thing in @Hebrews 2, "It became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory"; that is, that God calls to glory, and I can understand it; for, supposing it were otherwise, supposing there were no call to glory, there would not be fruit of redemption in heaven. There must be fruit there, as there will be fruit on earth; and therefore the call of God takes that direction, He calls to glory, and He calls to glory according to eternal purpose. That is unfolded in @Ephesians 1. But then there is another call of God, an earthly calling in which He blesses from glory. That is when Melchisedec comes forth, when the priest and king comes forth from glory. Just as Moses and Aaron, when they came out of the tabernacle at the consecration, blessed the people, so when the true Moses and Aaron comes forth -- in the Person of Christ, because Christ sustains both characters -- then will be made good the blessing and calling upon earth, the earthly calling. We are the subjects of the heavenly calling; that is, God is calling to glory. Christ, the second Man, is there; the pattern is there; and all are predestinated to be conformed to His image, "that he might be the firstborn among many brethren".
I can understand it being said, 'But the Old Testament saints will be in glory'. So they will, for we read in @Hebrews 12: We are come "to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect". And another passage which refers to them is
{133}
still more explicit; that is, they are "the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection". So, too, I find that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are to sit down in the kingdom of heaven. They have their part in the heavenly glory. And in the beginning of the unfoldings in the Revelation we find no distinction between saints in heaven, for the whole company of the heavenly saints is brought before us under the figure of the twenty-four elders; there is no distinction of the church seen there, though it is seen in the latter part of the Revelation, where we get the bride, the Lamb's wife.
All this is true, but there still remains the distinction of the church. Why is the church so distinguished? I think there are two things that God purposed about the church, though I feel I know very little indeed about the church, and hesitate to speak about it. I am quite familiar with the usual dogmatic statements but as to the truth involved in the church, the meaning of it in the word of God, that is another matter. But I do see two things about the church: one is, the purpose of God that there should be a company in heaven who should share the exaltation and acceptance and grace of Christ, the Head; and the other, that there should be a vessel in which the character and moral beauty of the Head were to be displayed down here. I see the one in Ephesians and the other in Colossians. In Ephesians I see the saints "raised up together and made to sit together in the heavenly places in Christ". What for? "That in the ages to come, God might show forth the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us, through Christ Jesus". The idea there is of a company in heaven in the exaltation and grace and acceptance of the Head. Beloved friends, how little we are up to it! The great thought in Ephesians is the church in the Head, the saints in the Head, the saints in Christ; we are "blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly
{134}
places in Christ"; He has made us "accepted in the Beloved". And therefore I can well understand that in Ephesians the church is viewed in heaven. It cannot be blessed as on earth. I do not know whether the thought is plain. We could not be blessed as on earth: we are blessed while on earth, but we could not be blessed in that connection as on earth, else we should have an earthly calling. If our calling is heavenly, we are blessed in heaven; and if you want to find the heavenly calling fully unfolded, you must go to Ephesians, and there it is that in the sight of God and before God the saints are raised up together, not only quickened, but raised up together and made to sit together in the heavenly places in Christ, that in the coming ages God might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness towards us in Christ Jesus. He will have a company which shall be there in the favour of the Head. That is one thought of the church.
Now, beloved friends, the other is the thought which comes out here in Colossians, and that is, that the church should be a vessel in which the character and the moral features of the Head should be displayed down here. This may hold good to a certain extent even in the future. I suppose that the church will be the special vessel even in eternity in which the character of the Head is displayed. I believe one thought about the church is this -- it is of the Head, and every member of it moves in concert with the Head. That is in the idea of the body, every member moving at the will of the Head. I want you to bear these two things in mind in regard to the church.
But there is another thing in connection with it, which will bring me to the scripture before us, and that is this. If what I have spoken of be true, that there is a company in heaven blessed in the Head, and the vessel down here for the display of the character of the Head -- it involves this much, they must be of a
{135}
new order, because the earthy order will not do for heaven. Make up your minds to that, beloved friends. I do not mean to say that we have done with the earthy yet; I am sure we have not, because we still bear the image of the earthy; but this I do say without hesitation, the earthy man will not do for heaven. He would not have done for heaven even as God made him; pure and innocent and good as he was, the earthy would not do for heaven. Therefore you must have a new man; and the second Man is out of heaven. You must receive that if you want to understand what Christianity is; the second Man is out of heaven. The first man was out of earth, earthy, and never could go beyond earth as he stood; and I venture to go further than that -- that if the first man had not failed, I believe it would not have been according to the glory of God that he should be recreated. But recreated he must be if he is to have part in the heavenly; and therefore when we come to Ephesians -- and so, too, in Colossians -- I get the great truth of a new creation brought in.
Now the truth I want to dwell on tonight is that the character of Christ is to come out here on earth. There are two things, blessing and character; we are blessed in heavenly places; the blessings are there, and in a sense *we* are there, but the character -- that is, the character of Christ -- is to come out here on earth. The character of Christ can come out in a foreign country in the saints. And the two important lessons to this end which I want to bring before you are, I must be of His order, and in moral correspondence to Him. So that what is *actually* true in Him is *morally* true of the saints. Because one great point which the apostle has in view in bringing before them the truth of chapter 2 is that they may be liberated from the power of things here. He takes up, one by one, a variety of things to which people are exposed here; opinions, philosophy, religiousness and superstition;
{136}
and brings before them a revelation of truth in order to effect their liberation from the influence of these things. That is the object of chapter 2, so that they may be at liberty; and in order to bring that about he shows to them their correspondence to Christ. I will just explain it. They are circumcised, buried with Christ, that is one point of correspondence. They are risen with Christ, that is another point, and they are quickened together with Christ; that is another. Then He goes on to show them that the body is of the Head, and the Head is for the body. He had already shown them at the close of chapter 1 that they were of His order. Look at chapter 1 verse 27; "To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory; whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus; whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily". Then in verse 6 of the next chapter, "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving". Then after that, he goes to warnings.
Now, beloved friends, it was a very wonderful thing for the apostle to be able to tell the Colossians that Christ was in them. He says, "To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you"; that is the new order. What would a Jew have thought if you had told him that Messiah was in him? A Jew could understand in a certain sense what it would be to be blessed here upon earth under the rule of Messiah; but I do not think it ever entered the mind of a Jew that Messiah should be in him. But that is the very thing he brings before the Gentiles,
{137}
the truth of the mystery; and that involves a new order; not simply that I am personally reconciled, but that Christ is in me the hope of glory; Christ is my life. Is not that a new order? Here you find, so to say, the heavenly Man, Christ, is in me; and, he adds in the next chapter, "As therefore ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord"; and that is true of every Christian. It is not a question of attainment, but it is the peculiar form in which the gospel presents itself to the Gentiles, as the apostle says in @Galatians 1, "When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him as glad tidings among the heathen". I have thought that the peculiarity of Paul's ministry is this, that not only are we forgiven through Christ, but that Christ becomes the life of those who are forgiven, and that therefore it is "Christ in you the hope of glory". It is the way in which the mystery presented itself specially to the Gentiles, "Christ in you the hope of glory". It is a blessed thing to think that Christ is my life, Christ is in me. It is not only that I am in Christ -- that is a question of acceptance, and favour, and blessing; but Christ is in me. You get John running quite parallel with it, for he says, "He that hath the Son hath life". There may be a distinction between Christ and the Son, but Paul and John run on parallel lines. "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life". Christ is our life; as the Lord said in @John 6, "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me". And I see the wonderful grace which was manifested in His incarnation, in His becoming Man in order that we might live by Him. You may say, I could never live by Him if He had not died for me. I quite admit that; "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you". But I see, too, the grace of His incarnation; that He became man that we might
{138}
eat Him and might live by Him; as another has expressed it, that He might be digested by faith into the life of our being. It is Christ in me the hope of glory. I have exchanged my order. I am quite alive to the fact that I am here on earth, and that you cannot bring the things of the new order into the old order; but still the fact remains that I am of the new order; Christ is in me. And another truth is that Christ is to rule, even in the things of the old order. Christ is to rule in the details of my life down here, even in those things which I shall have to drop when I die, all human relationships and responsibilities, and everything of that kind. There are many things, such as human relationships and relative duties, and so on, that I cannot connect Him with directly, because He is out of them all. But as long as I am in them, as long as any Christian is in them, Christ is to rule. I have to carry it out in the appointments and details of my house and everything else. In the very way in which I adorn my house, I would like to raise the question, 'Is that morally suitable to Christ?' In all the detail of life Christ is to rule, because though I have not yet actually done with the old order, yet I am of the new order, and Christ is in me the hope of glory.
Then another important point comes in, and that is, the ministry of Christ to the soul; that the soul may grow up into Christ; as the apostle says in the last verse but one, "Whom also we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus". It is not exactly here a question of the body, but of "every man"; the apostle concerned himself in regard to every individual saint, in that sense, that every one should grow up unto perfection in Christ. That is, that all the moral qualities of Christ, as it were, should be formed in us in the power of the Holy Spirit. A full grown man, to my mind, is a man who
{139}
not only has all the faculties, but where all the faculties are in exercise. And that is the idea, I think, of a full grown Christian; not simply that all the faculties are there -- the faculties are there in everybody who has received Christ -- but that all should be in exercise. I think that is the idea in "That we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus". It has often been said that that verse does not refer to glory, but to the effect of ministry down here.
There is just one word more in this connection in verses 8, 9, 10 of the next chapter: "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power". It is that which is now true, beloved friends, in the Person of Christ, that which characterises that Man in glory; for having become Man, He remains man for eternity. I am not going to attempt to explain to you what the completeness is, or what it consists of; the point of the passage is that the completeness of the Godhead is there, and it is in connection with that "you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power". Now I am sure you will agree with me that if you are of the order of the heavenly man there is nothing upon earth that can teach you or instruct you with regard to that. I meet with a very great deal here on earth that can instruct me in connection with the fallen man, and his ways, and what he is; but I can get nothing upon earth, no philosophy or anything else that can possibly instruct me with regard to the heavenly Man; and therefore I have to learn it all from Christ Himself. And that is what the apostle is teaching them here; "Ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power"; that is, you are independent of all else; that is the great thing: I have not to turn to
{140}
any addition. I would take a great deal of pains in many things, would learn languages and the like, if I had the ability and time, to help me to understand all the unfoldings of Christ in the word of God; but I do not want anything additional to Christ. If I were to go the world over, and read all the philosophy and wisdom in the world, it would not help me to understand anything about the character and ways of the heavenly Man; I have to learn every bit of it in the unfolding which Scripture gives me of Christ Himself. The wonderful thing about Him is this, that while in Him dwells the completeness of the Godhead bodily, we are complete (the word is the same) in Him, who is the Head of all principality and power. I believe it is a great point for saints to be consciously independent of that which is here. I do not mind being accounted a fool in the world, though I may not be much more a fool than other people; but you cannot instruct me, you can give me no manner of help with regard to the heavenly Man; I can only learn that in Christ Himself and I say, Thank God I am complete in Him who is the head of all principality and power. I can give my whole attention, by the grace of God, to learning what Scripture unfolds to me of Christ.
I commend to your study @John 6. There I get the great truth brought out of the wonderful grace, that heavenly grace, which has come down here, manifested in the incarnation of the Son. The blessed, eternal Son of God became man, came into the world, in order that He might be life to it; that is, that we might eat Him and live by Him. His death comes in for our deliverance, because His death was needed that we might be delivered from the flesh and its connections; but the great point is, "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me". I appropriate and feed on the heavenly grace manifest in His having become man. People often think the incarnation merely refers to what Christ was here after the flesh. It is a great
{141}
mistake. There is hardly a thought that is set before us in John's gospel in regard to Christ which you cannot carry on to resurrection; and the incarnation not merely refers to what He was here as come after the flesh, but it refers equally to what He now is, because He is still man.
Now as to our correspondence to Him. That comes out here in verses 11 to 15: "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the flesh" -- omit the words "of the sins", because they ought not to be there -- "by the circumcision of Christ; buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it". Now I want to touch on the three points which come before us here. The first is circumcision, which brings in the thought that we are buried with Him; the second is, we are risen with Him; and the third is, we are quickened with Him. The words "with him" are exceedingly important, because they give the character to the thing. If I were risen, simply risen, apart from risen "with him", I should be raised to judgment; and I could not conceive the thought at all of being quickened except it were "quickened together with him". It gives the character to it. The first is circumcision; and the point of the whole passage is, that what is actually true in Christ is morally true in us. What I mean is this; that for Him circumcision has actually taken place in the cross, and that He is actually cut off from everything after
{142}
the flesh, in order that He might be exclusively unto God, "In that he died, he died unto sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God". He is no longer known after the flesh. Then He is risen, that is, the bands of death are loosed; that is what I understand by resurrection. And more than that, He is quickened; that is, He is raised again from the dead in what I may call actual suitability as man for glory. Not but what even when here after the flesh He was morally suitable to glory; it has often been said He might have retired from the mount of Transfiguration to glory; the glory saluted Him; but He was raised again from the dead in a condition of power and glory suited to the place He was to take as man on high. Just refer to @Psalm 21, "The king shall joy in thy strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips; for thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness, thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head: he asked life of thee and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever". I do not think anybody can question the application of that scripture to Christ personally; nor can I doubt it was made good in resurrection; that is, that, as a man down here, He asked life in view of death, and God gave it to Him, "even length of days for ever and ever". That is what I should call the quickening of Christ; He is raised from the dead; in fact, the very word 'quickened' is applied to Him, so that you have not to go outside Scripture for it. We are told He was "quickened in the Spirit". Not only were the bands of death loosed, but He was raised in glory. He is no longer in weakness and humiliation, as He was down here, when He came to accomplish the will of God; but He is quickened in the Spirit, He is raised in glory, He lives of the power of God.
{143}
Now there are those three things: circumcision, which cuts Him off from all here, and He lives unto God; the bands of death are loosed, because He is raised; and He is quickened, that is, He asked life and God gave it to Him, even length of days for ever and ever. That is what is actually true in Christ. Now I say the saints are in correspondence to Christ, and that is morally true of every saint. You are circumcised; every saint has accepted the cross. You are buried with Him in baptism, the putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ. If you have not, you can never go into the holiest, because it is only on that ground you can go in. Flesh never goes into the holiest. You can only really enjoy Christian privilege as having put off the body of the flesh. Every real believer is on that ground, whether he realises it or not. Putting off the body of the flesh is that a Christian realises spiritually that which was formally expressed in baptism. What for? So that I can be faithful and for God. If I am ruled by the flesh -- because the body of the flesh means the rule of the flesh -- I am sinning; for if I am ruled by the flesh I follow the bent of the flesh: "The lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life". No, I say I have put off the body of the flesh, the rule of the flesh, that is what I profess to have done. And what for? that I may be separate to God. That is the idea of circumcision.
Now I come to the second: I am risen together with Him, the bands of death are loosed for me. That is true morally of every Christian. I am no longer in terror of death. The bands of death are actually loosed in the case of Christ, He is actually risen; but for me they are loosed morally. Death is no penalty upon the saint; and now I can be with God, and death is not between. If death were upon me as penalty, I could not be with God; nor could you; nobody could be with God if there were a shred of
{144}
penalty upon him. The bands of death are loosed, and death is no longer on the saint as penalty; he is with God.
Now I come to the third point, which is intimately connected with resurrection; and that is, I am quickened together with Christ, so that I might live according to God. I am actually by the quickening power of God made alive in a way which is suitable to God Himself; quickened in a heavenly life, in the power of the Holy Spirit, that is the meaning of it. That is the wonderful thing which has come to pass in every Christian. It is a most wonderful thing, because the words "with him" give you the character of it. You could not understand the character of it if it did not say "with him". It could hardly say in an absolute sense that we are quickened, because we have yet to be quickened in regard to our bodies; but in regard to our souls we are actually made alive before God, so that we live in the order of Christ, "in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him". That is the effect of being made alive in association with Christ by the power of God. What a thought it is! How far have you and I entered into it? That we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Jesus! It is not simply that I approach God, that I pray to God; but I have boldness and confidence like a son; boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Jesus; that expresses the result of quickening. I am brought to the blessed sense of this, that I am before God, the object of His love and favour, as a son in whom He delights, and I have the answer to it by the power of the Holy Spirit in me.
When you talk of all these things you must remember that what the apostle speaks of here is what will carry on to eternity. What I have as a condition of soul now, I shall have as an actual condition then. Christ has it as an actual condition now, and we have it now
{145}
as a condition of soul by the quickening power of God. I believe many people have made great mistakes in regard to life, in viewing it as a something substantive which is communicated to us. I can understand life in God, because God is eternal; He lives, He is. But *I* live, and so does every saint, simply by the quickening power of God. I am made alive now in my soul together with Christ, after His order, and eventually I shall be made alive in body after His order: "As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly". The point in this chapter is that the saints are placed in moral correspondence with Christ; and the point which comes out in the exhortations in the next chapter is that the character of Christ is to come out in us practically as one body.
I have only one word more to add as to what it says later on. "Let no man, therefore, judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, and not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God". I want you to bear two points in mind, because they are exceedingly important. The body is of Christ. You say, Of course the body is of Christ. Well, but the body is of the Head. My body is of the Head, and my body corresponds to the Head. And so, as to the body of Christ, the body must correspond to Christ, else it would not be the body of Christ. He warns them against shadows, because in following shadows they were in great danger of losing the substance. The words 'body' and 'substance' are the same, and you might read it 'substance', but that
{146}
would mar the sense, because I have no doubt the idea is that "the body" is of Christ. The moral thought it conveys to my mind is that the body is of the same kind and character; and must be, or it would not be of the Head. Then on the other hand comes out the other truth, that the Head is for the body. My head is for the body. What cares for my body if the head does not? The body cannot care for itself; but the head cares for the body. You have not got to seek of Christ to care for His body. It is a great comfort in the present distracted state of Christendom that, after all, the Head is for the body. It is not simply because we are in the truth that Christ cares for us, but He cares for His body, and for every member of His body. Why? Because He is the Head of the body. But it is a great thing to hold the Head, and to know that what tends to the nourishment of the body really comes down from the Head, because the Head is for the body. The body is of Christ, and the Head is for the body; and, as brought out in the next chapter, the character of the Head is to come out in the body. And it is a great deal better that the character of the Head should come out in the body, than that our character should come out; that the features, so to say, of the Head should be seen in the body than that our moral features should come out, for they are not very attractive. But you cannot conceive anything more wonderful than that there should be a body of people upon earth, conscious of what they are in Christ and of what Christ is to them, and that they should manifest in this world the character of the Head; kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, putting on love, which is the bond of perfectness; all the blessed character and features of the elect of God, for Christ is the elect of God, coming out in the saints in one body down here. You may think these things in a certain sense are transcendental; but they are not so, they are the
{147}
truth of Christianity. People say, 'I do not come up to it'; but do not let us give up the truth because we do not come up to it. Whether we come up to it or not, let us have a right standard. The point is to see what our calling is, to see what the church is in the sight of God; accepted in association with and in the grace and favour of the Head, and the vessel in which the character of the Head is to come out down here. That is the divine thought of the church, the members in the Head for acceptance and exaltation, and the Head in the members for character down here. May God give us grace to bow to it that we may accept the great truth of the new order, that we may see the blessed reality of it, and what has taken place in order that it may be brought out -- how that Christ humbled Himself; He that existed in the form of God has become a man, has died and is risen and is in us the hope of glory, and we are growing up unto Christ; for the point to be attained is the full-grown man, all the spiritual senses in exercise and activity. I commend the truth to you, and pray God it may be blessed to every one of you. As I said last week, if I had to wait till I could speak without defects I should have to wait long enough. I can only bring the truth before you according to my little apprehension of it, and commend to you, not so much what I have said, but the truth to your attention, and to your consciences and hearts.
Chapters 2: 20 - 23; 3: 1 - 17
I have said, beloved friends, more than once, in looking at this epistle, that it gives to us what one might call the proper testimony and character of the saints here, looked at as one body. Also, that the epistle does not, as the epistle to the Romans, contemplate saints in their individual path. We have to distinguish between things that differ. We know well
{148}
enough that we all have our individual path and things connected with it. That is the path through the wilderness, and so far as I see what is connected with the wilderness is individual. But there is another character of things that has to be maintained among saints, which comes especially before us in the epistle to the Colossians; and that is the relation of saints one to another -- their proper testimony and character as one body.
It is, I think, comprehended in the term which we get in chapter 3 -- "the new man". It says, "Ye have put off the old man and have put on the new". That is what I want to come to tonight; how the truth is to come out in practice. In the first two chapters the apostle had unfolded the doctrinal groundwork of it all. The apostle gives us in these chapters what is true of the saints before God; that is the doctrinal basis, and then in the third chapter he gives us the exhortations, the practice in which it is to work out; so that in the character and walk of the saints down here as one body, Christ is to be reproduced.
But now I just refer for a moment to the substance of what has come before us on previous occasions. We began in chapter 1 with the glory of Christ, His double Headship; and with it reconciliation. And you must begin there, because God has seen fit to put everything on the basis of reconciliation, and if you are not reconciled, you are not in any relationship with God, because nothing has really any place before God except what is on that ground. Christ has made peace by the blood of his cross, to reconcile all things to himself; and I pointed out that the time has not yet come for the reconciliation of things, but that what is being effected at this time is the reconciliation of persons. And in connection with that, Christ comes out as the Head of the body. Persons are reconciled; "You now hath he reconciled". Then in the latter part of the first chapter, and in the second chapter, we
{149}
saw the new order, that saints now are of a new order -- Christ is in them. Manifestly that is a new order; it never was true before, and I do not know that it will be true upon earth again; because as far as I can judge, it is peculiar to the church. "Christ in you the hope of glory"; that is the new order; and you are complete in Christ; and so it says, "As therefore ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him".
Then in addition to that, we saw the correspondence of the saints to Christ, circumcised, buried with Christ, risen with Christ, quickened together with Christ. I was pointing out that the expression "with Christ" which is added to these terms gives to them their character; you could not understand what it is to be risen if you did not understand risen "with Christ" nor could you know the character of the quickening if you did not see it is quickened "with Christ": that gives the character to it. And what it involves is this -- association with Christ; we are risen with Him, in association with Him; whatever He is risen to we are risen to; whatever He is quickened to we are quickened to. Just as we get in @Romans 6, "Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus". Why? Because Christ "died unto sin once, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God". Therefore you reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin and alive unto God in Christ Jesus. You are quickened together with Him; that gives the character.
I only say that much by way of preface, because it is the doctrinal basis of the epistle. Tonight I want to follow the course of the exhortations, and to refer especially to "the new man". And here I may remark how the proper testimony of saints is marred by the existing condition of Christendom. The very idea of rivalry, or opposition, or antagonism, or anything of that kind is utterly contrary to the thought of
{150}
"the new man". And "the new man" is what we have put on. The way it is stated is remarkable. He says, "Having put off the old man, and having put on the new". That is the truth in Jesus. I daresay there are many who have taken up the profession of Christianity that do not know very much about the new man; but still there it is; when he speaks in that way he speaks of the proper ground of Christianity. Of course, the putting on the new man involves a work of God, new creation. The new man is created; but as to Christian profession and character, we have put off the old man and put on the new. And you and I have no title to walk save according to the new. If you walk in the old you are inconsistent, because you have avowed to put off the old and to have adopted the new, and therefore your responsibility is to walk according to what you have adopted as having put on the new. I will come to what that is presently. I doubt if it is very much understood, else I think we should see a very different kind of practice on the part of saints, very different ways on their part.
But I must follow the course of the exhortations, the Lord enabling me. "Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances (touch not; taste not; handle not; which all are to perish with the using), after the commandments and doctrines of men? Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour, to the satisfying of the flesh. If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God". Now it is evident that what the apostle is urging on the Colossians he is urging on us, and that what applied to the Colossians applies to us. That is evident from what he says in chapter 2: 1 "I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as
{151}
have not seen my face in the flesh". We have not seen the apostle's face in the flesh, and yet he had great conflict for as many as had not seen it. Now what he urges is consistency with our standing; that is the first thing; and he takes up in the exhortations what he had said in chapter 2: 11, 12: "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: buried with him in baptism; wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead". He appeals to them at the close of chapter 2 as being "dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world", and in the beginning of chapter 3 as being "risen with Christ". He says, if you are so why are you inconsistent with it? Why, as though living (or alive) in the world, are you subject to ordinances? Beloved friends, the truth is this, that people who take the ground of being alive religiously in the world may be rightly enough subject to ordinances -- may be content to be instructed without intelligence to do this and that, and to abstain from doing this and that. The idea of dogmatism is that I submit my will to ordinances; it is just what suits the flesh. It is very manifest how people are well content to surrender their consciences to spiritual directors; that is the history of Christendom to a large extent, and it existed before there was any Christianity at all, because it was the principle of heathenism, and even of Judaism. The difference was, that in Judaism there was the "shadow of good things to come", and, of course, there was nothing of that in heathenism. Still, it is a remarkable fact that when Christianity came in, the apostle does not hesitate to describe Judaism as "the beggarly elements". And yet in spite of this the mass of people are content to be subject to ordinances, to do what they are told to do, and to abstain from doing what they are told not to do, and that in face of the apostle's
{152}
warning, "why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances?" If I were a high churchman, I should obey my spiritual directors and ask no questions; I should commit my conscience, in a sense, to their keeping, and what I was told to do I would do.
But that is exactly what the apostle will not have. He says, "If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world", Christ is dead from the rudiments of the world; in a sense He came under them, for He was circumcised and the like, "made of a woman, made under the law"; but He died out from them, and we are dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, so that all that character of things should have no application to us at all. That is what the apostle brings before them. I am outside all that which applies religiously to man in the flesh, whatever it may be, whether heathenism or Judaism or the corrupt Christianity of the present day; if it applies to man as being alive on the earth, it has not its application to me, because I am dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, and I am privileged to understand things as before God; to have intelligence of things spiritually before God is the very opposite of being dogmatised.
Now that is the first thing. Then he goes on to say, "If ye then be risen with Christ". Now mark again here the expression "with Christ", because that gives the character to it. I was saying last time that the force of resurrection is that the bands of death are loosed. But there is more than that in it, because you are risen together with Christ, and if you are risen together with Christ you are in touch with heaven. I am quite sure that Jesus was always as man, morally in touch with the heaven from which He came; that is clear enough from what took place on the mount of Transfiguration; but more distinctly still He is seen in relation to heaven when He rose again from the dead. His earthly path of faith was over; and when
{153}
He meets Mary He says, "Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go tell my brethren, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God". We are risen together with Christ, so that the bands of death are loosed; death is no longer upon us as penalty, and more than that, we are in touch with the scene to which Christ is gone: and therefore He says, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God". That is a great thing to do, because one looks for everything to come forth from there. I do not expect very much to be effected here upon earth. I cannot say I am one of those sanguine people who expect to see any very great improvement effected here: it is a mistake to look for it; but I think that a very great deal will be effected from the right hand of God. Christ is sitting at the right hand of God; that is where man has gone in the Person of Christ, and everything will, I judge, come forth from thence. He is in the place of supreme honour, and power, the right hand of God, Now we are in touch with that blessed scene, as risen together with Christ, and the exhortation is, "Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth; for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God". Remember, beloved friends, it is an exhortation; and mark this, it is an exhortation to be consistent. The apostle says, "If ye be risen". He does not raise any question as to whether they were risen, for they were so; he tells them so positively in the preceding chapter: any more than he raises a question as to whether they were dead, for he tells them they had "put off the body of the flesh". How can you have a more distinct figure of death than putting off the body of the flesh? If you die, that is what will take place, the body of the flesh will be put off. He does not raise any question as to their having died or being risen with Christ; but he takes
{154}
them up as in Christian standing, and the exhortation is to be consistent with it; as much as to say, You have taken that ground, now walk and act in accordance with it: "Seek the things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God". And what the expression "things above" presents to my mind is the whole scheme of what is to be accomplished in Christ. I think you will find the idea of it in @Hebrews 12. I do not go into it now, but if you turn to it at your leisure you will find there the things about which God is now speaking to us from heaven. When God had brought Israel out of Egypt they were clear of judgment and clear of the enemy's power, but they were not clear of the flesh; and therefore God spoke to them that which tested the flesh, and they mostly perished by the flesh in the wilderness. But in regard to Christians, the great truth is that God has no question of the flesh to raise with us at all; every question has been settled for God in the cross, and what He now speaks to us of are the things above. The contrast in @Hebrews 12 is between what He spake on earth and what He speaks from heaven. He speaks now from heaven, and therefore speaks of the things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.
I sometimes think there is a tendency to regard the things above as being something for the imagination, but it is not so. You could not set your mind on things above if they were not revealed; but they are revealed, and what is more, there is an energy in the Christian -- Christ is in him -- by which he can "seek the things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God". For if Christ is in me, in the very nature of things, the power in me will go up to its source. The power of the Holy Spirit in me must lead me in thought and feeling right up to the source; as it says in @John 4, "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into eternal life".
{155}
Now we will go on to the next point. "For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry; for which things¬ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: in the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; and have put on the new man". Now, beloved friends, this thought, "Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God", is also taken up from the previous chapter. In chapter 2: 13 it says, "You, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses". I suppose that everybody knows that the meaning of the word 'quicken' is to make alive; that is, you hath He made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses. Now he says, "For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God". The meaning of the expression I judge to be this -- that our life, the proper life of the Christian (I am not now speaking of the life of the Christian morally) in its actual condition has not yet come out into manifestation. @1 John 3: 2 will explain it: "Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is". That is, what we are to be is yet hid, and I think that is the force of these words: "Ye are dead, and your life is hid ..". And in the next verse we find, "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory". Beloved friends, nobody knows really what
{156}
we are going to be like; a man has never been manifested yet from glory. When Christ who is our life is manifested, we shall appear with Him in glory. I can understand anyone saying, Was not Christ seen after resurrection? Yes; but I think the great point of the scripture is this, that what we are to be is to be manifested from glory. To a large extent Colossians is, I think, a question of testimony; and that will be the testimony then, the accomplishment of @John 17: 23, for it is not the same thought that you get in the Ephesians, "That in the ages to come he might shew forth the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us by Christ Jesus" -- that looks at the church in the grace and favour of the Head; the thought here is that we are to come out in glory. "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory". In the meantime our life is hid with Christ in God.
And hence there is another side of the truth, and that is death, here. At the close of the preceding chapter it is death to what is religious, death from dogmatism and ordinances; here at the beginning of this chapter it is more absolute: it says, "For ye are dead". It has often been said that this is the most absolute statement of the kind we have in Scripture. What it means to me is this, that I am dead to the whole course of things morally in the world. It is not simply I am dead to sin or dead to the law, but dead to the whole course and order of things in which flesh lives. For a confirmation of it I would turn to @1 John 2: 15, 16: "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world".
And here I would like to explain a difference in principle between John and Paul. John, as far as I
{157}
can understand, gives you the character of things essentially; Paul gives you your position in relation to them; and I gather that here in the Colossians we are viewed as dead to the whole course of things in which flesh lives, all that goes to make up the world. In John the young men are taught to judge it; that is, to see that what goes to make up the world, is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. That is just as true today as it was when John wrote; and it is *all* that is in the world. Paul says, "Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God". Supposing there was nothing in the world to minister to the lust of the flesh, or of the eyes, or to the pride of life, what would become of people? The mass of people live in these things, and could not get on without what tends to gratify the flesh and the eyes. And the pride of life is a tremendous factor in their existence. Everybody almost has an idea of getting on in the world, and there is the keeping up of appearances, and that sort of thing, "the pride of life". And what the apostle John says is this, "All that is in the world ... is not of the Father". It is all hard and selfish -- there is nothing of real affection in it. And now we have the admonition to "mortify", because you are dead; that is, I have to cut off the connection in myself. I look about me, and see on every hand what tends to minister to the flesh, and what pleases the eye, and what is a temptation to ambition and so on, and have to learn that the connection has to be cut, as it were, in myself. I am dead to it all, and my life is hid with Christ in God; that is the point, and therefore he says, "mortify".
I do not want to dwell much upon it, but he says, "Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness" -- that is, the lust of the flesh -- "inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: for which things¬ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
{158}
disobedience: in the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth" -- here we get the emotions and tempers of the flesh more -- "Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; and have put on the new man which, is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him". Now this brings me to the old man and the new man. The character of the old man is given to us in Ephesians; and what I want to speak about is the character of the new man, and to show you how the whole order of things in professing Christianity is contrary and opposed to the idea of the new man.
Now I believe the thought of the new man is connected with testimony here; it is really a new creation. It is remarkable how certain things stand connected in Scripture. You will find that where the Spirit of God speaks about the body of Christ, the truth of quickening is introduced; while the new man is connected with new creation. So it says in @Ephesians 2: 15: "For to make in himself of twain" -- the word 'make' there should be 'create' -- "to create in himself out of twain, one new man, so making peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby". There you get two thoughts, the one new man and the body. The thought connected with the body is to reconcile unto God both Jew and Gentile in one body; but the previous thought is that He creates out of the two in Himself one new man. Then in chapter 4: 24: "And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created" -- there you get the thought of new creation again -- "in righteousness and holiness of truth". Now, as far as I can see, there is only one man now, properly, that comes under the eye of God. The new man has come in; and Scripture never speaks of an old until there is a new. The old man is the old,
{159}
because a new man has come in; and the new man is Christ, in what I may call His moral features and character. I think that is the idea of the new man, and is what a Christian has put on. "As many of you as have been baptised into Christ, have put on Christ". We profess to have put off the old man and to have put on the new; to have put on Christ as to His moral features and character. You have to remember this, that Christ has come under the eye of God here upon earth; and even in regard to the future, in the millennium, I believe what will come under the eye of God will be Christ. It appears to me in that day everything will be covered, as it were, by Christ, everything is put under the hand of Christ; and all is headed up in Him. Now in the interval we have Christ in the saints. They profess, as I said, to have put on Christ. And that is possible, for Christ is in them. How could Christ come out if Christ were not in us? The thing would be totally impossible; but the character of Christ may come out because Christ is there. "Christ in you the hope of glory". You have received Christ Jesus the Lord, and you are to walk in Him, and your testimony is to be, so to say, the character of Christ.
Now there are two great thoughts connected with the new man which I will dwell upon, unity and character. No such thing can be found in connection with the old man, except a very bad character. Look at what it says: "You have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision; Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but Christ is all and in all". If Christ is all and in all, manifestly it is unity, because it is one Christ in all the saints; it is unity because it is one new man, He makes in Himself out of twain one new man. It is not that there are so many new men; that is not the idea presented to us; but it is
{160}
to make out of twain one new man. And so here, "Christ is all and in all". Therefore, as he says, "There is neither Greek nor Jew". In the new man all these distinctions are gone; there is no Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free. I forget all these things in the realisation of the new man: Christ is all and in all, and my mind is, so to say, withdrawn from distinctions which exist in the flesh. I may have to do with those distinctions in my individual path in the wilderness, but in the circle of the saints all those distinctions have to be forgotten. The great truth now is unity in the new man, because Christ is all and in all, and all the distinctions which existed in the flesh are abolished in what is connected with Him in glory.
Now look abroad for an instant on the state of Christendom. What a practical denial it is of the truth. When we see saints mixed up with profession, and separated into great professing bodies here upon earth, I say it is a denial of the truth of the one new man; because what marks them is rivalry, and opposition, and all that kind of thing. It only proves to me how Christianity has been degraded, and the idea of the new man completely lost. But here it is, and the first great thought connected with it is unity, that is, "Christ is all and in all". If I think of myself, Christ is in me; but then if I think of another saint, Christ is in that saint, too, and it is only one Christ, and therefore you can have but one new man. If you want to understand anything about true unity, you must first understand the new man; nobody can have any right thought of unity without it. They try to bring unity about in other ways; to get a broad platform on which Christians generally can unite; that is very common in the present day, but does not realise the Scripture thought of unity. When I come within the sanctuary, as it were, and into the company and association of the saints, my mind has to forget the distinctions which exist in the flesh. I have to
{161}
remember this, "Christ is all and in all", not only Christ all, but Christ in all. As has often been said, He is "all" as object, and He is "in all" as life. And as I said before, it would be perfectly impossible to have put on the new man, to have taken that ground at all, if Christ were not in us.
Now there is the other point connected with the new man, namely, character. He says, "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another; in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord". Now, beloved friends, here you get character. There are three things on the face of it -- and I do not mean to go beyond the surface -- the first is grace, absolute forgiveness; the second is love; and the third is peace. They mark what is true in Christ now. He has forgiven us, and we are to forgive as He has forgiven us. Of course, it all refers here to our relations one to another; we are to forgive absolutely; as the Lord said to Peter, "not till seven times, but till seventy times seven". Then the next thing is "love, which is the bond of perfectness". And then you get peace, "Let the peace of Christ" -- for everything here is of Christ -- "rule in your hearts" -- and that is to settle every question -- "to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful". Now you could not have a more beautiful picture of saints in unity, all entering into this truth, that they compose the one new man. It is the character of Christ reproduced
{162}
in them, the moral character of the heavenly Christ; the blessed features of it as presented here being unlimited forgiveness, and love, and peace. How can you conciliate such things with rivalry, or opposition, or envy, or emulation, or anything of the kind? I think nobody can appreciate what we get here as to the character of the new man, without seeing what an utter condemnation it is of the existing condition of Christendom as we have it before our eyes. The fact is, the reason of the inconsistency is this, they do not know anything at all about the doctrinal basis, for they do not know anything at all about the truth of the church, hence I can well understand that they do not know what the proper testimony of saints ought to be. It appears to me there are plenty of Christians in the world, and good Christians too, who know many blessings, as the forgiveness of sins, and even the gift of the Holy Spirit, but have not the faintest idea of the truth of the church. In a sort of statement of faith which appeared recently, in which there was much that one could endorse, I was struck with the absence of two things, namely, all allusion to a glorified Christ, and to the union of the saints with Christ. Therefore, if people do not apprehend those points, in which really the essence of Christianity consists, I can very well understand that they do not apprehend what ought to be the proper character and testimony of saints down here, and if you do not understand the body, you cannot understand the new man. The body is of the Head, and the Head is for the body; I apprehend that; but I see connected with it the blessed truth which comes out in this chapter, that is, the new man, where "Christ is all and in all".
Now, beloved friends, that can never be revived; but as I was saying a week or two ago, do not let us lower the standard. Even if practice may not come up to it, and even if it is impossible to bring saints back to the real standard, let us have the right idea.
{163}
It is a great thing to get the right idea; but then if we get it, let us expect that the Lord will give grace to walk according to the right idea, in the truth of it, even though you may not expect -- and I do not expect -- to see things restored to what they were when first established.
Now that is just what I wanted to come to in this chapter. I do not propose to go further. The apostle winds up with that one word, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another; in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him". Beloved friends, just think of the place of the saints. "The elect of God", an expression which is applied to Christ; as you get in verse 12, "Put on, therefore, as the elect of God" -- that is what the saints are, "the elect of God", in the place of Christ here, and the character of Christ to come out in them as one body. That was the divine idea; that was the thought of the Spirit of God in regard to the saints. And I thank God if He has given us to see what His thought was as to the testimony of the saints here. As I was pointing out last time, it is the practical accomplishment of the Lord's prayer in @John 17, where He prays not only for the apostles, but for those who should believe on Him through their word, "that they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".
May God, beloved friends, really give us, in the light of the truth here, to see the existing condition of things, that we may have a true estimate of what is about us here in the world; not expecting to see things restored to their original condition, but not evading our responsibility to seek grace to walk in the truth as it was given at the beginning.
{164}
NEW CREATION, IN THE BELIEVER'S APPREHENSION OF IT
@2 Corinthians 5
I was dwelling a little last time on the meeting of two things in Christ. On the one hand, every testimony which God has ever given finds its resting-place there. There are many and varied testimonies of God, many indications of His mind scattered through Scripture, but whatever testimony God has ever given has now found its resting-place in Christ, and that on the foundation of righteousness. On the other hand, we have in Christ the full revelation of God. "No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". Thus we have at the same point the full revelation of God, and the establishment in a Man of every divine purpose. That is what is gained by contemplating the Lord. There is no more light to come out. Christianity really comes in upon the same line, for the apostle John says, "No man has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us". The same formula introduces that passage as introduces the passage I have quoted from the first chapter of the gospel.
Now, having said so much in regard to what is true for faith, I desire to come to another point, viz., how the soul reaches the sense of new creation. You must distinguish between two things -- the fact of new creation, and the apprehension of it. New creation evidently is wholly and entirely of God; it must be so. If it were not, it would not be new creation. But in the chapter before us we find the way in which the truth is reached in a man's soul. There is a certain line of thought which brings us to the point of new creation which I want, by the grace of God, to trace.
{165}
Now, in our spiritual experience, there are two chapters: one comes to a close, and the other is eternal. I purpose dwelling on these two, and especially on the one which is eternal, that is, what I spoke of just now as new creation. I cannot tell you much about new creation -- I can tell you what Scripture says about it. What I see in the passage before us is the way by which new creation is apprehended in the soul of the believer. New creation has taken place before we have much apprehension of it. It is difficult to understand that anyone should be the subject of new creation without having an apprehension of it, but it is clear that any work of God must precede the apprehension of it on our part. A babe has some consciousness of life, but then life must be there. And the same holds good as to new creation.
We have in the chapter this expression on the part of the apostle: "Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be acceptable to him. For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God, and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause". In the course of the passage, the apostle alludes to two influences which affected him powerfully. One was the knowing the fear of the Lord, and the other, the love of Christ. "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord" is connected with the judgment-seat of Christ, and the fear of the Lord is evidently a very different thought from the love of Christ, and yet the apostle was greatly affected by
{166}
both. The two thoughts had a different effect. The result of one was, "we persuade men". The effect of the love of Christ was different. The judgment-seat of Christ closes up one chapter of the history of saints, that is, the chapter of our responsibility. It is important to apprehend that this chapter is still going on as long as we are in the body. We are in the place of responsibility. Responsibility, in regard to Christians, is evidenced in many things. We have to continue in the faith, and not be moved away from the hope of the gospel. We have to walk in the Spirit. These things prove responsibility, but all that closes in the judgment-seat of Christ. "We must all be manifested before the judgment-seat of Christ, that everyone may receive the things done through the body, according to that he hath wrought, whether it be good or bad". It has been said that the judgment-seat of Christ will determine our place in the kingdom, but it is at the same time a comfort to know that the judgment-seat will close the history of the Christian's responsibility. I do not think any one of us can be very proud of our history, though it gives us abundant occasion to thank God for His grace. If one is kept so long as he is down here in the midst of dangers, it can only be attributed to the unceasing grace of God. If it were a question simply and purely of responsibility, one would certainly fall away. And yet the judgment-seat is not an occasion of fear to saints. The apostle John says, "Herein is love with us made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world". That is the way it was presented to the mind of John; but the apostle Paul does say here, "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord", and the effect of this was that he persuaded men. He adds, "But we are made manifest to God". It is possible that there were those who accused the apostle of seeking to exercise an undue influence over men, but, having a sense of the judgment-seat of
{167}
Christ in his own soul, the apostle was pressed to persuade men, not for the purpose of gaining an influence over men, but of gaining a vantage ground for the testimony of the gospel. Noah, in the sense of coming judgment, prepared an ark for salvation, but at the same time he was a preacher of righteousness. He was in the consciousness of what was coming. And I can understand the same thing in regard of the Christian; he knows the fear of the Lord, although, in regard of himself, he has no fear in respect of the day of judgment.
Now I want to come to the other chapter in Christian experience which runs concurrently with the one of which I have spoken. "For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if One died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh, yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation". Now, I desire, by the grace of God, to open up a little this line. It is of a very different order indeed to what preceded, for it does not contemplate our responsibility, but that which is in contrast to our responsibility, viz., the work of God. The Christian has his responsibility; you cannot, as we have seen, be apart from responsibility and the sense of it as long as Christ is absent. The Lord left His servants to take care of His household in His absence. Everything tends to accentuate the thought of responsibility in the absence of Christ, but that is
{168}
evidently one side of the truth, and the work of God is another. The apostle begins to open up the latter with the love of Christ, on which he reasons.
Now, the first point in this line is the love of Christ, and that which is the peculiar expression of that love. The love of Christ is abiding. The expression of it was in a moment; death was the expression of His love, but the love was there to be expressed. Jesus Christ is "the same, yesterday, today, and for ever", but there was a moment when He gave expression to His love, and the expression which He gave of His love -- and it was *divine* love -- was that He died for all.
I was speaking on a previous occasion of the wonderful truth that Christ has brought into death the testimony of God's love. It is there that we learn that love. There never was a person yet that learned the love of God but in the death of Christ. They may have had ideas about it, but no one ever learned the greatness or reality of it save in the death of Christ. It is true that what is spoken of here is not exactly the love of God, but "the love of Christ constrains us, because we thus judge, that if One died for all, then were all dead". The love of God refers usually to all, to men as men, but the love of Christ refers rather to those who are the objects of divine purpose. Christ went into death that He might acquire rights over all, but in order that those who live should live to Him. I think that is the light in which His death is viewed here. The apostle argues here, "If one died for all, then were all dead". That is a most solemn consideration. If you would arrive at the truth of new creation, you must begin by accepting that "if one died for all, then were all dead". The death of Christ is the most solemn witness of the state of man that ever was given in this world. It is, indeed, a new witness. God had given many a witness of the state of man, but the most solemn witness is the death of Christ; the simple fact of the death of Christ is the proof that all were dead.
{169}
If Christ died, it proved that there was no one here in life under the eye of God. I think there are Christians who have never accepted the solemnity of that. When I see people disposed to take their own course here, and to give more or less licence to their own wills, it proves to me that they have never accepted the truth that "if one died for all, then were all dead". You cannot exaggerate the solemnity of the testimony of the death of Christ. It was the expression of divine love on the part of God, but also the testimony that all were under death. That is very sweeping, for it sets aside all the pretension of man down here, and witnesses the absolute right and title which Christ has over those who live: "they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again". The Christian has thus no title to live to himself. He has to accept the death of Christ as God's testimony that death was upon him, and if he takes the ground of claiming to live, he has no title to live to himself, but to Christ. That is the standard now.
There were two ways in which this affected the apostle: he was beside himself to God, and sober for the sake of the saints. It is a great thing to be beside oneself to God. In coming to God, you are withdrawn from the things here into which sobriety enters. The apostle was beside himself to God, that is, he did not order his communications with God according to the limitations of sober sense. His communications with God were according to the power of the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, with the saints sobriety comes in. What I understand by this is the ability to take a sober estimate of all connected with and that affected them. And this was the way in which the love of Christ wrought in the apostle. It came out in that way.
But to return to the thought that "if one died for all, then were all dead". What the apostle bases upon
{170}
that, is that "henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more". If all were dead, there is little meaning in knowing people after the flesh. This broke the apostle's link completely with the Jew. To have a special leaning, as the apostle once had, to the Jew, was to know them after the flesh. The time was when all that had its place, but now that had ceased. "Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more". This was a solemn lesson for the soul of the apostle. The distinctions which had existed between men no longer existed for the apostle. The Gentile was no different from the Jew, and no one was any good at all, except as the fruit of the work of God. We may not be able to take things up quite in the same absolute way; we have natural links and ties which we must regard. It would be perhaps untrue for us to say that we know no one after the flesh, but we can apprehend the idea of it. It became the apostle's deliverance from all fleshly distinctions which existed between men down here. The time had been when, even as a Christian, he had had regard to them, but he had regard to them no longer.
We come now to the point of new creation: "Therefore if any man be in Christ, there is a new creation". The truth is that there is a new man come upon the scene, that is, a new order of man, and a new order of man means a completely new system of affections. Supposing that it were possible for man to be completely set right as man down here, that would not alter the system of affections proper to man. The system would abide, though the affections were purified. One can understand that many would like that -- they would like still to maintain in all their force the links of natural life down here, with the affections that are connected with those links purified, but that is not new creation. New creation means another order of
{171}
man, and so, another order of relationships and affections. I have thought over an expression, "new nature", that people have commonly used. It appears to me to be too limited an expression to convey new creation. It does not give me the idea of a new man. When you have got the new man, then you can talk about his nature; but you must have the man first. And having the man, you must connect with the man a system of relationships and affections suitable to him. I think that a great many Christians fail to see that. They regard Christianity as a kind of purification of the relationships existing. I have no doubt that a Christian makes a better father, husband, or child than any other. But that is not new creation. All the relationships and affections which exist in connection with natural life down here will pass away for the Christian -- they all come to an end in death. They are connected with human life down here, and come to an end with it. They will not pass beyond. But what has been brought into view by the power of God is a new man, created after God, and at the same time a new and complete system of relationships and affections which do not pass away. I have no doubt that it is in that connection that eternal life comes in. Eternal life *is* eternal life, and we are brought into eternal life in Christ already, and so into relationships and affections which are new and of God. The new man is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth. But it is a new man with new affections and new sensibilities. Everything in the new man is according to God -- holiness and righteousness, affections and sensibilities -- and Christ is the proper expression of them. We find in @Colossians 3 that "there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Christ is all, and in all". And the sensibilities, the affections, the peace and the word of Christ are to characterise the Christian down here. You are to put on love, which
{172}
is the bond of perfectness, and the working of this is that God becomes the supreme object of love. Christ has His proper place in the affections of the Christian, as the apostle puts it here: "The love of Christ constrains us". And there are, too, relations down here with the saints. "By this we know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren" -- those who are equally with ourselves the subjects of new creation. They have the first place with the Christian down here. Now, that is important, for in new creation you have to do with eternal things, and you are brought into that here. They are things which are unseen and eternal, but they begin while we are still down here upon earth. That being so, they must of necessity take precedence over things which are upon earth. The apostle says further, "All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation: to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech by us: we pray, in Christ's stead. Be ye reconciled to God; for he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".
You will observe how intimately the truth of new creation is bound up with reconciliation. I think reconciliation is largely misunderstood. The idea of reconciliation in many minds is of some change in themselves, but that is not the divine idea. God has reconciled us. I could not say God *is* reconciled. There are two thoughts presented here: the *ministry* of reconciliation, and the *word* of reconciliation. When the Lord Jesus was here upon earth, He was here in the ministry of reconciliation. It was the outset of it: "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them,
{173}
and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation". The fact is that the very presence of Christ here meant reconciliation. It meant that God had bridged over the distance that stood between Him and man, and in the coming of Christ all stood for Him on a new basis. Man was approached on wholly different ground, and that was in view of the death of Christ; but the fact remains that God was approaching man down here in the Person of Christ. If God had imputed trespasses, there could not, of course, have been reconciliation; but when Christ was here, God was not imputing trespasses.
Now, as to the *word* of reconciliation. The force of 'word' is testimony, and the testimony of reconciliation was, that in the death of Christ the moral distance between God and man had been completely and eternally removed for God's glory in the judicial end of man in the cross; and further, God had made the very removal of man to be the occasion of the expression of His love. Love has come in where distance was. That is what the cross meant. All that was effected, so to speak, in a moment in the death of Christ. Now, the apostle says, "God hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation". In accepting the light of the cross, people received reconciliation. Now this connects itself with the truth of new creation. If there were not new creation, one could not be in the full enjoyment of God's love. But new creation is there, and in virtue of it we are in the enjoyment of reconciliation; conscious, on the one hand, that the infinite distance that existed between God and man has been removed in the death of Christ to the glory of God, and that in the place of the distance there is love. God "made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him". You have to remember that when the righteousness of God came out in Christianity, the love of God was behind it. God made him sin for
{174}
us -- that was in love to us, that we might be for the satisfaction of God in regard of righteousness.
It is plain that new creation and reconciliation are very intimately connected. No one could enjoy the thought of reconciliation if there were not new creation. The Christian is thus a man of another order; he is after the order of Christ. "As is the heavenly, such are the heavenly". He is according to God, and, as being according to God, he can enjoy the thought of reconciliation, and this is as being of God. The apostle says, in @Romans 5: "We joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation". I do not believe that any Christian can be in the enjoyment of reconciliation but as being in the apprehension of the love of God. The very presence of Christ here was the expression of His love. It showed that God had no pleasure in the distance. And there was the blessed testimony, divinely given, down here, of divine love. The Lord bore testimony that "God so loved the world". In the cross the distance was removed, and in the place of the distance we find the love. You get an illustration of it in the parable of the prodigal son in his coming back to the father. The distance was gone, and the love was there, and that marks properly our relation with God.
As I said at the beginning, we get two chapters opened out here; one, which will be brought to a close at the judgment-seat of Christ, never to be reopened; and the other, which tells us of the work of God, as the effect and result of which, we enjoy the blessed truth of reconciliation. There is the process by which the soul arrives at the truth of new creation. This begins with the witness of the death of Christ. We know no one after the flesh, not even Christ. That is all passed away. But we come to new creation, where all things are of God. Everything in the line of new creation takes its character from God morally.
{175}
The new man is created, after God, in righteousness and holiness of truth. God has begun a creation for Himself morally. It is according to Him. That is where the Christian properly started from.
May God give us to know the great reality of being down here in the enjoyment of reconciliation!
{176}
BLESSINGS, EARTHLY AND HEAVENLY
@Psalm 72; @Colossians 1: 19 - 29
I want to throw out a few thoughts, no doubt familiar to a great many here, to indicate the difference between the character of the blessings in the time to come, and the character of the blessings that belong to Christians at the present moment. I wish to speak as simply as possible, so that all may share in some degree in the benefit of what has been before us at these meetings; but all I can do is just to throw out a few thoughts, which I trust may help to start you on the line.
It is a fact that we learn most things by contrast; our minds are so constituted that there are really few things that we learn except in that way. I could show you how in the word of God things are continually presented in contrast, because God knows well what poor feeble things we are, and He puts things before us in that way so that our minds may be able, in measure, to comprehend them.
I want to bring before you some things which will characterise the millennial age, what God has in view for that time. I see distinctly in the word of God that from the time sin came into this world, God had in view a world of His own, and I always read @Hebrews 2 as connecting itself with "the world to come, whereof we speak". Every trait of faith there brought out in principle connects itself with that world. The world here was ruined by man listening to the enemy, the enemy obtained a footing in it, and Satan has now come out as the god and prince of this world. Such a world will not do for God. God may bear with it and work out His ways in it; but it will not do for God; and what God made known to faith was that He would have a world of His own. In the epistle to the Hebrews we have the revelation of the
{177}
world to come, and what marks it is, that everything is put under the Son of man. God has not put the world to come under angels, but under the Son of man.
What I will speak of first are *the blessings* which mark the world to come. I can only present to you two or three features connected with it.
In order to make the thing clear and orderly I will first speak of it in connection with God, and will seek to show you the place which God will have, then the place which Christ has distinctively, and finally what will mark man on earth in the time to come.
In regard to the first, God made known, from ever the time that a real type of redemption came in, that He intended to dwell among men on earth. I suppose everyone here knows what I refer to -- the redemption of His people out of Egypt in virtue of the blood of the passover Lamb. God's purpose was not only to redeem them -- it was that He might dwell among them. The moment they come into the wilderness we get God's dwelling-place: that is what the book of Exodus presents. If you sum up the book, the first thing is redemption, the deliverance of His people; the second is the order of God's dwelling. He was going to set up His dwelling-place among His people. When we get to Leviticus we have the truth of approach to God; the tabernacle was there, and Leviticus brings before us the great truth of approach to God. I merely refer to that as indicating the order of God's purposes. It has often been pointed out that God did not dwell with Adam or with Abraham; but when God has a redeemed people, then it is that He can establish His dwelling-place.
I would just turn for a moment to @Leviticus 16: 5, 6, 15, 16, the day of atonement. It is evident in the day of atonement that all is founded on redemption, whatever comes out is grounded on the fact that God has been completely glorified in the death of Christ. The ground of reconciliation is that Christ was made
{178}
sin, and that sin has been put away from before God. God has been completely glorified in it, and the witness is that the blood is sprinkled on and before the mercy-seat. You cannot get a more striking type of the effect of the work of the Lord Jesus Christ than in what took place on the day of atonement. I would just notice, too, that the day of atonement did not come in until after the sin of the priests, after Nadab and Abihu had offered strange fire, and the link of the people with God through the priesthood was thus broken.
The day of atonement -- you might call it the day of reconciliation -- presents the fact that God has been completely glorified in the putting away of sin. The blood is sprinkled on and before the mercy-seat.
There is no doubt a difference between the import of the bullock and that of the goat; yet we find that precisely the same thing was done with the blood of the goat as was done with the blood of the bullock: the blood of each was sprinkled on and before the mercy-seat. Whatever may result from it, the foundation of all lies in this, that God has been glorified in the putting away of sin by the work of the Lord Jesus Christ.
I believe the ultimate application of the blood in each case introduced, in type and shadow, the heavenly and the earthly. The blood of the bullock was carried into the holiest; it was for Aaron and his house -- the ground of approach for the priestly family. If you look at the antitype, the reality, it was Christ and the church -- that is what is usually typified by Aaron and his sons. All go in together on the ground that God has been glorified in the work of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am not now speaking of what Christ was personally or of what was due to Him, but of His identification with the priestly family. "Both he that sanctifieth" -- that is Christ -- "and they that are sanctified are all
{179}
of one" -- they go in on the same ground. That is connected with the blood of the bullock.
The blood of the goat was the ground on which the tabernacle of God could remain among the children of Israel. God saw fit to have a dwelling-place down here; and the ground on which God will have a dwelling-place among men in the future is the same as that on which we have boldness to enter into the holiest. @Leviticus 16 gives us the basis, in death, of God's ways in reconciliation. In @Colossians 1 we find everything put upon that ground: Christ has made peace by the blood of His cross, that He might reconcile by Himself all things unto God.
I have said this, beloved friends, in order to show you that the first item and element of the blessing of man in the millennial earth will be that God will dwell among them. His tabernacle will be cleansed from all uncleanness and filthiness by the work of Christ, and God will dwell among His people. Could you conceive a greater privilege than to have God dwelling here? Men on the earth at that time will have more than Adam or Abraham had: they will have the unspeakable privilege of God setting His dwelling-place among His people. I have often asked myself the question, What will occupy men's minds in the time to come, when there will be no great business activity, no great excitement in connection with politics or war? If all these things were taken away from people now they would be very dull. Well, I will tell you what I see -- and just submit the thought to you -- God intends to let the present world, so to speak, wear itself out. He will allow it to be seen that the present world with all its activity, energy, and ability, has not been able to secure happiness for man. I challenge any thoughtful person as to whether the inventive skill of the present day tends in the direction of happiness. What I see is that the great inventions of the present day are turned to promote covetousness;
{180}
a new thing to be successful must turn to moneymaking. Instead of tending to the happiness of man, these things tend in the opposite direction. God will allow the folly of the world to be exposed, and it will be made manifest that all man's skill and intelligence have not tended to his happiness, because he is away from God. The great discoveries of the present day are in the ascertainment and application of the laws of nature. Men cannot make laws, but they find out laws, and learn to apply them. But who gave those laws to nature? If the God who gave those laws to nature is dwelling upon earth, it will be a greater thing for men's minds to be occupied with the One who gave those laws than with the laws themselves. There is a great deal in that, because God's ways will be unveiled, His wisdom all comes out in the time to come. One great element, then, of the time to come will be the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth; and He will be known by His people as a God of mercy, for He will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities He will remember no more. These are what I may call the first elements of blessing of the world to come; God will dwell here on the ground of what Christ has accomplished, and more than that, the knowledge of the blessed God Himself will be here, and that will be better than everything man can find out by investigation of the laws He has established.
Now I will say a word in regard to the place that Christ will have in the world to come. It comes out in the most beautiful way in the Psalm I have read. Just notice the striking close of the Psalm: "The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended". David has nothing more to ask for; all his prayers have their answer in the glory of the King's Son. The chapter is a prayer for the king's son, and I do not think anyone can doubt that the Psalm refers to the true Son of David, not to Solomon. It may have been fulfilled to
{181}
some degree in Solomon, but the real application of the Psalm is to Christ, the true Son of David. All nations shall call Him blessed. Christ has died to sin, and from the rudiments of the world, and is no longer known after the flesh; but I should not care to say He has died to men, because I do not find Scripture say so. Men are to be blessed in Him -- not only the priestly company in heaven, but men upon earth shall be blessed in Him. They will be blessed under the peaceful rule of the King's Son. As the true David He will subdue His enemies, and as the true Solomon He will reign in peace. Moses and Aaron combined give us a type of Christ: He will come out as King and Priest and will bless the people, and men will be blessed in Him. I picture to myself the world to come as something like Israel in their tents, as Balaam saw them abiding in divinely appointed order, in the vision of God. That will have its application, in a certain sense, in the world to come; all will, so to say, be covered by Christ under the eye of God. It will be a great thing, beloved friends, when the true Moses, the true Aaron -- King and Priest -- comes forth and all nations call Him blessed. That will be a very blessed time down here, a time of peace, security, and contentment. How much are these things known now?
One word more in regard to men. What I find in regard to men is this, that in all God's dealings in grace there is and must be in them the one and new foundation -- the foundation in man will be new birth; @Ezekiel 36. God by His Spirit works in sovereign power in man, and lays the foundation for whatever superstructure it may please Him to erect upon that foundation. The superstructure in the world to come will be the law -- His people will get the blessings of the new covenant. They will be betrothed to Jehovah in righteousness and faithfulness, and His laws will be given into their minds and written in their hearts. If I were to look at things merely according to man,
{182}
I should like to live in that time. Nobody can dispute that there will be the greatest blessing for men in that day. Peace, security, and content, as I said just now, will be seen everywhere. How one sighs for content! Supposing the world were filled with content -- where would be the necessity for legislation? There would be no place for it. The fact is, the whole condition and state of things will be totally and completely changed.
In @Leviticus 16 we have the great moral foundation for everything, and in @Psalm 72 we have laid out the blessings which are connected with the reign of the King's Son.
Now I want to pass on to @Colossians 1 by way of contrast.
In the passage I have read there is distinct proof that saints are not here looked at as in heaven, because twice over the "hope" is spoken of. If you talk about hope you have not got the thing in full fruition of things and the reconciliation of persons. The former is future, the reconciliation of persons is present. He says, "You now hath he reconciled". That is connected with the gospel. In @2 Corinthians 5 the apostle enlarges upon it; but I believe the thought of reconciliation has to do with identity, with individuality: I am individually reconciled to God; it is not a question of a new state, but that I, as an individual, am reconciled. That is what Christ has done, and I want to speak to you as
{183}
to the character of it. It appears to me that the main thought in reconciliation is this, it places me with God apart from all that is contrary to God. It places me with God apart from the flesh. "You now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death". We are set with God apart from the flesh. The flesh is that which would preclude our having any entrance where God is. We get the positive privilege of reconciliation brought out in @Hebrews 10 -- boldness to enter into the holiest. That is the first privilege which belongs to the people of God now. I am reconciled -- placed with God -- holy, unblameable, and unreproveable in His sight, apart from what would hinder my entrance into the holiest, and am there in association with the true Aaron. If I go back to the beginning, Adam did not go into the holiest; flesh does not enter there; but the fact of reconciliation is that I am apart from the flesh. In the flesh I never could go into the holiest. I am now apart from it; death has in Christ come in upon it, so that I might be before God, unblameable and unreproveable. It is not simply God dwelling amongst men, but we are individually blest with God. We are placed before Him, constituted holy, and we have liberty to enter into the holiest. There is no place too holy for a Christian; what can be holier than the holiest? If I think of myself now with God, I see there is nothing whatever contrary: every bit of contrariety is gone in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ; there is not only expiation, but I am before God apart from the flesh, so that I can be with Him in perfect happiness, liberty, and peace. I am constituted holy, unblameable, and unreproveable; it is really what God Himself is, and that is what we are constituted before Him. We have to wait for the full result, but not for the reconciliation; that is present. It is a wonderful thing to be with God in this way, every bit of contrariety gone in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ. There will be great blessing in the time to come when God dwells among His people, from the flesh, so that I can be with Him in perfect happiness, liberty, and peace. I am constituted holy, unblameable, and unreproveable; it is really what God Himself is, and that is what we are constituted before Him. We have to wait for the full result, but not for the reconciliation; *that* is present. It is a wonderful thing to be with God in this way, every bit of contrariety gone in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ. There will be great blessing
{184}
in the time to come when God dwells among His people, but it is a far greater thing, to be with God now in this way. The full result, of course, will be when we are in glory, in likeness to Christ; but I am only speaking of what we are constituted now while still upon earth. We have the privilege to be with God according to all holiness, and to see that there is nothing contrary.
Now we come to another point (verse 27): "Christ in you, the hope of glory". We get here a new thing, which had never been spoken of before, namely, Christ in the saints. I will tell you what is a very great point in my judgment; it is very important to get a right idea of Christ as He is now. The first thing is that He came out of heaven. He is the living bread come down from heaven. Then He has, as Man, glorified God, so that man should be in God's presence in divine righteousness; and further, by the power of God in resurrection, He is in a condition of glory and power suited to the great place He has taken as Man. The first thing is, then, He is heavenly because He is out of heaven. After the flesh He was here in weakness -- the condition was perfect according to what was needed -- but He was raised from the dead by the power of God. I delight to think of the Lord Jesus Christ, the same blessed Person, divine and heavenly in character, raised again from the dead by the mighty power of God in the condition of glory and power in which He takes His seat in righteousness as Man at the right hand of God. I only bring this before you in order to lead your hearts to an apprehension of the greatness and glory of the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Head of the body.
The point that comes out in verse 27 is that He is in us. That is the mystery, and what it involves is, that though I am the same in identity, I am of another kind. Christ is in me, and the instant I talk about Christ being in me I am of another kind. That will
{185}
never apply to saints on the earth in the millennium; they are the same identity, but not, save morally, of another kind. We are the same persons but of another kind, because Christ is in us the hope of glory. Christ being in me, teaches me that I am apart from the world. Every person who is looking for glory is apart from the world. I am content to accept the world as a wilderness, because what I have is, Christ in me, and He is in me as the hope of glory. I am going to have a place of blessed exaltation and be like Christ; whatever marks Him as Man will be descriptive, too, of the saints. The truth of Christ being in us is a most momentous one, and it involves unity. No one can confess that truth without acknowledging the unity. The moment I come to think of Christ in me I must also think of Christ in other saints. If I think of myself as a member of the body I have to think of other saints, because Christ is there, too. In @Colossians 3 the apostle speaks of it: "Where Christ is all and in all", in all the saints, and the fact of Christ being in us is the real bond of unity in the saints down here. What I am told in Ephesians is "There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling"; one hope, because Christ is in us the hope of glory.
One more point comes out at the close of the chapter: "Whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus". When I come to speak of the future, I do not read anything at all about growth: I do not think that idea comes in there; growth comes in now because we are of a new kind, and therefore there must be growth, because every saint begins as a babe in Christ. Every man begins of necessity as a babe, and has to grow up into a perfect man. The idea of a perfect man is where all the moral faculties are in exercise. The faculties are all in the babe, but they have to be developed. The
{186}
believer has to grow up into a perfect man -- where every spiritual faculty is developed.
I have often coveted the ability to present Christ in glory to the saints; I should like to be able to minister to the saints what Paul spoke of when he said, "I determined to know nothing among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified". Who of us has an adequate idea of the greatness and glory of that risen Man? The first great thing is to see that He is a Man of another order, not only that He has gone to glory, but that He is from heaven: He is heavenly. Do you want to know some of the features of the heavenly Man? Righteousness, holiness, blamelessness, love, boldness, access, confidence -- those are the features of the Man out of heaven. And now He has gone to the Father, and we see Him no more; but He has put us in the Father's presence; He has gone there in a condition which is the full and adequate expression of the mighty power of God in resurrection.
I would not desire anything more than the ability to minister Christ to the saints, as Paul says, "Whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom". Do you know that you are going to be like Christ? "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly". We are going to be perfectly like Christ. We know that when He shall appear we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. The apostle John could dilate upon the present blessing: "Beloved, now are we the sons of God"; you will never be more truly the object of affection to the Father than you are now, and therefore the apostle says, "Now are we the children of God"; but He says, it is not yet manifested what we shall be, but we know that when He appears we shall be like Him. If I am going to be like Christ, in the image of the heavenly, Christ becomes the standard of purity for me down here. I would not be content with a lower condition of things; I have the blessed joy of being
{187}
placed with God apart from everything that is contrary, and the consciousness that I am going to be perfectly in the likeness of the Man in glory.
May God, beloved friends, give us a sense of the greatness of our calling. I delight to trace out in Scripture the blessing of the time to come; but it only brings out into greater and more distinct contrast the peculiar blessings that God has called us to.
May we be kept apart from everything down here, and become morally more like the One to whom we are going to be perfectly conformed.

AN ABSENT LORD, AND THE EXPECTATION OF HIS RETURN
@Matthew 24 and 25
We must all have been struck by the way in which the Lord in this passage (chapter 24: 45 to 25: 30) turns away for the moment from the subject which was mainly before His mind, namely, the coming of the Son of man, and the judgment of the living nations, to bring out the ground and nature of the responsibility of those who confess Him as Lord during His absence.
The position was that in which the disciples were about to find themselves placed, and is that which we also occupy, and I have thought it might be profitable to dwell a little on our relations to an absent Lord, and the way we are affected by the expectation of His return.
Three parables are introduced into the passage -- first, of the servants in relation to the household; second, of the virgins in relation to the bridegroom; and, thirdly, the servants in regard to the substance entrusted to them. In every case the predominant thought is profession and responsibility, which the absence of the Lord serves to test, and which is dealt with on His coming.
And here it may be observed how much there is now on the earth, that, so to say, belongs to and is of deep interest to an absent Lord. We have three distinct thoughts in this way -- a household, rights (the bridegroom has the bride), and substance -- and the fact that He has rights and interests here secures His return.
But we may consider the passage a little in detail. The uncertainty of the moment of the Son of man's coming has made manifest the need of watching, and the Lord takes occasion to show the character which
{189}
true watching would take. For a servant to say he is watching for the return of a master, and yet to be unconcerned as to that close to his hand which is of supreme interest to his master, would be manifestly inconsistent. The fact has to be recognised that the Master has a household here. Christ came to His own, and His own received Him not, but to as many as received Him, to them He gave title to take the place of the children of God. In the time that God hides His face from the house of Jacob -- and while Christ waits on Jehovah -- He says, Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah has given me. To have had the nation would have been more public glory; but the household lies closer to His heart, and the household is left here under the care, in a sense, of servants during the Master's absence. The apparent delay in His return gives opportunity to the servants to show whether they are seeking their master's interests, or doing their own will. On the one hand, faithfulness to the Master would be evidenced by the expectation of His return, and would be displayed in diligent care for the need of the household; on the other hand, the thought of delay in the Master's return would bring to light in the evil servant the spirit of domination and worldliness, smiting his fellow-servants and eating and drinking with the drunken. It may, I think, be said that in the servants is represented the spirit of the teaching body. The evil servant has found his embodiment in what has ruled in popery and the like -- wherever there is a constituted clerical body and practical unbelief in the coming of the Lord. On the other hand, those who in faith take the ground of being set to care for the household have to remember that the household will in large measure take its character from what is heard and seen in the teachers (their doctrine and manner of life) and that the teachers on their part prove by their conduct in the household whether they are faithful in heart, and
{190}
really watching for the Master's return. The faithful and wise servant will not fail of his reward.
In what follows -- the parable of the virgins -- we have a similitude of the kingdom of the heavens, a picture of the state of things (in the sphere where the moral sway of heaven is owned) which would immediately precede the return of the bridegroom. As we have seen, the bridegroom presents to us one that has rights. The profession is that of virgins, who have gone forth from the world to meet the bridegroom. They recognise and testify of the rights of the bridegroom of which He is not yet in possession, and, as virgins, they hold themselves uncontaminated from the human spirit around. While the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept. At the midnight cry all arose, shook themselves free from influences here and trimmed their lamps -- foolish as well as wise -- the wise having oil in their vessels, recognised the presence of the Spirit here and hence were in readiness. They were by the Spirit in real separation from the world. With the foolish it was imitation. We have through mercy been awakened to see that the Spirit is here to maintain a testimony for Christ in His absence, and in having part in the Spirit we are in readiness for the coming of the bridegroom. We have not to prepare. Wisdom is seen in the recognition of the presence of the Spirit, and consequent readiness; foolishness in the effort to be ready. Thus the testimony of the return of Christ has its answer in an awakening to the original profession of going forth, and in the recognition that having the Spirit we are ready.
Following the parable of the virgins we have presented to us another aspect of the state of things in the absence of Christ. A man going into a far country has called his own servants and distributed among them His substance according to their several ability. In the parable in @Luke 19, where each servant receives
{191}
a pound, the thought appears to be that the servants are set up by the master with capital with which to trade in a sense to their own ultimate advantage. In Matthew I think the point is that the master of the servants distributes his substance (not in a burdensome way, but according to every man's several ability) to be used for *his* gain. The reward to those that are faithful is to enter into the joy of *their* Lord. The useless servant who had his own false estimate of his master's character neglected the talent entrusted to him, and is cast into outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. Thus the faithfulness of the servants is tested, and, as seen in the parables which have preceded, their conduct is evidently governed by the expectation or otherwise of their lord's return.
To sum up, we have seen how much an absent Lord has here that is of interest and value to Himself -- a household, the care of which demands vigilance, rights to be maintained in faithful testimony (lights burning), and substance which calls for faithfulness in the use of it. Then we see the qualities suitable in those who are here for Christ's name in His absence -- faithfulness and prudence in those over the household, wisdom in those that have gone forth to meet the Bridegroom, and goodness and faithfulness in those entrusted with their Lord's substance. Further we apprehend the effect on such of the expectation of the Lord's return -- the prudent and faithful servant is vigilant in care to minister to the household, the wise virgins recognise their readiness by the Spirit to go in to the marriage, and the faithful servants are diligent in the employment of their Lord's substance. On the other hand we learn that what is evil, foolish, and unprofitable is utterly rejected and disowned on the coming of the Lord.
{192}
JOHN AND PAUL
I believe we have in John what is essentially heavenly, that is, what is out of heaven, and what is out of heaven is heavenly, and cannot change its character. It does not bring before us the exaltation of man in virtue of redemption as does Paul, but the moral excellence of what has come forth from heaven -- the living bread and the Father's love. Hence eternal life is to know the Father and Jesus Christ His sent One (not exactly His glorified One). And we feed on this heavenly grace which has come out of heaven, and live by it. We enter into it while we are here, but it does not lose its heavenly character, and by Christ's death we are free from the system in which flesh has its life.
I think to enter into and enjoy what is essentially heavenly, as having come thence, is almost greater privilege than to enter into the divine counsels which have their centre in Christ in glory, which is Paul's line. If a concordance were consulted, I take it, heaven would be more often found in John than in Paul, only with the former it is more what comes thence, but without changing its character, and with the latter what goes there.
{193}
"I COME ... TO DO THY WILL, O GOD"
@Hebrews 9: 24; @Hebrews 10: 1 - 14
I could not, beloved brethren, pretend for an instant to carry your thoughts to where what we have heard would carry them. But in confirmation of what has been brought before us, I have read this scripture, and would seek to bring out a little, the line on which Christ came here; feeling that it involves truth of vital importance to our souls.
The greatest service that can, perhaps, be rendered at the present moment to saints is so to minister to them the truth, as to transfer them as to the state of their souls from the ground of man's responsibility to the ground of divine counsel.
There is a tendency in every one of us to limit the grace of God to the clearance of our responsibility; but though all is cleared, I do not think for a moment that that is the measure of grace, nor is it really the line on which Christ came into this world.
If you study the epistle to the Hebrews you may see that the evident object of the apostle is to lead those whom he addresses, off the ground of law, and to place them on that of the purpose of God. They were naturally on the ground of ordinances, and were accustomed to connect religion with their responsible life down here. The law did not go beyond the measure of man's responsibility. It was interwoven with the responsible life of man on earth, although it contained "the shadow of good things to come". Under the old covenant, religion was mixed up with responsibility; but now the counsel of God is revealed, God is bringing many sons to glory.
It is evident that promise is the expression of counsel, and indeed apart from counsel we should not have promise. In chapter 6 it is stated that, "God, willing
{194}
more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it with an oath". Counsel was expressed in promise as regards Abraham and the promises being unconditional, must be of counsel. Clearly every absolute promise of God is, of necessity, an expression of His counsel. The great difficulty is to lead saints, as to the apprehension of their souls, to the ground of counsel.
If we look around, it would not perhaps be too much to say that the greatest part of Christians are little more than advanced Jews; that is, their Christianity (religion rather) is interwoven with their responsible life down here: they know something of grace, and of the forgiveness of sins; but their religion may be said not to be beyond what is suited to man on earth -- it is interwoven with their responsible everyday life. That is well enough in its place, but it is not the height of grace -- not Christianity; and it indicates a lack of apprehension of the counsel of God; for what God has now given us is a calling in its nature entirely outside of our responsible life on this earth.
We read in @Ephesians 1, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ". How could this be spoken of as part of our responsible life? Clearly it is God's calling, not our responsibility; and what should be desired and sought after is, that saints should be led into the apprehension of God's calling in grace, for the more the calling is apprehended the more they will come out in the colour of it. The more anyone apprehends the calling the more he will seek to carry the souls of the saints into it; and the more they apprehend it the more will it affect their responsible life here, and the manner in which they carry out their duties here.
In @Hebrews 9: 26 - 28 and chapter 10 the apostle is putting Christ in contrast to the law; the force of the passage at the end of chapter 9 is marred by the
{195}
division of the chapters; evidently the great point is to put in contrast the yearly recurrence of the sacrifices with the complete and efficacious character of the work of Christ.
There are two distinct thoughts in verses 26 and 28 -- the dealing with sin and with sins. I have more than once felt thankful for the passage, as it appears to me to throw a reflex light on what was foreshadowed in the day of atonement; for though in contrast with the day of atonement it is nevertheless instructive as to it. Evidently allusion to the day of atonement is made in the end of chapter 9, and apart from verse 26, I could hardly have associated sin with the day of atonement; I judge that what this verse teaches us is that the carrying in of the blood on the day of atonement indicated the clearing of sin as before God.
But I do not see that sin is here viewed as man's responsibility. In verse 28 sins are so viewed; verse 28 is the complete clearance of responsibility. But it is plain enough that what the work Christ came to accomplish was to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself, and that is the complete clearing away of sin from before God in order that God might have a free hand to accomplish His counsel.
That is the line on which Christ came, and in this light @Psalm 40 is here quoted, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God". We have the will of God presented in contrast to the offerings under the law: He taketh away the first, that He may establish the second. He takes away the system of offerings which were connected with man's responsibility -- the first, that He may establish the second. And what is that? God removed by Christ that which caused distance between Himself and us. The will, the good pleasure of God, was to remove every bit of distance between Himself and man. The cause of the distance between God and man has been removed, and whether we apprehend it or not, God has come close to us. The veil was rent
{196}
from the top to the bottom. No one will ever have a right apprehension of what it is to go in to God, if they do not see the distinct object for which He came out in Christ.
It is blessed to know that all distance is gone, whether we apprehend it or not. God in His boundless love and grace has drawn near to us, and the wonderful display of this is in the work of the cross. The veil was rent from the top to the bottom. No mere human mind could conceive such a thought as that the will of God was to remove every bit of distance between Himself and man; that in it He might be fully revealed, and Himself and His love fully known and enjoyed in the most perfect nearness and intimacy. I need hardly say that unless there were a corresponding work of grace in us it would be all unavailing.
For a true idea of eternal life you must put together what is presented in @John 3 and 4. Chapter 3 is objective, chapter 4, subjective. In the one we see God coming out as the Giver of it, and in the other, the corresponding state in us, "A well of water springing up into everlasting life". The water that Christ gives cannot be disconnected from the believer nor the believer from it. It is a well of water in him.
In regard to the truth before us, we see in chapter 10 that He does away with the one, the order of sacrifices under law, that He may establish the other -- the will of God, by which will we are sanctified. We thus see how the whole system of offerings is set aside, that God may establish another and a better thing.
I would add a few words on how He makes good to us that will. It is in putting us in company with the very One who came to accomplish His will. By that will we are sanctified through the offering of Jesus Christ, and the sanctification is that we are of the kindred and company of the priest. The Sanctifier and the sanctified are all of one -- are one company, like Aaron and his sons, and He is not ashamed to
{197}
call us brethren. That is where we are. It is what Christ came for. It is Christianity. People are defective because they limit Christ's work to the clearance of sins, and fail to see the will of God and the place of association with Christ with which it connects us. Christianity is that God has come out, and believers are placed in association with the very One who came out to do the will of God. He leads the praises of the assembly because He knows the heart that is toward the assembly.
But the apostle adds a word to show the completeness of the clearance of those who are sanctified, first contrasting the position of Christ with that of priests under the law. "This man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God ... For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified". They who are sanctified by God's will are perfected by one offering. If sins are not completely cleared, they never can be for there remains no more offering.
The object in Hebrews is not to unfold the ground and doctrine of justification, but to show the completeness of it -- "perfected for ever". We get the practical part of the chapter in verses 23 - 25. We are to consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works; not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as we see the day approaching. We have individual privilege, but we have also special obligations one toward another, and responsibility, through grace, for one another's welfare.
With the wonderful reality before us that our salvation is commensurate with the revelation of God, and taught of Him to enter into the true apprehension of it, its gracious effect will be wrought in us, in leading us to the acceptance and fulfilment of our responsibilities in a true care for the spiritual welfare of one another.
{198}
THE FATHER'S HOUSE AND THE KINGDOM OF GOD
@Luke 15: 20 - 24; @Luke 17: 11 - 21; @Luke 18: 15 - 30
There are two passages in the gospel of Luke, beloved brethren, to which I should like to turn: @Luke 15: 20 - 24; chapter 17: 11 - 21; chapter 18: 15 - 30. It appears to me that the more we get instructed in divine truths the more we see that there are certain things which *must* be.
Scripture does not present truths in an arbitrary or fragmentary way, but shows us that certain consequences must follow from what God is, and the way in which He has revealed Himself. I can compare it to astronomy. In the solar system, when an astronomer knows the place and influence of the sun, he knows the course which other bodies in that system must take. It is simple to see that the courses of the subordinate bodies are governed by the influence of the sun. These things afford us an illustration of the truth. In proportion as you get acquaintance with God you see that other things must be, because of what God is.
God is the centre of the moral universe, as the sun is of the solar system, and He has set His creatures as it were in orbits. Anyone who knows astronomy has an idea of what would ensue if a planet left its orbit; but that is what has taken place morally. Satan -- a creature -- fell from his orbit, the fallen angels from theirs, and man from his; the results we know.
But what we see is that God has revealed Himself in a power in which He is able to recover, not to put man back on the old footing, but to put all on an infinitely more blessed platform than in creation, because God is revealed morally, and that of necessity puts all on different ground. Now that we have the
{199}
revelation of God in His blessed being and ways we find a vastly more perfect system of blessing.
What I want to say a word about is of what must be true in Christianity. From the nature of the revelation of God you have an inner and an outer. The inner is a calling entirely above and outside of man's natural being and path here on earth. It flows from the revelation that God has been pleased to make of Himself. If God has been pleased to reveal Himself, as He has, the privilege must be commensurate with the revelation. But it is also true that the Christian is on earth, not under law and prophets, but in the kingdom of God -- and this is the outer -- for we are left down here to fill up the rest of our life in flesh for God's will.
It will be noted that two things are presented in Luke -- the Father's house and the kingdom -- and we shall see the place and importance of each to the Christian. Neither one nor the other can be held exclusively; you must see both.
I should like for a moment to refer to @Matthew 16: 16 - 19, where you get exactly the same principle. There are manifestly two ideas there. One is Christ's assembly; the other, the kingdom of heaven. The one is the inner, and the other the outer. The one refers to us corporately, the other individually. The Christian has part in both, and it is important to apprehend both.
The truth as to Christ's Person had been revealed, and now there was a rock upon which Christ could build His church. *The "rock" is the confession of Christ as the Son of the living God -- in the glory of His Person*. The soul has the sense of His supremacy. That is the rock, so to say, in the soul of the believer.
Christ's assembly is a corporate idea, and the structure is here. Saints are all component parts of the structure, and it is a great thing to enter into the fact -- as otherwise we drop down to congregationalism. Christ's assembly is not simply a congregation, but a
{200}
structure of which each saint is a stone. A congregation might be characterised by the holding of certain truths, but it would not be thereby a structure -- there might be no building.
But we have also in @Matthew 16: 19 the thought of the kingdom and the place which the Lord has in regard to it. He gives to Peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven. He says, 'You are to act for Me on earth'. Christ is as man the great Luminary set in heaven to rule or govern on earth, and Peter was to act down here in the light of heaven. We have to act down here under the authority of Christ in all that is connected with the service of His name.
Both things are true to the Christian. He is a stone in the structure as the result of the work in his soul, that is the inner; but he has an outer sphere, too, the kingdom, where he has to act under Christ's authority on earth.
I come to the gospel of Luke. Now, beloved friends, I have something to say here, and I trust to be enabled to say it. We read, "Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it: and let us eat, and be merry", @Luke 15: 22, 23. I do not think this scripture presents the height of divine counsel, but it is a most wonderful revelation of the grace of God, and the pleasure of God in recovery.
What would have become of man on earth if God had not come out to recover? The pleasure of God is in recovery. It is what chapter 15 conveys. We have in the chapter every divine Person active in grace. It is the administration of grace. The shepherd seeks the sheep, the woman sweeps the house, the father runs to meet the prodigal.
If God reveals Himself in such a way, I judge the privilege must be commensurate with the revelation. The delight of God is in recovery, and the first movement
{201}
in a soul means its recovery for God, but things could not stop till the prodigal is brought to share in the delight of the Father. God has come out in grace. Philosophy never had such an idea of God; that was reserved for Christianity.
God has come down because man could not get up; he was lost, ruined -- had left his orbit; he was, so to speak, like a wandering star; but God does come out in infinite grace to recover, and He brings the prodigal into His own joy in recovery.
One word on the "best robe"; I think you cannot leave out in this the thought of *state*. If you do not allow that this thought is involved, you put the best robe over the prodigal's rags, and it is not the thought of God to cover thus the moral ruin of the prodigal. He provides something entirely new. If he is accepted in Christ, Christ is also in him. It is not in my judgment the same as the wedding garment in @Matthew 20. That was a necessity -- a man had no business to be at the feast without it. It was an insult to the king to disregard what was provided for the guest. The man without the wedding garment said virtually, 'I am fitted to be here by suitability of my own'. The wedding garment is divine righteousness for a sinner -- the only title to be at the festivity. The *best* robe was put on after reconciliation had been effected. It formed no part of the prodigal's first inheritance, but was what the Father brought out; it is *Christ* -- not only as covering the prodigal, but *Christ in* the prodigal. The result is the prodigal is perfectly fit and conscious of being received. He is there in the state suited to the place. He is at home there. That is what I mean by the inner, and that is the glory of the Christian, and I compassionate any Christian who has no sense of his glory. My glory is what I am with the Father, not what I am in the world. How far do we know what it is to be withdrawn from the outward of our life here and to retreat into the inner
{202}
-- our place with the Father? It is quite true I want help in the details of things here, but that is not enough. I want to retreat into my glory -- for I am not unsuited to the Father's house, and can participate in the joy of the Father. He has brought me into His joy, and in a state in which I am not unfit for His house.
Now I come to the outer (chapter 17: 11 - 21) -- the kingdom of God. The instruction in regard to the kingdom begins, I think, with the healing of the leper in chapter 17 and goes on to chapter 18: 30. It is an exceedingly important truth in its practical bearing on our everyday walk down here. The leper that returned appears to me a beautiful illustration of the kingdom of God.
The Lord had come to relieve man of the judgment that rested on his body, of which leprosy is a picture. A divine Person had come entirely outside of legal ordinances. He relieved ten lepers, but only one of the ten enters into the kingdom of God. And how? He entered within the sway of divine goodness revealed in Christ; that marked him, and he is sent on his way in peace. What a wonderful revolution in that man! Law will not do for him now. God has come down in divine goodness; now he has got back healed to the One that relieved him, and he gives glory to God.
The Lord says, "Where are the nine?" and to this one He says, "Arise, go thy way". He had his individual pathway on earth under the sway of divine goodness. Immediately after, when the Lord was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, He answered, "The kingdom of God is among you". Divine goodness was here in power, but man did not apprehend it. He was lost in the dark insensibility of unbelief. The believer is relieved of the judgment that was resting on him, and the Holy Spirit dwells in his body. If he dies he goes to the Lord. Death is now the servant of the believer, and his body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. In his
{203}
pathway here the Christian is, in the abiding sense of divine goodness, sent forth in peace to act in the power of the Holy Spirit for God in this world.
I would just refer to the next chapter, 18, where two blessed truths come out. Little children have part in the kingdom of God, they are to be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. We do not bring up our children under law, but in the light of divine goodness revealed in Christ. Nothing is to be put between them and the goodness of the Lord. They are in relation to the Lord here, and we learn in @1 Corinthians 7 that they "are holy", they are entitled to be in the congregation.
We all have to begin completely anew for the kingdom as a little child. There is no good in anything we had before. We begin now from the top and have to look at everything in the light of divine goodness.
Then in the latter part of the chapter we find that riches which give a man importance in the world, and are the token of material prosperity, make it difficult for him to enter into the kingdom. The tendency naturally is that when a man is compassed with material prosperity he does not care for the moral, that is, the revelation of divine goodness. There is a conflict always going on between the material and the moral, and man's soul is the battleground.
It is very difficult to touch a rich man with the revelation of divine goodness. *God* can touch him, for nothing is impossible with God.
Material prosperity is no good beyond this world; you cannot carry this world's goods beyond this world; when death comes a soul must leave all, but divine goodness will stand a man in stead for eternity.
One word more. The principle of kingdom is government. The disciples remind the Lord of the surrender they had made. Peter says, "Lo, we have left all and followed thee". What is the answer? Whatever surrender had been made for the kingdom
{204}
of God's sake a man would get "manifold more" in this present time. Retribution is connected with the kingdom of God; you not only get future advantage, but present blessing; you are a hundred-fold better off in the kingdom of God.
Man is uncommonly fond of material prosperity, but I ask any believer, Is it not far better to have your soul in the sense and light of divine goodness than to have all the material prosperity the world could afford? -- to know that you can be here for God, that all is light beyond, and when everything fails here, you will be received into everlasting habitations? That is the end to the Christian in the kingdom of God.
We have thus the inner and the outer. Truth is revealed to us to govern us in our pathway down here, and there is light in Scripture both as to what we are by God's calling and what we are as men down here. The two must be put together in the soul; but I am privileged to retire from the outward here into the blessed secret of what I am with the Father in His house according to His love, participating with Him in His own joy in recovery. THE PRIVILEGE IS COMMENSURATE WITH THE REVELATION.
{205}
THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST
{206}
{207}
THE SUPERIORITY OF CHRIST TO EVERY MAN HERE
@John 2; @John 3: 1 - 8, 35, 36; @John 12: 30 - 33
I want to bring under your attention the greatness of Christ. I do not mean positionally, but morally. What is in my mind is to show what Christ is in comparison with other men. There is a great deal of pretension in the present day on the part of man, and it is not only in what men themselves assume to be (and there is plenty of pretension in that way), but in the way in which man is exalted on the part of other men. What comes before us commonly in the present day is the tendency to make everything of man. All cannot be leaders, but there are leaders, and leaders are set up and supported by others. There are, no doubt, men of great capability qualified in a way to be leaders; but we are in a day marked, to a large extent, by the exaltation of man. In the long run man will be deified; in that way lawlessness will come to a head. God has given to man ability; whatever ability any man may have he never acquired; he may have used it well, but he never acquired it. Man does often use the ability that God has given to him, and because of that other men will unduly exalt him. The result of it all will be, as I said, that man will be deified. We get that brought out in 2 Thessalonians.
Now the point to my mind is that in the universe of God Christ is the beginning or Head. Both are relative terms. You could not speak of a head except in relation to other things; there would be no meaning in the term; Christ is the Head and beginning of the universe of God. I do not speak about the universe of God in a physical, but in a moral sense. In the universe of God Christ is pre-eminent; it is that that
{208}
led me to read the verse at the close of chapter 3, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand". "And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence", @Colossians 1: 18.
I want you to entertain the thought of Christ in that point of view. And there is another thing: that in virtue of redemption He has become the point of attraction to man. What do you think conversion means practically? It means the deliverance of a person from the world, and his attachment to Christ; he belongs to Christ and to that world or system of which Christ is the beginning and Head. In chapter 12 Christ speaks of Himself as the centre and point of attraction, and, in connection with that, of the judgment of this world. He says, "Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out". Why? Because Christ has come in as the centre and point of attraction to man. He says, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all unto me". Things could not have been spoken of in that way -- the thought of the judgment of this world brought in -- unless God had begun again, and made Christ to be a point of attraction. Christ would never have come at all but for the mercy of God, and if God's purposes of mercy are to be carried out, and if there be the judgment of this world, there must be a point to which man can be attracted, and that is conditional on the Son of man being lifted up. In that way Christ presents Himself at the present time. There are three things we have to take into account in connection with Christ. The first is attraction, He draws to Himself; the next is attachment, by which we are delivered from lawlessness; and the third, consequent upon attachment, is affection. I say that much by way of introduction; but my point is to show the title of Christ to pre-eminence. If He is Head over all things,
{209}
the beginning, and point of attraction, it is as evident as possible that He must be pre-eminent, and I will try and give you some idea of the pre-eminence of Christ morally, His superiority to other men.
I think we ought to have some idea of the worthiness of Christ. We are married to another, to Him that is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God. We shall not bring forth fruit to God if we do not esteem Christ very much more than any other man. My point is to show the moral superiority of Christ to every man in the world. It is a point of view in which I like to look at all the detail that is furnished to us in the gospels. If we have eyes to see, we shall perceive everywhere the moral superiority of Christ to all that He came in contact with down here. It may be said that men are much more enlightened in the present day than when Christ was upon earth. That may be true in science and so on, but in that day man's mind was pretty active; there was as much ability in that day as now; there were thinkers and philosophers -- in that way the world is not advanced so very much. There is more investigation of the laws of nature and, that kind of thing, but in that day there was as much activity of man's mind in other directions. People have to go back to the works of that time to find the great monuments of genius. Now in the ministry of the Lord Jesus upon earth you find Him continually in contact with men, and in every case we can see the moral superiority of Christ to every kind and condition of man, and to every circumstance in which he was found. God is going to set forth a universe in which He Himself will be glorified, and of which Christ is the beginning and centre, and if we are believers and have the Spirit of Christ, we do not belong to this world; but have been brought into attachment to Christ, so that we belong to that system of which Christ is the beginning and Head. In order to illustrate what I have said I am going to take up
{210}
what comes out in this chapter. The first point is in connection with the marriage in Cana; the second in connection with Jerusalem, where Christ speaks of the temple of His body; and the third in connection with man -- many believed on Him when they saw the miracles which He did. In every case I want to show how much better Christ is than man. Judging pretty much by the occupations and the reading of people, I feel that Christ does not content their hearts. Many Christians seem to be thinking that something is better than Christ, for if they thought Christ better than everything else surely they would give more attention to Christ. If I had found out the best thing in this world, and appreciated it, surely I should give some attention to it. If people think Christ is better than everything surely they should give more attention to Him. But they give to Christ the odds and ends of their time. We do not treat Christ worthily, and the reason is that we have not a sufficient appreciation of His superiority to every man, and, I may say, to everything.
We read in chapter 2 in verse 11, "Jesus ... manifested forth his glory". Did you ever think what His glory was? I understand it was His glory that He could do better for man than man could do for himself. Man will do the best for himself in general, and certainly on great occasions. Marriage is a great occasion, perhaps the greatest occasion in a man's life, undoubtedly man will then do the best. But whatever man may be capable of doing for himself Christ will surpass it. Man will do a good deal for his own happiness, but he does not secure it. It is often enough the case with man that the wine runs out. He does not attain happiness by the means he has proposed to himself, and is in that sense a failure. That is often enough proved in the experience of people -- man has to recognise that he does not secure his own happiness. Now Christ is superior to man,
{211}
because He can and will secure happiness for man if man will only listen to Him -- happiness that will not run out; He begins with the water of purification. Man never begins that way. When man sets to work to secure happiness he takes up the means at hand. Some set to work to make money, others to gratify what they think innocent tastes, and others go in for domestic happiness, they take what is to hand, but they never think about the water of purification. Christ begins with that, and He turns the water into wine. I am not speaking about what I do not know; depend upon it, that is the true way of happiness. There are two things which Christ does for you; on the one hand, He delivers you from the world, and on the other He communicates to you the Spirit, that you may be conscious of and enjoy the favour of God. I believe that to be the true secret of happiness for man. I am confident that God does not intend man to be happy without Himself. Man may have all the opportunities which the providence of God has placed within his reach, and use these to the best advantage, but his happiness will somehow be marred, because God will not have man happy without Himself. When Christ came in His point was to cleanse man from the pollutions of the world; then "Having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear". The Spirit was given that man might joy in the knowledge of the favour of God. That is a great deal better than ever man could do for himself. I ask any reasonable person if it be not true that Christ is greater than man. Christ can do better for man than man can do for himself. Let a man lay out all the plans he can for his happiness down here, and I will undertake to say that his happiness will be marred; sickness or death may come in, there will be a worm at the root of the gourd. I cannot conceive anything more blessed than that Christ should turn the water into wine in the
{212}
heart of man. I am not taking up the incident in a dispensational but in a moral point of view, to illustrate what I say, that Christ is superior to man.
In verses 18 - 21 we get another point as to man in what is seen here, that is, the destructive tendency of man, and, in contrast to that, how Christ raises up. Man pulls down and Christ raises up. Evidently, raising up is a greater thing than pulling down. The temple was corrupted. The Lord cleanses it -- He casts out the sheep and the oxen. It was the peculiar privilege of Israel that the temple and the oracles of God were among them, but they took opportunity to corrupt them. You may depend upon it that whatever of God comes into this world is bound to be corrupted. The material temple was turned into a house of merchandise. When the true temple came, they could not *corrupt* that, so they set to work to destroy it. Corrupt and destroy are very much akin. You remember what the apostle Paul says in @1 Corinthians 3: 17, "If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy". That has come to pass in Christendom; the temple of God has, so to speak, been turned very largely into an occasion of worldly advantage to man; the same corrupting principle that ever prevailed has come in. Now if you have followed me, you will see how in the history of things the tendency of man has ever been to corrupt or destroy that which is of God. Christ is presented in contrast to that. The Lord said, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up". The temple was still to be there on behalf of man. The Lord would raise it up. We get an idea in that of the superiority of Christ to man. Man destroys the greatest advantage which God could place within his reach. Greater advantage there could not be than that he should have the temple of God, the Son of God here. And when they destroyed the temple and broke all contact with God as far as they
{213}
could do it, what came to pass? In three days, the Lord says, I will raise it up. God is still brought into contact with man. That comes to light in the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles; in Christ, God was still brought into contact with man. The temple was raised up. "In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". So that God is brought into touch with man, and all is maintained in the power of the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven. There again is brought out in a striking way the superiority of Christ to man. I take it, a great object of the temple was that the oracles of God might be placed within the reach of man, and they still are, consequent upon redemption and Christ having been exalted. I have often thought that the present is a great moment; we have come to mount Sion; the ark on mount Sion was witness of the sovereign mercy of God, but I cannot understand the true idea of mount Sion apart from a risen Christ. Mount Sion meant that when Israel had forfeited the ark by their unfaithfulness, God had given it back to them in the sovereignty of mercy. "His mercy endureth for ever" is the song with which mount Sion was celebrated. Man crucified Christ and God gave Christ back to man in resurrection in the sovereignty of mercy on the ground of redemption; hence in Christ risen we have the true principle of mount Sion. We are said to have come to it, because we have come to what is represented in a risen Christ. So man forfeited any right or title to the oracles, or light of God, in the destruction of the temple, but the Lord says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up"; the oracles will still bring God in contact with man. You get the principle in @Romans 3. God has set forth Christ a mercy-seat, a point where He can touch man in the sovereignty of mercy. The same tendency as was seen in Israel is true in us when we have the greatest divine advantages placed within our reach. Our tendency is to corrupt what is of God.
{214}
People make light, in the first instance, of what God gives, then they corrupt it.
One point more. We read, "Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did". They trusted themselves and their conviction, and that is what man does in his self-conceit. The same is true in the present day, men trust their own conviction. I have seen people seeking external evidence of the truth of Scripture, because the tendency of man is to trust the conviction at which his own mind arrives. But Christ did not trust that; He knew that it was not to be trusted. The grace of the Lord goes behind all that; He says at once, "Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God". The Lord goes to the bottom of the matter; He makes known what the true state of the case was, that man is essentially lawless in spirit, and that no conviction of mind will bring him into relation with God or into the path of God's will. Man's mind is capable of a conviction, undoubtedly; it was affected here by miracles, and that tends to increase man's responsibility, because evidence is given to man by which man's mind can be affected. The reason of its being necessary that a man should be born again is that man is essentially lawless in regard of God. He is incapable of appreciating the rule of God. The mind of the flesh is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. The kingdom of God means the moral rule or sway of God. Except a man be born again he cannot see that. The kingdom of God was presented to man in Christ. God has raised up for man a Head in One suitable, for in Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; and in being brought into attachment to Christ, we are brought into relation -- into attachment to God, we enter the kingdom of God, and man comes in that way under the rule of God. Christ knew more about man than man did
{215}
about himself. The Jews thought a great deal of themselves, and people now think they can form a conviction on evidence brought before them, but the conviction will not hold a man in relation to God. The Lord knew it, but I would not have known it, nor you; we only know it because Christ has told us; when He said "Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God", it was because He knew man's spirit was lawless.
If you have followed me I think you will be bound to admit the superiority of Christ to man, and at the same time you will see the thread of mercy which runs through everything of Christ. Christ would provide better for the happiness of man that man could for his own. Christ would abound over all the destructiveness and perverseness of man and would raise up the temple; so too He would not allow man to rest in confidence in himself and his own convictions. He knows very well that whatever conviction there may be in man's mind it will not suffice to hold man in attachment to God. The Lord goes to the bottom of the matter and shows how perfectly He knew how the condition of man is to be met. Christ is the Head and centre of the divine system. "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand". All things are to be brought into reconciliation. Meantime He is the point of attraction to man. He gives us the Spirit to bring us into attachment to Himself. We are to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He may be the Firstborn among many brethren. It is therefore a matter of immense importance that we should have appreciation of Christ. Paul says, "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ". We want some sense of that. Scripture gives us abundant opportunity. I commend these things to your attention that you may
{216}
ponder over them -- seek to contrast Christ with all that He had to meet with in the circumstances to which I have referred, whether at the marriage supper, or at Jerusalem, or in regard of the many who believed in Him. I think if you ponder over it you will get a little more appreciation of Christ than perhaps you have had hitherto.
{217}
THE SPEAKER, THE ORACLES AND THEIR EFFECT
@John 3
I have read this chapter not with the purpose of expounding it, but as following the line of thought which came before us in the last lecture. My point was to show the superiority of Christ to man. You will say, of course, everybody takes that for granted; but I think it is not only to be taken for granted, but an apprehension should be gained of it. What we want is the knowledge of Christ. The apostle Paul speaks of "The excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ". We may have lost opportunities and advantages here and we want compensation. I do not think God intends us to be without compensation. I am afraid people do not always get the compensation, and have a sort of regret as to what they have sacrificed, but that is a poor thing. Paul had made sacrifices, had evidently given up a great deal, reputation, connections and associations, but he had compensation, and it was found in "The excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord". Therefore, the knowledge of Christ is a very great point for the Christian.
I took up two or three points last time in connection with chapter 2, points of interest, showing the superiority of Christ to man. One was in connection with the marriage at Cana. I was pointing out that it showed how Christ could do better for man than man could for himself; then, in connection with the temple, that man does one of two things, he either corrupts or destroys. But Christ raises up. "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".
{218}
There was another point, that Christ knew more of man than man of himself. Man did not know his own lawlessness; Christ did. Hence the Lord speaks of the necessity of a man being born again. No man naturally knows sin. Man's conscience does not witness to sin, but in regard to its activity. But even where sin does not come into conception, there is the principle of lawlessness. Man does not know it, but Christ did. The Lord spoke of the necessity for a man to be born again, in order that he may come under the moral sway of God.
I was saying that in the idea of the temple you have to take in the thought of the oracles. The oracles of God are most important to man. I say that much to lead up to chapter 3. The point of chapter 3 is that in it we get the oracles; as in chapter 2 the temple. In the tabernacle, and again in the temple, was the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat, and when you come to the real temple, that is Christ, you have the oracles of God. You have to distinguish between the temple and the oracles. It is a great point to know the value to us of the temple so that we may get the oracles. There are three points I take up in connection with the chapter. The first is the speaker, I contrast the speaker with man at his best; then the oracles, that is, what is spoken. Then the effect of the oracles, of the speaking. You get that brought out in the chapter very simply. One word in advance in regard to the effect of what is spoken; we have it before our eyes. People are attracted and attached to a centre so that they are recovered from lawlessness; on the other hand some are repelled.
Now I will say a little in regard of the speaker. The verses I read dwell a good bit on speaking, "We speak that we know, and testify that we have seen". Then afterwards, "What he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth". Then again, "He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God". Men
{219}
often speak, but one thing must mark all speaking on the part of man: no man can speak (I am not referring to senseless people, but to people accounted wise in this world) who has not knowledge, but then the knowledge that man has is acquired. Whatever may be the field of knowledge, whether philosophy or science, it must be acquired. Man must have observed and co-ordinated things in his mind, he must possess capability, be able to notice facts and put them together; deduce conclusions, and in that way arrive at what is called knowledge, but evidently it is acquired. There is another point in regard of man: every conclusion of man, and even his observation, may be marred or distorted to a certain extent by some difficulty in apprehension, because it is extremely uncommon to find a man entirely without bias or prejudice; if there be anything of that kind affecting the mind of man it is pretty clear that his conclusions are not likely to be absolutely correct. Now in regard to the Son of God we get a remarkable expression: "The Son of man which is in heaven", and another, "We speak that we know, and testify that we have seen". Christ had not to acquire knowledge; knowledge was inherent. That is the difference between Christ and any human speaker. No human speaker could say, "We speak that we know", because man as man knows nothing; when he comes into the world he knows nothing; all he knows is acquired. Christ never had to acquire knowledge. The officers who came to take Him had to say, "Never man spake like this man". The Jews said, "How knoweth this man letters never having learned?" At twelve years old, in the midst of the doctors at Jerusalem, "All that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers". All serves to illustrate what we get here, "We speak that we do know". "He that is of God speaketh the words of God". Therefore there can be no comparison between man and Christ. There is a
{220}
contrast, but no comparison. There is one more point, every man upon earth is affected by the fogs and mists of earth; that is as certain as possible; we know it in natural things, and in moral things there are plenty of fogs and mists. I do not believe there is any man who is entirely unaffected by them. Of the Son of man it is said, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven". I understand by it that He is entirely above the mists and fogs of earth. He is above the clouds, and unaffected by them, they can produce no effect upon the mind of the speaker here. There is nothing distorted, nothing out of order or proportion. He is the speaker, who speaks that He knows and testifies that He has seen. I trust I have carried you thus far, and that all will apprehend the superiority of *the* speaker -- the Son of man which is in heaven -- to every human speaker. Plenty of men profess to be seekers after truth, but their vision is pretty sure not to be perfect, because it is affected by prejudices that prevail upon earth.
I pass on now to the next point -- the oracles. There I think we can see the contrast between what man speaks and what the Son of man speaks. "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life". In this chapter the Lord says a good bit about the light. "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light ... For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God". All the Lord speaks here is in anticipation of resurrection. I want you to bear that in mind, the Son of man had to be lifted up. The light could not come out fully until resurrection.
{221}
What I understand by the light is the revelation of God. In the death of Christ we get the light of divine love. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son". Another thing had to come out in regard of God, that was divine power, and that was seen in the resurrection of Christ. Resurrection meant that Christ was given back of God to man in the virtue of redemption. We get a beautiful expression in the epistle to the Hebrews, "Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant". Therefore, in Christ the light is of the love and power of God toward man and on man's behalf. All that the Lord said and did in the course of His ministry anticipated that. In @Acts 26: 23 it says, "That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles". He was to come out in that way in resurrection. As the Lord said in @John 2, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up". The temple was to be in resurrection. That is what God ordained. I am referring now to what is spoken, and it is difficult to put that before you, because when we talk about speaking, we expect to hear words; but there is a very old saying, that facts or acts speak louder than words; they do, and that is essentially the case when the facts or the acts are of God. The testimony of God has come out in facts. There are words to explain it, but the testimony is in the death and resurrection of Christ. As I said, the death of Christ is the great expression of divine love. "The Son of man must be lifted up" as the perfect expression of divine love. God saw fit Himself to take up the liabilities under which man lay by the judgment of God in order that He might show mercy to man. Hence the Son of man lifted up is not simply the testimony to what man's condition was, but to divine
{222}
love, in its bearing in regard to man. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life". The latter part shows the consequence. I am occupied with the foundations. The other fact is the resurrection of Christ; the power of God has intervened to raise up Christ from the dead in virtue of redemption, that He might in that way be given back to man. When the Israelites carried the ark into battle, and the Philistines took it, there might justly be said, "Ichabod", that is, the glory had departed from Israel; but God gave the ark back. He did that in the sovereignty of His mercy. So in resurrection God has given back Christ to man in the blood of the everlasting covenant. If you have followed me you will have seen that the facts of the death and resurrection of Christ speak much stronger than words. I have no doubt that all the Lord Jesus did and said was leading up to these facts. It is doubtful if the disciples understood any act of the Lord's life -- either His words or His miracles -- until they understood His death; everything was illuminated by it. In contrast to that, man gives you volumes; you may get wisdom on the part of man in a way, for there are capable men of the world, with great powers of observation, large minds, having great knowledge of human nature, and acquainted with the history of things in the world; they are men of interest, and we read their works, but it is only books they give you. But I can understand anybody saying, does not that show great breadth of mind in the men themselves? Yes, but what have you got to? Only man; and they making use of the ability God gave them. There is another class of men, possessed of wealth, and bestowing on men all kinds of benefits, building institutes and libraries for the improvement of man's mind, perhaps with the idea of improving man morally. It might be said of such, Do not acts speak louder than words?
{223}
Have you not witness to the liberality and beneficence of man? You have, but, after all, only man is before me. I can understand another class of men prepared to go to any extremity for the maintenance of principle -- a politician, who for the sake of principle would die; again, it may be said, Do not acts speak louder than words? But you have only the man or the principle. In any case that I have supposed you have no more than the man or the principle; but in the death and resurrection of Christ, it is not that you have man, but God. You have not wonderful volumes written, great liberality shown, or a man dying for a principle, but the testimony of the love and power of God. A man may die for a principle, but there is no resurrection; the death and the resurrection of Christ are the oracles; not an exhibition of what a man could do, or where a man could go, but the revelation of God. The death and resurrection of Christ are great facts and the testimony of God upon earth. They are the explanation of the mercy which Christ shewed in His miracles, and in all that He testified to both in regard of man and of God. There are two principles which ruled in everything that the Lord Jesus said when here; one was that he would not tolerate man: there was the rebuke and the refusal of man's pretension in all the Lord Jesus said; but, on the other hand, there was the continual bringing in of the goodness of God. So in the death of Christ, there was the complete setting aside of man, but there was the testimony, the bringing in of God in love. The facts that are brought before you in connection with the Son of God, which the Lord refers to here, are the lifting up of the Son of man, and the resurrection which that lifting up involved. "It behoved Christ to suffer and to rise again", and those facts present to us the oracles of God. I daresay the expression "oracles of God" does not present a very definite notion to many people; what I understand by them is the testimony
{224}
of divine love and power in Christ in its application to man. We have come unto mount Sion. That is what is spoken, and it is very different from what man can speak.
I come now to @John 3: 19 - 21 and 35, 36. There are two effects of light coming in, which I have referred to already. One effect is to expose; and light often repels because it exposes. You see that in a house or in an office. If a Christian is brought into an ungodly office he will find that the light will have two effects, on the one hand it will expose and repel, but on the other it will attract all except the lawless. There is not a doubt about that. I admit the need of a man being born again, but whatever there is of truth or doing truth here would be attracted to the light. He that doeth evil does not come to the light, it repels. You must not be astonished at that; all in the world are not going to be attracted by the light; undoubtedly there are those in the world who are repelled by it. They do not like the light. The mind of man hates an absolute standard of right and wrong. He prefers right and wrong to be in measure mixed up, so that there may be no absolute standard for his practice; but if God is light and in Him is no darkness, when the revelation of God has come in, there is bound to be an absolute standard of right and wrong. It is said of the Lord Jesus, "Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness". The one hated, the other loved; hence, undoubtedly, the effect of the light will be to attach to itself, on the other hand it will repel. Men of the world, and very intelligent men, too, refuse revelation because they will not allow an absolute standard of right and wrong. Now everything was brought to an issue when Christ came; because there was now a centre, a point of attraction. The Lord speaks here about being lifted up, and in chapter 12, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me". That passage involves resurrection.
{225}
A centre has come in to which everything for God can be attached. In connection with that we get, on the one hand, the thought of everlasting life for the one that believeth in Him -- but, on the other, he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. What has become of the world that existed when Christ was on earth? That world had Jerusalem for its centre, but has been broken to pieces and has come under Gentile domination. The world has become Babylonish. The effect of Christ coming in was this, he that believed came into everlasting life by the Spirit; but "he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him" has been exemplified in the case of the Jew. They were not subject to the Son; when presented to them, they said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him". Then He was presented in resurrection and they would not have him; and the Jew has been under the wrath of God from that day to this.
But there is another point. Christ was to suffer and to rise again from the dead and to show light, not only to *the people* but to the Gentiles. The *Gentiles* are being tested by the light. We get the thought of eternal life in Christ presented to the Gentiles. It is an accepted time and a day of salvation. Scripture speaks of the reconciliation of the world, the testimony has gone out to the world, and a great result will be brought about in regard to the Gentiles by the light. The apostasy will in due time be manifested, but God is accomplishing His purpose, and a great many have been attracted. The atoms that were floating about in lawlessness have been brought into attachment to the divine centre. But it is perfectly plain that the end of things, so far as man is concerned, will be the setting up of antichrist. Man will exhibit himself perfectly lawless, every principle of evil will be brought into combination. There will be the revival of the
{226}
Roman beast, and the actual antichrist will appear, and the devil, cast out of heaven, giving his throne and authority to the beast; and the harlot will ride the beast. Scripture makes plain enough what things are coming to, what all is going to culminate in. Then there will be the great final test, the coming of the Lord. Men are being tested morally at the present time; there are principles at work which will be headed up in the man of sin. One evident proof of lawlessness in the world is in the disintegration of society. There are two reasons which bring Christ again into the world: one is, that He appears the second time, apart from sin, unto salvation; but the other is that he will appear "in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ". When everything is ripe, when the vintage is ready and the harvest is ripe, He will come in to gather up the harvest -- not one grain will fall to the ground -- but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. The Lord will come at the appointed moment, and everything will be brought to an issue; He will appear for the salvation of His people, but He will appear to the destruction of the lawless. The issue is already here. Plenty of people have been attracted to Christ. He is the blessed centre presented to man in the way of testimony. We have been attracted to Him by the testimony. God has taken that way to deliver us from this present evil world. We have been attached to Christ by the Spirit, and are to keep ourselves in the love of God. We are in the good of revelation. "He that believeth in him hath everlasting life".
I suggest these things to you to furnish you with food for consideration. I want you to contemplate the greatness of the speaker, what is spoken and the value of the oracles, all the light of God shining upon you upon earth. "Herein is love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because
{227}
as he is, so are we in this world". It is wonderful to be in the light, in attachment to Christ, and to abide in Christ. When you are brought into attachment the point is to abide, and if you abide in Christ you get the benefit of the sunshine: we "walk in the light as he is in the light" that we may have the light pervading our hearts.

CHRIST AS LAST ADAM, IN KNOWLEDGE AND IN GIVING
@John 4: 1 - 26, 39 - 54
My thought is to continue on the line which has been already before us, and a little further to present Christ in contrast to man. We have a striking point of contrast in this chapter, for all that comes out in detail is the contrast of the last Adam to the first; that lies underneath. We are told in @1 Corinthians 15, "The last Adam is a life-giving Spirit", and in this chapter the Lord speaks of the living water which He would give. One may assume therefore that there is in this scripture a point of contrast as between the first Adam and the last, between man, as man, and Christ. By man came death -- death comes in at the end of the chapter -- by man came also the resurrection of the dead. I take up two points -- one is, as to knowledge; and the other, as to gift. The two things come out in a striking way. The chapter presents Jesus to us as the Christ, the Prophet that should come into the world, and I think the moral idea connected with the Christ is of the One who has accomplished peace, so that He might communicate to man the gift of living water. He is the life-giving Spirit, the Head of every man, wisdom for every man, who communicates living water to whosoever will. Adam could communicate nothing; though all those begotten of Adam were begotten in his likeness, he could not communicate anything. The first man Adam was made a living soul; he had not life in himself. The last Adam is a life-giving Spirit, and the thought of a life-giving Spirit is of One who can make alive, and the way in which we are made live by the last Adam is in the communication to us of the living water. "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".
{229}
The first point I speak about is that of knowledge. It is not the revelation of God that we see in this chapter, that was in the previous chapter. I was speaking last time of the superiority of Christ as seen in that chapter. He could say, "We speak that we know, and testify that we have seen". He was the Son of man which is in heaven and what He had seen He testified, and what He testified was what was in God. He knew what was in God, and consequently we get the mind of God brought out. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life". John the baptist speaks in the same sense at the close of the chapter. He says, "What he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth". But he adds, no one receives His testimony. No man can know what is in God except by the Spirit of God. A man may know certain things about himself. Adam could not know God as we do; he knew the goodness of God, but was not capable of knowing God. You do not know God by faith; you believe certain things which are in the mind of God with reference to man; for instance, if God makes known His grace in regard to man in forgiveness of sins, man can take that in, because it refers to himself; but as to the question of knowing God, no man is able for that except by the Spirit of God. The mind of man cannot soar above the things of man. We can and do know a great deal by the Spirit of God; but the mind of man in itself cannot go beyond the things of man. It is in that way that in the previous chapter we see the greatness of the Lord; He could say, "We speak that we know". He knew all that was in the mind of God.
But this chapter brings out the truth of what we read in the end of chapter 2, "He knew what was in man". Christ knew not only what was in God, but what was in man. Now no *man* knows what is in man. The Lord knew what was in man, because He
{230}
knew perfectly what was in God. The woman of Samaria says, "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" The Lord knew what was in her and everything about her, and she felt that she was searched; she said to Him, "I perceive that thou art a prophet". She was conscious that the Lord knew everything about her circumstances, history and surroundings. He knew her perfectly because He knew God perfectly, and the principle holds good in regard to us. It is the man that knows God who knows himself; no man knows himself until he is outside himself, and the only way you can be outside yourself is by knowing God. I have sometimes said I do not believe in other men because I do not believe in myself. There are plenty of people in the world who would be benefactors to man; they have confidence in man, but this proves to me, that they have confidence in themselves. The Lord knew the woman perfectly. The woman was lawless, that is what the Lord detected. She had had five husbands, and the one she now had was not her husband. With lawlessness there was confusion, very terrible confusion in her case; she had contributed materially to the confusion in the world. Wherever there is lawlessness there is bound to be confusion. In society there is a terrible deal of lawlessness, and pretty much of this character; and where there is lawlessness people contribute to the confusion of the world. There is another thing, lawlessness is bound to bring in controversy, because God will have to say to man; controversy and confusion forbid the idea of peace. Peace is where controversy and confusion are brought to an end. "There is no peace for the wicked". There is still another thing in connection with man which the Lord knew perfectly, and that is unbelief. That comes out in the nobleman at the end of the chapter. The Lord says, "Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe". Unbelief marks man as man is.
{231}
Man is lawless. By lawlessness he has brought confusion in, and there is, and must be, with lawlessness the principle of unbelief. We get the warning in the epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 3: 12, "Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God". Now the Lord knew this; he knew all things perfectly in regard to the woman, and all that he speaks was of that knowledge.
Another point in connection with that is, the Lord could speak about giving living water, because He had the power to meet all these things. This is very important as connected with Christ's knowledge. I do not think the Lord would have had any kind of pleasure in bringing to light all that was in man if He could not have met it. It is a poor thing to expatiate upon evil if you cannot meet it. But in regard of man I say, Where is the man that knows his fellow-man? The most far-sighted men in the world, those who assume to be leaders in a moral point of view, philosophers, and people of that description, do not know man. And the secret of it is that they do not know themselves, and they do not know themselves because they are not outside themselves; they do not know God, and their ideas will be entirely at fault, because they assume that there are capabilities in man which do not exist, that is my impression. It is a common idea in the present day that the condition of the world may be greatly improved by education and by placing people -- especially what may be called the degraded classes -- in better conditions of living. I have no doubt the condition materially may be greatly improved, and that education may in a sense tend to lessen crime, but education and improved conditions of living will never meet lawlessness, and therefore the confusion will remain. It may come out in another way, but it will remain. And another thing will increase with education and improved conditions of
{232}
living, and that is the disintegration of society. The bonds by which classes have been hitherto bound together have been greatly dissolved by increasing education. The truth is, that all that man can do in that direction does not meet the question of lawlessness. And where lawlessness is confusion will be, and controversy and unbelief. All the theories of man with regard to social improvement are built up on the idea of capability in man, and there is not moral capability in man. Certain gross things that take place in the world may be put to shame, but the idea of moral capability in man is a mistake; nothing that man can do will touch the root question, which is lawlessness.
Now, as I said before, the Lord saw perfectly into the woman. There was controversy between herself and God, as of course there must be where there is lawlessness. Why do you think the Lord brought the woman's history to light? why did He say to her, "Thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband"? Some would say, Because He wanted to arouse her conscience, but that is not the only reason; to my mind He brought it to light because He was going to meet it all. Whatever the Lord brought to light in regard to evil in man He was going to meet. He alone could meet it. And the way He took to meet it was entirely according to God, by bringing all to an end, bringing man to an end in order that He might communicate to man living water. There is an intimate connection between what Christ knew in regard to man, and what He was capable of meeting. He could accomplish the will of God in bearing all that lay upon man by the judgment of God, in order to bring that man to an end in the cross, that He might communicate the gift of the Spirit, so that man might pass out by one door, but come in by another. Every one passes out by one door, the death of Christ, but comes in by another, that is by the living water that Christ gives.
{233}
Evidently we have a great contrast between Christ and man. It is perfectly certain to my mind that no man knows his fellow, for the simple reason that he does not know himself. The Christian can say, "For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwells no good thing". If I were not outside the flesh, in the knowledge of God, I could not say that. If I do say it, I add, In another person's flesh dwells no good thing.
That leads me to another point, that is, Christ as the Giver, and there again I would point out the contrast between Christ and man. I was saying that we get in the chapter an implied contrast between the last Adam and the first. "Man was made a living soul". He had nothing to give. All he had was what God had made him. A man of the world can only give what he has acquired. He can give wealth, colossal gifts in that way, but he must have acquired it. He has not got it naturally. So, too, man can bestow on other men works of art and genius, but then he must have acquired skill in that line of things in order to give, and for the reason that every man comes into the world naked, he possesses nothing. Another point in regard to man is, that he cannot give to another what will reinstate that man morally. A man might give to a poor man what would take that man out of his circumstances, but he could not give to a fallen man what would reinstate that man morally. All the giving of man is subject to limitations. When we come to the last Adam the first principle of His giving is, He gives what is of Himself. He does not give what He has acquired. In one sense He has acquired the right to give, but what He gives is of Himself. I take living water to be essentially of Himself. "The last Adam is a life-giving Spirit". He can give living water, because He has terminated in death the lawless man that brought in confusion. But Christ gives what is of Himself. Now that is a point of the greatest possible importance when you
{234}
consider that Christ is the Son of God; to think that He can give what is of Himself. I can go a point higher, If He gives that which is of Himself, He gives that which is of God. Living water is of Himself, but then that is of God. It is the Spirit of God. The Lord opens the question with the woman here in saying, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".
There is the strongest possible contrast between the giving of Christ and the giving of man, even at the best. But there is another point in regard to the giving of Christ, and that is, He gives what will reinstate man morally. And I go a step further than that. He gives what can set up man morally in a position in which he never was before. Man is reinstated morally, that idea is clearly maintained in Scripture. "Christ suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God". Man is reinstated, you get that principle, too, in the prodigal in Luke, he was reinstated with the Father. The fact of man being reinstated with God is not inconsistent with the idea of man being brought into a position in which he never was before. Man is recovered for God. No one can gainsay that. He is not brought back in the way in which be left God; when brought to God he is clad in the best robe, the ring is on his hand, and the shoes on his feet. But he is brought back. I connect 'reinstated' with the thought of the living water. "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life". The first principle in connection with the living water is that a man is brought into the kingdom of God, under the moral sway of God. If man is brought under the moral sway of God he is reinstated with God. There is an end of lawlessness when man is brought into attachment to Christ, which he is by
{235}
the living water. He is brought back to God, because Christ is God. Everything depends upon Christ being God. If Christ were not man, we could not be brought into attachment to Him by the Spirit. But by the fact of being attached to Him by the Spirit we are brought to God. The Lord taught in @Matthew 18, that men were to receive the kingdom as little children, and the effect of receiving the kingdom was that they entered into it. The kingdom of God is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. I regard that as a point of paramount importance, because no man is set free of the world so long as he is subject to the lawlessness of the world; and no man can be liberated from the lawlessness of the world except by the establishment of divine authority in his conscience. The Spirit is given in order that the authority of the Lord may be established in the conscience of the believer. And so the believer is maintained in the fear of the Lord, and then he has security. I tremble for young people, they are exposed to great evil in the world, but I know that if the authority of the Lord is established and maintained in their souls by the Spirit of God they are safe. "The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous runneth into it, and is safe". The great preservative is the fear of the Lord. The contrast to it is the fear of man. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and a great security.
I come to another point. By the Spirit of God, the living water, the believer finds himself in another moral atmosphere, an atmosphere which is entirely dependent on Christ. If you have not Christ, you have no moral atmosphere but what is very corrupt. A foul atmosphere arises from corruption and decomposition. Depend upon it there is a very foul moral atmosphere in the world on account of the corruption there. But in Christ an atmosphere has been brought in in which the Christian can live. It is a pure atmosphere. I see it in the little company that surrounded
{236}
the Lord Jesus when here. The moral atmosphere of that society entirely depended upon the Lord Himself, and the disciples breathed a pure atmosphere. Nothing corrupting came into that circle. Everything defiling was rebuked by the presence of Christ Himself. My conviction is, though I could not exactly prove it to you, that there is still such a thing as a pure atmosphere here, and if you ask me where it is to be found, I say it is where Christ is the centre. There is a circle here of which Christ is the centre, and there must be there a pure atmosphere, because the presence of Christ would be the rebuke of anything corrupting or defiling. The point for us is that we should be in that pure atmosphere. I cannot exactly tell you where it may be found, except in saying, it is found in the region of the Spirit, because the region of the Spirit is morally Christ. You will not get health or vigour spiritually if you do not breathe a wholesome and pure atmosphere. People do not care to live in an atmosphere arising from corruption, naturally they are careful enough to secure a pure atmosphere. Well, we want a pure atmosphere morally. There is a region in which the atmosphere is of Christ, and those who breathe that atmosphere will be sound and vigorous spiritually. I like to talk about the region of the Spirit, for many of us have sought in these days to get free from organisations which have originated with man and to enter into the region of the Spirit. In the region of the Spirit there is divine light, the revelation of God in such wise as that it is available. It is there to gladden the eyes, so that God is known and delighted in, "In thy light we shall see light". "God has called us out of darkness into his marvellous light". When the Lord was here, do you think the disciples would have gone to the chief priests or the scribes to get light? They knew that all light was in Christ; so now all light is in the region of the Spirit. All is the result to us of
{237}
the living water that Christ gives. It springs up in us; it enables us to apprehend and to enter into conditions which have been brought about by the advent of Christ. Had not Christ come there would not have been the kingdom of God. There would not have been a moral atmosphere, and there would have been no light of God. The present is essentially for us a time of education. It will not fit you for heaven, but for the world to come; to fulfil our function then we have to be educated. Everything is assured to us, the Lord Jesus said, "He that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and he that liveth and believeth on me shall never die". The believer is not going into the grave to be out of everything; he is to be raised up at the last day, that is the great day. It is possible, on the other hand, you may never die at all. "He that liveth and believeth on me shall never die". We are brought at the present time into blessing. It is a great thing to gain an apprehension of that system of blessing of which Christ is the centre, of the "all things" which are centred in Christ, the Sun of righteousness, and to understand the function assigned to the church, as the heavenly city, in that great system. We have entered into the conditions in which eternal life consists, into the kingdom, the moral atmosphere, and the light of God. We increase in the knowledge of God and in holiness, and by the light of God.
May God give you grace to meditate upon what I have attempted to present to you, that is, the contrast of Christ to every man. In chapter 2 He could do more for man than man could do for himself; man destroys and Christ raises up. In chapter 3 He could say, "We speak that we do know"; man could not say that, he has no entrance into the knowledge of God naturally. Christ knew perfectly what was in man because He knew perfectly what was in God. He took account of what was in man, not to judge him,
{238}
but to bring it to an end in order that the Spirit might be communicated to man, that the Spirit should be a well of water springing up in the believer unto everlasting life. We have to accept the death of Christ in regard of ourselves; and we have part in it in order that we may come in by another door. Not only are you reinstated for God, but you are brought into things which for man are entirely new.
{239}
THE TWO MINISTRIES AND THEIR RESULTS IN THE SOUL
There are evidently two ministries presented to us in the New Testament, that of the gospel and that of the mystery. They are specifically stated by Paul, and may be found in principle in Peter's writings, and though the two are in perfect accord, and the same persons the subjects of both, yet they are shown to us in distinctness with their respective objects. I desire to set forward, in measure, the nature of each, with its effect in the soul.
And I may first remark that in speaking of the ministry of the gospel, I do not refer exclusively to its proclamation to the unsaved, for I think that the ministry of the gospel is necessary for the establishment of those who through grace have believed, as is made evident by the character of the epistle to the Romans.
The preaching of the gospel has a twofold object: to make known on the one side the righteousness and grace of God in Christ; and on the other to bring the soul through the death and resurrection of Christ consciously into relationship to God on the ground of His glory, and into the consequent enjoyment of salvation from all that is opposed to God.
And here I would remark that too much stress cannot be laid on the fact that before ever the gospel came into the world, the world had been guilty of rejecting God's Son, and that, in spite of full testimony given both in words and works; and hence the ground on which the gospel now rests is that of the purpose and glory of God. That Christ was rejected by His own people all would admit; but Scripture goes further and lays it down to this world and its princes. Jesus Himself said, "Now is the judgment of this world". Christ came here in grace, not imputing
{240}
trespasses to men, healing all that were oppressed of the devil, relieving men from the outward effects of sin, ministering in every kind of divine beneficence, but He was cast out and crucified. Now, though this fact may be lightly passed over by men, it is not so of God, and the consequences are momentous.
The first is, that while the gospel perfectly meets man's need and his failure in his responsibility, yet the ground on which it has come in is that of the purpose of God, for His glory, to accomplish His will; and souls who have received the gospel leave the world morally to enter God's house. The basis of it is that where man was most guilty, sin was removed from before God by sacrifice, and God perfectly glorified. Christ having died for all (for the state of all was alike), all are invited to come in, but whether men respond or not to the call, God will surely accomplish, by the gospel, His own purpose. He will have His house filled. The Jews fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them, and God is calling out of the Gentiles a people for His name.
All who preach the gospel should be conscious that they are the servants of God's purpose; and in this light they will see the equal importance of the ministry of the mystery with that of the gospel.
As I have already said, the object of the ministry of the gospel is, besides revealing God's righteousness for faith, to bring our souls consciously into relation to God through Christ on that ground. It makes God known in His love and goodness -- and by faith of it we are justified, have peace with God, access by faith into favour and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. His love is shed abroad in our hearts, and we joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation. We are in God's marvellous light, and before Him apart from all that is contrary. At the same time our whole thought of God is completely changed. We are brought to Him.
{241}
It will thus be evident that the gospel deals with our persons and does not touch the question of any change of order. We who once were guilty are justified, who were alienated are reconciled. We have our place before God clearly marked out, and not only so, but are formed for God by the gospel, for, as we have seen, the truth of the gospel not only makes known to us the benefits given in grace, but forms our souls by the Spirit's power for God from whom those benefits have come. And hence there is not only the surrender of our own wills in the confession of Christ as Lord, but there are desires of heart for the worship and service of God and fellowship with other saints. The truth, that where two or three are gathered together in Christ's name He is in the midst is accepted, and the soul has reached the blessing of God's house. Believers thus instructed are like Israel in the wilderness, the congregation of the Lord. But not knowing the ministry of the mystery they fail to apprehend the truth of Christ as Head, and the relation of saints to Him as such, and to one another as in Him, with the affections which are peculiar to these relationships. Hence the full purpose of God is not reached in the soul, and this is surely a great loss as well as a hindrance to the continuation of the work of God in them.
In the mystery the position of Christ as Head and the relation of the saints to Him as such is made known, and by the ministry of the mystery the soul is fitted for its place in the assembly which is His body. The believer comes thus as a living stone to the living stone to form part of the spiritual house. He is at the service of and under the direction of the Head. Every believer is, in receiving the Spirit, united to Christ, but I think I may say that but few of us comparatively enter here into the blessed reality of union; but as by the truth of the gospel our souls are formed for relationship with God, so by the ministry of the mystery we are practically formed for the special
{242}
relationship in which we stand to Christ as members of His body, and consequently to one another.
The mystery speaks of Christ and of the assembly. The first important point is to apprehend what the Head is, and then that the members are in accordance with the Head, as Rebekah was of the kindred of Abraham and thus suited to be the wife of Isaac. It is evident that Christ could not have entered on the position of Head of the body while here after the flesh, for He stood completely alone as the corn of wheat. As Head He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, wholly of a new source and order, "out of heaven". He is also separated by death from all the distinctions by which men are divided on earth according to the ordering of God, in order that He may be Head alike to Jew and Gentile. He forms in Himself out of twain, one new man.
All that is accomplished in Ephesians is there viewed as of the power of God, working where all was in death. Christ had gone into death not only as having borne on the cross all that was due to sin, but in the moral excellence which characterised His blessed Person as Son of man. He was the embodiment in flesh of the grace of heaven, full of grace and truth, the living bread come down from heaven. Infinitely perfect as man, and His perfectness not derived from man, but of His own Person. Hence we can well understand the mighty power of God put forth in His resurrection to give Him a condition and place suited to what He was, and commensurate to His humiliation. Such is the Head, the Man of grace and glory, and thus it was that He made Himself known to Saul of Tarsus; for while He appeared to him in a glory surpassing all natural brightness, He spoke to the stern insolent persecutor in terms that expressed the supremacy of grace. I need hardly add that in Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, but that is not now my point, I am viewing Him as the Head.
{243}
The mystery makes known not only the Head, but the glory of our connection with the Head. We were by the baptism of the Spirit members of Christ before we knew it, but the ministry of the mystery not only informs us of the relationship which subsists, but forms us spiritually for the enjoyment of the relationship. It makes known to us that Christ is in us. It is not as men on earth (supposing we had ever had any status before God as such) that we could be united to Christ, but as having, when spiritually dead, been quickened by the power of God into a new order of being corresponding morally to what Christ is as Man in glory. "As is the heavenly such are the heavenly". There is with the Christian an inner and an outer man, and the inner man is that with which the Christian identifies himself before God, and in virtue of which he looks to be clothed upon with his house out of heaven; and even now beholding the Lord's glory he is changed into the same image from glory to glory.
The mystery, as we have seen, makes known how Christ can be Head of a joint body composed of Jew and Gentile; and how Jew and Gentile while still here in flesh can form a joint body of which Christ is Head.
For the realisation of it, one's mind and spirit must of necessity be withdrawn by the power of the Spirit from the individual outward life of the Christian on earth in which Christ is known and confessed as Lord. And farther, the ministry of the mystery fits us for the bond with Christ as Head, and it is in the apprehension of Him thus that we enter fully into the privilege of the assembly and are formed in the affections peculiar to it. Christ loved the assembly and gave Himself for it. We get thus an idea of the assembly in its proper character as the body of Christ, and consequently the temple of God; and understanding the truth of our union with one another in the Spirit, are thus greatly helped in the endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

THE COUNSEL OF GOD
{247}
THE PROMISES
@Genesis 12: 1 - 8; @Genesis 22: 11 - 19
What I desire, beloved friends, to draw your attention to are the two distinct lines which can be seen running through the whole of Scripture: what may be called man's line, that is, the line of man's responsibility; and God's line, that is, the line of God's purpose. I believe there is hardly anything more important to us than to apprehend the distinction between those two lines. And further, to see that our souls are really and practically -- I mean as to their apprehension -- established on the ground of divine purpose. I have thought sometimes of an expression which the apostle used to the Ephesians when leaving them; that he had not "shunned to declare to them all the counsel of God". And I doubt if a greater service in ministry could be rendered to the saints than to transfer them, as to the state of their hearts, from the ground of man to that of divine purpose. I think there is in type an illustration of it in the case of the children of Israel; while they were in Egypt, in the land of judgment, they were, as to their sense of things, on the ground of man's responsibility. They were sheltered from judgment by the blood that was sprinkled on the lintel and on the side posts; but subsequently they were set in movement -- I believe this began with the passover -- and the end of it was they were delivered out of Egypt, brought through the Red Sea, and were in type brought to God, that is, to the apprehension in their souls that they were the objects of divine purpose. If you want the confirmation of it, you have only attentively to read their song when they had passed through the Red Sea. It is all full of purpose: "*Thou* shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance,
{248}
in the place, O Lord, which *thou* hast made for *thee* to dwell in, in the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established". You have only to study that song to see that it is the opening up of the purpose and counsel of God. They were brought to God, and were the figure and type of the soul being really planted on the ground of divine purpose. What makes me speak of it is this, that the vast proportion of Christians in the world have never, as to their practical state, got beyond the ground of responsibility. They have the sense that the work of Christ has met their responsibility -- and they know forgiveness, which is connected clearly with man's responsibility -- but I do not think they are, in their souls, at all on the ground of divine purpose. And the result of it is this, they never break with the world, for the moment a person gets a real apprehension in his soul of divine purpose, he breaks with the world. He is by faith on the ground of God's will.
I say that much by way of introduction; but I want to show you the thought carried through Scripture, and to speak tonight about the beginning of it, and the circumstances, which, in a certain sense, led to the revelation of counsel. I quite admit you cannot talk about circumstances leading to purpose; but circumstances led to the revelation of purpose, and that is what comes out here. Then I want to carry the thought on, if there be an opportunity on future occasions, to what is developed in the New Testament: for the idea of purpose comes out very much more fully in the New Testament than in the Old. You get it in the way of promises in the Old, but in its scope in the New Testament it carries us to eternity and heaven. I do not mean to say that promises have to do with heaven, but everything which God establishes in heaven is *of purpose*. Therefore, to take a succession of things, when I come to the New Testament I find the "better hope", and the "promise of

eternal life", the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the mystery, and the truth of union; all those things are brought out in the New Testament; and every one of them is based on, and all flow out of, the purpose of God. I merely indicate in that way the line which I desire to take. But tonight my thought is just to confine myself to promise; that is, to where we get the first clear and distinct indication of the purpose of God. I do not doubt God had His purpose from the beginning. When we read the Old Testament in the light of the New, we see illustrations of truths of which there was no distinct revelation. For instance, when we see Eve taken out of Adam and brought to Adam, we get a type of the church. So too in Rebekah brought to Isaac, I do not doubt, there is a type of the church. There is no revelation of it, but when we know the truth of these things, we can read these types. They were no good in this way to saints in Old Testament times, but they are good to us. In fact, there is this important point connected with Scripture, that "Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning".
The expression with which Stephen opened his address to the Jews in @Acts 7: "The God of glory", throws a deal of light on God's dealing with Abraham. I believe, beloved friends, that that single expression is pregnant with meaning: "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham". You remember at the close of his address, it is recorded that he "saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God". I believe that a vast deal is comprehended between those two expressions, "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham" and "he saw the glory of God". What it conveys to my mind is this, that Stephen apprehended that, in spite of and even through the perversity of the Jews, God had gained His end; He was the God of glory, and the glory of God was there in Jesus at the right hand of God.
{250}
A wonderful thing! What a grasp of truth Stephen had at that moment! What an illumination he got by the Holy Spirit! The fact is, he was in the truth of his position as a stone in the temple; completely under the power of the Holy Spirit, and the result of it was that he got extraordinary illumination as to Scripture. The test of people is light; that is, if you are in the truth of what you are, in the truth of the temple, as a stone, the effect of it will be that you will get light on the Scripture. Now I believe that the idea of "the God of glory" comes in when things on earth had, so to say, gone to the bad. Then it is that God comes in as One who was cherishing, if I may so say, His own secret purposes, in the accomplishment of which He would be glorified; here in the case of Abraham we get a revelation of purpose; but the purpose existed before. God saw all before Him completely from the foundation of the world, just as eternal purposes existed in the heart of God before the foundation of the world. We were chosen in Christ, it says of Christians, before the foundation of the world. So in regard of everything here upon the earth, I mean as to the disposal of the earth, everything was before the mind of God from the foundation of the earth. You read in the Revelation of those who were written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the slain Lamb. And at the dividing of the earth, God had in view the tribes of Israel. But then purpose is one thing, the revelation of the purpose is another; and the revelation of purpose came out in promise, when, so far as man was concerned, everything on earth had really gone to the bad. That is the first point I want to establish.
One thing which had come to pass here upon earth before God called Abraham was Babel; and Babel means confusion. The principle of Babel was that man would make himself a name; man was going to have renown springing up here on earth. In the
{251}
proper working out of it, Babel really means anti-Christ. I see the working out of it in one or two directions in the Scripture; I see it in popery, in the Babylon of Revelation, and in imperial Babylon. I see the principle of Babel in Nebuchadnezzar, he would make himself a name; there was great Babylon which he had built. If man makes a name for himself, God's name is nowhere. The thought came in very early in the world's history, soon after the flood. What man said was this, nothing is to be withheld from us; we will make a name for ourselves. But what that means in the long run is this, that God is to have no place at all upon earth. So we read in the Thessalonians, that the man of sin opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or is worshipped. There will be no toleration of the name of God, it will not be allowed upon earth. That is the climax of Babylon. Man has taken the place of the Holy Spirit in the ecclesiastical Babylon, there is no place for God there; and in the imperial Babylon, man will have a place and a name.
Another thing comes in in intimate connection with it, and that is idolatry; because we find that in all that state of things, man is not self-supporting; he wants some spiritual power behind to support him, and he gets it. When Nebuchadnezzar made the image of gold, and commanded all the earth to worship it, who can doubt that the devil was behind? It was the grossest form of idolatry, everybody in the empire commanded to bow down to the image of the empire which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. So, too, in the last end of imperial Babylon, man sets himself to be worshipped, in a certain sense takes the place of God here upon earth. Who is behind that? I do not think anyone can doubt. It is like the unclean spirit that, after going out of the man takes to himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and they enter in, and the latter state of that man is worse than the first.
{252}
And so before God called Abraham out, although it does not come out in the history, it is mentioned incidentally afterwards, there was idolatry in Mesopotamia whence Abraham was called. But to my mind the important point is, that Babel was there.
Now, beloved friends, that brings me to Abraham; and I would that I might be enabled to show you the important principles that come out in connection with him, for they are principles of vital moment to every one of us to understand. I believe they are principles which reflect the greatest light upon the character of God Himself, and that is the value of them to me. The real value to my soul of a great part of the Old Testament is, that it gives wonderful light as to what God Himself is. We get instructed in the light of the knowledge of God, and we then feel that certain things must be. Argument in this way is right enough, if you reason down from the settled knowledge in your soul of what God is. Then you can see that certain things must be because of what God is.
Just one word with regard to promise and purpose, because I do not think everyone quite understands the connection between the two. As far as I see, promise is not co-extensive with purpose, because promise in Scripture is, in general, connected with the earth, and purpose goes beyond the earth. All the promises of God are yea and amen in Christ; and we are the heirs of promise, but they relate to the earth and to God's disposal of the earth. We are the heirs of promise, for it speaks in Hebrews of God showing "to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel". What I want to say about the connection is this, that promise is always of counsel. Promise, when unconditional, is the expression of counsel. A conditional promise is different, because a conditional promise involves two parties; but an unconditional promise, such as God gave to Abraham, is the expression of purpose. Nothing can be more important than to bear that in
{253}
mind. The verse I have quoted proves it: "God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath". You could not have any statement more conclusive as showing that the unconditional promise of God is the fruit of counsel. Now what God practically says in the case of Abraham is this: 'I am sovereign, and I intend to have a man; the world is gone to the bad, but I choose My man. And what is more, the earth is My inheritance, and I will dispose of the earth as I see fit'. That is what man will not tolerate; there is nothing that the human heart hates more than the idea of sovereignty on the part of God; but God is sovereign, and purpose exhibits the sovereignty of God, and the sovereignty of God comes to light when in the thoughts of men God had been displaced. God called Abraham (he was to be the progenitor of Christ), and says, "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed". God says, "I will bless"; and what is more, He says, "Unto thy seed will I give this land". Those are two thoughts of the greatest moment to get hold of in connection with God, for our only solid standing ground is the sovereignty of God in blessing and disposing. I do not think any soul has got any real rock to stand upon until it has got to that point, the sovereignty of God in choosing and blessing, and that God will dispose of the earth as He sees fit: and who is going to quarrel with God? If God had not been sovereign and had not chosen, there would have been nothing but perfect ruin for the whole world. What would have become of the world if God had not made Himself known in this way? I have read the Psalms lately with very great interest, for I see the point of conflict in them is whether the man of the earth or God's man is to possess the earth. There was God's man, David pretty generally, and he knew that he was the man of God's choice, and the question was whether the man of God's choice was to
{254}
possess the earth. It is a point of vital moment to every one of us; who is going to have the day, man or God? There would be no blessing for any one of us if God had not made Himself known in sovereignty. He says, I choose a man and I will bless him, but in blessing I am sovereign. More than that, God claims, and claims righteously, the title to dispose of the earth as He sees fit. I have no doubt at all that man at the bottom of his heart quarrels with the sovereignty of God, and with the right of God to dispose of the earth as He will; but God will do it.
I have spoken so far on God's side; but now I want to speak on Abraham's side. The principle which marked Abraham, the one simple principle which has obtained ever with the true people of God is this -- faith. It is in that way Abraham comes before us, as the expression of faith. If one may so say -- though I do not like the term altogether, but I daresay it will not be misunderstood -- the one virtue of Abraham was faith; and it is a principle of great importance, because its practical effect is that it links the heart of the believer with God until God establishes His purpose, and at the same time separates it from the world; he believed God and his faith separated him from the world and from kindred; God was the first thing with him.
Now all these are points of great moment when you come to the proper relations of the soul with God, because the soul has to accept the truth that God is sovereign. The world has rejected Christ, Satan is its god and prince, but God is sovereign in blessing and choosing, and we have to accept it. I say unhesitatingly to everybody here tonight, that God would have you believe in Him, in the sovereignty of His purpose to bless, and would have your heart linked by faith with Himself, and separated thus from the course of this evil world. I could bring you plenty of examples of this effect of faith, but you have only to study chapter 11 of the epistle to the Hebrews for yourselves,
{255}
and you will see the great and blessed principle of faith running through the world's history, through the line of the witnesses in that chapter. The effect of it was always to connect the heart with God, and with what I may call God's world, that is, the world to come; they waited for the coming of the Lord. I have been instructed by what was said to the prophet Habakkuk. If it tarry, wait for it, it will surely come. And what is to characterise us, during the little while? "The just shall live by his faith". There is the principle. Faith is the principle of life in the soul with God, and for that reason will separate you from the course of this present world.
And, beloved friends, there was another thing which I have before noted, that Abraham was to be the progenitor of Christ, for Christ must come in; for if God was determined to bless, and to dispose of the earth as He pleased; there was that resting upon man here which must first be set aside by the judgment of God. Death and the power of Satan rested upon man, and all that must be removed before God could accomplish His purposes. They were things which could not be effected in Abraham, he could not remove the judgment of God, he could not free himself of death, nor bring in resurrection, and put aside the power of the devil here. Therefore, in @Genesis 22, Abraham's seed comes in to do what could not be done in Abraham. The sovereignty of God, and God's right to dispose of the earth as He pleased, and faith; all these principles come out in Abraham, but for the removal of the judgment which lay upon man, and the breaking of the power of the enemy, we must look to another than Abraham, and we get that in the promised seed, that is in the true Isaac. For everybody who understands anything at all about Scripture knows that Isaac is a type of a risen Christ. Abraham received Isaac in figure raised again from the dead. In Isaac typically I see Christ offered up in sacrifice to remove
{256}
the judgment of death which lay upon man, and to break the power of the enemy. That is the wonderful thing which comes to light in the promised seed. Abraham had to learn in some measure, though I do not know how far he learnt it intelligently, that his seed must pass through death into resurrection, in order that the judgment which lay upon man might be set aside. How could there be blessing for man upon earth, or how could you have eternal life upon earth, if the judgment of death were not set aside? How could God bless according to His own heart if the judgment of death were resting upon man? The fact is, we lose sight a great deal too much of the fact that death rests upon man as the present judgment of God. Most people have the idea of judgment to come, but they commonly lose sight of the truth that the wrath of God abides upon man, and death as the judgment of God upon sin. "By one man sin entered into the world and death by sin"; and death is resting upon man's body. I often think of it in regard to a Christian. What Christ came to do was to relieve man of the judgment which rested upon his body. There is a beautiful illustration of it in the ten lepers; Christ relieved them of the judgment which was upon their bodies; nine went their way, insensible to the benefit in large measure, but the tenth came and fell down at the feet of Jesus, giving Him thanks, and he gave glory to God. He was relieved of the leprosy resting upon his body. So it is with the believer; I am relieved of the judgment which lay upon my body, and the proof of it is, that the Holy Spirit dwells in me.
In the millennium, in the kingdom in glory to which the promises point, men will be literally relieved of the judgment of death lying upon them, and they will enjoy eternal life here upon earth because they are so relieved. It says, "There (in Zion) he commanded the blessing, even life for evermore". Man will be blessed in Abraham and the true David. Another
{257}
thing will take place, the power of the enemy will be broken; because, if man is no longer under judgment as to his body, the enemy no longer has the power of death. The two things must go together. When the children of Israel were brought through the Red Sea, the Egyptians were seen drowned in the Red Sea; the people were brought to God, but the Egyptians were destroyed. This is the great importance of @Genesis 22. What a wonderful book the word of God is, when you get an apprehension of purpose! In what a striking way are these dealings of God brought before us in type and shadow! And these divine dealings with Abraham all springing from the counsel of God; and then the truth comes out in @Genesis 22 of how God would effect His purposes in Isaac; and therefore we have in that chapter the confirmation of the promise. In chapter 12 it is, "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed"; in chapter 22 it is, "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed". It had to be really in the seed, and hence it is of the greatest moment to see that the true seed of Abraham was Christ; that God's blessed Son was to become man, the true seed of Abraham after the flesh, in order that He might by death remove the judgment that lay upon man, and break the power of the enemy for ever. Blessed be God it is done, and no more remains to be done. Christ has appeared once in the end of the world, "to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself"; He has accomplished God's will. The veil has been rent from the top to the bottom; God has come out; the distance between God and man has been completely removed in the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ; and so true is it now to the believer, that his body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. You could not have a greater or more distinct proof of the fact that you are free from judgment before God than this, that your body is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and is a member of Christ.
{258}
One word more. The promises to Abraham, although they were the expression of divine purpose, do not, I think, go beyond the kingdom. What is said in regard to Abraham is that "he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God", and that he sought "a better, that is a heavenly, country". But Scripture never tells us that he found them. That he will find them I do not doubt for a moment; but Scripture does say, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day" -- that is, Messiah's day -- "and he saw it and was glad". Something at all events was unfolded to him of the glory of the Lord's day, the kingdom. And I think the promises to Abraham will all be made good in the kingdom. When we come to the New Testament I do not doubt at all that the purpose of God goes beyond what was uttered to Abraham, because there we get Christ in glory, and the church, His body, and other truths, all of which are really the working out of divine purpose.
Now I want to pass on to show you how in the immediate posterity of Abraham we get further light as to the development of purpose. Isaac has a very singular place in Scripture. I have heard it pointed out, and do not doubt the truth of it, that Isaac represents in Scripture the heavenly man; and the moral reason of it is that in type he was raised again from the dead. Then again Rebekah was brought to him, which we can see now to be a type of the church united to Christ in the time when Christ is hid, so to say, from the world. Rebekah was brought to Isaac, and Isaac was comforted after the loss of his mother. When the natural links were broken, Rebekah is brought in. So with Christ, when the links after the flesh were broken with His beloved people, the church is brought to Him in glory. You thus get in Rebekah the idea of the church united to Christ in the time when He is separated from His people, when that link is broken.
{259}
I remember hearing it pointed out some years ago, that Isaac had continual contention with the Philistines, and his work was to unstop the wells which his father Abraham digged and the Philistines had filled up. And that is pretty much the work of the heavenly man upon earth, unstopping the wells; that is, there are the wells here, the wells of refreshment, and the work of the Philistines, who were intruders in God's land, is to stop them up, while the work of the heavenly man is to unstop the wells. That is a very simple work to do; it is not even to dig them, but to unstop them. If we speak of the present moment, the truth is out, but there is always a tendency to bury it again, to stop up the wells. The great thing is to unstop them, so that the people of God may get the benefit of the springing water, truth in its application to the moment.
One word more in regard to the posterity of Abraham. I have spoken about Isaac, and what I think Isaac represents to us in connection with Rebekah; but I come now to Jacob for a moment. Jacob represents to us the head of the earthly people, and Christ is to rule over the house of Jacob for ever. It is Jacob's house. And then in connection with Jacob we get the twelve heads of the tribes; so that you see what an opening up of truth you have in type and shadow. In Abraham you get the sovereignty of God and His determinate counsel to bless, and His claim to dispose of the earth as He will, and faith on the part of Abraham which has to wait till the time of promise came. Then in the seed of Abraham, you get first in Isaac the type of Christ separated from His natural kindred, and the church brought to Him during that time. Then in Jacob the head of the earthly family, the earthly house, and the twelve tribes, so that in these three patriarchs, these three men to whom promises were made (because they are all included in that), you get the unfolding of the purpose
{260}
of God in its due order. All the promises were the expression of divine purpose.
And I think it is very blessed to see how God was above all the evil which had come into the world. We see the evil fast ripening; we are not in the days of the beginning of it; there is nothing new under the sun, and what we see at work in the world is only the ripening of the principles which we get in the book of Genesis, whether for good or bad. As has often been said, you get roots in Genesis, and in Revelation you get the fruits. We are going towards the end of things; but the blessed thing for us to know is that God is above all; nothing has affected the determinate purpose of God to bless, and God has His own principles and ways of blessing. What we have to do in the meantime is to wait in faith. "The just shall live by faith"; that is the great principle now, waiting for the coming of the Lord, and the introduction of the world to come which is put under Christ.
Just one word more. The point with the Christian is, as I understand it, that we anticipate the world to come. And shall I tell you how? It is very simple. We are under the Lord, and in the light; no longer in darkness, but in the light. If you study Romans attentively, you will see how it introduces the believer into the blessings of the kingdom. You have got Christ as Lord; you believe in God who raised Christ again from the dead; as in type and shadow Isaac was raised, so Christ is raised in the power of the Holy Spirit; the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in those who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit. Individually, in a spiritual sense, the Christian has the blessings of the kingdom; he anticipates the world to come; and the practical effect is, that he is separated from the present world; because you may depend upon it nothing more effectually separates a man from the present world than to be subject in his heart to the Lord. If you confess, with
{261}
your mouth, Jesus as Lord, the practical effect will be to separate you from this present evil world; because I defy any thoughtful Christian to connect the name of the Lord with this world. The principle is, "Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity"; and therefore I say, as subject to the Lord, as under the Lord, as believing in God who raised up Christ, and as indwelt by the Holy Spirit and led of the Spirit, the Christian, in his individual path, anticipates and has got the blessings of the kingdom; only, as I said before, not in an outward, but in a spiritual way. Romans, as has often been pointed out, never goes beyond the individual path of the Christian, and the principle that prevails all through the epistle to the Romans is, that Christ is Lord. "To this end Christ both died and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living". But then if Christ is Lord to me -- and thank God, He is so to me and to every Christian, too -- I am free of judgment, my soul is connected with His authority and with the world to come, and I am delivered from the present world. I am free of judgment, so that I can be indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and the enemy has in consequence lost power and authority over my soul. Therefore it says, in @Romans 12, yield your body to God a living sacrifice, which is your reasonable service. It can be rendered up to God a living sacrifice, in which to prove the will of God, so that, as I said before, in Romans in anticipation the Christian gets the benefits and blessings of the kingdom.
Then there is another thing, he is a son of Abraham, because he is on the principle of faith. He is heir according to promise, that is, when the promises actually get their fulfilment in the time of Christ's public glory, then we shall inherit with Christ. "If children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ".
My object tonight was as simple as could be, to
{262}
seek to establish every soul here, by the grace of God, on the ground of divine counsel. That is the only solid standing-ground for your feet; and I say that divine counsel is infinitely blessed, and that God's ways according to His counsel are right and righteous; that God did not intervene in sovereignty in that way until the world had become idolatrous and man sought to make a name for himself. We have to face these things, and that is firm ground to be upon. The more you look into it, the more you will see that; and I say you are upon it if you are really Christians, and I trust everybody I am speaking to is. If you are really a Christian, and subject in your soul to the Lord, and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, you are upon that ground, and are in faith waiting for the coming of the Lord. I can say for myself, truly and honestly, as to the state of my soul, I get at a greater and greater distance from the course of things down here. The scene which is around me here is man's world or Satan's world, and my soul recoils from it more and more. I get at a greater distance from all its ways and principles, and I get nearer and nearer to that "world to come", of which Christ is the Head. It is the blessed path of a Christian, "Now is our salvation nearer than when we believed". Faith is a most wonderful principle in two ways, as connecting the soul with God and God's things and God's world, "the world to come", and, on the other hand, separating it morally from the course of this present evil world.
May God give to us a greater insight into His counsel. Can you conceive a more gracious expression than that: "God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath"? What for? "That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie" -- what? -- "we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us". Who would not
{263}
value "a strong consolation"? "That we might have a strong consolation" -- because we have got the word and the oath, two "immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie". May God give to every one here tonight to see the rightness and righteousness of His way, and to have your souls solidly settled on the ground of divine counsel. Everything connected with your responsibility and mine has been met by the work of the Lord Jesus Christ; but in order that He might plant us on the ground of divine counsel where He would have us. Everything is sovereign there. May God give us to accept it more and more through grace.
{264}
THE BETTER HOPE
@Hebrews 6: 10 - 20; @Hebrews 1: 1 - 14
I indicated, beloved friends, last week the line on which I desired to speak. I wanted to show, as the Lord might enable me, the unfolding of divine purpose in Scripture. It is a subject of very great interest, and the more so on account of the great importance that the souls of saints should be really set on the ground of divine purpose. It is what God was doing in regard to Peter in @Matthew 16. Peter had believed in Christ, he had accepted Him -- he was an apostle, but what was revealed to him by the Father was a truth which he had not yet known in regard to Christ, that is, the Father revealed to Peter the true glory of the Person of the Lord. But there was another thing in connection with it. The Lord says to Peter, "Thou art Peter". The name 'Peter' indicated what Peter was; it confirmed Peter's soul in what he was according to the counsel of God; outside of his position in the flesh, even as a Jew who had received Christ. We read in @John 1 that the Lord had already changed his name, He had told him he was to be called Peter; but in @Matthew 16, the Lord appears to confirm it to him in connection with the revelation which Peter received from the Father. So that I apprehend that what was going on in regard to Peter was that his soul was being led into the truth of what he was, not after the flesh, but according to the counsel of God. I do not understand that there is any force in the expression "a stone" (which 'Peter' means) except in connection with a structure. A rock is a foundation on which a structure is built, but a stone is for the structure, and that is what Peter was. "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock" -- the confession of Christ Himself as the Son of the living God -- "I will build my assembly".
{265}
Beyond doubt that is a structure; the assembly is a structure. There is a great difference between a congregation and a structure. Israel was accustomed to the idea of a congregation, but not of a structure, except in a material sense; they had a material temple, but not a structure composed of living stones. They were Jehovah's congregation; but I do not think they understood the idea of a structure. That is what the Lord reveals to Peter, that He was going to build a structure composed of living stones, of whom Peter was a sample.
Last time I sought to bring before you the completely new departure in God's ways which took place in the calling out of Abraham. It is marked by what Stephen says in the beginning of his defence to the Jews in @Acts 7: "The God of glory". We do not, I think, find that name applied to God in the Old Testament, except in @Psalm 29: 3, but Stephen, by the Spirit of God says, "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham". I have no doubt that is an expression which has reference to divine purpose. Then I sought to bring before you the incontestable truth that promise is the expression of purpose; it must be so, and hence it says in @Hebrews 6, "God, willing to shew to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel". Promise is the outcome of counsel where promise is unconditional. Do you think that God is ever baffled or taken aback? Do you think the condition of the world when God called Abraham, had, so to say, confounded God? Not a bit of it. It is true that God felt it, but He had divine resources above any emergency, and therefore He comes out to Abraham as the God of glory, and makes unconditional promises, having reference, I do not doubt, to the world to come. They had a sort of fulfilment in this world, but they really had reference to the world to come, and will be fulfilled in it. Therefore Abraham died in faith; he had not received
{266}
the promises; though he received Isaac; but he was "persuaded of them, and embraced them", he got an indication of divine purpose; and had the world to come in view. The Lord says of Abraham, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad". The heart of Abraham was gladdened by a view of Messiah's day; but, "these all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth". The revelation to them of the promises had a great effect upon them. It was not only that they took up truth and held it, but the truth which they held had the greatest influence upon their conduct here; it made them strangers and pilgrims upon earth. It has been said of Abraham, that he comes before us in the Scripture as a heavenly man; for there were two things which marked him, the tent and the altar. He had no possession except a burying place upon earth. He was a dweller in a tent; he had not a city, but looked for one; he was a pilgrim and a wanderer. He had a tent, and he had an altar, a place of communion.
But I want to turn your attention to another point, and I look to the Lord for present grace to make it plain to you. What I desire to bring before you tonight is the "better hope". I do not think the idea of the "better hope" is found in the Old Testament; it is a new thing come out. It could hardly come out in the ways of God until Christ, having been rejected from earth, was glorified in heaven. I want to give you an idea of what this better hope is, and to show how it is based on divine purpose. It is no afterthought; there cannot possibly be such a thing as an afterthought with God. God may work out His ways through the wickedness of man, and He waits for man. You find in Scripture continually, God waiting in order that responsibility may be filled up. For
{267}
instance, Abraham's seed after the flesh could not inherit the land, because the iniquity of the Amorites was not yet full. God waited, and they had to wait more than four hundred years. So God works out His ways through the wickedness of man; but still everything that God works out is the outcome and expression of counsel. In the working out of divine counsel the wisdom of God is displayed, and the results will be to God's eternal glory. If you would know divine wisdom, Christ is the wisdom of God, because Christ is the One in whom God works out His counsels.
I would say a word about the interval between Abraham and Christ. It appears a long interval, during which God was not working out counsel, but in infinite wisdom, dealing with the seed of Abraham after the flesh on the footing of responsibility; and, therefore, law came in when they were delivered out of Egypt. I think, up to that point, it was counsel, but in receiving the law, the conditions were changed, and the enjoyment of the land depended upon the obedience of the people. All that went on until the seed came, they were under law. It was, as we should say, a period of probation, to see whether they could really stand with God on the footing of the law. I need not go into it, but it ended in the rejection of Christ. It has often been said that they not only broke the law, became idolaters, and persecuted the prophets, but when Christ came to them with the promises (for He was the vessel of promise), they rejected Christ, and in rejecting Christ they rejected the promises, and there was an end of all hope for man on the footing of his responsibility. On the footing of law, all was completely over; and they had forfeited all, so far as man's responsibility was concerned, in rejecting Christ. The leaders recognised in a kind of way that Christ was the heir; they had an idea of who Christ was on account of the testimony which He gave, though
{268}
there was blindness and ignorance mixed up with it; but still the thought of the husbandmen was, "This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance". And in casting out God's Son and crucifying Him, there was a clean end of every hope for the people and for man after the flesh; all was over on that ground.
But then it was that God reverted to purpose; He went back to what I may call the ground of Abraham. It is a very interesting point in @Hebrews 6, that you find God has gone back to the promises and the oath. The whole period of law which had intervened was, in a sense, a blank or worse than a blank; and what I want to show you is, that the better hope of which the apostle speaks in this chapter is really founded, like promises, on the purpose of God. The Jews, in crucifying Christ, little knew what they were doing. There was one fact in connection with the Lord of which they were totally ignorant, and that is, that He had positively come down here to die. They crucified Him "with wicked hands", but He was "delivered", we are told, "by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God". He had come here to do the will of God, and the will of God involved the offering up of Himself. As we find in chapter 10 of this epistle, He takes away all the offerings which were offered under the law, and He comes to establish the will of God; "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God"; that is, in the work of the Lord Jesus Christ, the will of God, the pleasure of God, was accomplished, and God was completely glorified.
Then comes another thing, that the One who came to do God's will, enters as man into a position suited to what He was, in the dignity of His Person. Beloved friends, it appears to me impossible that Christ could abide here after the flesh. There was nothing morally incongruous, but it was a condition of humiliation in which it was not at all according to the purpose of
{269}
God that He should remain. He entered upon that condition, He partook of blood and flesh, was made in all things like to His brethren for a certain definite purpose, that He "might taste death for everything". But the result of it is that God has been glorified, and that Christ has, as man, entered into a position suited to the glory of His Person. That is brought out in @Hebrews 1. That chapter presents to us the greatness of His Person; He is God's Son, and is called to sit at God's right hand until "I make thine enemies thy footstool". Who but a divine person could have taken a place at the right hand of God? What angel could? The apostle speaks of angels because they are the highest of creatures; but to what angel said God, "Sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool?" It is a man that sits at the right hand of God; but the very fact of His sitting there is as strong a proof as you could possibly have that He is a divine Person. And further in @Hebrews 1 we read: "When he had by himself purged our sins, he *sat himself down* at the right hand" of God. In chapter 2, where He is looked at as Son of man, and as the head and vessel of God's purposes, then He is spoken of as "*crowned* with glory and honour". When He was down here, and Peter confessed Him as the Son of the living God, the Lord said, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven". Peter did not know it even by association with Christ after the flesh, he did not really know the glory of His Person apart from the Father's revelation. But anyone now, who apprehends the position in which Christ sits as Man, has divine proof of the glory of His Person.
There were great things in the mind and purpose of God to be effected in Christ. Redemption was to be accomplished here; sin to be put away by the sacrifice of Christ. He has appeared once in the end of the world to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself;
{270}
but being raised again from the dead, He enters as Man on a place which was according to eternal counsel, "being made so much better than the angels, as he hath, by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they". When one thinks of the Lord Jesus on earth, He was revealed as Son of Abraham, Son of David, the true Messiah, the hope of Israel. But when we think about Him at the right hand of God, we see One who is declared to be the Son of God; One highly exalted above all principality and power, that He might fill all things, but exalted according to eternal counsel; because it was of eternal counsel that everything should be put under the Son of man. I think @Psalm 8 is sufficient proof of it, "What is man, that thou art mindful of him; or the Son of man, that thou visitest him?" Two persons are referred to in that Psalm, "man" and "the Son of man". Adam was man, but Adam was not the Son of man; the Son of man has reference to the Lord Himself, He is the Son of man.
Now I go on to the next point, and that is, Christ was not to be alone in heavenly glory. He is at the right hand of God alone, because that is a position which is personal to Himself; but He was not to be a Man in heaven alone. And we, perhaps, get the idea of it even in @Hebrews 1, God has anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His companions. Exalted as He is as Son of man, the great truth comes out that He is to have companions. In the Old Testament you can find a great deal which relates to the sufferings of Christ, and to the resurrection, and even to His glory, but the New Testament teaches us that Christ in glory is to be the first-born among many brethren.
Look at @Romans 8: 28 - 30: "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he
{271}
might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified". I think what I have said is, in the presence of this scripture, incontestable. In the wisdom and grace of God, Christ was not to be in glory alone. He should have companions in glory, with the object that God "might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus". My conviction is that we shall be very much astonished in many ways when we arrive at glory; we shall be surprised at the extent and character of the kindness which will be lavished upon the saints there.
There is a far greater development of counsel in the New Testament than in the Old. The apostle Paul said to the Ephesians that he had not shunned to declare to them all the counsel of God. The first principle is this, that man in the Person of Christ is in glory on the ground of accomplished redemption; sin having been put away from before God, and God glorified, and that He is not to be alone there, but the firstborn among many brethren.
There is a similar expression, "many", in @Hebrews 2: "It became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings". That is the line on which God is operating at the present time. It is not introducing blessing into the world; the day will come for that. It is not the time for the manifestation of the glory of Christ; but God is "bringing many sons unto glory". It is a point of all moment to apprehend: I would I could bring it home to every soul tonight; and that it is entirely outside and beyond what we are by nature and after the flesh. Scripture speaks of the glory of the children of God, but very few Christians really get a right idea of their glory. I say I have my glory.
{272}
And what is it? My glory is not what I am outwardly in the world, but what I am with God. Withdrawn from what I am outwardly in the world, I enter into what I am with God according to His counsel, that is, that I am a son of God, a son whom God is bringing to glory. It is a great thing to enter into your glory, but you must in faith be withdrawn from your outward circumstances here in the world. That is what the Spirit of God will do for you.
I have no doubt that God, in infinite wisdom, has placed us in certain positions here; but our place in the world had nothing in itself to do with the counsel and purpose of God, because God purposed us for entirely another position and another order of being, predestinated us "to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren".
Now, beloved friends, I want to go on to the "better hope", because that is the point I desire to make plain to you tonight. The Hebrews had accepted the "better hope". I do not think they understood very much what it meant, but they had "fled for refuge", that is what we read, "to lay hold upon the hope set before us". Let me bring your attention back for a moment to the position of the Hebrews before they were converted. In rejecting Christ, the Jews evidently had lost all after the flesh; there was an entire break between God and the Jews. But God virtually says to them, 'Well, you have crucified Christ with wicked hands, but He was delivered by My determinate counsel and foreknowledge. I have accomplished My purpose. You have lost everything on your footing as men upon earth, but I open to you an entirely new door upon the ground of My counsel. I present to you the result of accomplished redemption. Christ is in glory, and I invite you to enter in at that door, and to flee thus for refuge, because there is no hope for you in connection with the earth, to flee for refuge and
{273}
to enter in at the door of purpose. I invite you to accept in faith this ground, that I am bringing many sons unto glory, and to lay hold of the better hope'. That is virtually, as it appears to me, what God said to the Jews. It is a wonderful triumph of the grace of God. And I will tell you the reason of it, because God was working, not, so to speak, from the guilt of the Jews, but from the death of Christ. He had been completely glorified, redemption was accomplished, and God was working on that basis. And when God comes out in the riches of His grace, He begins with the Jew.
I have no doubt at all that the "better hope" refers to conformity to Christ in glory; and those converted had to travel that road. Many of the Hebrews had accepted it; and if they were not up to it in their souls, still they had accepted the "better hope" in accepting the testimony of Christ in glory. And I think that is the position of many souls now; they have accepted the testimony of Christ in glory, but I very much doubt whether they are really in the apprehension of the bearing of it. When I see Christians eager to make the best of this world, it does not appear to me much as if they had really apprehended the "better hope", and were established on the ground of divine purpose, that God is bringing many sons unto glory. If I had a true sense of that in my soul, you may depend upon it I should sit light to everything here. Not but what I would by the grace of God be faithful in every circle here; but things would sit upon me lightly if I really laid hold of what God is doing at the present moment, bringing many sons unto glory, and Christ the pattern of what we are to be, that "as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly". If that took possession of anyone's thoughts, I do not think present things would have much influence over them. They would enjoy soul salvation.
{274}
With regard to the Hebrews, the practical result of it was this, that by the very fact of becoming companions of Christ they became "heirs of promise", that is, they were really of Christ; as the apostle says, "He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified, are all of one". As Christ's they became heirs of the promises, and therefore the promises made to Abraham belonged to them. And that is how the apostle takes them up in chapter 6. Who are heirs of promise? Not Jews; they are put aside for the time being. Christians are the heirs of promise. Therefore the apostle says, "God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath". What for? "That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us". The hope was never set before Abraham; what I read about Abraham is that he sought a better, that is a heavenly country, but the hope was never definitely set before him of being the companion of Christ in glory. That is the hope set before us; and it is we that have that hope who are to get the "strong consolation" that flows from the "two immutable things". Beloved friends, have you got that "strong consolation"? Is your soul settled on the ground of divine purpose? When God makes the promise that is founded on purpose He confirms it with an oath.
An oath is a most interesting thing in Scripture, for when you find a real indication of divine purpose you will generally find it confirmed with an oath. For instance, "The Lord hath sworn and will not repent. Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec". Aaron was never made a priest with an oath, but Christ is made a priest with an oath after the order of Melchisedec, because He is priest according to purpose.
{275}
If you want to get your soul thoroughly established, you have only to get into the region of purpose. I ask anyone here tonight, how do you read Scripture? Do you read it simply to get gospel statements out of it? I do not think you will get much confirmation of soul if you do. Read Scripture with the thought of your soul entering into divine counsel, and then I think you will get "strong consolation". You will see what it is God can confirm with an oath. Anything which depends partly upon God and partly upon man, God will not confirm with an oath. That which depends upon Himself God confirms with an oath, and it is that we might have a "strong consolation". Mark the grace of God, that we might have not only consolation, but "a strong consolation". I have often thought of a beautiful expression in the Romans, "that we by patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope". So, too, here, "strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us".
Now I want to show you the way in which we get the good of the hope. It is a very important thing to see the place of faith in regard to hope. The place of faith is this, it substantiates hope. What that means is that you get the present good of hope. "Faith is the substantiation of things hoped for", and in that sense hope has to precede faith. There is this difference between Romans and Hebrews; the point in Romans is the principle on which a man is justified; but in Hebrews the point is the principle on which the just man is to "live", that is "by faith". Now the principle is that faith substantiates hope. If you have got the "better hope", if it has got a real hold upon your soul, if you apprehend the line on which God is leading you, that you are to be "conformed to the image of his Son", then by faith you will get the present good of it.
I will show you two things in which you will get it:
{276}
the first is, you will apprehend that you are of the kindred of Christ, the kindred of the Priest after the order of Melchisedec. As Aaron's sons were of the kindred of Aaron, so Christians are the kindred of Christ; "He who sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one"; and that is not only what you will be in heaven, but what you are upon earth. The other thing is, that as the kindred of the Priest you have "boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus"; all the grace of God's presence is laid open to those who are sanctified, "by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all". The blessed grace of God's presence is open to those who are of the kindred of the High Priest. That is your privilege. I ask every soul here tonight, How much do you and I really know the grace of God's presence? We go in "by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh". There is no veil between God and us, the Son has given to us the liberty of that holy and blessed presence of God where Christ Himself is; you have "boldness to enter into the holiest".
But there is one word more. As the consequence of that, of necessity you must accept death to the world. It is an old saying in regard to the Hebrews, 'inside the veil involves outside the camp'. You cannot take up the position of a Jew upon earth, because the way through the veil is not, and never will be, open to them; but if you go through the veil, that is, if you have real priestly privilege as sanctified by Jesus Christ, you must accept the place of death to the world; you cannot separate the two. If you have heavenly portion and privilege, "boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus", the other must follow, that you accept the position of death to the world and the whole course of religious man here upon the earth. That is what the Spirit
{277}
of God had to teach these Hebrews, because they were attempting to combine the two things, Christian privilege with the Jewish system, and the Spirit of God is pressing upon them that they really did not know the true character of one or the other.
It is a terrible lesson to have to learn, that "in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing"; but if I have apprehended that, I do not care to take up any position here as a man on earth. If I am morally and radically bad, it is not much good to claim any position here. But I have a wonderful position in divine grace, a companion of Christ, sanctified by His offering; and not only that, but He has given me the power to support me in the wonderful position which grace has given me. It is no use having life if you have not the substance to support life. The Christian has both. The substance is faith; faith which brings in the power of God to support me in the possession and enjoyment of "the better hope".
My object is, if I can, to help to confirm the souls of the saints of God on the footing of divine purpose. I do not make light of the pathway here, or of the responsibilities connected with it. I have my own responsibilities; but I see that my true privilege and calling before God is outside of them all. It is according to His eternal purpose that I am called to be a companion of Christ in glory, to be conformed to His image; and that is what I want to take possession of my soul, so that my soul treads firmly upon that ground. And then I want to be instructed in the word of divine counsel; that is what I go to Scripture for; I want to get hold of divine wisdom, and to see what the great end is to be in divine glory. The three things -- divine counsel, divine wisdom, and divine glory -- are all on one line; and if you get a glimpse of it, the effect will be immensely to establish and comfort your soul; you will get a "strong consolation"
{278}
by these "two immutable things", God's promise and God's oath.
May God give to us to see that it is our present privilege to enter into the holy presence of the blessed God through the blood of Jesus.
{279}
THE GIFT OF THE SPIRIT AND ETERNAL LIFE
@2 Timothy 1: 1 - 12
In standing here, beloved friends, I am a little disinclined to touch the subject of eternal life; but in taking up such a line as that of divine purpose I have felt that one was, in a sense, compelled to touch upon that subject, that it was, indeed, impossible to avoid it, because it is in Scripture so very distinctly connected with divine purpose; as you read in this chapter, God "hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose". That is, whatever the works of man might be, the grace and purpose of God were in the background, and we are taught that they not only existed, but that they have come to light, that Christ "has annulled death and has brought life and incorruptibility to light by the gospel". Death was the judgment of God upon man, and the power of the enemy. Until death was annulled, both as God's judgment and the enemy's power, the time had not arrived for bringing life and incorruptibility to light; but now they are brought to light by the gospel, God has fallen back upon "His own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus". When there was no question before Him of responsibility, or works, or death, or anything of the kind, the purpose, the promise of life in Christ Jesus, was there.
I have said on previous occasions what should commend itself to any simple Christian, that promise, if unconditional and absolute, such as "the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus", is of necessity with God the expression of purpose; it could not be otherwise, else it must have come in as an afterthought; and I have also spoken of the promises to Abraham; and,
{280}
in connection with the promises, the character in which God presented Himself to Abraham, "the God of glory"; and I have noticed how that Stephen, who uses the title "God of glory", was permitted to see the glory of God, and Jesus at God's right hand. We have seen that the promises to Abraham were confirmed in Abraham's seed, that is, in Christ risen from the dead.
Last week I spoke of "the better hope" as being a question of counsel, seeing that it is in @Hebrews 6 connected with the expression, "God, willing ... to shew to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel" -- the better hope is of the counsel of God, who is "bringing many sons unto glory".
Tonight the thought before me is of eternal life and the gift of the Holy Spirit; not exactly to present these things in themselves, but to show the connection of these truths with the counsel of God, how they have come to light as of God's "purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world was". Of course, that is looking at eternal life in what I may call its highest development; for eternal life is a term of wide import in Scripture. It refers, in the direct bearing of it, to blessing upon the earth; that is evident from the way in which it is first introduced to us in the Old Testament. But Paul shows it to us as connected with heavenly glory; and for that reason carries it back to what was in the purpose of God before the world was, and thus disconnects it from the course of the world altogether.
I referred a moment ago to what comes out in this passage, namely, that life and incorruptibility were not brought to light until death was annulled. That leads me to what I believe to be a very important thought connected with life in Scripture, namely, that it is outside of responsibility, and what responsibility could bring in. I want to make that point very plain to everybody here tonight. It is, I believe, one most
{281}
important idea connected with eternal life in Scripture.
If I go back to Adam, Adam was alive by the breath of God; but we must remember the footing upon which Adam was before God, that of responsibility; and if he failed in his responsibility, death would come in. And, therefore, no one could rightly talk of Adam having eternal life, because everything with him was dependent upon his standing in obedience. "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die". I suppose, if Adam had remained as God created him, he would have lived for ever, for death was not upon him; he was perfect, and death came upon him as the sentence of God when he sinned. "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin". This much was proved, that innocence could not stand against the tempter. God put man on the footing of responsibility, with a command, and a penalty if he transgressed, and the penalty came upon him; as it has been said, 'Adam did and died'. I bring this forward, beloved friends, because I think it is a most important point to apprehend in connection with eternal life, that it is outside of responsibility, and therefore of death. As it says in @Romans 6: "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord". The way in which Christians come into life is that they pass "out of death into life". I do not think anyone could rightly talk about having life without knowing what it is to have "passed out of death into life". Christ has "annulled death and has brought life and incorruptibility to light by the gospel". The two things go together.
I desire to touch on the truth of eternal life in three connections -- as presented in the Old Testament, and by John, and by Paul; and my object is two-fold: to show the place which the Holy Spirit in each case has in it, and its connection with the purpose of God. Whether it be for blessing on earth, or in the line in
{282}
which John presents it to us (which is connected with earth really, though it be what is heavenly upon earth), or in the aspect in which Paul speaks of it, as connected with Christ in glory, in every case life is presented to us as of the purpose of God; and therefore (a very important point to remember) outside of responsibility and death. I do not mean to say that we have done with responsibility; we have never done with it so long as we are here upon earth and Christ is absent; but I say you have part in that which is outside of your responsibility. So, too, I am liable to death unless the Lord come; but it is none the less true that I have passed out of death into life. There is an expression in Scripture which confirms it to me, and that is "the glory of the children of God". Our glory is, that in the power of the Holy Spirit we are with God outside of what is connected with our outward and responsible life here upon earth; and I am sorry for the Christian who does not know something about it. With the Father I am a child, the gift of the Father's love. There are responsibilities flowing from it, that is, to walk consistently with it; but the thing itself is a privilege which in its nature is outside of responsibility. Our outward life down here is not in itself the expression of the privilege which belongs to a Christian, though it is affected and governed by it.
Now, beloved friends, I have so far spoken on the negative side in seeking to show that eternal life, properly speaking, is outside of responsibility, and death, the result in man of responsibility; and everybody here will admit that life is constantly presented in Scripture in contrast to death. When we come to what is more positive, there are three main ideas connected with life, and very important ideas they are, too, which I will try to unfold a little. The first is blessing, the second is character, and the third, power. Now mark this, we have to learn everything from Scripture; it is no good bringing preconceived thoughts to Scripture,
{283}
because that is not subjection to the Spirit of truth nor to the word of God; and I think I can prove to you without any very great difficulty that the three thoughts I have mentioned are connected with life in Scripture.
Take the first distinct mention of eternal life in Scripture, in @Psalm 133, which I turn to at this moment simply for the purpose of speaking of eternal life as blessing. In the third verse we read: "For there Jehovah commanded the blessing, even life for evermore". I think I am justified in saying that Scripture presents eternal life to us as blessing. Again, in @Psalm 21, where it is said of the king: "He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever". It is really the answer in blessing which God gave to the sufferings and death of Christ. He is installed as the great Head and source of blessing for ever and ever.
Then, too, with regard to character -- for in working the subject out in its various connections, I will show you how these three thoughts come in -- I give you one passage, "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body". By the word 'life' in this passage I understand the character of Jesus, what He was morally here upon earth; and that is to be manifest in the mortal body of a Christian. But as we shall see presently, there is a further thought connected with it. Character is intimately connected with being; that is, character is the expression of what a person is in his moral being. He that doeth righteousness *is righteous*, even as He is righteous.
Then there is the third main idea, and that is power. And what I gather from that is "If Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness". "The Spirit is life", that is, I judge, the thought of power. Power in the Christian is connected with the Holy Spirit, for he has
{284}
not one atom of spiritual power in himself, and therefore the scripture goes as far as to say, "The Spirit is life"; that is, potentially. If you speak of blessing, the blessing to us is sonship; if you speak of character, the character is Christ in us; but if you speak of power, the power is the Holy Spirit. So the apostle says to the Galatians, "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit". I want you to bear these three very important points in mind -- blessing, character, and power -- because you will see how they appear in each connection in which eternal life is presented to us in Scripture.
Now, beloved friends, I desire first to touch on the truth of eternal life as predicted in the Old Testament, in connection with the world to come, the millennium; then on the way John presents it to us, and afterwards as revealed to us through Paul in connection with Christ in glory. Of course, the last two are very intimately connected, because they have their application to the same body of people, to Christians; we have part in the truth as presented by John, and in the truth as presented by Paul. I will show you presently the contrast between the two last; but I may just say that, in general, in John life is presented to us in the present; with Paul it is presented to us in full result in Christ.
To refer again to @Psalm 133: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there Jehovah commanded the blessing, even life for evermore". Now, beloved friends, my conviction is that you find the three thoughts I have referred to in that Psalm: blessing, character, and power. There is no doubt the Psalm is prophetic; it refers to what will be made good here
{285}
upon earth in the world to come, the millennium. It is the last Psalm but one, you will notice, of what are called the Songs of Degrees; they are a kind of supplementary Psalms, which lead right away in thought from the people in the sense of distance and woe to the full result in blessing and unity in Zion. You will observe that it is "the mountains of Zion" where God "commanded the blessing". Do you know what Zion represents in Scripture? Zion is the "city of the great King"; nothing on earth can be compared to Zion. Mount Sinai is contrasted with it in Hebrews; but nothing can be compared to Zion, because of what is connected with it in the ways of God. Zion is the place of God's choice. God refused Shiloh, and there was not found a place for the ark until it was brought to mount Zion. The ark had been delivered into captivity; as it says, "He delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand"; but "He smote his enemies in the hinder parts, he put them to a perpetual reproach", and brought back the ark. But by whom? By David, the man of His choice. He rejected Ephraim, and chose Judah; He rejected Saul, and chose David. The great beauty of Zion is its moral connection; it is the witness of the long-suffering faithfulness of God. When His people had forfeited everything by their conduct, God brought back the ark. Never was a more disastrous step taken than to carry the ark into battle. It was making a god of the ark. And the people lost it. God knew how to recover it, and He did; but it was with no honour to the people. They had lost all; they had, so to say, nothing without the ark; but God brought it back to mount Zion, and then David led the song: "Give thanks unto Jehovah, for he is good, for his mercy" -- His loving-kindness it really is -- "endureth for ever".
I think that is quite enough to prove how the thought of this Psalm is connected with the purpose of

God, that is, with the place of God's choice, mount Zion.
The great idea which predominates in @Psalm 133 is blessing: "Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity". They have reached blessing: it refers, I suppose, to the unity of Judah and Israel when they are brought together again upon earth as "one stick". But I think the dwelling together "in unity" gives us also the character in which life becomes manifest. They have got the blessing, and what marks them is that the jealousies, the contentions, and divisions which formerly existed are completely set aside. Then you find also the third idea, and that is power. It is like the oil, "the precious ointment", for their dwelling together is the effect of the influence and power upon them of the Holy Spirit, which flows from the true Aaron in glory. And it adds: "There he commanded the blessing, even life for evermore". Thus they will be relieved in that day of death; they will be no longer on the footing of responsibility, because the law will be written in their hearts, and Christ will be present. The first covenant depended upon the conduct of the people, as well as upon the faithfulness of God; the second is the covenant of God's will, and their responsibility having been met, their sins and iniquities are remembered no more.
But I do not want to dwell too much upon scriptures that speak of the blessing of Israel, because after all these have only an indirect bearing on us. I go on to what applies to us more directly, and I turn your attention to two passages in the gospel of John (chapters @John 3: 14 - 17 and @John 4: 13, 14): "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
{287}
but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved". Again, "Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".
Now, in the gospel of John we are struck with this, that it is the intervention of God by His only-begotten Son outside of all dispensation. It is really the coming out of God in the revelation of His love to the world. Therefore, as has been often noticed, in the introduction of the gospel we do not find any genealogy of the Lord traced down from Abraham or David or up to Adam. And another point noticeable in the gospel is, that Christ is commonly presented to us as outside, so to say, of the circumstances of His merely earthly life. He is presented to us by John as with the Father, that is, that morally He was outside the present scene and all connected with it (although He actually had His part in it); and hence John could say in the opening of the gospel: "The word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of an only-begotten with a Father".
And there is another point, namely, that in Christ as "with the Father", was manifested to the disciples the truth of eternal life. As the apostle says, we "shew unto you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us". I do not mean to say but what Christ had His part in responsibility here; that I fully admit; and in truth He came here to die; He was going to give His flesh for the life of the world; but my conviction is that there was manifested to the disciples in Christ what was entirely outside of responsibility and the reach of death, what He was with the Father. They saw the blessing in which as man Christ was with the Father. They saw, too,
{288}
His character, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the blessed traits which came Out in Him; and further, that He was here in the power of life; "In him was life", although that expression really refers more to what is divinely true of Him.
But now I want to come to the application of John to us. If you would get a true idea of eternal life as John presents it, you must take the two passages I read in conjunction; the one gives us what I may call the objective side, and the other is the subjective side, and you must put the two together. The point in @John 3 is the way in which God has come out, and in @John 4 the means by which the believer goes in; for it was not enough simply that God should come out. The way in which God has come out is revealed in the verses I read in @John 3; it is God revealed and acting in the sovereignty of divine love. "God so loved the world". Who besought God to love the world? Love is sovereign; "God so loved the world". Who can say why? No one. All we can do is to accept what Scripture says, that "God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son", He came out in that way in the gift of His Son, and the Son of man has been lifted up, "that whosoever believeth in him might not perish, but have eternal life". I believe that privilege must be commensurate to revelation, and that if God has seen fit to reveal Himself thus in the sovereignty of divine love, He must be known accordingly. God is love; and in His love to the world is the manner and character in which we know God. I think it is a privilege which is peculiar to this moment. Nothing can alter the character of God, but there may be certain things which are prominent in any given moment; and this is such. How do you think Israel will know God in the millennium? As Jehovah in His eternal faithfulness, whose mercy endures for ever. But our privilege is to know God revealed in the greatness of His love to the world. Why must the
{289}
Son of man be lifted up? On account of the condition of man? Quite so; but really on account of the love of God. That is the ground on which it is put, for Jesus adds immediately, "for God so loved the world". In order for the love of God to the world to be adequately expressed and to be made good, it was necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up. I ask all here one simple question, Do you know God in the sovereignty of love? Because what it means is this, God will hold nothing back from those whom He loves. It has often been said that love will do the best it can for its object. And if this is the way in which God has been pleased to come out, there is nothing that He will hold back from the objects of His love. It is a great thing to know God in goodness, but it is a greater thing to know God in love. I think I have an idea of the grace of God, but a very poor one of the love of God.
Now I want to touch on the other side of the truth, that is, the means by which we go in. That is what comes out in chapter 4; the Lord says to the woman of Samaria, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again, but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life". You cannot conceive anything more wonderful than that, that the believer was not only to be relieved but to have, as one might say, a spring in himself. I have no doubt whatever that the allusion is to the Holy Spirit, though not exactly as indwelling us and uniting us to Christ; I think it is the Holy Spirit connected with the believer in the most intimate way; if I might use the expression, speaking reverently, as if the Holy Spirit were mine, that I might use Him in that sense. And I believe it is so; I do not think there is any limit to the use which a believer may make of the power of the Holy Spirit. "The water that I shall give him shall be in
{290}
him, a well of water springing up into eternal life". The idea which it conveys to me is that the office of the Holy Spirit is the ministration of Christ to the soul of the believer on the principle which you find in chapter 6, "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me". The soul eats, and enjoys, and delights in that living bread, in the grace expressed in the Lord Jesus Christ as come down from heaven. The soul lives by Him. Then comes the consequence; there is a well of water springing up into eternal life. It refers to the answer in the believer of affections which spring up in him God-wards by the Spirit. @John 3 gives us the divine side; @John 4 gives us the believer's side. We could not have a sense of the sovereignty of divine love and not respond to it; "He that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God". "We love him because he first loved us"; affections in the power of the Holy Spirit are generated in the believer towards the blessed source of the benefit, the One who has come out in the love presented to us in chapter 3. It is the Spirit of Christ, not exactly the Spirit of God. (I do not mean different in personality, but in aspect.)
I think you will see that the three things of which I have spoken are verified here: that we have blessing, character, and power. The blessing is that we are children. "As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the children of God". And the character is Christ. "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me". And the power is the Spirit of life given of Christ. "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into eternal life". There is the blessed spring and power of affections in the Holy Spirit. I need hardly say, beloved friends, that all begins with God, in the work of the Spirit of God in the soul; a man has to be born again, as we read, "Whosoever loveth is born of God, and knoweth God". But I speak of what are the characteristics of life.
{291}
One word more in regard to the blessing. I turn to @John 17: 3, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ thy sent one". There again is the blessing. It hangs on the truth that we are brought into the place of children. We are set in that place before the Father, and therefore eternal life, in the very nature of it, is with the Father, and the privilege and blessing of it is, "That they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ thy sent one". I have spoken about the character, or in other words the moral being, and also of the power. But on that point I will just refer to @John 20, where the Lord breathes on the disciples, and says, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit". He communicated to them, I do not doubt, what is referred to in chapter 4, the "well of water springing up into eternal life".
I will not dwell further on what comes out in John, but pass on to the thought of life in Paul, and will read three verses in @Ephesians 1, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love; having predestinated us unto sonship by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will". Now, beloved friends, I think you will get great light from this passage on the way in which eternal life belongs to the Christian; not quite as John presents it, though consistent with it, but in connection, in the most distinct way, with the eternal purpose of God. It is that which led me to refer to this passage, because life is presented here, beyond all question, in connection with eternal purpose; He has "chosen us in him before the foundation of the world". What for? "That we should be holy and without blame before him in love". I do not think it can be disputed that what comes out in this passage is totally apart from
{292}
responsibility and every consequence of responsibility. Not but what responsibility has been perfectly met; that comes out afterwards; but what is stated in this verse is wholly outside of it. Now what is the blessing? It is that God has "predestinated us to sonship through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will". There is the full height of the blessing. That is a very different thing from anything which will be conferred upon man on earth in the millennium. This connects itself with heaven; He has "blessed us with an spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ". I have no doubt whatever that sonship, as to the full force of it, is always connected with heaven. It is true the Christian is brought into it before he gets to heaven, for he gets the Spirit of sonship; but the relationship is a relationship which is proper to heavenly places. The word 'son' is used in a sort of figurative way even in regard to Israel; but in the full height of it the idea belongs to heaven.
Beloved friends, what privilege and blessing to be with God and before God, with no shade of distance; not alone to know God Himself in an the grace and love of His being, but to know Him, too, in all the range of divine wisdom; that is what I understand the privilege of sonship to be. That is what we are brought into; as the apostle says in Galatians, "Ye are all the sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus"; we are brought into it in faith now, but in actuality when we get to heaven. In actual condition, and as to the place of it, we are not in it yet; but we are there in a sense because we are united to Christ. Sonship is the blessing.
And now as to the character. He has "chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love". There is the character; not character in the sense in which we sometimes employ the word, but character in the sense of moral being. It is the character which
{293}
is proper to the relationship. And how is that brought about in the believer? You may say it refers to the future, because it is a statement of purpose. I quite admit it. But do you mean to tell me it is not made good in the present? I am convinced it is, and I have no doubt it has been brought about in the believer "by the renewing of the Holy Spirit which he shed on us abundantly". The renewing of the Holy Spirit is one of the characteristics of God's salvation. (See @Titus 3: 5, 6.) The Holy Spirit is in the Christian, forming Christ in us and forming us in Christ. The apostle says to the Galatians, "of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you"; and to the Colossians, of whom he could write, "Christ in you", he adds, "Whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full grown in Christ Jesus". I see Christians getting a little bit here and a little bit there; I know it, too, in my own experience; one time one may make a little advance in the way of holiness, another time in the way of spiritual affections, another time in the way of intelligence; but you want to get everything balanced, because the end is "the measure of the stature of the completeness of Christ". Thus there is the renewing of the Holy Spirit, a new order of moral being of which Christ in glory is the pattern. We begin thus as babes, as everybody will admit; but we are to grow up unto Him in all things who is the Head; Christ is the standard. Gifts are given, "till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the completeness of Christ". The full blessing and privilege of a Christian is sonship; the character is Christ, that is, He has chosen us in Christ before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love. It is a man of a new order, in the truth of which the Christian is formed by the power of the Holy
{294}
Spirit. I need hardly say that the whole work has to begin with God in new birth; but I see also in scripture, "the renewing of the Holy Spirit, which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour".
Now I think you will have seen, in connection with what Paul presents, the three things -- the blessing, the character, and the power. I do not think the sense would be at all complete if you omitted either of those three ideas. It brings us back to what we started with, that God "has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began". Death has been annulled, and life and incorruptibility brought to light by the gospel.
I just desired to show you the truth of life connected in every case with Christ, for even the blessing in Zion is entirely dependent upon the presence of Christ. I believe saints in that day will be very conscious that they are indebted for everything to Christ, and that they are really held in the enjoyment of blessing by Christ Himself. So, too, I find the same thing in John's line of things. There it is what was revealed in the Son Himself, become man, "that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us". The blessing is that we are children, and the character is Christ; we eat Christ and live by Him, the living bread come down from heaven. And then there is the power, the well of water in the believer springing up into eternal life. The whole conception is divine; the thought originated in the heart of the blessed God; He revealed Himself in the sovereignty of love to the world, and we are brought to respond to it in spiritual affections by the power of the Holy Spirit. If you want to get the full result, you must go to Paul. The full result is in conformity to Christ in glory, according to God's eternal purpose, and Paul presents it to us in connection with heavenly glory,
{295}
which John does not. Who can say that the expressions in the beginning of @Ephesians 1 will be fully verified until we are in glory? I quite admit that in virtue of union with Christ we are in heavenly places already; but we are to be actually in heavenly places; that is what it refers to. God has "blessed us with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places in Christ: according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love". This will be made actually true in us in glory, though I should be very sorry to relegate it entirely to the future, because I think it is given to us for the present. It is the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer so to minister Christ to our souls that this is made good to us in the present.
I think I have said enough to show you how that eternal life and the gift of the Holy Spirit in connection with it, hang entirely upon the purpose of God. It is that which is manifestly outside all question of man's responsibility; it is not according to our works, it is not upon that line. I say, thank God for it. I am very well content to go on the little moment that remains, and seek to fulfil my responsible life down here by the help of the Holy Spirit to the praise of God. But in the light of God's blessed word, and in the power of the Holy Spirit, I am permitted to be in a certain sense beside myself, to retire for a moment in faith from all here, and to realise what I am with God according to His eternal purpose. And it is not simply for our pleasure, but for His; it is the fruit of His love. Do not you think God delights in what is the effect and fruit of His love? I am sure He does; and He delights that we should enter into it, and know that it originated in that love. May God give to us to respond to it, that we may know more of the mighty power of the Holy Spirit in us as a well of water springing up into eternal life. I can earnestly desire
{296}
for myself that spiritual affections may be really in exercise in me, that they may reach up as it were to the source of all blessing, to Him who has revealed Himself to us in the sovereignty of His love.
{297}
THE MYSTERY
@Ephesians 3; 5: 28 - 32
On former occasions we have had before us certain truths presented in the Scriptures, first the promises made to Abraham; then the "better hope" of the epistle to the Hebrews; and, last time, the subject of eternal life and the gift of the Spirit; and I have sought to show each truth in its connection with, and as the outcome of, the counsel of God. Tonight I wish to speak of a truth of a different character -- the mystery -- but, by the Lord's help, to present it also in the light of counsel. My conviction is this (I may be mistaken, and am not dogmatic on such a point), that the peculiar ministry for the moment is the counsel of God. There are plenty of other things which are prominent and have a great place in the minds of Christians; but I think, for the establishment of the people of God, and for the working out of God's will in them, it is all important to present to their souls the counsel of God. I have not spoken of the truth of election, which has reference to individuals, but in a broader way of the counsel of God. And by the counsel of God I mean the things which God has taken in hand to establish according to His will, on the basis of accomplished redemption.
Before speaking on the subject of tonight, I should like to say one word in reference to the gospel. I am convinced that the basis on which the gospel rests is the counsel of God, and that were it not for the counsel of God there would be no gospel. One cannot shut one's eyes to the fact that the world has rejected every overture which God could make to it even in grace, and that so far as the responsibility of man is concerned all hope is closed. This is evident from what the Lord said in reference to the coming of the
{298}
Comforter, that when He was come He would convict the world of sin, because they believed not on Him. You have to remember that Christ was presented to the world in divine grace and power and goodness, and that the world did not believe in Him. Therefore, the Holy Spirit convicts the world also concerning judgment, "because the prince of this world is judged"; that is, that as the result of the rejection of Christ, Satan is declared the prince of this world. I do not say he was not the prince of the world before, but I do not think it came out until the world had definitely rejected Christ. And the Lord says, "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me". Then the gospel comes in on the ground of divine counsel; that is, it is the means which God uses for the accomplishment of His counsel, though at the same time the gospel opens the door to all, for Christ died for all. One could not be free in the preaching of the gospel if that were not accepted. "There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all". But while the gospel opens the door to all, the object of the gospel is not only to save souls, but to bring them into the counsel of God about them. You may say that the preaching of the gospel does not effect that fully; but I think the preaching of the gospel ought at all events to pave the way for it, and not to give to souls the idea that, being saved from judgment, they are free to live in the world out of which Christ has died.
Now, beloved friends, all that I have presented on previous occasions has been connected with saints individually, whether the promises, or the better hope (which is really fellowship with Christ in glory), or eternal life and the gift of the Spirit. All those subjects refer to the blessings we are brought into and privileged to enjoy individually. It is evident that life refers to us individually; individually we are alive to God in
{299}
Christ, individually we live in the Spirit. Tonight I am going to bring before you, by the Lord's help, what refers to us corporately. The moment we come to the mystery, in the sense of the one body, we bring in the truth of corporate blessing. And corporate blessing, what we are as one body here (for that is the mystery), is according to the purpose of God. It is brought out as distinctly as possible in the chapter before us; for after that the apostle has told us what God had in view in it, that is, that "now unto the principalities and powers in the heavenly places might be known by the assembly the manifold wisdom of God"; he adds, "according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord".
I will first speak a few words as to the meaning to be attached to the expression 'mystery', and then I desire to show you what the mystery is. People have not always a very definite idea of what is intended to be conveyed by Scripture expressions, and there may be some here tonight that have not any very clear thought of the expression 'mystery'. I trust to make clear to you what mystery means, that we may understand it, if the Lord give us understanding. And to what end? That we may be practically in the truth of it, that is, that it may be, so far at least as we are concerned, carried out. I am not at all blind to the difficulties peculiar to the present moment, because the truth of the one body applies to every saint upon earth, and yet it is but a very small proportion of the saints upon earth who have any understanding at all of the one body. If I were to talk to the greater part of Christians about the mystery, they would not know what I meant at all. It is but a fragment of them who have any idea at all of the truth of the one body. My conviction is that ninety-nine out of every hundred saints, as to the condition of their souls, have never got beyond congregationalism; they have never got to the idea of a structure. And even amongst ourselves,
{300}
we know a great deal more about gathering than about building. The great mischief is where the two are not held. I quite admit the importance of gathering: "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name"; but without building it must result in congregationalism, which does not present the truth of the church. What the Lord says in the very first allusion to the church is, "On this rock I will build my assembly", and that is a structure. I allow that there is the Lord's congregation here in the world, but what the Lord speaks about in @Matthew 16 is a structure. Building and gathering, I am convinced, ought to go hand in hand. If souls are gathered out to the name of the Lord Jesus, there ought to be at the same time the building up of souls in Christ; for there is only one material in the structure which Christ builds, that which grows to a holy temple in the Lord, and that material is Christ. It is not man as such that is built in it, neither Jew nor Gentile, I mean morally; it is Christ and nothing but Christ: "On this rock I will build my assembly".
But now as to the idea connected with 'mystery'. The word is employed in Scripture in many connections. I do not know that we find it in the Old Testament, but we find it frequently in the New. The Lord spoke of the mysteries of the kingdom. So, too, mystery is employed in a more general sense in the first chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians. And in the Revelation we read that the mystery of God should be finished. It has been said, and I quite go with it, that mystery means something which is known only to the initiated. It was an expression current among the heathen. I daresay someone would ask me, Who are the initiated? Well, I say, everyone who has the Holy Spirit is of the initiated. Therefore the mystery is the property of every real Christian, for we could not speak of a person being a real Christian unless he have the Holy Spirit, though, as it has been said, he
{301}
may be on the road to it. But every real Christian is of the initiated, and is entitled to be in the secret of the mystery.
But there is another and a very important moral thought connected with it. A mystery is something which cannot exist in the *public* ways of God. Let me give you an illustration from @Matthew 13. The mysteries of the kingdom of heaven could not exist in the public ways of God. If the kingdom were established in power and glory, you could not have such a character of things as is presented in that chapter; because the form of the kingdom shown there contemplates no difference between Jew and Gentile; "the field is the world", and there are "the children of the wicked one". And do you think when God comes in in His public ways there will be the children of the wicked one, the 'tares' in His kingdom? Not a bit of it. And do you think in that day there will be no distinction between Jew and Gentile? But no such distinction is known in the mysteries of the kingdom. The Lord says, "It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven"; and He explains to them how all is brought about: the seed is sown, and springs up, and the consequences of it are seen. The kingdom of heaven, in the form in which it is presented to us in @Matthew 13, exists in the time when the king is hidden and God has not come out in His public ways. When He does, the kingdom will have a totally different character.
But now I come to another point, that is, to the mystery presented to us in the epistle to the Ephesians (chapter 5: 28 - 32): "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ the church. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife,
{302}
and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church". In this very striking passage, we have Paul saying, "This mystery is great". Peculiar stress therefore is to be laid upon what you get there; but he says, "I speak concerning Christ and concerning the church". Now the mystery as presented to us in this passage refers first to Christ. What I understand it to mean is this, that Christ in the time that He is cut off from His natural kindred, becomes the head of a joint body on earth, composed of Jew and Gentile. I think there is an allusion to this in the passage. Christ is separated from His kindred after the flesh, as Joseph was; and in the time of His separation He has become the Head of the assembly composed of Jew and Gentile. And that is what never could be in the public ways of God. When the Lord comes again, and the kingdom is set up in glory, do you think such a thing could be possible? It is totally impossible. Jew and Gentile will have their respective places in that day, but what will mark the Gentiles will be that they will eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table; they will be blessed intermediately through Israel. Israel will be the channel of light and blessing on earth in that day, because the promises belong to Israel, and the Gentile will be brought into blessing subordinately to Israel. Jehovah will reign, and Christ will be King of the whole earth, and the Head of the Gentiles; but not the Head of a body composed jointly of Jew and Gentile. It is in the time of His rejection that He takes that place.
Now I want to come to another side of the mystery. I have spoken of the Head, now I want to speak of the body; @Ephesians 3: 4 - 6. "Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles
{303}
should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint par-takers of his promise in Christ by the gospel". The mystery here is connected with the body, and what is presented is that which is impossible in the public ways of God, that Jew and Gentile should be joint heirs and a joint body. It evidently refers to the present moment, because, if it referred only to the future, the word 'heirs' would not be used. 'Promise' I understand to mean here that to which God has engaged Himself. I do not think it refers to a promise specifically made to any person. A promise on the part of God is an expression of purpose. Just as we get "the promise of life in Christ Jesus" -- God has been pleased to engage Himself to it.
I just show you the two sides of the mystery; on the one that Christ has become the Head of a joint body composed of Jew and Gentile; and on the other, that the Gentile has become a joint heir, and a joint body, and joint partaker of God's promise in Christ through the gospel -- the gospel being the way by which it has been brought about.
Now I go on to a few thoughts in connection with chapter 3. It is a deeply interesting chapter, and brings in Paul and the administration committed to him; and in order to lead up to it, I must refer to what comes out at the close of chapter 1 and the beginning of chapter 2 of Ephesians. Chapter 1: 19 - 23: "What is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all". There is not a word about mystery
{304}
there, because it does not refer to Christ as the Head of a joint body of Jew and Gentile down here, but in the greatness of the position in which He has been placed as man according to the purpose of God; while the body is looked at in the whole extent of it as the fulness of Him which filleth all in all. It is Christ alone, in His proper place, as one might say, in heaven, and therefore there is no allusion to the mystery. At the beginning of chapter 2 it says, "And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace are ye saved); and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus". There is not a word of mystery here any more than there is in chapter 1 in connection with Christ; because it is no question of what the church is down here, but of what the saints are in heaven; they are raised up together, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ; and the point that governs the whole passage, whether in reference to Christ or us, is the power of God. There is not a word about administration, nor about mystery: it is the calling of God and the height of the exaltation of the saints; they are quickened by the power of God out of death, raised up together, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Mysteries do not refer to heaven; mysteries refer to what is
{305}
taking place here upon earth. When God comes out in His public ways, then the mystery of God will be finished; God will have brought about the counsel of His will, and there will be no longer mystery; nothing to be known in that day by the initiated, because everything then will be public. It is clear to me that mysteries can have no reference to heaven; and therefore, when it is a question of setting Christ at God's right hand in heaven, and of saints being made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ, mystery is not introduced. But in chapter 3, when the apostle refers to the administration which was committed to him, and to the assembly as here upon earth, then the thought of mystery is introduced, as that which had been revealed down here. Look at chapter 3: 1, 2, "For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if ye have heard of the administration of the grace of God which is given me towards you". It is a question of the administration given to him. Look also at verse 8, "Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery [the word 'fellowship' ought to be 'dispensation' or 'administration'] which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things, to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God".
It has often been observed that chapter 3 is really parenthetical. It comes in between chapters 2 and 4, the beginning of chapter 4 being continued on from the end of chapter 2 and chapter 3 comes in to show us the special administration committed to the apostle, by which everything was brought about in souls. The power of God is that which effects everything, but as to the means by which the result is brought about in souls, it is a question of administration; and hence
{306}
the apostle claims that he did not get what he had from other men, but that it had been specially revealed to him, an administration committed to him.
And mark this -- it is by the administration of the mystery that the angels and principalities and powers in the heavenly places were to become acquainted with the manifold wisdom of God; and you cannot therefore attach too much importance to administration, that is, how God's ways are administered down here, how the one body, the assembly, has been formed.
Now I desire to bring out a thought or two in connection with what the mystery, the one body, is. The apostle says, "Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel". It was when the whole world was lost in dark insensibility to God, that God began to bring this about. The Jew was lost in the darkness of unbelief, in spite of every possible testimony presented to him; and the Gentile was sunk in the degradation of idolatry. Such was the condition of the world before God. What God does in the first place is to set Christ at His own right hand in the heavenly places. And the next thing God does historically in the unfolding of His ways is to call out a remnant of His people -- it is shown in the epistle to the Hebrews -- He presents to them the better hope. "The Lord added daily the saved ones to the assembly"; He saves a remnant of His people, and He brings them into the assembly; they were baptised by the Holy Spirit. Now if Jew and Gentile were to be a joint body, do you think the Jew was to come down to the level of the Gentile? Such a thing could not be. The Jew had rejected Christ, but dark as the poor Jew had been, he was not, when his eyes were opened, to come down to the level
{307}
of the Gentile. On the other hand, was the Gentile to be put on the Jewish platform? Not at all, for that was all gone because on that platform man had failed totally. The Gentile was not to be put on the Jewish platform, nor was the Jew to come down to the degraded Gentile, but both were to be on a completely new platform. The Jew was baptised by the Holy Spirit; that put him on new ground; and the Gentile, too, received the Holy Spirit, which put him on the same ground with the Jews who were saved; it made one body of them, because the secret of the one body is the possession of the Holy Spirit. It is that which astonished the Jews, that the Holy Spirit fell upon Cornelius and his friends; and some were apparently unready to baptise uncircumcised Gentiles; but Peter said, "Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptised, which have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?" The truth is that God put no difference between them. He linked the Jew and Gentile with Christ in heaven by the Holy Spirit.
And I say without hesitation that union must come before unity. If there were not union there really could not be unity. Unity must properly begin from the top, from Christ. It is like the precious ointment that was poured upon the head of Aaron and flowed down. Unity flows properly from union; that is, we are united to Christ by the Holy Spirit, and therefore there is unity down here. When the Holy Spirit fell on the day of Pentecost, the saints were united to Christ, though I do not think they knew it. Then afterwards the Gentiles, too, received the gift of the Holy Spirit, and were united also to Christ. And thus both Jew and Gentile were a joint body, though as yet the truth of it had not come out. Neither the one nor the other was entitled to that ground; it was all completely new, and it was on that ground the Gentiles became joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel.
{308}
Take a case which might occur in the present day. Suppose I had a slave, and both I and my slave received the Holy Spirit. I say we are joint heirs, and of a joint body, and joint partakers, though that man does not cease to be my slave. When we come to our individual paths here upon earth, I do not cease to be his master nor he to be my slave. The apostle Paul made Onesimus go back to his master. He suggests in the most tender and gracious way to Philemon that he should give him his liberty, but he is to receive him as a brother beloved. When we come to corporate truth, we have to remember that it lies outside of our individual path upon the earth. The difficulty is to conciliate the two things. Each has his individual path subject to the Lord; and we are told to abide in the calling in which we are called. But then, outside that, we have our corporate blessing -- joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel; it is on completely new ground by the fact of union with Christ in the reception of the Holy Spirit. That is a point of all moment, because it was not a sort of mutual concession, nor a kind of evangelical alliance; but that the Jew who had forfeited his place upon earth, was by the fact of his receiving the Holy Spirit united to Christ in heaven, and the Gentile, having received the Holy Spirit, was also united, and therefore they were one body upon earth; the gospel was the instrumentality which God employed for that purpose. The apostle Paul went among the Gentiles preaching "the unsearchable wealth of Christ; and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things; to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the assembly the manifold wisdom of God".
A word now upon the wisdom. I think the idea of the word 'wisdom' is 'resources' -- the manifold
{309}
resources of God, for see what God has brought about. If we only understood it we should appreciate the greatness of it. It is obscured at the present moment by the condition in which saints are; but if you could understand what the assembly was at the beginning, and what it would be if every saint entered into the truth of his calling, you would apprehend the greatness of what God has effected. There was the world as to its moral condition lost in unbelief and degradation; that was the spectacle before principalities and powers in the heavenly places, and what had God brought about? He had set a Man in heaven at His right hand to begin with, and made Him the Head of a joint body on earth in which His moral completeness was to be displayed. Do you know what the idea of a body is? There are two thoughts. One is that the body acts under the direction of the head; and when the body ceases to act under the direction of the head it is paralysis, there is clear proof that everything is out of gear. But there is another thought in connection with it -- the head is displayed in the body, for every member of my body derives from the head. Those are the great ideas, I believe, connected with the assembly, as the body of Christ -- there was a body here upon earth composed of Jew and Gentile, acting under the direction of a Head in heaven, and at the same time a vessel for the display of the virtues of the Head; as the apostle says, "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood ... that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light". That was the spectacle before angels and principalities in the heavenly places. What a wonderful and morally beautiful sight it was -- to have a body here in which every member resigning its own will was contented to act under the direction of the blessed Head in heaven, and in this body was the display of the moral beauty and comeliness of the Head in heaven! What could
{310}
be more amazing? What a mighty triumph of wisdom on the part of God!
In the epistle to the Colossians we get the truth of the new man, which is intimately connected with the body. The great idea in it is that "Christ is all and in all", and that the sensibilities and affections, and the word of Christ, the whole moral beauty of Christ, come out in the saints as one body here upon earth in their relations one toward another. When you think what the history of the world had been in the presence of heaven, was not that an amazing result for God to produce? Did not that prove to principalities and powers in the heavenly places the unbounded resources of God, to see a body here upon earth, composed of those naturally so diverse as Jew and Gentile had been, directed by the Head, and displaying all the blessed characteristics of the Head? I would to God we had a greater sense of the beauty of the Head, of the fulness of the Lord Jesus Christ; that we knew more of the unsearchable wealth of Christ. The apostle says, "Whom we preach" -- speaking of Christ -- "warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ". I trust that Christ is formed in every soul I am speaking to, but are you anxious to "grow up unto him in all things which is the head"? We ought to have such a sense of the virtue and moral excellence of the Head that the one thing to be desired is to grow up unto Him in all things; that we might get more away from man, and ourselves, and all the workings of flesh, to be more conformed to Christ in glory. It is a great thing to get the Head before you. You will never understand what He is as Head to the body if you do not understand what He is as Head to you. The Head is the source and the standard to each one of us, and when I understand what He is as Head to me, then I understand what He is to the whole body.
Then will come out the blessed truth of unity here.
{311}
It will not be a unity of agreement or an alliance, but unity in the character of Christ Himself; as the apostle says, speaking of the new man, "There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but Christ is all and in all". That is the great reality God did produce down here. It has been terribly marred in the hands of man. But then, all the work of man and the failure of man cannot possibly alter what God has effected. The body is here, and it is a very great thing if God has given us just to return to the truth of it; and although our sphere of influence may be a very small one, and we may have very little opportunity of coming into contact with the saints of God, yet so far as we can, it is a very great point to walk in the truth of the mystery, not only correct in our individual path, but deeply concerned in regard to our relations one towards another, so that the character of Christ may be seen in the company of the saints collectively.
In conclusion I may say that I do not think anybody would question for a moment that the mystery is connected with the eternal purpose of God. And it is a very important truth for us. The knowledge of the mystery marks us off practically from the great mass of Christendom. Of course, all saints are in the body, and in the mystery; but they are not instructed in it. I suppose everybody here tonight is so more or less, and the point for us is to walk in the reality of it. The first thing is to give up our own heads, that is, the direction of our own minds, to be under the direction of the Head in heaven, and then to be very jealous that the blessed traits and features of Christ should be reproduced in us in our relations one with another down here. If you want a guide for the assembly, study @Colossians 3, and see what comes out there.
I am entitled to say that the truth of the mystery places us more distinctly on the ground of divine
{312}
counsel than any point I have brought before you on previous occasions. The very fact of being heirs of promise puts us on the ground of divine counsels; so does the having part in the better hope; so, too, eternal life and the gift of the Spirit; and more distinctly so does our being of the one body. The administration of the mystery has, as we have seen, a very definite object, "that now, unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the assembly the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord".
One word more. It goes on to say, "In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him". There is your privilege. I do not go on to the prayer at the end of the chapter, save to say that what it means is this, that the truth may be made good in our hearts in our practical state down here, "that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith", so that we may know "the love of Christ", and "be filled into all the completeness of God", that saints may not be one-sided, for that is not the idea of 'fulness', 'completeness'. May God work it, beloved friends! Thank God, He has made these things in a great measure plain in these last days, and I dread very much lest we should slip away from them. It is very easy to hold things in terms when the vital power of them is gone; and if we are not going on, depend on it we are going back -- you cannot remain stationary in divine things. If you are not growing up into Christ, you are retrograding. And therefore it becomes every one of us to be exercised as to how we are holding the truth and going on with it. May God give us understanding, and maintain us in power, by His blessed Spirit that dwells in us.
{313}
THE CALLING OF GOD AND HEAVENLY PLACES
@Ephesians 1
What is before me, beloved friends, to speak on this evening is the calling of God. It is evidently a very important matter to get a clear idea of. A little later on in the epistle we find the thought of our calling, and there is a shade of difference between the two expressions. The apostle refers to God's calling in the prayer at the close of the first chapter: "That you may know what is the hope of his calling"; and what I want to unfold a little tonight, as the Lord may enable me, is what is conveyed in the expression "his calling", and to add a word or two about "the hope" of it.
God's calling, I need hardly say, must needs be according to His purpose. We read elsewhere, "Who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose". So, too, we have, in @Romans 8, the expression, "The called according to his purpose". The calling of God is not always identical, and I want to show what is God's calling for the Christian. We get a reference to it in @Philippians 3, where the apostle speaks of pressing on for "the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus". He looks at it there as the end, the prize for which he was striving might and main, the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.
There are three things which come before us in verses 3 - 5 of this chapter: the first is the calling; the second is the state which befits the calling; and the third is the proper scene of the calling. In thus speaking of them I refer to them in the reverse order to that in which they are presented to us in the passage.
{314}
The three verses are evidently intimately connected, and the connection is marked in verse 4 by the word 'according', and in verse 5 by the "having predestinated"; the three points are thus connected together.
When I read the scripture, I dare say you noticed the recurrence of one expression, that is, "his will". First you get in verse 5 the good pleasure of His will; then, in verse 9, the mystery of His will; and then, in verse 11, the counsel of His own will. The thought connects itself in my mind very intimately with @Hebrews 10, in which, referring to Christ, it says "I come ... to do thy will, O God"; it goes on to say, speaking of the offerings under the law, "He taketh away the first that he may establish the second". It is very important to apprehend the real line on which Christ came here, namely, to establish the will of God. God does not take counsel with any; there are very few of us who do not take counsel with someone, but God has no one to take counsel with, He works all things after the counsel of His own will. I refer to that, because it makes it so evident that the calling is according to the will of God, what we are called to is the fruit of His counsel. As I was saying at the outset of these lectures, the service I desire to render to the saints is to establish their souls on the ground of divine counsel, for a vast proportion of the people of God, as to the state of their souls, are not beyond the ground of responsibility as men on earth. They do not see that the end of conversion in God's sight is to set them on the ground of His counsel, and that the work of Christ answers to that, for the clearance is complete: "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified". You must not confound 'sanctified' and 'perfected'. 'Sanctified' is by far the greater thought of the two. "By the which will we are sanctified", set apart for God. The pith of that passage in its application to us is, that
{315}
we are set in the place of priests, having access as sons to God. And then the truth is added that by one offering Christ has perfected for ever -- that is as to their conscience -- them which are sanctified, so that there is no more conscience of sins. I see more and more how in the gospel the question of man's responsibility is completely met; but I am sure that no question of man's responsibility can come up to the will of God; and our calling is according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace. It is not according to our will or our thought, but it is the good pleasure of His will.
Before I dwell upon these verses in detail, I should like to say a word or two about the expression "calling". It is not the first time that we find a calling in Scripture. I see two callings in Scripture, and there may be more -- an earthly and a heavenly calling. If I go back to the beginning, I do not see that Adam had a calling; God put him on the footing of responsibility. He was set up in Eden a perfect creature as God had made him, the head and centre of God's creation down here; but he had not a calling, his point was to abide in what God had made him in the place of responsibility. That was no question of faith.
Passing on through the history of the Old Testament we come to Abraham. It may seem a curious thing to say, that though Abraham was called out by God, yet no present calling was revealed to him. He was a pilgrim and a stranger, he sought a heavenly country, he looked for Christ's day. We are told all that, but still I do not think we have the truth of a present calling revealed to Abraham. I do not doubt what the place of Abraham will be in glory. He will find what he sought -- "a city which hath foundations". "He that seeketh findeth". Abraham sought it according to the instinct given him of God, and you may be sure he will find it. But Abraham received promises rather than a calling.
{316}
The beginning of a calling in the Old Testament was in the case of Israel; God revealed His name to them in its import as a name of relationship, and they had a special calling of God, they were Jehovah's people by calling. In them we see the possession of a calling. We find that they did not abide in the truth of the calling, and therefore they were set aside. But they have not forfeited their calling, for Scripture says that "the gifts and calling of God are without repentance", and the calling will therefore be yet fulfilled in them.
Now we come to the New Testament, to Christians and the calling of God, I think verse 5 of this chapter makes what the calling is perfectly plain. It is in the greatest possible contrast to what the calling of Israel is. He has predestinated us to sonship to Himself, through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will. That is God's calling so far as we are concerned, and it is the highest privilege which can be conferred upon us. It has often been said, in regard to union, we are members of Christ; while, in sonship, we are companions of Christ. He is "the firstborn among many brethren".
I want to enlarge a little upon this latter. We find He has "predestinated us to sonship" -- I alter the form of the expression, because "the adoption of children" does not exactly give the sense: it really is "sonship" -- He has "predestinated us to sonship through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will". I think a great many people read that verse and do not apprehend the force of it. People have very vague ideas about sonship. What gives character to sonship in that verse is "through Jesus Christ". It implies that in order for the accomplishment of the counsel of God, it was needful that Christ should become man, and take His place as man in heaven. We never could have had the place of sonship through Jesus Christ as He was here upon earth, for He speaks of Himself as the corn of wheat
{317}
that to bear fruit must fall into the ground and die. There was no such thing as His being the firstborn among many brethren, on the footing of what He was after the flesh, not on His account, but on our account. One thing was against it -- the judgment of God, death, rested upon every man here in the world when Christ came into it. And therefore to begin with Christ had to remove that judgment, to die, in order that the judgment which rested upon man might be annulled, and that He might take a new place as man in resurrection, and not only in resurrection, but in heavenly glory, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. The truth is, divine righteousness had to have its full display in Christ in His exaltation. He glorified God as man, He bore the judgment which rested upon man down here, "Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead", and now divine righteousness has its full display and expression in Christ. He is not only raised, but exalted to the right hand of God in the heavenly places, and there it is that He is become "the firstborn among many brethren", and we are to be conformed to Him, for the calling is to sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself. If you trace it to the beginning, that is, what had to be accomplished in order that the will of God might have its full effect.
There is another point which I think is important, and that is, that in Scripture the expressions 'children' and 'sons' are not confused. Both expressions are used in regard to Christians. A Christian is a child of God. 'Child' is the word which is always employed in reference to the Christian by the apostle John: "Now are we the children of God". And again, in the first chapter of John's gospel, "To as many as received him, to them gave he title to take the place of the children of God". On the other hand, Paul almost invariably uses the word 'sons', though he does once or twice say 'children', too. A remarkable
{318}
instance is in @Romans 8, where both expressions are employed. I will show you the distinction between the two. You could not speak of the Holy Spirit being the Spirit of children; but He is the Spirit of sonship, and for this simple reason, that the Holy Spirit has come down from Christ glorified, from the Son of God in glory, and is therefore the Spirit of sonship in us. The truth of sonship is this -- the calling of the Christian corresponds to what Christ is in glory, not to what Christ was when He was here upon earth, but to what He is now, and therefore the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of sonship. But we are children of God. The idea which children of God conveys to me is that we are the partners of Christ's rejection. Sonship is that we are the companions of Christ in glory. And both things are perfectly true to the Christian. We have fellowship in the sufferings of Christ, and, as in that place, are the special object of the Father's affections. That is what Christ was when He was here upon earth; He was suffering and rejected; but He was the unfailing object of the Father's delight and affections. What characterises a child is this, "If so be that we suffer with him". But while we suffer with Him, we see "what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God" -- mark what follows -- "Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not". It accords with the expression in the first chapter of John's gospel, "He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not". But what then? "To as many as received him, to them gave he title to take the place of the children of God". And therefore it is that the world does not know Christians, because it knew not Him.
But as sons we are the companions of a glorified Christ; that is what the Holy Spirit would lead you to. The Holy Spirit not only makes us conscious of
{319}
the Father's affections as we go about the world and have to do with things down here, but leads us in spirit to what God has called us to: predestinated us "to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren". The same thing is brought out in @Hebrews 2 -- God is "bringing many sons unto glory". So, too, in Corinthians, He has called us "to the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord" -- that is the Christian calling again.
But there is another thought connected with the calling, and that is priesthood. The two things are intimately connected, sonship and priesthood. Because the great idea connected with priesthood in Scripture is access, and it is sons who have access. There is a further privilege of sonship -- namely, intelligence of the mind and will of the Father. But the other point is equally true, that we have priestly access. Sonship is what God has called us to. How much do we really enter into it? Many Christians rejoice in the thought of children, and I think we ought to rejoice in it. We are the children of God now, the apostle lays special stress upon it in that way: "Now are we the children of God"; but it is none the less true that God has called us to the fellowship of Christ in glory. And what for? Our pleasure? No, for His pleasure, "according to the good pleasure of his will". Remember this, God's counsel is for His pleasure. He does not order simply for my pleasure, but He makes me know that what I am before Him is for His pleasure. Your exaltation in the grace of God, whatever you may be called to, is according to His will.
The fact is, everything with God is infinite. I know in the present day plenty of people are dazzled with the discoveries of astronomy, and the vastness of space; but it has not very much effect with me, because, after all, created things are not infinite in the true sense. But when I come to what God is morally,
{320}
everything of necessity must be infinite; and therefore it is not very surprising if God makes known what I may call the infiniteness of blessing, for the blessing is according to the infiniteness of what God is. God is love, and God is infinite in love, and if God delights in blessing there is no limit to it; and in that sense it is not wonderful at all. It is limited only in our capacity.
Now one word about "the hope of the calling". I have heard the question frequently asked, What is "the hope of his calling"? Well, I have no doubt at all "the hope of his calling" is purposely left indefinite; Scripture does not say exactly what it is. But the idea which it gives me is the calling in the consummation of it; I think the point of the prayer is that you should get the present good of it. If God instructs my soul, by the knowledge of Himself in what is the hope of the calling, I get the present good of it. We get as heavenly light what soon will be our part. It is no use attempting to relegate the calling to the future, for the calling is revealed, and the moment it is revealed it is true to faith and good to those who believe. The secret things belong to God, but the revealed things belong to faith. And therefore, if the calling is revealed, though you may not yet have got the actuality of it, the actual condition of it, yet what is revealed is the property of faith, and therefore the calling is as good to me as it will be when I get the consummation of it at the coming of the Lord. I think that is the idea conveyed in the expression.
I pass on now to speak about the state, "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love". I use the word 'state' or 'condition' in reference to that verse (though, after all, words are poor), because I think the verse describes state or condition. Now, beloved friends, you will think it strange if I say that the verse suggests to my
{321}
mind a practical state, and yet I do not mean practice exactly, because it is what *the person* is to be. I know many Christians take refuge in saying, Oh! I am that in nature. But that is not the point of the verse. The verse states that He has "chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love" -- that is, we are to be so; it is not simply a nature. I dare say you are that in nature, but I say the verse refers to what God has purposed that you should be. I can understand a person saying, But does it not refer to the future? Well, I cannot say it refers to the future, because it is made known for the present. At all events, it is your standard; it is what God has chosen you for. And it is a practical state. I do not at all like the way in which it is commonly taken up as a mere question of nature, because I do not think that gives the idea of the phrase. The beginning of a Christian is this -- that he is in the Spirit. The apostle Paul says in @Romans 8, "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you". That is Christian state, and, I have no doubt, the secret of everything lies there, in the Holy Spirit in the Christian. But that is the outset. Many a Christian may be said to be in the Spirit, and yet after all Christ may not really be formed in him. The Corinthians were in the Spirit, for they had the Spirit of God beyond all question. No person that has received the Holy Spirit is in the flesh. He is in the Spirit; that is Christian state. In the case of the Galatians -- and I doubt if you may not say it in regard to the Corinthians -- Christ was not formed in them; at all events the Corinthians were no further on than babes in Christ, and whether Christ was formed in them or not I can hardly say. But with the Galatians it is clear -- the apostle travailed in birth again until Christ was formed in them. The fact is, the souls of the Galatians had not got a real view of Christ in glory;
{322}
Ishmael was not putout; they had not got a true idea of Isaac the seed of promise; and therefore they wanted to go back to Hagar. What the apostle brings before them is this, that when Isaac was weaned Ishmael had to be put out. Jerusalem above, which is free, is our mother. What I said was the case with the Galatians, and is the case with many Christians at the present day. If you have been brought out of system, you will know there are very few Christians who have any real idea of Christ in glory. Yet they are real Christians, and have the Spirit. But it is one thing to have the Spirit, and another thing for Christ to be formed in you; and the effect of that is that *Ishmael*, the flesh, is bound to go; the child of flesh must not be allowed to rule in the house. And there is another thing -- where Christ is formed in the Christian, the Christian would not allow himself to be put under ordinances, to observe days, and months, and seasons, and years. I have no doubt a great many people are spiritually beyond the system they are in; but if people are intelligently in system, it is clear to me that Christ is not formed in them. It is a great thing when Christ is formed in you. It is then the Christian says, Flesh is no longer to rule here, flesh is to have no quarter, and Christ in glory is to rule supreme.
And then you have to grow up into Christ. Do not suppose people begin to grow up into Christ until Christ is formed in them; but when Christ is formed in them, then they begin to grow. And that is the object and effect of ministry, as the apostle says in @Colossians 1, "Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ". So that it is not one feature or trait of Christ developed, but every trait of Christ having its place in the Christian, so that there be nothing deficient, and each quality balanced. Even with apostolic men, you will see one quality predominant in one man, and another in another.
{323}
That may be all well, but the great effect of ministry is that every quality should be in the Christian, and every quality have its right place -- that we should be full-grown in Christ.
Now I come back to verse 4. If a person has the Holy Spirit, it is not difficult for me to apprehend that that person is holy and without blame before God in love, so far as he is in the Spirit; but I think the verse gives the standard, and that it is a standard which is to be realised down here. I do not think I can say I am it; I think any person would make a grave mistake who said that; but it is my standard; and if Christ had complete possession of the heart of a Christian, the Christian would be this, he would be "holy and without blame before God in love". I have no doubt it will be completely realised in glory. The condition is a very blessed one, it is a wonderful thing to be practically holy, so that there is a complete instinctive shrinking from all that is evil. The Christian is to be holy and without blame before God, so that no charge can be laid against him; but then there is another word, that he is to be holy and without blame before God "in love", that is, in the exercise of spiritual affections. Beloved friends, I do not think a Christian is of himself capable of any spiritual affection, but every spiritual affection in the Christian lies in the power of the Holy Spirit. And so the apostle says of the Colossians that Epaphras had declared to him their "love in the Spirit". The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life in a Christian. I believe the great defect with most of us is that we are not sufficiently under the sense of obligation, for the moment I come under the sense of obligation, the Spirit of life enables me to respond to the obligation. I will explain what I mean. I say, "If God so loved us", what is the obligation? "We ought also to love one another". There is the obligation, and the moment that obligation is accepted, the Holy Spirit enables you to fulfil it, and therefore all
{324}
spiritual affections are in the power of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and the affections are according to Christ, and in the Christian they lie in the power of the Spirit.
The matter is one of very great moment; for I am sure it is a defect in most of us that our souls are not sufficiently under the sense of obligation. God is never under obligation, save to Himself. And hence love with Him is sovereign. The way obligation works is this. We are set under the greatest obligation. "Hereby perceive we the love, that he laid down his life for us". There is the ground of obligation. What then? "We ought also to lay down our lives for the brethren". "Ought" expresses obligation. What does obligation flow from -- what the saints are? Not a bit, but from what God is, and what Christ is. "If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another". I say to the youngest here tonight, let your soul be under the sense of divine love; if you recognise the obligation you will not find difficulty in carrying it out. The more your soul is under the blessed sense of divine love, the more you will find your capability in the Spirit of Christ to walk here in love to the brethren. And on the other hand, if your soul is not under the influence of divine love, I am sure you will not walk practically here in affection towards the brethren. A Christian is never said to be love; but, under the sense of love, we walk here in spiritual affections in the power of the Holy Spirit. That is the way it works. God has called us "that we should be holy and without blame before him" -- mark the last expression in the verse -- "in love".
Just one word more, in regard to life. I remember seeing some time since an expression which greatly commended itself to me -- that life is that by which a being enjoys the position in which it is placed. You must first discover the position you are placed in, and then you will know something about life. If you had
{325}
not the state suited to the position in which you are placed, you could not possibly enjoy that position. But if you know anything at all about the position, then you will very soon find out that the state corresponds to it, for otherwise it would not be worthy of God. I have seen people in the world who have not the state to support their position, and it is a miserable struggle; but it is not God's way. If God has called us to sonship by Jesus Christ to Himself, we have also the state, namely, holy and without blame before Him in love.
Now as to the place of it. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ". I cannot say much about "heavenly places", because I really know so little about them myself. A person might very readily say, We must refer all that to the future, because we are not yet in heavenly places. I say that will not do, because I find in the beginning of chapter 2 that Jew and Gentile are made to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And I believe that truth is brought in there in order to show us how we are in heavenly places, so that we may enter as a present thing into the calling. Because if the calling refers to heavenly places -- which it does -- one would say naturally, I must wait for the enjoyment of the calling until I get into heavenly places. But the mystery is solved -- you are in heavenly places now. And it is true in principle of every Christian. It is not a question of his entering into it, but it is all a question of God's power -- that just as surely as Christ is in heavenly places, so every Christian is in heavenly places in Christ. But how did you get there? By union; the gift of the Holy Spirit united you to Christ in heavenly places. But have you got the good of it? That is the point. Do you understand what it is that the apostle says, "You being dead", and so on, you are quickened and raised up together, and made to
{326}
sit together in heavenly places in Christ? Oh! a person says, that is what is going to take place. He is going to quicken these mortal bodies and to raise us up: all that is to take place at the coming of the Lord. Perfectly true; but what I find here is that as regards the condition of the believer's soul God has anticipated that; God has so wrought in the believer that it is effected already in his soul; so that not only are you united -- but you have got the good of it. Do you know what the good of union is? You have got to where Christ is. People take union up as a dogma, and say a believer has the Holy Spirit and is therefore united. Perfectly true; but have you reached where Christ is? because that is the idea of union. Chapter 2 reveals to me that it is possible for the believer to see how God has anticipated what will actually take place at the coming of the Lord. It has often been said that in the epistle to the Ephesians the coming of the Lord is not presented to us; because God has anticipated it to us in putting us in Christ in heavenly places. It will be a great thing if we are living on the earth when the Lord comes, but in virtue of what God has wrought in believers¬ souls we have already gone to Him; Christ has been so practically formed in my soul in the power of the Holy Spirit that I have got the good of union. I do not simply talk about it, but I am conscious I have really reached Christ in my soul in the place where Christ is. You have got away from earth. Being quickened together with Christ does not take you off earth, but the being raised up together does. You are conscious that all the distinctions which divide men here upon earth are for you abolished for ever; and more than that, you are at liberty in the very place where Christ is. All that is what God had effected in those to whom the apostle wrote here, the Ephesians.
Beloved friends, I do not want to lay too great a strain upon Christians, especially young Christians.
{327}
It is all true for you, but the work of God is not done in you in a moment; Scripture never conveys that idea at all. You are in the Spirit if the Spirit dwells in you; but there has to be the renewing of the Holy Spirit; and then there is another thing presented to us -- we begin as babes, and have to grow up to men. There is no need to be discouraged; everyone must begin at the beginning. And you have to remember this, that there is no gift given to a believer beyond the gift of the Holy Spirit. You could not have more than divine power in you, and you have that; and the purpose of divine power in you is that you may live by divine power, and that Christ may be formed in you, and you may grow up into Christ. I believe that to be the blessed office of the Holy Spirit in the believer. I thank God life is not left in my power; life in the Christian is in the Spirit of life, who ministers Christ to his soul. God has made my soul alive in His goodness, and what nourishes the soul is the appreciation of Christ. I prefer Christ to myself and to all else. Christ is "chief among ten thousand" and "altogether lovely". One would sacrifice all, in that sense, for the appreciation of Christ. The Holy Spirit ministers Christ to my soul, and the practical effect of that is not simply that Christ is formed in me, and that Ishmael has been turned out, but it is that I grow up into Christ in all things. Then it is I realise that I am united, for I have got the good of union; I have left the distinctions of earth, I am at home in the scene where Christ is, my soul is at liberty, and in delight there; I become beside myself I am withdrawn in the power of the Holy Spirit from the ordinary circumstances of everyday life into the blessed scene of light where Christ is.
One word more. God has "blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places"; and people have frequently asked, What are the blessings? If you were to ask me what were the temporal blessings
{328}
with which Israel was blessed in earthly places, I might tell you, but I could not tell you very much about the spiritual blessings in heavenly places. I only tell you this, If you know anything at all about what Christ is the centre of in heavenly places, you will know something about the character of the blessings. "Seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God". If you get an apprehension of the affections, and delights, and joys of which Christ is the centre at the right hand of God, you will then have an idea of what the spiritual blessings in heavenly places are. And that is what we are blessed with. It all depends on the soul really apprehending that God has set us in heavenly places. Now do not be discouraged. I cannot talk much to you experimentally of these things. But I say all these things are possible, because they are what God has effected. It is possible not only to be united to Christ -- we are united to Christ -- but it is possible as a present thing to get the good of union. Then, if you are conscious of having reached Christ, where He is, you will soon understand what the calling of God is, and you will apprehend the state which is suited to the calling. I am afraid that when the Lord comes, and we are really brought into the actuality of it, some of us will be surprised because we have entered into it so little now. I shall not be sorry to be surprised, but if we knew something more about the hope of His calling, we should not be so very much surprised when the Lord comes. But you must remember this -- God works all things after the counsel of His own will. He has not done this or that, or called people to this or that, to please them, but to please Himself -- it is "the good pleasure of his will", and "the counsel of his will", and with God, of necessity everything is infinite.
May God give our souls to enter into it. I trust I have not brought anything before you which will cause
{329}
anyone here any kind of difficulty. May God give you to examine everything in the light of His word, and to abandon every thought which will not bear that light, and establish and confirm you in everything which is according to the truth of God.
{330}
THE FOUNDATION AND THE BUILDING
@1 Corinthians 3: 10 - 17
F.E.R. There are two things that the apostle certainly does not allude to here, namely, a material temple and a congregation.
G.P. Is this the church in any particular aspect; if so, in what?
F.E.R. It is evidently the church as the dwelling-place of the Holy Spirit, the temple of God.
F.H.B. Is it not locally applied to Corinth? But what characterises the local assembly should characterise the whole assembly.
Ques. What is the meaning of the foundation being laid?
F.E.R. The apostle was referring to the foundation laid in Corinth; but then the question is *where* was the foundation laid? That is what made me say it is not a material temple, nor a congregation. The foundation is not the structure, but it involved the structure.
F.S.M. The foundation had been laid in their souls, you mean?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
D.L.H. What is the idea of building?
F.E.R. The idea of building is doctrine built into people's souls. People are formed by the doctrine. The structure is formed by building. The structure is outside of our individuality: it does not set it aside, but is outside of it. It is in the Holy Spirit. In the epistle to the Romans individuality is maintained throughout, even in regard to service. In the body of Christ you lose your individuality; you become part of the whole.
J.S.O. You do not mean the individuality of the *labourer*, but of the person built in? In @1 Corinthians 3,
{331}
the individuality of the responsible labourer or builder is maintained.
F.E.R. Verse 16 refers to the saints collectively. When you get the true idea of the temple your individuality is gone. You are a stone in the structure.
Geo.C. Is the foundation laid once and for all?
F.E.R. In Corinth no one else save Paul laid the foundation. He says, "other foundation can no man lay".
W.H. Does anyone else lay elsewhere, or is this the start of the whole?
F.E.R. I believe it is the start of the whole.
G.P. Does Paul speak here as a servant of the Lord or as minister of the church?
F.E.R. No one could take this ground of a wise master-builder except the apostle, I judge.
W.B. It was the start as to doctrine then?
F.E.R. The question is, where *was* the start as to doctrine? The start was made before the New Testament was written. It was by teaching not by writing. The doctrine connected itself so intimately with souls that it became part of them. The foundation refers to what had been laid in their souls.
It became the foundation in souls of a new structure, and that structure is entirely new and outside of what we are in our individuality as men on earth. Every one indwelt by the Spirit is of the structure; but it is fitly framed together in the Lord.
The foundation is not the structure. The latter may not be, in man's work, of the same material. Let us refer for a moment to the previous chapters. In chapter 1 Jew and Greek have no place at all. Paul starts with a new man, and tells the Corinthians they are of the new man; they are of God of the new order in Christ Jesus. Then in chapter 2, we find that man's mind is totally incapable, a spiritual man was needed, and in chapter 3 we come to the temple.
{332}
A.H. What do you mean by the structure; not what was *in* them, is it?
F.E.R. To understand the temple we must know what is built in; it is all of Christ. I do not say they were not the structure, but the point was, that they might *know* they were of it; not only *in* it, but *of* it -- a component part of it, outside Jew and Gentile, and all those distinctions of man.
T.H.R. It is only that which is of Christ which is *really* in the structure.
G.P. What is the "wood, hay, and stubble" then?
F.E.R. Leading people to attach undue value to an outward or sacramental connection with Christ and the like.
T.H.R. You cannot separate the structure from *persons*.
F.E.R. Unity flows from union. To be really in the truth of the one body you must understand union. It is one thing to be united, and another to be in the truth of union. A person might be united, and in his soul be hardly out of Egypt.
G.P. Is the chapter a picture of Christendom?
F.E.R. I see in Christendom all that is spoken of here, "wood, hay, and stubble". Defiling the temple is a step farther, and brings destruction on the defiler. When man lays down authoritatively principles to govern souls, you have got in principle the corruption of the temple; the Spirit of God is displaced. The great value of the temple is that the oracles of God are there.
W.H. What is the difference between the temple and the house?
F.E.R. Virtually they are the same thing. The temple is the dwelling-place of the Holy Spirit; the house is where God orders. The house is where you are to conduct yourself; the temple is where the oracles of God are. There is great good to be gained by being in the truth of the temple. If you want to
{333}
get light you must be in the truth of it. I can think of myself as outside of man on earth -- that is an immense thing. My individuality is merged in a new structure where Christ is all and in all. That truth comes out in the relations and conduct of the saints down here. This chapter runs, I think, with Colossians.
G.P. Where is the foundation laid, and by whom? Is it from Paul we get it?
F.E.R. I think so.
F.H.B. Through Paul's 'doctrine' of the Son of God as revealed in him?
F.E.R. The special testimony which laid the foundation was from Paul. The truth had been wrought in their souls. "I determined to know nothing among you but Jesus Christ". As a matter of fact Paul had laid the foundation at Corinth.
F.H.B. As to the truth a person may know Christ as Saviour and yet not know Him in this character as the foundation of the assembly.
W.B. If a man went away to the heathen and preached Paul's doctrine, would he be laying the foundation or not?
F.H.B. I suppose he would, if he were to preach Jesus Christ according to Paul's testimony.
B. You would still leave room for the other apostles, though the foundation has specially to do with Paul?
F.E.R. Everything is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets; but that is not exactly what Paul speaks of here: it is the foundation laid in Corinth.
J.S.O. There is no failure in Ephesians. It is more -- "Ye are builded together for God".
W.B. You get the apostles of the Lamb in the foundation of the city.
F.E.R. Yes; but that is the city; in the temple
{334}
aspect the assembly is strongly identified with Paul's doctrine.
G.P. What is it to gather saints on the ground of the one body?
F.E.R. To gather them on unsectarian ground; but what we have to do is to build into people's souls, so that they become really gathered. You want to produce it from *within* rather than from without. You want to build up in their souls the truth on which this new structure rests.
J.S.O. I suppose you meant that 'gathered on the ground of the one body' has become a conventional expression, and that the truth should be so ministered to souls as to bring them out to Christ, and then they would be practically gathered on that ground.
F.E.R. Yes, exactly. You go into a town, for instance, and find five companies professedly gathered on the ground of the one body; it is only the idea of congregation. It is not distinctive now.
Ques. What is to be distinctive?
F.E.R. Well, what I was speaking of this morning is distinctive: the inner and the outer. The fact is, all truth is levelled down to what a man is practically down here by the refusal of 'mixed condition'. *What* are we aiming at in ministry? That is the question.
F.H.B. There is a great deal of human work in gathering people, and consequently a great deal of scattering.
F.E.R. Exactly.
H.C.A. You must be careful to build in the same truth as in the foundation. There may be a quantity of doctrine, but the saints are not built up by it, save as Christ is ministered. He is the foundation.
D.L.H. The difficulty that exists in people's minds as to this shows how very few are *really* gathered on the ground of the one body.
J.S.O. The great principle of gathering abides the same.
{335}
F.E.R. Yes; but the taking up of even a correct term may become simply congregational. Unity, the truth of the one body, flows out of union.
T.H.R. You cannot build anything but what is of Christ into souls for this structure. If you have not the foundation of the Father's revelation of the Person of the Son, you cannot build a spiritual structure; you must have the *truth* of the structure.
W.H. If asked how *you* were gathered, what would you say?
F.E.R. I should say, I thank God, though very poorly, I *am* in the truth of the temple through grace.
Rem. They would not understand you.
F.E.R. Then I should say, Come and see -- cannot you recognise that God is here?
A.M.M. There is a tract highly valued among us: 'The One Body, the Ground of Gathering'.
F.E.R. Yes; building and gathering are two different things.
F.H.B. Gathering should be the result of building; the truth so built into souls that they could not be anything else than gathered.
J.S.O. Only a person who has peace may be gathered, and has everything to learn.
F.E.R. The temple is not corrupted in this chapter. The apostle is warning them.
Ques. Are not the temple and the one body distinct thoughts?
F.E.R. They are one thing, but two thoughts.
H.C.A. I am persuaded that we want to know more about the temple. God was there; and building refers to the temple, not to the one body.
J.S.O. You do not mean to say there are any new principles on which saints are to be gathered?
F.E.R. No; only terms that were used long ago do not do now, because many others take up the same terms as gathered on the same ground.
J.S.O. But that is imitation, and we must go on
{336}
with the reality. If I am asked the ground on which I am gathered, I should say that, though much humbled at all the divisions amongst those called brethren, they make no difference to me, for I am still clinging to the principles of God's word which brought me out at first, and that the word abides, "where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them", and that I am where I am because the Lord is there. We must take care not to use terms and expressions which do not answer to the truth. The less we say about ourselves the better.
F.E.R. Now the truth of the temple is, that there is light there, the oracles of God are there, and we have to find that out.
D.L.H. Correct principles may have been pressed, and persons accepted them, and yet not know union.
F.E.R. That is exactly my point. Souls have been apprehending things in a natural way instead of laying hold of them spiritually. You must apprehend the thing spiritually, and not be contented with the mere acceptance of truth. We must seek to use terms that will instruct people. I am speaking of ministry to confirm souls. They ought to be conscious of having come to the place where light is -- that is what will test us.
F.H.B. Yes; I know people have been settled by that. They come to the Lord's table because they find light, saying, 'That is where light is'.
J.S.O. Light and the Lord's presence.
D.L.H. Is there not the idea abroad that an organisation was started some years ago, and now it is all come to ruin?
F.E.R. Yes; and the outward *has* come to ruin. People have attached undue importance to the outward bond. The bond is in the soul really. The character in which Christ is known is another important point. Some souls know Christ as Lord, but they do not know Him as Head. It is a question of that which is
{337}
to characterise us who are gathered. I was speaking of *building*, not of gathering.
J.S.O. Though I agree with what is said as a whole about gathering, still you would not keep out of fellowship any soul that had peace?
F.E.R. Certainly not.
W.H. "Let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon". What is that?
F.E.R. He is warning them against building what is perishable. We read in chapter 10 that Israel had the symbols of spiritual things -- baptism and spiritual food and spiritual drink. Yet the most part perished in the wilderness by the flesh because they had no vital connection with Christ. The one body flows from the truth that all the members are one in the Head -- unity flows from union.
J.S.O. It is right to have the desire that the saved should be gathered out, but there is a danger of making it an object to get them to the table, instead of seeking so to minister Christ to souls that they come out to Him.
F.E.R. We are set in the close of the church's history, not in the days of the first gathering out of the world. Unity is certain to come if you could only minister enough of Christ to souls.
B. You must minister Christ to them to bring them in.
F.E.R. You bring them in to form them in the truth of the temple. You have not done with souls when they are gathered. They come out truly through the influence of pressure within. You must minister the truth in Christ to them afterwards.
J.S.O. Three things have to be distinguished: Christian *standing*, Christian *state*, and Christian *practice*. Then there is also progress or growth.
F.E.R. Here you get the beginning of it, the foundation which is Jesus Christ. There is a difference
{338}
between knowing Christ as Lord and as life. *State* connects itself with knowing Christ as life.
G.P. Christian state is spoken of among us, and people think it is walk.
F.E.R. That proves they do not know Christ as life. It is all the difference between seeing Christ in Romans, Colossians, and Ephesians. In Romans, He is Lord. In Colossians, He is Head, and you get all the moral excellencies of life brought out. In Ephesians, it is His exaltation as Man; it is not a question there of Lordship, nor of His completeness as Head; but as *Man*, He fills all things. We have to learn Colossians -- the completeness of the Head: proper Christian state comes out of that. He is Head to the church, and Lord to the individual. You first individually find Him Head, and then as Head to the church. In Romans, everything is made to hang on the possession of the Spirit.
J.S.O. Until you get the Spirit and Christ in you, you are not in the Christian state.
F.E.R. No; but you are started when you get the Spirit. The formative work begins with the Spirit. When you get to Colossians, you get something further, *Christ* is in you; and in Ephesians, further still: you are "raised up together, and seated together in him".
B. How would you proceed in seeking to find out the state of the individual?
J.S.O. I always try to find out if the person can cry, "Abba, Father", and understands that he belongs to the body of which Christ is Head in heaven; and that being gathered is not joining a body of Christians. You can hardly lay down rules.
B. The building up would take place in visiting. It is not leaving it to an evangelist, but building up is a continuous thing.
F.E.R. To give souls the idea spiritually is the thing. You must present Christ as Head for that.
{339}
W.B. Would you ask them if they have faith for the path?
J.S.O. One can hardly go into detail. The thing is to have the principles.
D.L.H. "On *this rock* I will build my church", @Matthew 16. What is the force of that? Do you say the rock is in your heart?
F.E.R. It is the fruit of the revelation to the soul of Christ as the Son of the living God. The rock is, so to say, in the soul. Christ is laid in the soul as foundation -- the confession is the rock. It is the Person of the Son of the living God, but apprehended as such by the soul. There is the apprehension of the revelation in the soul, so that He is confessed. Where was the beginning of it in @Matthew 16? It was in Peter's soul.
T.H.R. You would not have what was really divine as to it in Peter's soul if it were not a revelation.
F.E.R. I do not think it went much further with Peter till Pentecost, but the rock was there; it was the apprehension of Christ outside the whole order of things with which He was connected down here. It could not fully come out till He had entirely broken with the links connected with flesh and blood.
W.B. You speak of the rock as subjective?
F.E.R. Yes, I do.
J.S.O. The person partook of the nature of the rock; and the revelation cannot be separated from the Person of the Son of God.
F.E.R. Exactly. You must be careful that you build on the foundation what is congruous. The rock is not objective -- the Person is objective.
T.H.R. I do not think that you will find it anything very new, that the rock is the revelation of the Person of Christ as Son of the living God by the Father. Christ builds His church upon this real and living work of the Father's revelation in souls.
F.H.B. The stone (Peter) was of the rock?
{340}
F.E.R. Yes; was built on to the rock. The stones have to be built up. The truth was put into Peter's soul. A man is proved to be a stone by the confession. There is a laying a foundation in people's souls of Christ, and there is a building up a superstructure. Saints have in the experience of their souls to come to Christ as the Living Stone -- and thus they are built up.
Ques. Is @Matthew 16 and @1 Peter 2: 4 the same thing?
F.E.R. One (@Matthew 16) is the divine intent; the other (@1 Peter 2: 4) the experimental side "*To whom coming*".
J.P. The truth that has been before us this afternoon is immensely important, it will bring down the 'how much', and bring up the 'what sort'.

PAUL'S TEACHING SUBSTANTIATED BY JOHN'S IN VIEW OF THE LORD'S COMING
It may be of service at this moment to bring under the attention of saints the place filled in Scripture by the writings of Paul and John respectively, and the relation in which the one stands to the other in regard to their inspired testimony, for it must not be forgotten that though each inspired instrument has his own distinct line, all the writings go to form one homogeneous whole.
It may be remarked at the outset that whatever place John filled as an honoured and inspired instrument of inspiration, he had no *distinctive* commission given to him as regards public service in the world. He occupied a place in testimony in common with Peter and the twelve, but he laid no distinctive foundation. Peter was specially commissioned to feed and shepherd the sheep and lambs of Christ. Paul had a special mission to Gentiles in the gospel, and to enlighten all as to the administration of the mystery, but John was to tarry till Christ came. Hence we find Peter building up new-born saints (Jews of the dispersion) as a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, and Paul as a wise master-builder laying a foundation, but the same thing is not found in John's epistles, which serve rather to guard saints from being turned aside from what was from the outset, that is, as to Christ.
In the gospel of John and in his epistles we find scarcely an allusion to the assembly in any aspect, though we do find there truths which are essential to it. In the Revelation the Lord shows to John in a mystical way the assemblies in Asia as an existing fact, and He makes known through John the decline and partial recovery that were to have place in the assembly as a whole; but the point of view is the assembly as
{342}
in responsibility, and viewed as departed in heart from its espousal, which had been the special work of Paul. All this is shown to John, not as a fresh revelation, but as "the things which are" in view of the introduction of things that should be after these, for obviously the latter could not come in until the end of "the things that are" had been made clear. In the end of the Revelation, John is permitted to see the heavenly city, the bride, the Lamb's wife, in its relations earthward, so to say. The aim of Paul's ministry had been to set the saints before God in heavenly places according to the truth of the calling of the bride; while John sees her as the holy city descending from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. The assembly is then seen as the intermediary through which God will display His glory to men, and this connects itself with the general line of truth in John; but I think it must be admitted from what has been said that in no sense or aspect can the assembly be regarded as the distinctive work of John. No dispensation of it was committed to him. All he has is, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".
The foregoing remarks will serve to clear the ground for what follows.
It is commonly thought, and perhaps justly, that John's writings are historically the latest of Scripture, but, while admitting this, it must be remembered that to Paul, and not to John, was given to complete the word of God, by the unfolding of the mystery. What is given to us in the writings of John develops nothing as to God's dispensations, but serves to fill out and confirm what was already there. As to God's dispensations there can be nothing beyond Paul, in whose writings alone we have the two great parts of Christianity, namely, the gospel of the glory and the mystery. My present object is to seek to make clear to any who may read, the relation in which John's writings stand to Paul's.
{343}
It has been often observed that when decay and failure began to be manifest in the assembly viewed as a system set up here on earth, the apostle Paul in his epistles to Timothy and Titus falls back on the promise of life in Christ Jesus, a truth which now became prominent with him, and he speaks of himself as apostle, according to the hope of it. When the assembly, having become corrupted, could no longer safely be leant on as the pillar and base of the truth, eternal life in Christ comes specially into notice, and apart from the knowledge of it the truth of the assembly according to the thought of God cannot now be apprehended. According to Paul's general line of teaching, eternal life tends to connect saints with the purpose of God as displayed in Christ in glory, and to separate believers thus in mind and spirit from the corruption which prevails down here, and at the present time it is, I judge, the way by which the truth of the assembly must be reached.
It does not mean that the truth of the assembly is in any way put in the shade, but that eternal life is the road by which the truth of the assembly must be learned. It was simple in the early days for the saved ones to be added to the assembly, and they were thus practically sheltered from the untoward generation around; but when the assembly has been leavened by evil, and become a place of shelter for every evil thing, the way of return to the truth must of necessity be difficult. To keep Christ's word, and not deny His name, and to know that He has loved the assembly, demands personal acquaintance with Himself. In other words, the knowledge of 2 Corinthians must in souls precede that of 1 Corinthians. I refer, of course, to spiritual apprehension -- Christ written in the heart, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, is needed now to emancipate a soul from the corruptions of Christendom, so that it may enter spiritually into the truth of the assembly. Many may be brought
{344}
ostensibly on to what is termed church ground who have no spiritual apprehension whatever of the assembly, for the reason that they know little or nothing of life in Christ, which places them morally outside the whole course of things here. In the true power of it as seen in Paul, we know no one after the flesh.
I have before referred to the fact that Paul carries the thought of eternal life on to conformity to Christ in glory, but there is certainly no intention by this to relegate the truth of it to the future. His ministry was of the new covenant, and had special reference to Christ being written in the heart; and by looking at the glory of the Lord we are changed into the same image from glory to glory. He would have saints sow to the Spirit, that of the Spirit they might reap eternal life, and desires Timothy to lay hold on eternal life to which he was called. Now it is here that, as appears to me, the writings of John are of the greatest moment to us. He comes in in a way in which neither Paul, nor Luke, the companion of Paul, could. He bears witness of Christ as having been with Him from the outset. From him we learn how the question of eternal life had its solution in what had been manifested in Christ here on the earth, unknown of the world and refused by His own.
The first great feature of John's testimony as to Christ is the declaration of the Father, that is, God revealed toward the world as love, and as now having in the Son, as man, an adequate and sufficient object for the satisfaction of His love. Then we have the great work effected by Christ in removing from before God, by the cross, all that was contrary to God and that compromised His glory in order that those given to Christ by the Father might be set in His own place as objects here of the Father's love, and receive from the Son the water which He gives to be in them a well of water springing up to eternal life, thus connecting
{345}
them livingly with Himself. This was actually accomplished in @John 20, and we have the solution of the question of eternal life in the midst of a world that remained unchanged, and which by the Spirit's presence was convicted of sin. What I have brought forward as to John is parallel to the truth in @Romans 8. But there was yet another point in John's testimony as to Christ. The Lord in leaving the world spoke of sending another Comforter from the Father, who besides bringing to the remembrance of the disciples all things that Jesus had said to them, would testify of Christ in glory. Hence in John's first epistle we find that after bearing witness of what they (the apostles) had heard and seen, John has in chapter 5 to bring in the Spirit as witness to Christ as last Adam (come by water and blood) in glory, and this corresponds to @2 Corinthians 3. But further, in @John 16, we find the Spirit would glorify Christ, would take of His things and show them to His own, and all that the Father had were His. Now this carries us out into a range of things not further developed in John's writings, things which eye has not seen nor ear heard, which have not entered into man's heart to conceive, things which God has prepared for them that love Him, but which God has now revealed by His Spirit. For these I think we must go to Paul, to whom it was given, by the revelation of the mystery, to complete the word of God. And I think we gain an idea of these things, in what may be described as the climax of the revelation to Paul, in @Ephesians 3, for the comprehension of which we need to be strengthened according to the riches of God's glory with all might by His Spirit in the inner man that the Christ may dwell by faith in our hearts. It is sad indeed to reflect that it is in Ephesus the point of declension is noted to John.
What has been said may in a measure serve to show the interconnection of the Scriptures, and the impossibility of our gaining any full and adequate idea of all
{346}
the counsel of God without the help of John; while at the same time Paul's testimony remains as the work of the wise architect. Not that I would in any way cloud the peculiarly lovely and blessed character and the intrinsic value of John's writings in themselves; but it is very necessary that the various parts of the divine revelation should have their due place in our souls, and be formed there into what they are, as one homogeneous, harmonious whole.
{347}
LIGHT
@Matthew 15
It appears to me that in Scripture there are two distinct senses in which light is spoken of, namely, as exposing, and revealing. I think we have been accustomed to connect with light too exclusively the former idea. In natural light we have an analogy; by the bright rays of the great light appointed by God to rule the day, not only is everything which comes within their action exposed, but the heat and vivifying power which emanate from the source of light accompany and cannot be separated from the rays. They are felt and appreciated by everything not utterly insensible and devoid of feeling. Thus it was when Christ was here. He was the light of the world, and those who came within the rays of this light found themselves exposed; but there was with, and characterising those rays, a warmth and power which attracted hearts that felt the weariness engendered by the sin and coldness of the world; and the Lord could say, "He that followeth me shall not continue in darkness, but shall have the light of life".
Men welcome increased light in science and natural things, which really means increased knowledge. How much more does the christian heart welcome the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
Now in the passage before us we have a striking illustration of the application of light in two aspects, that is, as exposing and revealing, the first a necessity of righteousness, the second, so to say, a necessity of love.
In the answer to the scribes and Pharisees, the Lord, using the word of the prophet Isaiah, exposes the true character of all human religious service without the
{348}
true knowledge of God, and subsequently to the disciples He shows the true dark character of the human heart, the source of all that morally defiles a man.
Man is, since the fall, departed in heart from God, but he cannot in conscience totally ignore God, of whose existence there are too many evidences, and whose word is too well vouched to be easily set aside. Hence he renders to God outward service, honouring Him with his lips while his heart is far from Him. There is the total absence of real affection toward God, the heart not having learnt that God has loved him. What should we think in the family circle of children who, while maintaining outward propriety of demeanour in their intercourse with their parents, made it manifest by the lack of warmth and reality that their hearts were devoid of affection? And is God to be worse served than parents? Does man owe less to Him? Hence it is not difficult to apprehend the completeness of the Lord's exposure of the worthlessness of human service of God. And it is in principle as true in Christianity as in Judaism.
Nor is the exposure of the human heart less severe. What application could temptation by evil have to a heart that was not already in touch with the evil? Satan undoubtedly acts on the heart of man, but only to call into activity principles of evil already dwelling there. Such is the desperate state of things existing in man which was exposed by the light that came into the world.
But if all had ended here the case would have been sad indeed. The exposure would have been complete enough, but the poor exposed heart left without hope, without being made acquainted with good.
But in the case of the Canaanitish woman, we have another side of the picture, and the revelation of what is the true basis and starting point of all relationship of man with God.
{349}
When God created man, man could not be said to be a dog; nor could he have been acquainted with the moral goodness of God, for he knew neither good nor evil. He knew God as a beneficent Creator, and One who cared for his well-being; but I do not think he knew God spiritually; but, so to speak, through the medium of created things, and of all that had been established and ordered in relation to himself on earth. The first man is out of earth, earthy. But with the fall all was changed. Man had acquired the knowledge of good and evil, but was withal alienated in heart from God. Hence the necessity of which the Lord speaks in @John 3 of a man being born again, in order that a spiritual craving may be created in his soul, which nothing but the apprehension of God spiritually can satisfy.
But then it is that he is content to accept the place of a dog, of one who, as regards God, has been without shame or sensibility, and thus left without claim on God, save on His compassion. Such is the place the soul has to take in truth; but only to find that divine goodness and power have come within reach of the appropriation of the most degraded here, with the full knowledge of their degradation, the great divine end being that the love of God might be revealed to the heart of man. This is light, or rather love revealed as light, good for the feeblest heart. The Son of man must be lifted up to bear the whole weight of the judgment that rested on man by reason of sin, that God might be revealed as love to the poor human heart, and the believer be enabled by the Spirit to respond to that love which has been manifested to him in the gift of the only-begotten Son of God. The love of God is shed abroad in the believer's heart by the Holy Spirit given him, and now by the Spirit cries, Abba, Father. Not only has he reached blessing but liberty.
Truly no one need be afraid of light, for grace
{350}
gives now as heavenly light what soon will be our part. The more that light is admitted, though we are searched by it, the more we become acquainted with the unfathomable depths of divine goodness and love, and the more capable we are to be here intelligently for the will of God, the whole body full of light.
{351}
"UPON THIS ROCK I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH"
@Matthew 16: 13 - 18
When the Lord comes into the coasts of Caesarea-Philippi, He questions the disciples as to what the people said of Him, and then as to what *they* said of Him, and Peter confessed, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". No one could have told what change was coming in; the confession of Peter determined it. The Father had revealed something to Peter, and that revelation determined what was to come in consequent on the rejection of Christ: not only that Christ was rejected, but He had rejected them, "He left them and departed". We come then to Peter's confession, which brought to light what was to supplant all that existed. Hence He says: "Blessed art thou Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it". Now, the thought of the church is very familiar to us, though many people associate very wrong ideas with it, and look upon it as either a material building, or an organisation of men; but here it means 'assembly'. I have no doubt that, as to the main idea, Christ was going to build for the day of His glory, not for this world. We find the *present* application of the truth of building in chapter 2 of Peter's first epistle; but in this chapter I think the day of His glory is in view, and the idea of the assembly was determined by Peter's confession. Nothing would have been adequate to that confession but the building of the assembly, nothing else would suit it than that there should be a
{352}
body which should reflect Himself -- be descriptive of Him, in which He would be displayed. The heavenly city in @Revelation 21 shows what it will be in the day of His glory. There is that here that answers to it, but it could not come out here fully. It is now a spiritual house, a holy priesthood; but that does not come up to the full idea. He was about to construct a building in which every stone was to be a reflection of His glory. Peter's confession was an indication that the foundation was laid on which He could build, though the time had not quite come for building. Peter's confession proved him to be a stone: the building is going on now. Christ rejected of His people, is declared to be the Son of God by resurrection, and He builds what is according to Himself. Temples made with hands are no longer the House of God -- they are not Christ's building at all. His assembly is not a material building. Here the Lord sees the foundation; it was the Father's revelation in a living soul, and He says: "On this rock I will build my assembly, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it".
Here was a stone. What constituted Peter a stone was the confession of Christ as the Son of the living God; and it is the same as to every one of us -- we have to come to that. It is more than the apprehension of Christ as Saviour, it is as One who came not from Mary or Joseph or from Israel, but from heaven; and that confession is a proof that a stone is there. There are two thoughts as to building; there is building *in* and building *up*. The stone is built in: it thus forms part of the structure. The confession is very elementary, though it is the effect of the Father's revelation, and the soul has then to be built up. I might be asked, What do you mean by 'building up'? I mean, built up in the divine nature. Christ is going to lead that soul on to the enjoyment of what He Himself knows. It is an immense thing for us to
{353}
apprehend the glory of His Person, for He then leads us into what no one but Himself knows -- the Father's heart, and He imparts what no prophet or law-giver could impart. He dwells in the Father's bosom, and He delights to impart to us the love which He alone knows, that we may respond to that love: that is what I mean by being built up in the divine nature. What I am brought into by the Son of the living God is companionship with Himself. He has relieved me from what was upon me, that I may enjoy what He enjoys and may respond to it. Every Christian has to be built up in the divine nature. In heaven none of our natural peculiarities will be left, not even natural memory: we shall recall only what the Spirit brings to our remembrance. In heaven affections will be spiritual, divine affections reign supreme there. The Son is the object of the Father's affections, and He delights to bring us there. He puts every stone in place, and builds up every one in the divine nature. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, and we are formed by the place in which we are set through grace.
In the glory every stone will reflect Christ; no angularity, no obstruction there, not a bit of *us* will be left -- nothing left but what grace has formed in us. Every stone in that building will reflect Himself and be descriptive of the Builder. There is nothing like the church in eternity: the glory of God is there -- no natural light, no need of sun nor moon -- no need of the most distinguished luminaries, the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof.
The Lord seizes the moment here (He always did seize the moment) of this confession of Peter's. It is wonderful to see what He works. It is of the utmost importance for us to get the idea of His assembly, and not to be content merely with being saved. No doubt Peter entered much more afterwards into all that the revelation meant -- that Christ was not simply Messiah,
{354}
Son of Abraham and of David, according to promise, but Son of the living God.
May God give us great interest in these wonderful revelations, that our faith may be sustained and energised by them.
{355}
BEHOLDING THE GLORY OF THE LORD
@2 Corinthians 3: 18
I add one word in connection with what we have had presented to us, the thought that the servant must come from the Lord. What I add is this: I think the servant needs to be imbued with what is expressed in the Lord, with what is true in Him. I do not think we can enter into service here, according to the mind of God, if we are not beholding the glory of the Lord. The result of beholding it is that it has the greatest effect upon us. We are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Lord the Spirit. The starting-point of ministry is really Christ Himself. Christ is the antitype of what was foreshadowed in Moses. Moses was the minister of the law; Christ is Mediator of the new covenant. What was typical in Moses is now fulfilled in Christ, only what was typical in Moses was veiled. Where he was typical was that his face shone, but when he came to the people he veiled his face, or typically, if I may use the expression, he veiled his glory. There was that which shone in his presence, an effulgence as coming from the divine glory. Here we have the antitype, and as we look at it we are changed into the same image. I want just to say a word in regard to the thought of the glory. Glory has been said to indicate divine satisfaction, and divine satisfaction rests in Christ. He is the true starting-point and principle of God's ways with man. It is Christ in contrast to law. It is the divine pleasure that the One who bore the curse should be the display -- the minister of blessing, and all divine satisfaction is connected with the ministry of blessing. It is the positive delight and pleasure of heaven not only to relieve man of every pressure lying upon him, but to dispense every possible blessing in the power of the Holy Spirit.
{356}
There are two features, it is the ministration of the Spirit, as well as the ministration of righteousness -- one part is to relieve, the other to establish in the greatest possible blessing. All this really begins with Christ. There is not one single bit of ministry carried out down here but what begins with Christ. "He is ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men". All divine satisfaction, divine delight is expressed in Christ. It is beholding the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image and we drink in, into the divine satisfaction which rests in Christ. It is a wonderful thing that there is a ministry of blessing as well as of relief and connected with heaven in the power of the Holy Spirit, who is given -- as we read in Galatians, "That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles in Christ Jesus that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith". We look at the glory of the Lord: the divine satisfaction expressed in Christ. There is a man there, and all the power for ministry comes from there, and every servant starts *from* Him, and is imbued with what begins *in* Him. Now we see that glory in the face of Jesus, and are changed into the same image. I can say, I begin to understand something of my elevation down here -- not elevation of the flesh -- but I would not exchange places with the greatest person in the world if it were possible. How could I? What greater privilege could you have down here? To relieve man of all the pressure under which he is lying, that he may be established by the Spirit of God in the very greatest and highest blessing. There are three great things which God effects in men. You get them in @John 3 and 4. First, new birth; second, the revelation of Himself as love to the soul; third, the communication of the well of water which springs up to everlasting life. Perhaps ministry has not much to do with the first, but ministry has a good bit to do with the second. God
{357}
has set Christ forth to be a mercy-seat through faith in His blood, to be the starting-point of all His relations with men in the power of the Spirit; and then the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given to us, and we respond to it: we cry "Abba, Father". As the servant of the Lord I want nothing, I am independent of all. Of course, I am glad to see fruit in the saints, as the apostle says to the Philippians. He could, and you can, serve down here without any thought of present recompense, but delighted to see fruit in the saints that would abound to their account. That is the blessed pathway of service. I see nothing like the moral superiority of it anywhere else. You can only understand it by beholding the glory of the Lord, and so being changed. There is no reason to veil *that* face, and that is the starting-point. May God give us to understand it, and to know what it is really to be with our eyes in that direction, and drinking into the Spirit that rules now in God's ways with men.
{358}
PHILADELPHIA
@Revelation 3: 7 - 13
I desire to point out what I think is indicated in this epistle. We get in it a return to the true relations between the church and Christ, and that is a very great thing. We get the attitude of Christ toward the church, and the attitude of the church toward Christ. Two things mark this return: one is, "Thou hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name"; and the other is, "I will make them ... to know that I have loved thee". Now it is very interesting to see this coming to light just at the close of the church's history, to see the indication of a return of first principles. Philadelphia represents in the Lord's eyes the whole church; when He says, "I will make them ... to know that I have loved thee", that is true of the entire church. The church was left here to be *for Christ* -- to display the characteristics of Christ, not to acquire a renown of her own. She was the depositary of the truth, to keep His word and not to deny His name. She was to be separate from the world. If there is no separation, there is no holiness. Holiness can only be preserved in separation from the contamination of the world, as we get in @2 Corinthians 6, "Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord". The church characteristically is a company where His word is kept, and His name is not denied. It is a great thing to be found here faithful to the word of Christ, and walking here in rigid separation from all that is unworthy of His name.
I am bound to be exclusive. If there is a company of Christians who are keeping His word and not denying His name, it is a service to the whole church, because it maintains the standard. "I have *loved thee*". It is everything to get back to the sense of the
{359}
love of Christ to the church. If you want to be devoted to Christ, you must come under the influence of *His love*. If I may say so, what we lack is real devotedness of heart to Christ. In verse 10 we get a positive promise: "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation". There may be a company in the truth of Philadelphia, but the promise applies to the whole church. The hour of temptation will try the dwellers upon earth. You cannot help dwelling on the earth, but morally you can be out of it.
"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out". It is a very great thing to have given up the idea of having any renown *down here*. I do not think our place is renown, the proper place of the church is death to all that is here. We cannot take a step without it. We shall have renown, because we shall be publicly identified with Christ in all these things promised to the overcomer. If we give up church-distinction *here*, we shall have it in the millennium, we shall be renowned in *His* renown.
"I will write upon him my new name". It is what He is in relation to the church. It is a very great thing that there should be a company here who are true to Christ, and who realise that the church is the object of His love. The one thing is that our souls should be brought under the influence and power of His love. It will make us devoted. The Lord give us to be of that company who keep His word and do not deny His name, and to have a deeper sense of His love to the church -- the pearl of great price. "He went and sold all that he had and bought it". Just as the love of God produces confidence in Him, so the love of Christ produces devotedness to Him.
{360}
THE GREAT PRINCIPLES OF RULE AND LIFE IN CHRIST
@1 John 3: 1 - 24
F.E.R. I would suggest for our reading the subject of the relation of Christ to the world, and the great principles of rule and life in Christ.
We get one point in chapter 2: "And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world", which seems to indicate the position which Christ occupies in regard of the whole world.
Ques. What do you understand by that expression?
F.E.R. Propitiation is a point where the mind of God is favourable in regard to the whole world, that is, in Christ.
Ques. As regards the sins of the whole world?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Then it is not the idea of expiation?
F.E.R. No; I think propitiation is the point where God is favourable.
Ques. Do you connect it at all with the mercy-seat?
F.E.R. It is the same sort of thought.
Ques. Is it the same in @Romans 3: "Whom he hath set forth to be a propitiation"?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Brought the world into the favour of God?
F.E.R. I would not go so far as that, but God is favourable to all men.
Ques. Do you speak of the world as including all nations of the earth?
F.E.R. Including all men.
Ques. The reconciliation of the world spoken of in @Romans 11 is on that ground?
F.E.R. Yes.
{361}
Rem. You distinguished this morning between the world as an organised system, and those who inhabit it.
F.E.R. Yes; I think Scripture does. All that organised system came under judgment -- "the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me". But you get another expression -- "God so loved the world"; it is not an organised system there, but the people in it. So here, "He is the propitiation ... for the whole world".
Ques. "Love not the world" -- what is that?
F.E.R. That is the world morally. It goes on to say, "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world".
Ques. Do you connect this thought of propitiation with Christ being Head of every man?
F.E.R. I do. I think that is the point in John's writings, especially in the gospel. The Son of God has come, but He is viewed in relation to the world. He is "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world". He came down, not to condemn, but to save the 'world'. "The bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world". The same thought is carried on in the epistle. "He is the propitiation ... for the whole world". It is the width of grace that comes into view.
Ques. "The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world"?
F.E.R. Exactly.
Ques. In Romans you get the propitiation, and in chapter 5 Christ the Head of every man. Is it the same thing?
F.E.R. The last Adam is the mercy-seat.
Ques. Is the width of God's favour as far as the width of Satan's evil?
F.E.R. Yes; all is by one Man. "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned" --
{362}
then after the parenthesis it is -- "so then as it was by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life". All men come into view because Christ is the propitiation for the whole world. Instead of all being in a state of alienation, the world has come into reconciliation by Christ, that is, on the divine side.
Ques. The ground of that is that He gave Himself a ransom for all?
F.E.R. Exactly. Christ discharged every liability under which man was; hence it is: "Through one righteousness towards all men unto justification of life".
Rem. Say a word on liability.
F.E.R. I think men lay under the liability by God's judgment, death and the curse, which it was entirely impossible for man to discharge.
Ques. While you say He took up the liabilities under which man lay, you would not go so far as to say He bore the actual sins of every one?
F.E.R. No, I should not say that at all; but I think you must allow the full bearing of redemption. It is the discharge of all liabilities, and its bearing is toward all. Righteousness of God is toward all -- through "one righteousness towards all men". So Christ is the Mediator between God and men, and God would "have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth". The mind of God is toward all men -- the coming in of Christ has changed everything.
Ques. Please compare chapter 3: 5 and chapter 2: 2. What is the difference?
F.E.R. I do not know. He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him was no sin. I should connect this with what we get in @1 Corinthians 15, "Christ died for our sins". It is a very general thought.
Ques. Is not the great point of this chapter "Abiding in him"?
{363}
F.E.R. The first point is to establish the position of Christ in regard to the world.
Ques. Reconciliation was by death, was it not?
F.E.R. Yes; I think so. But it is in Christ.
Ques. How do you take the latter part of @2 Corinthians 5, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself"?
F.E.R. Death had to come in in order that the liabilities of men might be discharged, but reconciliation is not exactly death; it is in Christ Himself.
Ques. That is, Christ was the point of it?
F.E.R. Quite so; He was and is the point of reconciliation. God has not suspended reconciliation. The point of reconciliation is still there, and the bearing of it is much wider now than even when Christ was upon earth.
Ques. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world"?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Would you say a little word as to the extent of redemption?
F.E.R. Redemption referred to God's inheritance, and if God saw fit to take up all men as His by creation, He was entitled to do so.
Ques. Is not the thought connected with redemption -- that God had the right to take it up?
F.E.R. Man belonged to God by His right of Creator, and He takes everything up, not simply on that ground, but by the right of redemption.
Rem. I think you spoke one time about redemption being connected with the sovereignty of God and the purpose of God.
F.E.R. I have no doubt it is the way to the accomplishment of God's purpose; but in @Romans 3 it is the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, its bearing is towards all. The righteousness of God is the rights of God, and God had rights of redemption. The law expressed what you may call the natural and primary rights of God, then God came out in
{364}
redemption right in Christ to take up the liabilities under which man was.
Ques. Is salvation a larger term?
F.E.R. Salvation comes in consequent upon righteousness. If you have not righteousness of God, you could not get salvation. There could be no salvation so long as man was labouring under liabilities in regard of God. The children of Israel could not have been brought through the Red Sea if there had not been the blood in Egypt.
Ques. Is there not a thought of the inheritance belonging to the Redeemer before He could come in?
F.E.R. Yes. It is the man who has the rights of the property that can effect redemption.
Rem. But the Lord Jesus Christ come in flesh had a distinctive place to take up certain rights.
F.E.R. He comes in to take all up on behalf of God.
Rem. Yet you could hardly say that God does actually take up His rights in regard of all men.
F.E.R. God has done so -- in Christ. Christ is said to be a light of the Gentiles and God's salvation to the ends of the earth. Men were in darkness and alienation, but now "the grace of God that bringeth salvation to all men hath appeared".
Rem. The world organisation denies that.
F.E.R. The world organisation is Babylonish.
Ques. Do you mean that man comes into a place of relation with God?
F.E.R. I would not go so far as that. I think God has assumed a place in regard to men. You must take it on the divine side.
Ques. Would it be right to say that whilst redemption has its bearing towards all men, only those who believe on the Son of God have their part in it?
F.E.R. The scripture is plain in regard to that in @Romans 3: 22 - 24: "Righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all ... through the redemption
{365}
which is in Christ Jesus". When we come into it, we can take it up and say, "In whom we have redemption". I suppose the gospel could not be preached if it were not toward all men.
Ques. Then if the gospel were not world-wide in its bearing, it could not be preached to all?
F.E.R. No. Grace and righteousness are in @Romans 3 almost interchangeable terms.
Ques. Do you connect grace with redemption?
F.E.R. Yes; so also righteousness.
Rem. The connection of grace and righteousness is a very interesting and important point.
F.E.R. The way in which righteousness of God has come out is in grace toward all men; but then it is righteousness on the part of God. Redemption undoubtedly means grace toward all men.
Ques. So that you could hardly have a more wonderful expression of His grace?
F.E.R. God takes very good care of His own rights, and He had the right of redemption. He chooses to come out in that right in grace to man; but then redemption is an expression of the righteousness of God.
Ques. "Being justified freely by his grace" -- does not that link righteousness and grace?
F.E.R. Yes. You have in that verse righteousness, grace and redemption inseparable. Redemption is the discharge of liabilities -- Christ came to discharge all liabilities in regard of all men.
Ques. What was due was due to God?
F.E.R. Yes; there were liabilities which God had imposed, and it was in the right of God to discharge them. God came in in Christ to discharge them, and Christ has come in as the Mediator between God and men.
Ques. There is no point of Satan having any rights?
{366}
F.E.R. All the rights are taken out of the hand of Satan by redemption.
Ques. What is the difference between redemption and purchase, "He bought the field"?
F.E.R. Redemption is in Christ -- that is more than purchase.
Rem. But purchase might be without any previous right whatever.
F.E.R. Quite so.
Ques. Could you say in @2 Peter 2 -- even denying the Lord that 'redeemed' them?
F.E.R. No.
Ques. In @Matthew 13 He bought the field for the treasure?
Rem. But that is more the thought of 'bought' than redemption.
F.E.R. "Denying the Lord that bought them" -- such were not in redemption. We are always mixing up our side with God's side. You will never see anything right on our side if you do not see it on God's side.
Ques. Is it not important that it is the "redemption that is in Christ Jesus"?
F.E.R. Quite so; but that is in God's ways to men. I could not say that all men are redeemed, but I could say that God has come out in the right of redemption, and it has its application to all men.
Ques. There is redemption to all men?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. The bearing of redemption being towards all is not teaching universal redemption?
F.E.R. No. The point is that in virtue of redemption Christ stands in a certain position in regard of all, and that all are being tested by Christ. There are two things in Christ in regard of men -- one is kingdom and the other is light. All are being tested by them. If there is kingdom, man has to come under rule. If there is light, man has to come out of darkness.
{367}
Ques. When you speak of men being tested, of course it is those who have heard these things. What about those who have not?
F.E.R. I cannot say; I leave that to God.
Rem. The gospel is the test now (@John 3): "He that believeth not is condemned already".
F.E.R. That is the Jew.
Ques. "This is the condemnation, that light has come into the world" -- that had its application to the Jew?
F.E.R. The wrath of God came upon the apostate Jews for their rejection of Christ. The wrath of God is coming on all men if they reject the gospel.
Ques. What do you make of "By nature the children of wrath, even as others"?
F.E.R. Man was obnoxious to wrath; but God has approached man in Christ, and now man is being tested by Christ.
Ques. What are man's liabilities?
F.E.R. That under which man was -- death and judgment. Christ took all, was made a curse; died for us; entered into the judgment of God. The Jew was tested by Christ and the wrath of God came upon them -- they were not subject to the Son.
Ques. Do you draw a distinction between the judgment of God and the wrath of God?
F.E.R. Wrath may be more governmental. Judgment goes further.
Ques. "Now is the judgment of this world" -- would not that take in Jew and Gentile?
F.E.R. All the world is subject to the judgment of God, yet the judgment of God does not come in. How do you account for that? The truth is, it is explained by the fact of a Mediator coming in on the ground of redemption, the whole position is changed, and the world is brought provisionally into reconciliation and standing in the goodness of God. God is a Saviour God toward all men.
{368}
Ques. God has created that position?
F.E.R. Yes; you have only to contrast @Romans 3 and 11.
Rem. In the preaching of the gospel the judgment came in in @Acts 10.
F.E.R. Yes; but that is no comparison. It only goes so far there as to state the truth that Christ is the One appointed of God to be the Judge of the quick and the dead, and then Peter goes on to unfold the present position, "To him give all the prophets witness".
Rem. But that does not necessarily involve the great white throne, "Judge of the quick and dead".
F.E.R. I suppose it goes on to it.
Rem. Judgment of the dead -- it must go on to the great white throne -- "quick and dead".
Ques. Does propitiation lead to reconciliation?
F.E.R. Propitiation is more the basis of reconciliation. The two are very intimately connected. Christ is the propitiation, and you could not have reconciliation without propitiation.
Ques. You could not have anything without propitiation?
F.E.R. No; it is the ground of everything. Men are now being tested by Christ, and what is presented to man in Christ is kingdom and life. The kingdom is rule, and I think men are being tested by those two things.
Ques. It is what you meant at the beginning when you said Christ takes a place in relation to the world for rule and life?
F.E.R. The great point now is, man is declared to be lawless, and the question is, will he come under the sway of God?
Rem. That is why the gospel of the kingdom was preached in the Acts.
F.E.R. Exactly. Christ has come in as the Sun of righteousness, and "he that abideth in him sinneth
{369}
not". Then life comes in by the Spirit and is seen in love to the brethren: "We know we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren".
Ques. And could the testimony be carried to the remotest corners of the earth?
F.E.R. You want to carry the kingdom and Christ.
Rem. Paul speaks of "obedience of faith among all nations".
F.E.R. Yes, that is it. The first thing is to come into righteousness, and the next thing is, you come into life.
Ques. What is the difference between salvation and life?
F.E.R. The two go together. Salvation accompanies life.
Ques. With reference to the kingdom -- how does the kingdom test man?
F.E.R. I think the expression of the kingdom is in Christ. Christ is the centre and Sun of the divine system, and the way by which man comes into righteousness is by the attraction that is in Christ -- Christ being the Sun of righteousness. The point is whether men will come into righteousness. Christ is the perfect and full expression of God's righteousness, and the point is -- will man come into righteousness?
Ques. How will that test man?
F.E.R. It serves to bring out whether man will answer to grace. God is presenting Himself in grace to man in Christ, and man is responsible in regard of the gospel.
Ques. Where does believing come in?
F.E.R. Believing is the effect of the presentation. The apostles went about preaching the kingdom of God everywhere, and it was accepted in faith.
Ques. It is a question whether man will bow to Christ and own Him as Lord?
F.E.R. Exactly. The question is whether man
{370}
will accept the grace of God and come under the moral sway of grace, and thus receive the kingdom.
Rem. You could not limit a man's responsibility to his reception or rejection of Christ and the gospel.
F.E.R. I think it is a very serious responsibility, and man's responsibility at the present moment is in regard to the gospel. The Lord Himself says, "He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned". "This is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another". It is the ordinance of God. A man has to come into judgment because he has been in lawlessness. I think the presentation of grace and redemption in Christ is the power of attraction to man. God is appealing to man on the ground of redemption, and the point is whether man is content to come in on that ground. If he does, he gets living water, so that he comes into life.
Ques. Would you say that growing up to salvation and coming to Christ as the living stone is concurrent?
F.E.R. Salvation and life are concurrent, and everything is in Christ, whether salvation or life. "I have set thee a light to the Gentiles, that thou mightest be my salvation". It is an immense thing to see the peculiar character of this moment, when God has reckoned up the whole world, and all the world is subject to the judgment of God, but instead of the judgment coming in, God is shown as favourable in regard of all. It is a vindication of God. God's grace towards all men hath appeared, and the point is whether men are content to find righteousness in Christ. If they are, they get the gift of the Spirit so that they may come into life.
Ques. Is it not at that point that intercession comes in?
F.E.R. We are to pray for all men, because God
{371}
would have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. (See @1 Timothy 2: 1 - 4.)
Ques. Then God has not one disposition towards us and another disposition towards the heathen?
F.E.R. No. It is a wonderful thing to see that everything that is in Christ is God's thought for all men -- whatever is presented to man in Christ. It is not simply for the elect, it is His thought for all men. The Son of God was revealed in the apostle that he might preach Him as glad tidings among the heathen.
Ques. Do we think sufficiently of the heathen today in connection with that?
F.E.R. Perhaps not. Christ is the righteousness of God; now the point is, He becomes righteousness to those who believe.
Ques. Is the force of "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved" the way into blessing?
F.E.R. You get that thought in Romans, "with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation".
Rem. Say a little word about abiding in Him.
F.E.R. It is a beautiful expression, "He that abideth in him sinneth not"; you can come to perfection. I think it is a great thing to see there is a way to perfection. "He was manifested to take away our sins, and in him is no sin" -- He is the Sun of righteousness. There are spots in the sun, but there is no dark spot in Him -- and "He that abideth in him sinneth not".
Ques. Is that the way the truth makes us free?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. If we always lived in respect to Him, we should not sin?
F.E.R. Exactly, because there would be the setting aside of the whole principle of sin in you. We want simply to be in the hands of Christ down here -- that is, under His influence; and being under His influence
{372}
I do not care for anything that does *not* suit Him, and I get a sense of what *does* suit Him.
Ques. What is the connection between perfection and purifying oneself even as He is pure?
F.E.R. I think that is the result of having "this hope in him".
Ques. Is that the idea of abiding in Him?
F.E.R. The effect of abiding in Him is that you get His mind. There are most wonderful things in Christianity, and one is that you can go through the world, and instead of looking at things according to man, you can look at them according to Christ -- I get His intelligence.
Ques. Do we not get a beautiful picture of the kingdom of God in the man "sitting, clothed, and in his right mind"?
F.E.R. Exactly. He was morally under the sway of Christ. He wanted to be with Him. That was not the Lord's mind for him and He sent him to his friends. I think you see the same thing in the disciples around the Lord. The influence of Christ ruled them, though they were very poorly in His mind, for they wanted fire to come down from heaven to consume the Samaritans because they would not receive them. The Lord said, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of". They were not up to the mark. They were of His spirit properly speaking, but His spirit would not command fire to come down from heaven.
Ques. Those who went out to David were greatly influenced by David?
F.E.R. Quite so.
Ques. That gives wonderful liberty both in going out to others and in your own path too?
F.E.R. I think so.
Ques. You said life is a test -- in what way?
F.E.R. I think living water is a test. It is presented to all and becomes a test to men. All men are tested by what we get at the end of Revelation:
{373}
"Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely". The Lord makes a kind of final appeal, saying, "I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star", and then: "And let him that is athirst come".
Ques. I suppose the woman in @John 4 was tested by the Lord in that way?
F.E.R. I think so: "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".
Ques. What is the living water?
F.E.R. It is, I suppose, a symbol of the Spirit of God.
Ques. May one individual be tested by the one test, and another by the other test?
F.E.R. I think it is possible, but I should think the great general test is Christ, because it is Christ who stands in relation to all men.
Ques. If you get the living water it is from Him?
F.E.R. Exactly; but Christ is the test.
Ques. Is there any difference between the water of life and the living water?
F.E.R. I do not know of any.
Rem. I thought that one is the Spirit, and the other is Christ.
F.E.R. I should be inclined to think that both refer to the Spirit.
Ques. Is it life in the power of the Spirit?
F.E.R. I do not think so. I think it is very much more the Spirit as life.
Ques. Do you connect that with @John 20?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What relation has that to "open blind eyes"? That is part of the gospel.
F.E.R. Yes -- so Christ is a covenant to open blind eyes. People talk much about the new covenant, but really it is Christ.
{374}
Rem. It seems a very great point -- "abiding in him".
F.E.R. And so it is. How would the earth get on if it did not abide in the sun? So everything depends on our abiding in Christ. If you do not abide in Christ you will get no rain, no fertility, or anything else.
Ques. So that Christ is presented objectively?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. There is attraction?
F.E.R. Yes; you are attracted and then attached, and when you get attachment you abide in Him. Attachment is by the Spirit, and when that has come in you become fruitful; @Romans 7: 4. We are joined to Christ who is the Husband, and the result is, we bring forth fruit unto God, because we come under the influence of sunshine and rain. What would the world be without sunshine and rain?
Rem. In reference to testing, if God is not at work in souls, there would be no response to the test.
F.E.R. That is another line. There is nothing more important than to keep distinct in mind the situation which God forms, and the work of God in man -- the way by which He effectuates His purpose.
Rem. The situation is the subject of gospel testimony.
Rem. Paul preached the gospel to the whole creation, and "as many as were ordained to eternal life believed".
F.E.R. "He that abideth in him sinneth not" -- the thing that I covet is to have the mind of Christ in regard to whatever meets me in the world -- to look at it with His eyes. That is, Christ in me.
Rem. That is being in the intelligence of Christ.
F.E.R. Yes, the one is the effect of the other. If we abide in Him we are in His intelligence.
Ques. And at the same time the sensibilities of Christ are in you?
{375}
F.E.R. Yes; all the gracious feelings that you get in @Colossians 3.
Rem. Abiding in Christ you have the mind of Christ.
F.E.R. There is another thing in the end of the chapter. We could not talk about life without an atmosphere and a circle of love.
Rem. Explain what you mean by that.
F.E.R. "We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren". It is among the brethren that you get the circle and atmosphere of love. Otherwise there would be no such thing as life.
Ques. Then love is the atmosphere?
F.E.R. Yes; and the brethren are the circle. That is a very important point. First, abiding in Christ and Christ in us. Next, finding yourself in the circle and atmosphere of life, which is love. Then you get the proof and evidence of love, that is, that you get what you ask of God.
Ques. There is a verse in @Psalm 37: "Delight thyself in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thy heart" -- is that what you mean?
F.E.R. Yes. You have only to wait on the Lord and in due time you get your petitions. The Psalms are extremely beautiful. You have to wait on the Lord; do not fret yourself, and He will give you the desires of your heart. You may not get it at the moment. People want some sort of miraculous answer to their prayers, but are not fit for it.
Rem. I have been struck with @Luke 11 -- the necessity of waiting, and the importunity of prayer.
Ques. You must know that you have a hearing?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What John calls "abiding in Christ" would Paul call walking in the Spirit?
F.E.R. It is hardly the same idea. I think walking
{376}
in the Spirit would be a consequence of abiding in Christ.
Ques. It is the way it works?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. So there must be a company to be in the atmosphere of love and to enjoy life?
F.E.R. Yes; but I say *circle* and not company. I think there *is* a company, only let your mind take in the whole Christian company. I never object to talking about a company, if your thoughts take in the entire company. If we cannot come into contact with the entire company, we must make the best of those we can come into contact with. Some people fret themselves because there are better Christians in system than are amongst us. That may be so, but they are not available, you cannot get at them.
Ques. How could they be better if they are lawless?
F.E.R. They may be more true to the light they have. I was only taking people up on their own statement. I would be prepared to admit their proposition.
Ques. How is it one cannot get at them more?
F.E.R. Because we are not up to the mark; there is such a lot of brethrenism about us. We are in terrible danger of getting peculiarities and habits formed by our particular association. We have to guard against that.
Ques. Do you not think we have been disciplined by God in connection with that?
F.E.R. I think so. We ought to get into the thought of individuality. The individual comes into view in @Revelation 2 and 3: "He that hath an ear". We have to look to it that we have an ear.
Ques. Is there not a kind of thought that we ought to get all these sort of Christians amongst us?
F.E.R. Amongst whom? What you want is to get them out of that in which they are entangled.
{377}
Ques. The tendency is to get into isolation?
F.E.R. That is an impossibility. We have all been made to drink into one Spirit -- this is sure to hinder anything like isolation.
Rem. If brethren are in the enjoyment of what they have got, it seems to me that others should share the good things with them.
F.E.R. I think that is the legitimate way.
Rem. I think sometimes in dealing with other Christians we have failed -- we have been so anxious to make proselytes of them.
F.E.R. We have to count upon God for ability to approach other people, but I think it is a great thing to be happy with those with whom we are more immediately linked.
The check to worldliness and worldly ways is to love the brethren.
{378}
ABIDING IN CHRIST
@John 15
F.E.R. It is important to understand that we are called upon to abide in Christ. It does not say abide in a company.
Rem. There would not be vitality in abiding in a company.
F.E.R. No. The idea of abiding in a company comes much more easily to the mind and is more readily grasped than that of abiding in Christ. The church never had a human organisation, it had no centralisation according to man's idea. There was the local company, and there were certain privileges which belonged to it; and if the assembly had no organisation at the beginning, certainly, when Christianity has broken down in the world, there is no good in attempting it.
Ques. Was not Jerusalem recognised as a centre?
F.E.R. God did not give up Jerusalem in a moment, but it never properly belonged to the church.
Ques. Did not Antioch afterwards stand as centre in contrast to Jerusalem?
F.E.R. The energy of the Spirit was there. The peculiarity in the church was that it had a centralisation which men could not understand at all, this was in the Spirit. Popery is centralised in the pope. Every system on earth has some centralisation, it has a committee or something of the kind.
Ques. Was there not an attempt at that in Jerusalem?
F.E.R. Yes; and we see how it worked.
Rem. The apostles who remained at Jerusalem ought to have gone out.
F.E.R. Paul came under its influence when James said to him, "Thou seest, brother, how many thousands
{379}
of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law".
Ques. Did the tendency develop so that the power of the Spirit of God was lost?
F.E.R. I do not know how long this took.
Rem. I suppose the true centre of the church is in heaven.
F.E.R. It is; but there is a centre on earth in the Spirit of God.
Ques. Is there not the same tendency to centralisation now, and the only thing that preserves from it is that things should be seen spiritually?
F.E.R. Yes. Paul, in giving way to James¬ advice, went the opposite way to that of the Spirit.
He failed in the thing in which James encouraged him to succeed, in appeasing the prejudices of the Jews. One would fail now if one started out to please men.
There is a danger of people having the idea of being borne along by a system -- of being attached to a company. There is no company to be borne along by. In the early days of the church it was different. A great many then were carried along by the influence of the company.
Ques. Is it not a great safeguard for young Christians to be held by Christian fellowship?
F.E.R. Yes; but abiding in Christ must come first; you must first be held by Christ. We are in danger of imitating Christendom, getting people converted and brought into fellowship. The true secret and power of fellowship is abiding in Christ. You must have Christ before you have Christian fellowship.
Rem. There is danger of putting a supposed company in the place of Christ.
Ques. What would tend to make souls abide in Christ?
F.E.R. I think the gain of it. We can understand the gain of a man abiding in the sunshine. A man
{380}
steering a ship wants the light of the sun; if he has a compass he wants something to check his compass by. Something may go wrong with the compass, or the ship may go wrong. There is no danger of the sun being deflected.
Rem. It was something of that sort in Peter's mind when he said, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life".
F.E.R. Exactly. The brethren were exhorted to "cleave to the Lord". If they got away from Christ, it would be very much like a man trying to steer his ship without the sun.
Ques. You would not weaken the importance of going on with the saints?
F.E.R. No; that would be the effect. You do not reach Christ through the company, but the company through Christ.
Ques. Would you seek to find out if a soul had attachment to Christ?
F.E.R. Yes; you would see if the bond was there. I do not speak of attachment in the sense of feeling, but of a bond, a recognition in the soul of a bond. The effect of that is abiding in Christ.
Rem. You find men sticking to business because of the gain of it.
F.E.R. You abide in Christ on account of the sunshine of it. No man can know the thoughts of God towards man except in Christ. The effect of abiding in Christ is that a man abides in the light of God's mind. "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another". Fellowship follows.
God is in the light in Christ. Everything outside of Christ is darkness. What is in Christ is outside of sight or sense. Then it is we have fellowship with one another.
Rem. We need not be afraid of Christian fellowship being disturbed if we are abiding in the light. If two
{381}
saints came together both abiding in Christ there would be fellowship.
F.E.R. If people are abiding in Christ, in the light of the sun, it will greatly affect them. They would test everything by that; they would not read half they do. People are greatly tested by what they read. If people were abiding in Christ, they would not care for the common literature that feeds a great many minds.
Rem. They would not fulfil the desires of the flesh or the mind if they were abiding in the sunshine.
F.E.R. Then again it would have a great effect upon them in regard to their pathway. In the details of their pathway things would be exposed to them. They would not take up with things unsuitable. "Whatsoever doth make manifest is light". All that is embraced in the will of God would be reached by us, and what is on the divine side would be taken up in our souls in connection with Christ.
Ques. What about verse 10?
F.E.R. If you abide in Christ, it involves the surrender of your will, because you are guided by Christ, like a mariner adjusts his compass by the sun. Walking in darkness, a man stumbles; if you walk in the light of the sun, you see the pathway. You keep the commandments of Christ, you are swayed and controlled by Him.
Rem. Fruit-bearing is impossible without sunshine.
F.E.R. Entirely. There are two things essential to fruit-bearing, sunshine and rain. Rain is the effect of sunshine, you would not get rain without sunshine. If there is not plenty of sunshine there will not be much rain. Everything is in Christ.
Ques. What do you understand by keeping His commandments?
Rem. It comes to the practical surrender of your own will. Abiding in Christ is the condition on which it hangs. A man who adjusts his compass acknowledges the sun as guide for the compass.
{382}
Ques. How is that brought about?
F.E.R. In the recognition that you are not capable of yourself. The cleverest man on earth is not enough for himself. You ought to recognise that. If you take into consideration all the vicissitudes you have to pass through, no man is enough for himself. You want to be in the light of God. In abiding in Christ there is the continual maintenance of this in the soul. In this world a man can only walk in the light of the sun, and so it is spiritually, we can only walk in the light of Christ, and this not only as regards this world but as to eternity. In @Ephesians 5 you get into the sunshine. "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee". People would in this way overcome the world instead of being overcome by it. Christ's commandments are the law of liberty.
Ques. Is not all that is expressed in Christ become commandment to us in that way, so that we are governed by Christ?
F.E.R. I think so. "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death". To a Christian, commandment would be the direction of a life that loves Christ. Christ Himself is the commandment. The appreciation of Christ lies at the root of keeping His commandments.
Rem. It is necessary to enjoy the expression of life in Him before one can express it oneself.
F.E.R. I want to enjoy Himself. If I would understand what man is in the eye of God I must learn what Christ is. It is a Man who kept His Father's commandments and who abode in His love. It is a Man who is all that; *that* is the point to get hold of. He says, "This commandment have I received of my Father", even as to laying down His life. The commandment is revealed in Him, but He is the One who fulfils it.
Rem. What was expressed in Christ was what He
{383}
was Himself; what has to be expressed in us is Christ.
F.E.R. Christ relatively to God. In Christ there was the perfect setting forth of God to man and the perfect setting forth of man to God. It is a very great thing to think of.
Ques. Is not the vine and the husband (@Romans 7) something of the same thought?
F.E.R. The vine has passed away now, and we *have* the husband. Christ is the beginning of the creation of God. I do not believe in evolution. When God began the creation He had the top in view. All creation takes its character from Christ. You must have Christ in some sense represented in every part of the creation of God. There is some trait of Christ in every part. His being the revealer of the Father is one thing, His being the beginning of the creation of God is another thought.
Ques. Was it not necessary that Christ should take the place of the vine because of Israel's failure?
F.E.R. I would not put it quite in that way, for Israel was not the true vine. Christ always was that though it did not come out till the failure was there; so as to the last Adam, I would not say that He came in *consequent* on the failure of man, though He came in after that failure, but the second Man was the Man of God's purpose. I think the young especially have to learn that they are not to be borne along by a company. There is no company capable of doing it.
Ques. Is it not often that the company is carried on by two or three?
F.E.R. It should not be so.
Ques. What about "the angel of the church", @Revelation 2 and 3?
F.E.R. The angel of the church is mentioned when the church was there. The difficulty now is to find the church. I am afraid of the tendency to look to a company. People have to look to it that they are individually abiding in Christ if they are to be a help
{384}
to themselves or to anybody else, and abiding in Christ involves the surrender of our own wills. Those abiding in Christ are abiding in the sunshine and they get light on all their ways. The danger is that in coming into a company we may think we have everything, and do not think of abiding in Christ. The effect of not abiding in Christ is that you order things, the details of your life, according to man; you dress and furnish your house according to the world; but if you abide in the light everything is affected by the light. If you abide in Christ, you seek to order things morally. You might have a house in most perfect order, and yet morally in the greatest disorder, each one there asserting his own will. Where you live is not the point: the great thing is to be jealous against moral disorder. Outward order is order according to man. The Lord did not care about outward order and proprieties when He was down here. What affected Him was the moral disorder that existed. The Jews were fastidious about outward order. Being under the influence of Christ produces simplicity.
The fact is you get the light of God in Christ. You have the mind of God brought out as to everything. What can be greater than being in the light of Christ! Christ is the measure and expression of God's mind with regard to man. I cannot learn it in myself or in any other Christian, but in Christ. The more I appreciate Christ the more I enter into the mind of God towards man. My apprehension of His mind does not alter it, but I enter into it more. God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself. We want our loins girt about with truth. That would work as to what a man is in the inward parts.
Ques. Has not this side been much lost sight of?
F.E.R. It has been taken up as being our place in Christ.
Now as to fruit -- there is produced in us that which is morally agreeable to God. Fruit comes out very
{385}
much in our relations one with another. Brethrenism is not fruit. We want to get rid of that, of all that is the effect of our particular associations -- the self-complacency, assumption, phraseology, and that kind of thing.
Rem. It would have a wonderful effect on the young if they saw us in the sunshine.
F.E.R. Fruit comes out in our relation one to another -- love, joy, peace, all that is comely. It is never artificial. Fruit is God-ward; it is not service. Service may be fruit, but that is not the idea of fruit.
Ques. Is it not the continuation of Christ here?
F.E.R. Yes. Fruit reproduces itself. Christianity was meant to be maintained by fruit. Fruit being abundant in the circle, the circle would be maintained. God would not allow the circle to pass away if there were fruit.
Fruit came out in the Philippians in sending a gift to Paul. A meeting dies out because there ceases to be fruit, like the churches in Asia. The Spirit was given to attach you to Christ, and now your responsibility is to abide in Christ. It is natural to the Spirit to keep you, but you have to abide.
Ques. Is there any distinction between abiding in Christ and walking in the Spirit?
F.E.R. One is the consequence of the other. Fruit is the same in either case.
Ques. Why is it connected with prayer? "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you".
F.E.R. Getting your petitions is the divinely given evidence that you are in life, as in @1 John 3, "Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight". You are in the circle of love, and you get the proof of it in that God gives you your petitions. The beginning is to abide in Christ; if we are not abiding in Christ, where are we? Abiding in man.
{386}
"The darkness is passing, and the true light now shineth", and the next thing is abiding in the light. It is wonderful how all comes back to abiding in Christ. It is often said a meeting is poor because there is so little ministry. There is sometimes an effort to pour a great deal of ministry on a meeting where there is no sunshine. Ministry will never make up for sunshine. Ministry comes rightly enough when there is plenty of sunshine. You may be sure you will never correct things by ministry. We need a great deal of exercise in the state of things in which we are. Unless things are to go to the bad entirely, we want a great deal of exercise individually with regard to the point of abiding in Christ. It is all very well to go on conforming ourselves to a standard of what is expected amongst brethren, but that is not abiding in Christ. It is a great comfort that Christ is unaltered; He is as available as ever, the sunshine is there. You can touch Christ, and Christ touches you, and He is the perfect expression of God's mind. The sun will not fail us. Paul in prison is what I call a *man*.
Rem. It is in continuance that the test comes, and that means dependence.
F.E.R. Discipline comes in to help us.
Rem. There is a verse in the Psalms which says, "Which holdeth our soul in life".
F.E.R. The one great point for us is the appreciation of Christ. If we appreciate Christ, we turn away from man.
{387}
CHRIST'S ASSEMBLY AND THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
@Matthew 16: 13 - 28
F.E.R. The point that presented itself to me for our reading was @Matthew 16 -- Christ's assembly and the kingdom of heaven.
This begins with the confession of Christ according to the truth of His Person. Everything is now viewed from the divine side. We get three great thoughts: (1) the treasure, in a way, "I will build my assembly"; then (2) the keys of the kingdom of heaven given to Peter; and (3) the kingdom of the Son of man. The keys of the kingdom mean the administration of the kingdom. The assembly is what Christ builds -- the treasure -- you get thus the inward and the outward thing. He buys the field for the treasure; @Matthew 13: 44.
Ques. You would say "my assembly" and the kingdom spoken of here both began at Pentecost?
F.E.R. The assembly was there in a sense before the Holy Spirit came. It became the house of God then, for God dwelt there by the Spirit. Peter had the administration of the kingdom; the administration of the kingdom took place when Christ went on high, else it would not be the kingdom of heaven. The assembly which Christ builds is really mystery -- He hides it.
Ques. Would it be that the Holy Spirit came and sealed what Christ had already built?
F.E.R. Yes; Christ built the house for God; so in Peter it is spoken of as a spiritual house. Christ is not exactly going on building, but in the power of the Spirit the building is expanded or extended.
Rem. In @John 20 they were all of one.
F.E.R. Yes; Christ had held them together; when
{388}
He was here on earth He was doing, to a large extent, the work of the Spirit.
Ques. Does not the public proclamation of the gospel cease from this chapter?
F.E.R. No. The proclamation that Jesus was the Christ ceased, was sealed up, and Christ builds the assembly.
Ques. What is the value of it?
F.E.R. We get an idea of the character of the assembly from the foundation, the rock on which it is built; but the value of it is that in it you get His mind. It is in a sense what the Urim and Thummim were to Israel. We can get His mind by being in the truth of it. It is not an outward, public thing, as saints gathered together at Corinth; in that we see the outward form of the assembly.
Rem. We have thought of manifestation, something to be seen, but it is the treasure, something spiritual.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. It is a great thing to have the mind of Christ down here. Who would understand the bearing of the truth of the seven churches except one in the truth of the assembly? It is a great point to see what the mind of Christ is at any given moment. We want to know what Christ thinks of things. We shall not get that if we are not in the truth of Christ's assembly. The appreciation of Christ, of what He is divinely, gives the foundation.
Rem. It is like @Psalm 73, going into the sanctuary.
F.E.R. Yes, you get His mind.
Ques. Would it be something like the oracle?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. Would you say a word about the temple and the house?
F.E.R. House is more the social aspect of the church; the temple more the shrine. The house of God is the place for which a man learns how to behave himself; @1 Timothy 3. The oracle is connected with the temple. I think God's house is His household. The
{389}
church is the pillar and ground of the truth; the truth of God is deposited in the church; that is, connected with its responsibility. In what we have in @Matthew 16 is involved the mind of Christ. The mind of Christ is here, and there is a way in which it is gained. You come across Christians still entangled in the world and worldly associations, and they have not the mind of Christ. It is dependent on what Christ has built. You do not get His mind if you are not kindred to Christ in nature.
Rem. That is the relation in which Eve stood to Adam.
F.E.R. Exactly. She knew his mind. If you are kindred to Christ in nature you know His mind. There is a response on our part.
Ques. Is that what Peter refers to in his first epistle?
F.E.R. Exactly. As living stones you are built up; you are kindred to the Living Stone. We appreciate His love and we love in response to it. We are one with Him in that way. It is no good talking about our being kindred in nature if there is not mutual affection. Abiding in Christ is being under His influence. It is in the kingdom that He builds His assembly.
Ques. Is there any thought connected with Christ's assembly except getting His mind?
F.E.R. I think that is the great thought, no other suggests itself to me.
Rem. Israel had the mind of God.
F.E.R. Yes; they were Jehovah's assembly.
Ques. What is the application of Urim and Thummim?
F.E.R. That is the divine judgment of everything.
Ques. Does the Lord refer to it in @John 15, "I have called you friends"?
F.E.R. Exactly.
Rem. In Philadelphia they have the mind of
{390}
Christ; a true Philadelphian would be one who understands the truth of the assembly.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. There are not many scriptures which present the assembly in this point of view. The truth of Christ's Person comes out in Peter's confession. Peter confesses Him by the revelation of the Father. The Lord takes the name of Son of man with regard to Himself. The Son of the living God has to do with the assembly; the Son of man is the title connected with the kingdom. What comes in between is the kingdom of heaven. The kingdom of heaven indicates the light which subsists for every man, like the sun rules in the heavens. The kingdom of heaven is preached to every man. The thought in it is not that you get the mind of Christ, but that you see your way. When Peter opened the door of the kingdom to Cornelius and his friends they saw their way. The kingdom of heaven is light by which man can see a way through this world. Light is set in heaven to bear rule on earth. Man has no light in himself. A man may be wise enough in things of this world but at the end may be a fool. Man has no light in him and so must walk in the light of the sun.
Ques. You connect the kingdom more with Christ up there and the church with the Spirit down here?
F.E.R. Yes, I do. The church is the mystery, the mind of Christ resides there. The kingdom of heaven subsists and is preached for every man. In its application it is individual. I can find a way through the world. How can a man who has no knowledge of God's will take a way through the world? The planets have each an orbit, but all have reference to the sun. Christ is our sun. The planets have no light in them; they have light relatively to the sun. Men are brought into the kingdom by receiving it. The subject of testimony is Christ in heaven as a light for men; if a man receives that, he comes into the kingdom and finds a way down here.
{391}
I order my path in God's will. You must apprehend Christ in relation to all men, like the sun in the heavens. The proclamation of forgiveness of sins is in connection with the kingdom. God has set a great moral light in the heavens on the ground of redemption to be there for every man. The apostle preached the kingdom; everybody who preaches now preaches the kingdom -- that Christ is light, on God's side the light is there for every man. In the first part of @Psalm 19 the sun is seen as set in the heavens; then there is the law and testimony of the Lord, etc. It is first Christ as light, then Christ in the heart. Christ is a light for every man. This comes very close to the truth of headship. The sun is the great head of the universe, so Christ is the great head of the moral universe.
Ques. What is the difference between the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God?
F.E.R. One is perhaps more the objective side, and the other the subjective: the kingdom of God seems connected with the Spirit; the kingdom and the assembly are always kept clear; there is what is individual and what is corporate. The kingdom does not raise the question of our relation to one another, it is light for our individual path here. The kingdom of heaven will apparently in the future take the character of the kingdom of the Son of man. He purges it.
The everlasting gospel is hardly the gospel of the kingdom, but an appeal to men to fear God because the hour of His judgment is come. The Lord is now in heaven, not here, and that gives character to the kingdom. The Thessalonians were evidently in the good of the kingdom. The power of the kingdom of heaven is moral; in the kingdom of the Son of man the power will be also actual and evident. The kingdom of heaven is light: man has no light in himself, he is dependent on light that comes from another
{392}
scene. If you are in the light of heaven -- that is, in the light of Christ -- you will know that God is going to head up all things in Christ, and will order your path in reference to that.
Rem. Every one must be in the kingdom before he can be in the assembly.
F.E.R. Yes, morally. The kingdom, as I said, has its relation to us in our individual path. You must get out of lawlessness into the light and rule of the sun.
Ques. Is the Son of man coming in His kingdom what we have in the beginning of chapter 17?
F.E.R. Yes, everything is then subjugated. The power of evil must be cast out of heaven before you can get the kingdom of the Son of man. What Christ is in heaven has relation to earth. The effect of casting out of the evil in heaven will be the heading up of evil here, and that will be the fitting moment for setting up the kingdom of the Son of man.
The Thessalonians were waiting for the public manifestation of what they were already in morally. But their part will be not to be in the kingdom, but to reign; the righteous will shine forth as the sun; we do not do that very much now. I am now better off than the most able man in this world, I do not stumble, I have light and I know where the way leads to. God has made known to us the mystery of His will.
Rem. That involves the denial of self.
F.E.R. Yes, and that Christ should be everything; it is blessed to see how everything is secured morally. God has been pleased to introduce in Christ three things: rule, atmosphere and light. God on His part begins with bringing in light. But in our apprehension we come under rule first, then we get life in the Christian atmosphere and then light. The first thing God said in Genesis was, "Let there be light". Light is the last thing we really enter into; it involves spiritual intelligence and the entering into what God
{393}
is in His own nature. It is the knowledge of God in what God is to us down here, as seen in @1 John 4.
Rem. Then we believe the love.
F.E.R. Exactly. Love is perfected with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment. Until a man is under rule he is in lawlessness. The first thing is for him to get out of lawlessness. The point of departure is the point of recovery. The devil led man into lawlessness, and the Son of God came to undo the works of the devil.
Then the next thing is the Christian circle, you love the brethren, and in this we know that we have passed out of death into life. Love is the atmosphere in which you live, there is no life outside it. Then the last thing is light, that is, the application of love to the Christian in all his path right up to the day of judgment.
{394}
CHRIST FOR ALL -- BUT APPROPRIATED BY THE BELIEVER
@Romans 3: 23 - 31; @Acts 13: 44 - 47; @Psalm 98: 1 - 3
It is a principle in my mind that we are not called upon to believe anything about ourselves. Many scriptures describe what God has wrought in Christians, but for that reason those statements are not the object of faith. Scripture is the word of God, given to us to keep us within bounds, but faith must rest in a divine Person and what is set forth in Him. "Ye believe in God, believe also in me". Christ would not be an object of faith except as being a divine Person; though He became man nothing could make Him less than a divine Person, and as such He is presented to faith, and the whole purpose of God with regard to man is set before us in Christ, and Christ is thus the object of faith, as God is, for in Christ He has been pleased to reveal Himself, and the revelation of God is for faith. It is applicable to man. There would be no sense in God revealing Himself if the revelation were not applicable to somebody, and as man cannot possibly verify it he has to receive it by faith. What you can verify does not call for faith. I believe in the existence of such a city as Venice, but there is no faith in that. I believe that the earth moves round the sun, but that is no question of faith, for you can verify these things. The revelation of God you cannot verify, nor anything in heaven, for no one has been there but the One who came down, so it is purely a question of faith.
And so, too, with regard to Christ in heaven; no one knows what He is in heaven. The apostles knew certain things of Christ of their own knowledge, but even they only knew what He was in heaven by the Holy Spirit. The report has come by the Holy Spirit, come down from heaven, and if people believe on Him
{395}
they believe by the report; never a person believed on Him otherwise. That is how Christianity began and has been continued from that day to this. It is very important to see what faith is and what it connects itself with. Christianity in the true power of it, is vital, it is not a question of faith only. Life must come in in connection with our relation to divine Persons, and it is only in that way that we can entertain the idea of life. I come back to what I started with, that it is not the way of Scripture to lead you to believe anything about yourself; you believe about God and about Christ.
Now there are many things which in a way are common to God and to man. If I speak of *redemption* it is common to God and to us -- redemption is in Christ for God the basis of His ways. *Righteousness* is declared in Christ and is common for God and for us. And *salvation* is God's salvation, "all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God", but it is for us, it is common for God and for us. These things have, of course, a different application for God and for us, but they are common.
I take up the thoughts of redemption, righteousness, light and salvation; they are all in Christ and Christ is for God; but then Christ is also for man, and all these things are for us, though in a different sense; it is a mistake to mix up the two sides. What is for God is an object for faith, but when it is a question of entering into what is in Christ for us, this is by the power of the Spirit.
I take up redemption -- the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; that is for God, but then in Ephesians and Colossians it says, "In whom *we* have redemption". It is one thing for it to be there in Christ for God, and another thing for us to say we have it. Again, Christ is God's salvation to the ends of the earth, but it is a great thing for us to obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
{396}
I think I have laid down a distinction which it is important to apprehend between what is for God and what is for us. It is simply this; when it is a question of the working out of the counsels of God, everything is in Christ, He is the Man of God's purpose and the One in whom all is carried out. When it is a question of grace, it is in Christ, and in this point of view the bearing is universal. He is God's salvation to the ends of the earth -- salvation to the Gentiles -- God's righteousness is towards all, the bearing is universal. On the other hand, when we look at what Christ is for us the thought is more limited, for the question of appropriation comes in. Comparatively few have appropriated the things that are towards all. Righteousness is towards all, but it is only upon those who believe. Christ is a light for the Gentiles, but to how many is He light? To those who have appropriated Him as light.
I take redemption to begin with. Redemption is a right of God. Of necessity by what God is, and what man is, God has rights with regard to man, and the law set them forth, but the law did not set forth save in type His rights in redemption; it set forth what I may call His natural rights. As a matter of fact, even before the law was given, man was under the penalty of death. But by the law he came under the curse -- two things under which he lay by the judgment of God; as the hymn puts it, 'Death and the curse were in our cup'. (`415:2) But that which did not come out by the law has come out in Christ. The right of redemption lay with God. In Christ God could discharge the penalties under which man lay. Every right that God had in regard to man has its answer in Christ; as to what I may call the natural rights of God, He could say, "Thy law is within my heart". But the right of redemption is also maintained in Christ. He has taken up every liability and discharged it on the part of God.
Where do you see God's righteousness declared?
{397}
Every intelligent person would answer in a moment -- in Christ. I see in Christ all that men should be for God, but I see also that He has taken up and discharged every liability under which man lay. Hence it is that there is redemption in Christ Jesus. It is very important to apprehend that that is for God. His proper rights as to the creature maintained, and the rights of redemption secured, and the practical result is that God has set forth Christ in relation to all men, a Mediator between God and men. Through one righteousness, grace is towards all men unto justification of life.
It is important to see what redemption has secured for God; the bearing of it is universal; righteousness of God is towards all, but upon all them that believe. This speaks of what He has secured for Himself in Christ, and not only for Himself, but for Christ, for apart from redemption it would be an impossibility that Christ should be head of all men.
All these things in their bearing are towards all, and when we believe we believe in that which is towards all -- not what it is towards *me*, but towards *all*. If I believe in God and in God's righteousness, I believe in righteousness of God towards all; that which is presented to us, the bearing and good of it, is towards men; that is the ground of faith.
I take another point -- light. Christ is a light for the revelation of the Gentiles; the Gentiles have come thus into the view of God; they were hid away from God in the darkness. It is not often that He penetrated into the darkness as in the case of Nineveh; they were hid away in the darkness of idolatry. Now a great change has come in by Christ. He is a light on the part of God so that He might see the Gentiles. He has proclaimed to them in consequence His righteousness in Christ Jesus, that He would have all men to be saved, that was the effect of Christ being a light of the Gentiles.
{398}
Now I take up the thought of salvation. Christ is God's salvation to the ends of the earth. I think what may be meant by that is the deliverance of the ends of the earth from the bondage of idolatry and Satan's power. There is a beautiful expression in @Psalm 98, "All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God". Where do they see it? It could only be in Christ. The ends of the earth were in the eye of God, there is a breach in the power that held them in bondage. All this mighty change has come in by Christ; we do not apprehend it enough. The introduction of Christ and the accomplishment of redemption could not leave the situation as it was. It changed the situation of the Jew, he has become lost in the world, but redemption was accomplished so that Christ might take up a certain position towards all, and so He claims the ends of the earth for our God.
Now I want to speak about the other side. What I have so far spoken of is what is presented to faith: "I have set thee for a covenant to the people, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the ends of the earth". It is the common testimony and is preached for faith. But now as to our side. You may not yet exactly possess what you believe; your faith sees redemption and light and salvation in Christ, but you may not really have got them. The point is, how do you get them? You have not righteousness really till you are brought into attachment; you may apprehend that it is there, but if you have not Christ you have not it, for having Him is righteousness. You have Him by the Spirit. Righteousness in its application to all men is presented to faith, and when that is believed the Spirit is given and one is brought into attachment, and a bond is formed between Christ and the believer who can say -- Christ is my righteousness. All appropriation is by the Spirit of God. It is very important to see the righteousness of God in its
{399}
application toward all men, but it is all-important on my side that I am brought into attachment to Christ, a bond formed, and Christ is thus the end of the law for righteousness to me.
Now take redemption. We see the value of redemption to God and to Christ -- that is for faith. It is a great thing to apprehend it, but how are we going to say, "In whom we have redemption"? We could never say that but by the Spirit, but having the Spirit we can say, "In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins". That depends on the Spirit of God who is the proof and seal of the believer being in Christ.
As to salvation. I have attempted to speak of what Christ is as God's salvation, but if I have received the Spirit, and am so brought into attachment to Christ, I see that He is salvation to *me*; I have obtained the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, I have appropriated Him by the Spirit, and that is what many Christians lack. Faith is there, they apprehend what God is in the revelation of Himself, and in His mind toward man, but there is a lack in appropriating Christ to themselves and all that is set forth in Christ. He is salvation to *me*.
I add a word more. When you appropriate Christ and all that is in Christ, you of necessity reject yourself. If you say He is righteousness to you, how do you show it? You practise righteousness by the Spirit of Christ. And if you practise righteousness by the Spirit of Christ you reject yourself. The very fact that you practise it by the Spirit of another Man is the proof that you have no righteousness of your own. If you say, Christ is light to me, what do you virtually allow? That you have no light in yourself. A mariner could not steer his ship if he had not the light of heaven; even his compass will not do of itself, the light of the heavens is essential for its adjustment. Well, I say, Christ is light to us, and till we had Christ
{400}
we walked in darkness and knew not whither we were going. Now we know very well where we are going, but we virtually admit that heretofore we were in the darkness.
No man can say that Christ is light to him but by the Spirit of Christ, but it means, I reject myself as dark. So every step brings you to the rejection of yourself as you adopt Christ instead of yourself. Salvation is in Christ Jesus. Naturally we are in bondage to the world and sin; how do you get out of it? By getting into another atmosphere, and until you do, you will never get out of the world. And what has established the atmosphere? Christ. He has established the Christian circle down here; you do not love the brethren naturally, you love them by the Spirit of Christ. What does all that mean? It means that in the apprehension of salvation in the Christian circle you reject yourself, because you have accepted and appropriated Christ.
Now that Christ has come in, it is an absolute impossibility that another man can have place before God. God may allow things to come to such a pass that antichrist may be set up, but no other man save Christ can abide before God. There must of necessity be the rejection of ourselves as we appropriate and adopt what is in Christ. It virtually means, I have no righteousness. And to say that Christ is light to me is tantamount to saying there is none in us. Would a philosopher say so? No, he is not prepared to humble himself, he thinks he has light in him. So as to salvation, it allows that I was in bondage and could not deliver myself. I reject the man that was not susceptible to salvation; that man has to be rejected as Christ is accepted and appropriated. We have to begin in faith to apprehend what Christ is for God in the moral universe, and its bearing; but then comes another experience on the part of the Christian, to find that he has everything in Christ -- redemption,
{401}
righteousness, salvation, light -- we are made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
The testimony goes out to the whole creation, God lifts up Christ as salvation for the ends of the earth and as righteousness towards all, like the sun in the heavens, there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
It is very blessed to see these things in their universal bearing -- that all have a title to them, but that is not all the truth; we have to appropriate all that is set forth in Christ, that at every point and in every possible way we may reject ourselves, putting off the old and putting on the new.
I do not know if I have made my meaning plain, but I want you to see on the one hand the width and universal bearing of the grace of God presented in Christ, and, on the other, the great importance on the part of the Christian of appropriating all that is set forth in Christ. It has to be done in detail, it can be done in no other way. You have all you appropriate, and so you can say, I have righteousness, redemption, light, salvation, I am in the reality of them down here.
I would not point out these things if I did not believe in their importance. They have been much confused and need to be distinguished that you may get the idea of appropriating all that is presented in Christ, and so be able to say, *I have* it.

CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP
@1 Corinthians 1: 9; @1 Corinthians 10: 16 - 21; @1 Corinthians 11: 23 - 26
F.E.R. The first epistle to the Corinthians gives us Christian fellowship on the objective side; the second, on the subjective side. In the first you have "the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord" and the fellowship of His death; in the second you find the fellowship of the Spirit, and the object was to bring them into the reality of it; it was there.
The first epistle gives two thoughts of fellowship. Chapter 1: the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord. In chapter 10, the obverse side is given. If the fellowship be that of the Son, of necessity it must be of His death, because He is not here; and His name is the bond of our common fellowship.
The fellowship of the Lord's table, that side of it, is the fellowship of His death. What binds Christians together in fellowship is the common confession as Lord of "his Son Jesus Christ". It is not fellowship *with* Him, but *of* Him. That bond subsists down here, and we are all equally responsible to maintain it according to God. In John's epistle we have, in chapter 1: 3, "Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ"; but the "our" there no doubt refers to the apostles. Further on, when it says, "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another", we have Christian fellowship in the sphere where all Christians walk.
Ques. Were not the saints at Corinth all wrong as to fellowship?
F.E.R. No doubt things were in many ways in a bad state. But there could be no other bond of fellowship down here. It has a voice to all the world; because there is not a single person on all the earth
{403}
but ought to confess Christ as Lord -- for "he *is* Lord of all".
Ques. Are all Christians in this fellowship?
F.E.R. They are all called to it. There is not and could not be any other bond of fellowship but that of Christ as Lord, and His death.
In stating it here the apostle appeals to "all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord". It is the broad ground of Christian fellowship.
In John, as we have seen, what comes in first is the apostles¬ fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. We come in as having fellowship with the apostles. They had a great place. The Lord in @John 17 prays for the apostles: "That they may be one, as we [are]". No doubt that refers exclusively to the apostles. We must remember there was what was peculiar to them. It is, I think, taking too exalted a position for us to say, we have fellowship with the Father and with His Son. It was apostolic. The vital part of John's epistle begins with chapter 3 there we have the privilege of children, and relationship is a great deal more than fellowship; but until you have got fellowship, you will not know much of privilege. Relationship is connected with affection. I think we can hardly connect the idea of fellowship with heaven. I understand fellowship to be our bond of association in a scene where all is contrary to God.
Ques. How do you arrive at that thought of fellowship from the Scriptures?
F.E.R. How do you understand the thought of fellowship? Is it not that there is something that binds us together? You are called to fellowship, that is moral association. Something in which we have common participation. We own and confess Christ as Lord in the midst of a scene where He is rejected. The apostle John begins with fellowship, and then goes on to privilege. First he takes them on their responsibility, on the ground of their external association
{404}
here, in a scene of contrariety. Fellowship stands in connection with responsibility, hence tests come in again and again. Chapter 3 brings in the subject of relationship and privilege.
Ques. Is there no communion in heaven?
F.E.R. You are putting a different meaning on the word, viz., that of intercourse, or common mind. Association is my idea of fellowship -- we own Him as Lord.
Ques. Did I understand that the first part of @John 17 is more connected with the apostles?
F.E.R. I should say so down to verse 20, then the prayer widens out: "Neither pray I for these alone". The first demand of the Lord was as to the disciples. The demand of the Lord is as to unity. The Father and the Son were perfectly one in counsel and mind; and what the Lord prays is, that unity might find expression in the service and testimony of the apostles, and I think we may see how the prayer was answered, for in spite of all prejudice they were maintained in perfect unity as to their testimony.
Ques. I suppose where it says in the epistle "We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us", it refers exclusively to the apostles?
F.E.R. It was the test of everybody -- if they heard the apostles, they heard God; there was perfect unity in their testimony. As to fellowship, I do not think, as I have said, that you find in Scripture the idea of fellowship in heaven. There is nothing but oneness of mind and affection in that scene; and whilst we shall be with Him whom we know and own here as Lord, that is not the character of relationship in which we shall be associated with Him there. There is no contrary element there. When affections are perfectly pure you do not want a bond of association. If you bring in fellowship you bring in the idea of responsibility. My impression about the difficulties
{405}
as to fellowship is that they arise from our not accepting the fact of the rejection of Christ. "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me". This scripture affords an idea of fellowship and its ground.
The apostle in 1 Corinthians brings before the saints the proper Christian bond -- that to which God has called them.
Ques. Are not communion and fellowship the same thing?
F.E.R. Communion may not convey the same idea in English, but there is only one Greek word for both. If you put a person outside, you put him out of our fellowship.
Rem. You would say then that our fellowship is on account of all that is around us. In heaven there will be no contrariety.
F.E.R. Yes. You will not have Christ in the relation of Lord to us there. All will be the communion of affection. The moment you bring in fellowship you bring in responsibility. The ground of our fellowship is the Lord.
Rem. In a happy family you would not speak of their fellowship.
F.E.R. Exactly. You would speak of love.
Rem. It is more the oneness of affection.
F.E.R. The honest truth is, that we should better understand fellowship if we understood better that the Lord is rejected.
Ques. Is @1 Corinthians 1: 9 corrective?
F.E.R. He tells them what God has called them to, which involved their responsibility.
Ques. What do you mean by our fellowship?
F.E.R. Christian fellowship. It is true there is local fellowship, but Christian fellowship is not merely local but universal. It is co-extensive with "One Lord, one faith, one baptism", and embraces "all who call on the name of the Lord". The state of ruin
{406}
in which we are does not change the ground of fellowship. You do not speak of a new ground of fellowship.
Ques. I suppose what we have in 2 Timothy -- that is, the call to separation from evil -- is what should characterise the body?
F.E.R. Fellowship was first formed, not by the testimony to "the body", but by testimony to the Lord. There were two great witnesses to Christ as Lord in @Acts 2 and 3. First, the Holy Spirit sent down, evidenced in the gift of tongues; secondly, the lame man being raised up. "His name through faith in his name hath made this man strong". It was the preaching of Christ as Lord that formed the ground of Christian fellowship, and it is what is called the apostle's fellowship. The first witness was the presence of the Holy Spirit, evidenced in the gift of tongues; and the second, man raised up from the weakness of nature.
My thought is, that the cause of all the difficulty lies in the fact that there are those amongst us that have no spiritual idea of the foundation of the church. Hence they fail to distinguish intelligently between the house and the body.
Ques. What about the spiritual foundation of the church?
F.E.R. It is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone. What is vital is the body, and hence I do not understand our being an expression of the one body. It has been said that, If those called brethren are a testimony of anything, it is to the ruin of the church; but that is as the house. Further, I think it is a mistake to connect the thought of union with the body. Unity is what appears to me to be connected with that in Scripture. I did take up the prevalent idea that union was connected with the body, but from Scripture I learn that unity is the thought which we
{407}
have in that figure. The most perfect figure I know of union is Adam and Eve. Eve is taken from Adam and then united to him; as being of him (as his body), she is united to him; but the body is derivative. It is important to get the moral thought of union.
The church shares in the exaltation of the Head. She is derived from Him, and being so, enters into the honour and exaltation of the Head. Nothing else would be suited to be united to Him but what is taken from Him -- that is strikingly seen in Eve.
Ques. What about that passage, "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit"?
Ans. That is not the body.
Rem. Think of what would be the effect on us if we were in the power of the truth, that we are derived from him!
F.E.R. People go back upon the scripture, "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body"; but that is not the moral truth as to the body; the moral truth is, that the body is Christ's body -- it is derived from Christ.
Rem. We do not understand that we are of the stock -- that we are derived from Him. Unity is connected with the body.
F.E.R. The Corinthians are spoken of as "the body", but the apostle does not touch the subject of the Head in either epistle. They did not properly recognise the Lord, much less the Head.
Ques. As to the subject of fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ in John's epistle, is that in no sense ours?
F.E.R. Chapter 1: 3 says, "That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you". The apostles were anxious that believers should have part in all that they could communicate. But they had a full sense of what was theirs specially, and I should not like to invade upon that.
{408}
Rem. We get the communication of the apostles, but we have not all the place they had.
Ques. Would you say a word as to fellowship in the Spirit?
F.E.R. Our fellowship is maintained by the Holy Spirit. If it were a mere question of ourselves, we could not maintain it. What you practically find is, that where the flesh works, the fellowship with one another is more or less broken. If you desire to see Christians set free from the confusion around, what you need to do is to get them to the Lord. Get them close to Him, that they may apprehend what is due to Him in a scene where He is cast out; and then their fellowship will be firm and stable.
As regards @1 Corinthians 11, you cannot rightly reach the Lord's supper except by the Lord's table; He died to all here, that is what we fail to see. The table is the fellowship of His death. It is Christ Jesus our Lord who has died. All here is of such a character that He has died to it.
Ques. Have we not suffered very much from thinking of the Lord's table as a material thing?
Ans. No doubt we have.
F.E.R. Not having come through the Lord's table to the Lord's supper, we have not come suitably to it. You must have maintained in your soul that the One you are going to remember has died to all here.
In baptism you are committed to His death; even a babe is; but when you come to intelligent Christians, you are to be in the recognition and fellowship of His death, and you are properly always partakers of the Lord's table; you come to remember the One who has now passed out of death.
Rem. J.N.D. used to say that why the name of Lord was brought in so much in Corinthians was
{409}
because of the careless way they were going on. There was little recognition of His authority and claim.
F.E.R. No doubt the apostle, seeing their state, presents Him in this way; it is in a way indicative of distance. He stands on his dignity.
If we allow disorder at the Lord's supper, I think we might rightly expect Him to be jealous of His claims.
Ques. What is meant by being "guilty of the blood of the Lord"?
Rem. I think the title 'Lord' brings in the thought of His dignity.
F.E.R. The way the apostle deals with the Corinthians, addressing them as to eating and drinking "unworthily", is not what I could do; as I should not like to assume such a position by reading that portion. We sometimes see brethren shutting their hymn books, and so on, in the meeting. I think there is danger in all this, as we may assume that everything is going wrong, and that the meeting ought to yield to our direction. I am not compelled to sing every hymn, but I have no right to judge everything that is said or done.
The Lord's table brings in our responsibility, and we are all bound to maintain that in integrity. Because I am in the fellowship of the Lord's death I have to be consistent with that. How could I go into a Roman Catholic chapel, or recognise anything of the nature of idolatry? If you take the bread and wine, you are identified with His death, and you ought to be in the fellowship of His death rightly to come to the Lord's supper. He died for us, that we might appropriate His death in order to live.
The great thing in visiting a person seeking fellowship is to get him to the Lord -- that is going back to the beginning.
If when everything was in order they wanted the Lord's guidance, how much more do we need it now?
{410}
It is a great thing to consider the good of people. If a person asserted his right to break bread, that is not good. J.N.D. used to say anyone who might break bread casually, was just as amenable to discipline as if he were in fellowship habitually.
{411}
"AS HE DID AFORETIME"
@Daniel 6: 10; @Luke 6: 1 - 5; @Luke 22: 15
Daniel lived in a day when all was gone as to Israel outwardly; and as regards Jerusalem, that city was in ruins, the temple was laid low and there was nothing to show of its former splendour. All was desolation; Daniel also knew that the "decree was signed", and that what he did was at the peril of his life, but that did not deter him from going on "as he did aforetime". His window was open toward Jerusalem; he was only a "unit", but this pious man goes on with his piety in the face of the break-up of everything outwardly. Jerusalem might be gone, but he could never forget the place it had in the thoughts and counsels of God, and his conduct is shaped as though it were still there: he prayed "toward Jerusalem".
We see the same principle as regards the Lord in @Luke 22. He not merely recognised the passover, but He said: With desire I have desired to eat it with you, though He well knew that He, the true Passover, was about to be offered up, and He announced that He would not eat of it again till it was fulfilled in the kingdom of God. He recognised what was existing, the passover as instituted of God, and He greatly desired to eat it with those He loved so well. We see here true piety. Then on the other hand, as to @Luke 6. David in eating the shewbread did what might be looked at by some as a profane act, but he did it in a day when he, the anointed of the Lord, was rejected; he says, "the bread is in a manner common". Why? Because things were all out of joint in Israel -- institutions that have been owned in their day when God is reverenced, lose their force or power when the anointed of the Lord is refused. So it is now; there are institutions in Christendom which in their day
{412}
have been owned and used of God, but have lost their force since the word of God is discredited -- Christ is Lord also of the sabbath, and He supersedes in that way institutions that were ordained of God and used of Him.
What we ourselves learn from these scriptures is, that in a day of outward ruin, we have to go on as individuals, acting as far as possible as though the ruin were not there. As Daniel prayed toward Jerusalem, we too are to go on "as aforetime", though the church outwardly has been carried captive to Babylon and but little of its grace and power, as seen in the beginning of Acts, be now seen. Again, as we find the Lord recognising that which God had instituted, though well knowing it was to pass away, so we cleave to what God has ordained; but, on the other hand, we drop things which had hold on us formerly, as having been used of God at one time, because we see that in the refusal of the word of the Lord those things have lost the place they once had, and have become in a manner 'common'.
{413}
ADDRESSES ON THE EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS
{414}
{415}
CHAPTER 1
I think it should be a great encouragement to us that the Spirit should see fit to give us a picture of the church (or of Christianity, if you will), not only in the order of the early days, as seen in the early chapters of the Acts, but, too, when things were not in that order.
The apostle brings before us here that in which he could find his satisfaction, when the most painful elements had come in -- such elements as you see in chapter 2 and in chapter 3 particularly -- "Many walk [not simply few] of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ", etc. That was what the church had come to to a large extent. They were not heathens, nor Jews; but in practice they were the enemies of the cross of Christ. If that were the state of things then, it is the state at the present moment. It is what profession has come to; the mass of Christendom are in practice the enemies of the cross of Christ.
What I understand by that expression is this: people who sanction the flesh are the enemies of God's testimony. The cross of Christ means that God has set aside the flesh in the cross, and those who sanction it in divine things are enemies of all the testimonies converged in the cross.
If that was the outward state of things at the beginning, and is still the outward state of things, we may take the other side, and we may find that in which the heart of the Lord can find satisfaction.
The epistle to the Philippians shows it. Philippi was a fragment of the church, and there, in a general state of declension, the heart of the apostle could find
{416}
satisfaction. You cannot find a greater privilege than to give satisfaction to the heart of Christ. The church is *here* to answer morally to what Christ is *there*. Every trait of Christ will be set forth by the church in glory and it should be so here now.
It is important to see that that is the connecting link between the church in glory and the church now. The apostolic church comes to an end when the Spirit leaves it, and only corruption is left. In the meantime "Jew and Gentile are builded together by the Spirit". What supplants it in the millennium is the Holy City. But the *body* of Christ is the connecting link between the present and the future. That is just as real now as then, and then, as now. The moral thought of the body is that in which He Himself is set forth, e.g., you cannot penetrate into my mind: all that anyone knows of me is that which is set forth in my body; they may see the expression of my mind in my eye, and in my words. The body is that in which the intelligence of man is set forth. "*His* body is the fulness of him which filleth all in all". That will be true hereafter of the Holy City, but it is true now.
"Christ in you, the hope of glory", that is Christ set forth in the church. That was the intention of the church -- to be the reflex of Christ in glory, to be the presentation of Christ in the very scene where He was rejected. That is what the body is set here for, not that *we* are to be seen, but *Christ*; not simply Christ in the individual, but Christ in the company.
In this epistle chapter 2 is the company -- the Christian circle.
Chapter 3 is the race -- the idea of that is individuality, not the company.
Chapter 4 is the bearing and attitude of one who is running the race, what is suited to one who is running the race of chapter 3.
There are two marks of the Christian -- the calling and the race -- which come out in Hebrews. Chapter 10
{417}
is the calling and chapter 12 is the race. In Philippians you have in chapter 2 the company, and that is connected with calling; in chapter 3 the race.
The great point for us to be exercised about is how far we are answering to the mind of Christ with regard to the calling, and as to how far we are in the race. The race implies that there is something to be attained, there is a good "Looking off unto", etc.
Previous to speaking of the Christian circle in chapter 2, the apostle unfolds in chapter 1 the whole outward state of things at the moment, and it is what corresponds to what we are conscious of at this moment. We should be thankful that the Spirit has opened up to us the outward state of things as here: there is nothing covered up, but the whole state of things at Rome is all laid bare to us. I am thankful it is so. If you see all this now the next thing is to be ambitious that there should be too what answers to chapter 2. If it were not for the word of God we could not understand the outward state of things at present. But seeing that, we must remember "the arm of the Lord is not shortened", but our desire be to answer to chapter 2 -- the circle. You can never run the race unless you know something of the calling. In Hebrews you get, first the calling, and then the race. That is a point of great importance.
If I speak for a moment of the outward state of things it is opened out in connection with three associations -- Jerusalem, Antioch, Rome -- the three centres of the Spirit's activity. It is interesting to compare what comes out here with what comes out in the close of the Acts. It is evident that Rome had become the centre of the Spirit's activity, the place of testimony.
Jerusalem. What opposed the testimony there was the religious element. It was from without -- from the scribes and Pharisees.
God's testimony is Christ in glory. There is a
{418}
great principle in the word of God -- God never displays anything till first a testimony has been given. You see it through the whole Scriptures. With the fathers -- Abram, Isaac and Jacob -- the promises were first given in testimony; then comes the display. So with the people in Egypt. First was the testimony, and then the display. The testimony of this moment is Christ in glory. God has no other testimony now, every testimony centres there. Christ is not displayed until first the testimony is given of Him here. The object of the church and of the Spirit being here is that there should be a full testimony to Christ in glory. That is the light of our hearts. "We, beholding the glory of the Lord", etc. (@2 Corinthians 3: 18). We are conformed to His image that we may be here in the testimony of His glory. Testimony consists *not in what people say*, but *in what people are*. There is a testimony connected with gift, but testimony as a divine thought is *what we are*. I can prove it from Scripture. The men to whom the promises were given -- their testimony was not in what they said, but in what they were -- Abraham, Isaac, Jacob -- "sojourned", "for he looked for a city", etc. (@Hebrews 11: 8 - 10).
Moses, too, what was his testimony? He chose "rather to suffer affliction with the people of God", @Hebrews 11: 24 - 27. He chose to be identified with the people of God in reproach. Our privilege in the absence of Christ in glory is to be identified with His rejection. And if we are in the light of His glory, we shall be identified with His cross; we have no continuing city here.
I am perfectly convinced of the truth of this. If we are in the light of Christ in glory, it *must come out* in the saints in their moral superiority, what men are governed by here, and to all they have to pass through, and there must be identification with His reproach.
Speaking of Jerusalem, the testimony of the apostles, as you may see in the Acts, is of Christ in glory.
{419}
"Whom God hath exalted". When Paul was brought out he does not set aside that testimony, but something is added. It is a greater testimony. He has greater light. He preached that He was the Son of God. I can understand with the twelve, they had known Him after the flesh, and as risen and exalted the Holy Spirit had come down. They reported what the Holy Spirit had taught them. That is not Paul's ministry, because he had not known Him after the flesh. He was revealed to him from glory as the Son of God; @Galatians 1: 15, 16.
Now the element which opposed the testimony of a risen and exalted Christ was the religious element, and it came from without. We have only that in a modified form today because the Jew has been set aside for his opposition, and scattered over the whole earth.
Again at Antioch, it was the religious element, but from brethren, the Jewish element *within*. The opposition within is often more trying than that from without. If Satan is not able to stamp it out, he will try to spoil the testimony. That was the work of the enemy at Antioch. That came to an end, the matter was happily settled at Jerusalem.
At Rome you do not find the opposition of the religious element without, nor prominently the Jewish element within, but the opposition of the world power -- stirred up by Jews. The world power had the testimony of God in bondage, the vessel of it was in prison. That identifies it with the present time. The opposition in our time is the world power, not in the literal way the Philippians knew it, but the world power dominates the testimony; it is under the patronage of the world power. It was ordained of God, and we have to pray for rulers, etc., but it was never God's intention that it should control and order the testimony. More or less from that time to now the testimony has been in bondage. What spoilt the
{420}
Reformation was that it accepted the domination of the world power and the testimony was held in bondage by it.
I just refer to a few points in the chapter. Verses 12 - 20. I ask one question. What possible satisfaction could the apostle find in Rome in the general state of things there? He was in prison, though what came to pass in the providence of God was that the apostle was vindicated; it was manifested that he was not bound as an evil-doer, but that it was in connection with the testimony, "bonds in Christ". God allowed it to be so ordered that the testimony was not marred. The effect of that was remarkable; it was to give impetus to the preaching of the gospel. But even in the preaching, the motives were not all pure (verses 15 - 18). There is a deal of mixed motive in connection with the testimony here. Not a state of things to afford satisfaction to the heart of the apostle. But his great heart carried him above it all. It is great grace that this state of things should be opened out to us. He saw that it would work to his salvation (verse 19) personally, that Christ might "be magnified", etc. His salvation was not deliverance from prison, but has a much larger sense, complete deliverance from all the power of the enemy, and the way of it was through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus, so that "Christ might be magnified ... whether by life or by death". He was certainly a very special vessel of God's testimony. "For to me to live is Christ"; he was so transparent, so governed by God's testimony, that not Paul was seen in the apostle, but Christ was seen in him. Even the state of things at Rome, which must have been exceedingly trying to his spirit, "yet would turn to his salvation".
But now as to his thought in regard to the saints. It is blessed to see his confidence in God in regard to himself, but what he desired and expected on the part of the saints at Philippi -- what was this confidence in
{421}
which he could find satisfaction? (verses 23 - 30.) Now one point which strikes me is the remarkable way in which the heart of the apostle goes out to the saints. He is in a strait, yet determines to remain for their sake. He partook in the affection of Christ which so strikingly comes out in the gospels. There is nothing more beautiful than to see the affection of Christ coming out in a vessel -- here working in him, the prisoner. You can understand his saying, "For to me to live is Christ".
You will never understand the truth of the church if you do not apprehend the devoted affection with which Christ regarded the little company of disciples down here. There is the same devoted affection in resurrection. The same comes out in the apostle, though it meant personal gain to depart; yet he was content to remain for their sakes.
There were two things the apostle expected on their part:
(1) The conversation worthy of God as set forth in the gospel.
(2) No fear of man.
The man that is standing in the light of God is not afraid of his adversaries. If one is afraid of adversaries it proves that he is not in the enjoyment of the light in which God has been pleased to shine out. In the midst of the surrounding darkness is your soul in the light of the glory of God? First I get the light of the grace of God; when I know more I see it is the gospel of the glory of God. I think the gospel of the glory to be the effulgence of God, the light of God as shining out in Christ in glory. God has achieved in Christ all the purposes of His heart. There is a Man at the right hand of God in whom God has not only been revealed, but glorified in all His attributes. And not only that, but that same One is vested with power to form everything according to God. Power
{422}
to subdue all things to Himself, to form everything *from* and *according to* God. Everything starts from the right hand of God -- a blessed starting-point. The "new man is created after *God*". How? By the power of the Holy Spirit. That One at the right hand of God, the Son of God, the One in whose face every attribute of God is revealed, is the One who has authority and power to form man according to God. How the power of Christ works down here is: (1) to send the Holy Spirit to form, from the right hand of God, man for God; (2) to conduct what is so formed by the Holy Spirit into the Father's presence, "It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is", @1 John 3: 2.
What I have brought before you tonight is nothing but the gospel: the glad tidings of the grace of God.
You may be amidst the darkness of this world, but at the same time, in your soul is the light of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. The result of it will be that our conversation will be worthy of the gospel, and there will be no fear of man.
If you would bear testimony, you cannot unless you are in the light of that glory. We ought to be transformed by it, and be in the blessed consciousness of His power to subdue all things to Himself. The Holy Spirit came for that purpose.
If you take the place of a servant, you must be prepared to sacrifice yourself for the saints. Like the apostle, you must be prepared to refuse personal advantage. And what is Christianity without divine affections? It is the substance of Christianity. May God give us to know more of the light of the glory of God, and to walk here more in power in the Christian circle of divine affections.
{423}
CHAPTER 2
I have pointed out what I thought was the connection in the epistle, the progress in it of what is unfolded. It is not a doctrinal epistle; there is not the unfolding of the purpose of God; but it is essentially a practical epistle. Another thing is that it presents what is highly experimental, e.g., you do not get *sin* spoken of.
In chapter 1 we get the state of things existing when the apostle wrote. There is no attempt to gloss over the state of things which existed there. It was not encouraging, nor was the outward state of Christianity, as disclosed in the end of chapter 3, "enemies", etc. And at Rome the testimony was bound by the world power. These points connect it with our time.
In chapter 2 we get the generation according to God -- a divine generation -- a circle according to God. I say 'generation' because children of God (blameless and harmless, without rebuke, etc.) are to come out here in that light. It is not their position, but their characteristics. The desire of the apostle was to see them answering to it. There is divine power here to give effect to that.
The Spirit of God cannot be bound. He will not work in channels which men have made for Him. You cannot bind "leviathan with a hook". But He is here to effect what is according to God and He certainly will carry out what is for God's good pleasure. There may not be much in display, but the mighty power is here and works according to God, and to promote what is suitable to God. But you cannot bind the Spirit of God, and there is no more important thing than for saints to be in the line where He works.
And what was there at Philippi? A handful of people of no account in this world, but great in the
{424}
eyes of God, sons of God. That is a point of great encouragement. We are small enough in this day, despised and thought nothing of by man, nothing can exceed our smallness, and the Philippians were not much different.
In chapter 3 you get the *race*, which is individual, and answers to @Hebrews 12. @1 Corinthians 9 shows the purpose of his running. The idea of a race must view the saints as individuals. Each seeks to reach the goal -- you do not run as a company.
Now in chapter 2 there are three points:-
(1) The mind which is in Christ.
(2) The exaltation of Christ.
(3) Divine generation (I use the word in its moral sense) down here.
You will see how these three points are connected.
(1) The mind of Christ.
(2) Is consequent on the first and
(3) Follows that -- the company here "blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation".
Now my conviction is that all is based on the first part. The exaltation of Christ, and the formation of the Christian circle is based on the cross, on *death*, because death is prominent in the first part of the chapter. Death is emphasised -- even the death of the cross.
The Christian company is the vessel of testimony, "Among whom ye shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life".
There is only one subject of testimony in Christianity. It has not always been that, God has had different testimonies at different times. Now, the only one is Christ, at the right hand of God. Our great anxiety should be whether we are morally according to it, so that there is no hindrance to the light of the Lord
{425}
shining out here. The Lord will be displayed, but before that there is a testimony to the glory of the Lord. The Holy Spirit is here for that. The testimony of the church is, and was, for that. The vessel of testimony should be according to that glory. "We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord", @2 Corinthians 3: 18. That is where people are not anxious enough. There are many who see what it is but are not anxious to be in accordance with it.
And death is the basis. Why? The great difficulty in the way was the man down here, and man owned of God, too. And by man I mean a certain order of man, a man of that kind after the flesh -- under death and as under the law, under the curse.
The important point was to set aside that man -- for God's glory. God did not do so till man had first been tested in every way. He ran riot to the flood; after that he failed under law. He was tested by the presence of Christ, and then by the witness of the Holy Spirit. The point was to set aside the hindrance -- that was the great difficulty with God. Now the Son of God comes out (in the first part of the chapter) a divine Person, and what we have in the passage is that *He* goes down into death.
There are two steps in order that man may be set aside completely and eternally for God's glory. What Christ had to enter into *really*, we have to *in mind*. With Him it was death actually, with us it is very different, because the great obstruction to the work of God in us is *ourselves*. We have to come to the cross in order that the obstruction may be removed. As long as I allow anything of self, I am an obstruction to the work of God in me. There is nothing more important for us than to have that mind. It is beautiful to see how God reaches a result. Death was a result to reach and God had a short way of reaching it. We
{426}
have a long way in reaching it. God could reach that end shortly, but we often take a long tedious way to reach it. But if you do not reach it you simply leave a great obstruction in God's ways with you.
Verses 4 - 11. Now, beloved friends, you see two great steps in the course which Christ took. First in verse 7, the second in verse 8. The Spirit of God does not speak of humbling Himself till He has become man. In the first step He does not consider Himself, "Lo, I come to do thy will", that is, before He becomes man. How often *we* assert ourselves in doing what we are appointed to! *He* "took upon him the servant's form".
The second step, "He humbled himself", etc. Death meant the removal of the man which existed before the eye of God. He disappeared in the death of Christ. That death was the end of the man, *and* in it God was glorified. God might have set aside the man in judgment, but that was not God's way, but God was glorified where man was set aside.
"Obedient unto death, even the death of the cross". It is a great thing to know that the man who was the obstruction has so disappeared that God is completely glorified.
We have to come to death and the death of the cross. The apostle could say, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless", etc., and "How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?" God could simply and quickly reach the point in the death of Christ, but it is by a tedious way that we have to travel. Do we desire to reach it? We must be as clay in the hands of the potter, content to let Him mould us. If so we should have to come to the mind of death, That man has gone for God and I can say he has gone for myself, I am crucified with Christ. I do not get the *judgment* of the cross, Christ took that, but to the mind of it. If you have not come to it, there is a
{427}
great obstruction to God carrying out in you the purpose of His way.
The second point is consequent on the cross, "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father". Everything shall be under the hand of man, but under the hand of the Man who glorified God. By 'name' I understand '*renown*'. "At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow". It is not a question of authority over those who believe, but it is universal authority based upon God being glorified in the death of Christ. "Every knee" shall bow. Now there is the possibility of the knee bowing in grace and faith. That is what the Christian does now; it is the condition of salvation. "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved".
The authority of Christ is universal, "We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man", @Hebrews 2: 9. The world to come is put under the Son of man because He has accomplished redemption. When Christ died, if I may say it reverently, God had a free hand. So God could make known His mighty power in resurrection. Everything begins from the right hand of God, and is therefore according to God's pleasure. With Adam God began with the dust of the earth. *Now* everything begins from the right hand of God. The name above every name -- that is the starting from which to carry out the purpose of God. Every one will have to confess; @John 5: 21 - 27.
{428}
Notice two things: "The Son quickeneth whom he will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son" (verses 21, 22), and "as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ... *because* he is the Son of man". The authority is over all, in @John 17, that He might act as a life-giving Spirit. Judgment is entrusted to Him so that all should honour the Son as they honour the Father. There will be a moment when His universal authority will be made good and all will bow. Christ takes in hand the solution of every moral question. The man who offended could not remove himself, but must be removed by another, the Son of God. "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him ... that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow". All judgment is entrusted to Him to secure His honour in the renown of His name. All will bow to Him and honour Him as they honour the Father.
The second consequence you see in verses 12 - 16. There should be a vessel of testimony here, a generation according to God, everything to be from the right hand of God -- a totally different order from what was at the beginning. The new man is created after God in righteousness, holiness and truth, because God is working from His right hand. He is the life-giving Spirit, and what He operates is according to God.
That little company at Philippi! Who would have thought that the power of God was there? so that the apostle could say, "It is God which worketh in you". People think that the power of God is here for the gospel. It is, but it is here that the divine generation may be here for God. In early days there was great power in the gospel -- the church was in order. Now it is in ruin. We must not expect great display in the gospel. The first great activity of the Spirit is in the church, "builded together for an habitation of God
{429}
through the Spirit". That is where God made known His mighty power.
Look at the character of it. That is practical (verses 15, 16). It is not a question of standing. But there is no reproach against you, children of God, i.e., a generation from God -- *morally* that. Formed by the love of God, and the Spirit bears witness with their Spirit that they are children of God. Formed by the love of God, and they love God. "I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them", @John 17: 26.
How much the church has departed from it. The bulk are content with the knowledge of being saved and having the Holy Spirit. How few know what it is to be in the love of God. How much are we acquainted with the love of God? How far are we controlled by it? To love God is the description of saints. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him", @1 Corinthians 2: 9. That is a proper description of Christians -- their proper state. "All things work together for good to them that love God". They are acquainted with God's love and they love Him, a divine generation. "Among whom ye shine as lights in the world".
Light only in the Lord. Christians are light because they bear testimony *to* the Lord. "We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the *Lord*". I believe there is nothing much more important than to be in the light of the Lord. God gained the victory and has the Man who glorified Him at His right hand. All the promises are "Yea and Amen" in Christ.
Can you shine by your own light? Does the moon shine by its own light? It shines because it reflects the light of the sun. Christians are precious stones but precious stones have no light or brilliancy of their
{430}
own. They reflect the light. You will never be lights in the world except as you are in the light of the Lord. Put a diamond in a dark place, and see how much of it you can see. So with a Christian in the dark, but, in the light of the Lord, then he will shine. "Sons of God", etc. You are in the light of the Lord. No one who is in the light of the Lord will do anything wrong. There would be beautiful fellowship if all were in the light of the Lord. There is nothing crooked there. "Holding forth the word of life" -- that is the testimony of life, because I can tell men how to get the water of life freely. We can *show* it to souls that the value of faith in Christ means, to reach the water of life, "Whosoever will, let him take", etc. That is what saints can seek to make plain. That belongs to the divine generation; to shine and to hold forth the word of life. And this is the practical result of having reached the cross. There will not be much of either unless we have reached it in our souls. If we have we shall come out in the light of the Lord, and so our hearts will respond to the love of God, and we shall not be ashamed to say I love God. Being in the light of the Lord we shine as lights, that is the simple result.
May God give us to see the great reality of these things. The point we want to reach is the cross, and that means deliverance. God has got rid of that man on the cross, and we want practically to get rid of him too. Suppose the Spirit is always beating against the flesh -- what progress shall we make? None. That is not the proper work of the Spirit, but "to will and to do of his good pleasure"; not simply setting aside the flesh, but the more positive making us acquainted with the love of God, so that we may come forth in the light of the Lord.
{431}
CHAPTER 3
It seems to me this epistle is of peculiar interest to us, because of the great moral connection between what is in it and the present time. I am aware that the epistle was written at a time when Rome was at the height of her power, and outwardly all the circumstances of the church were different; but beneath the surface there are marks which identify it with the present time, e.g., the world power had asserted itself with regard to God's witness. He was not man's apostle, not a self-constituted apostle, but God's apostle, and the world power had bound him. Do you say, 'how much did the world power know of it?' Not very much, certainly, but that does not alter the fact. You have the same principle today. The world power takes cognisance and control of Christianity. The Queen, in England, is recognised as the head of the church -- the reigning power claims authority over the church. It came in specially with Rome, which became the seat of ecclesiastical authority.
But the apostle was not in bonds as an evil-doer; his bonds "in Christ" were manifest, and the effect of the apostle's vindication was that many preached. But he could not always rejoice in the motive, though he did in the gospel being preached. In chapter 1 the apostle looks on things on man's side; in chapter 2 on God's side, from the divine side -- an entirely different standpoint -- from the platform which God had made for Himself, the platform of resurrection, of which man knew nothing. There are many who believe in resurrection who do not understand the platform of resurrection. The platform of this world is where the forces of man come into collision; God's platform is resurrection, it means sin condemned and removed,
{432}
and God free to act on the platform of resurrection, where God fulfils all the pleasure of His will.
There are two points in chapter 2: (1) the exaltation of Christ; (2) the Christian company. Both are the fruit of the death of Christ, and what God has established on the platform of resurrection. I would like to understand it better myself, and so be able to make it plainer to you, it is so important. This world -- Satan is the prince and god of it. Resurrection is God's, and seeing that, I see the Lord Jesus Christ, and what He does on that platform -- justification and the gift of the Holy Spirit.
"It is God which worketh in you", etc. What is "God's good pleasure"? That in the saints should be seen a revival of Christ. There is nothing else before God now. That is the colour in which the Philippians come out here. They were poor, not distinguished in this world, insignificant, of no account; their beginning was with the Philippian jailor, but they were a vessel in which it pleased God by His mighty power to revive Christ. They were to come out morally here -- a new generation outside this world and on the platform of resurrection. If you are on that you must be outside of this world, and all that you will be concerned about will be identification with Christ in the Christian circle here.
When Christ was here, the excellency of God was seen in Him. Now Christ is in glory and He is revived down here in the Christian circle. Sin in the flesh is removed before God, so that Christ can be displayed.
Verses 13 - 16 is God's pleasure. God's pleasure is nothing but Christ. How? To give deliverance from everything not of resurrection, sin, flesh, this world -- we are not on that platform at all. The point to which we want to come is "Risen together with Christ" -- to that platform. When deliverance is complete, when it can be said, "It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure", then the result
{433}
is "blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke [children of God, i.e., taking character from God], in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world [like Christ did]; holding forth the word of life".
That is, a little Christian circle, insignificant as it may be, was the vessel of God's testimony on earth. The church has taken that place, but everything depends upon God working "in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure"; depends upon deliverance in the saints. It is a great thing to realise I am free from the power of sin. I am never *actually* free here, but there is such a thing as "putting off the body of this flesh", so that I have greater pleasure in being free from it than in being bound by it.
You have to do with the world in business, but you are not bound by it, you can be outside of it morally. You belong to that company which is morally outside of it. "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren". But you must find the brethren, and you will find them outside the course of this world, obscure and hid. I would be sorry to go to the great systems of this world to find them. I want to get to the brethren, and I find them outside what is of this world, obscure enough with regard to position here, but "elect of God, holy and beloved", @Colossians 3: 12.
One great point in the chapter is the exaltation of Christ at the right hand of God, and at the same time, the Christian circle in which God is operating to give them deliverance morally from all that is not of resurrection. In chapter 3 there is another thought. It is not the circle. The apostle unfolds what has a place religiously on the earth, and you will find in contrast to that the Christian has to pursue a race largely on account of the state of things here. One point which connects it remarkably with the present time is, the chapter opens with apostate Judaism and ends with
{434}
apostate Christianity. The race comes in between. Verses 1 and 2, the way he speaks of the Jews, "beware"; in verse 17 it is "mark". I think at the close you get terms which describe morally apostate Christians.
Dogs are people without conscience. 'Concision', a contemptuous term, because the apostle always looked at circumcision as having a moral bearing, but there were those who were satisfied with the outward thing. 'Beware', not have association with it. At the close, he speaks of apostate Christians -- 'many', not few -- these were the greater number. He speaks of them in strong terms. They were not exactly the enemies of Christ, but enemies of the testimony of Christ, it describes any one who gives licence to the flesh. (The cross means crucifixion of the flesh.) They were Christians in name, but were really apostate -- "whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things". That is what Christianity has come to in this day, what it had lapsed into in the apostle's day. He had to warn the saints against those whose conduct was a practical denial of Christianity. You will see how that is connected with the present -- the last times. The last times began very early. Many in reading Timothy think of them as being in the future, but the moment the apostles had gone the last times set in, they began long ago; see what is here even before the apostle departed. Look at professing Christianity, seeking earthly advancement and joy, it is pure selfishness, not serving God, "whose glory is in their shame", etc. I want to present the contrast to all that.
In speaking of a race, the apostle ceases to be in that sense an apostle; he runs a race as a saint, as an example to be followed. He was a man of like passions as we, not divine like Christ. I have heard even Christians say that the apostle is egotistical. He *is*,
{435}
and why? Because it shows what God's mighty power could accomplish in a man of like passions, and therefore he is an example for us.
There are the two things: (1) the path in the Christian circle (and you must first find it, not among the course of this world, but among people delivered from this world); and (2) then fulfil our part in this circle. That should be our primary obligation, not putting the social before it. It is the first thing to you, and you come forth to fulfil every other obligation which God has given you. It is a striking thing how few admonitions there are in the word in connection with business. Only two spheres are recognised -- the Christian sphere and the social. The Christian goes through the world to provide for his household, but I do not vote, for the world is not a sphere in which the Scriptures recognise me. The Christian circle must have precedence with the social circle. It is much safer and happier to give the Christian circle its place and subordinate the social to it. One is eternal and the other temporal. The eternal obligation must take precedence of that for time. When the Christian circle is found, the next thing is to fulfil the obligations in it in love to Christ and to the saints.
Then remains to run the race. Why? Because we cannot settle down in any order of things here, because the calling is not here. You are "partakers of the heavenly calling". We are here in the light of the calling, but my calling is above, it has no reference to anything here. There is something for the Christian to pursue. I shall not be satisfied till the calling has taken possession of my soul, till I have reached the prize.
@Ephesians 1: 3 - 5. That is the calling.
Verse 3 is the *place* of it.
Verse 4 is the characteristics suited to it according to God's nature.
{436}
Verse 6 relationship to Himself -- in sonship.
Now that can never be achieved here. We are in the light of it. Therefore the apostle prays "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ... that ye may know what is the *hope* of the calling", because the calling has reference to heavenly places. It is a great thing for us to be in the light of it.
Here the calling is set before us as a prize. The calling should take complete possession of my soul. I cannot reach Christ actually, Christ must come and take me there, but the point is that "I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus" (verse 12).
The race is an important matter because it puts one to the test. There are three tests of a man running a race
(1) Patience.
(2) Purpose.
(3) Training.
Many start well, but their *patience* breaks down, that is a great test to Christians. I have found people who have started well, but tested by endurance have broken down. Some go spasmodically, but I have an end in view and must not be turned aside.
Closely allied is *purpose*. Keep the eye on Christ and then your patience will not be wearied. I am no more weary than when I started thirty years ago, because sustained by the Spirit. Some grow jaded and weary because they are not in the light of the calling. What keeps you fresh is the light of the calling. 'Garments fresh and foot unweary, tell how God has brought thee through'. (`76:8) Keep the eye on Christ. Why? Because He is the Forerunner. It is a great thing to know that He has entered as the Forerunner, our Joshua, within the veil. He has got
{437}
there, and we keep the eye on Him, that is *purpose*.
Training. A man would not attempt a race without training. He is careful about his food. We must have the flesh in subjugation. What do you feed upon? Christian literature? That does not tend to train. What tends to train is God's discipline. You cannot get real training without. "That we might be partakers of his holiness". We ought to be prepared to invite God's discipline. "If ye be without chastisement ... then are ye bastards, and not sons", @Hebrews 12: 8. It is that we may be partakers of God's holiness, that flesh may be set aside. "Let us lay aside every weight ... and let us run with patience".
If there is continuance it proves the three points. They are great things, produced by the mighty power of God's working, then you will exhibit the peaceable fruits of righteousness.
Now the point is "to know him" -- to know Christ, to know the love of Christ. We are all defective on that point, a very crucial point. It is not simply the fact of the cross, but knowing Himself. What a wonderful thing to know *Him*! I know friends here, Christian friends. I think I can appreciate a spiritual Christian, though I make no claim to being spiritual myself, and I have more real pleasure in knowing such than in knowing one distinguished in this world. But no spiritual Christian is up to Christ; but coming to Christ, I come to the perfection of everything. The disciples knew Him in a familiar way, they were associated with Him and had the opportunity of knowing Him. We have the opportunity of knowing Him on the platform of resurrection.
"Fellowship of his sufferings"! That is what cuts me off from this world. The calling, in result, is complete likeness to Christ, according to *what He is*. Many want to be like Christ *was*. They never can be, but they may be according to what He is; that is the
{438}
aim of the Christian. The working out of it will be 'I would like to be so now. I would like the calling to take complete possession of my soul'.
"Forgetting the things". It is weak people who are looking behind. Ready to bemoan the past, and say the things of the past are better than those of the present. But what I have to do with is the present. There is no behind to the Spirit, nor future, it is all one present. "Reaching forth", etc. Whatever good things are behind, there is better before. The great point is to forget, and to reach forward to the calling of God in Christ Jesus. There is an opportunity to prove our training. The point is the calling of God on high is to take possession of our souls here, therefore we get it set before us as a prize.
Verse 15. "Perfect". People who have reached the resurrection platform are conscious of deliverance from sin and the flesh, and know Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit outside of the course of things here. They know the love of God, and are set free from the power of sin and the flesh. The great point is, 'walk in the unity of spiritual affection' -- the same rule.
Then comes the warning against apostate Christianity. Now I defy anybody to say this chapter is not available and practicable now. Let the truth have its own place. If we are found in the Christian circle, let us seek to fulfil our obligations. But the consummation of it is not here, but is in heaven, in complete likeness to Christ. "Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body", to fulfil completely the calling of God "according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself".
God grant that we may be prepared to go on and prove God, and the mighty power working in us to
{439}
bring out patience and purpose and training, so that our souls may be possessed with the greatness of God's calling. May that thought so take possession of us that we may be encouraged to run the race "looking off unto Jesus ... who ... is set down at the right hand of the throne of God".
{440}
(1) THE GOSPEL AND ITS PREACHERS.
@Philippians 1
In the Scriptures the Spirit of God has seen fit to give us a picture of the church, not only when all was in order, as at Jerusalem in early days, but also when things had fallen into disorder. In this epistle the apostle Paul has shown us that in which his heart found comfort and resource when this was so. There are several elements in this epistle which indicate the pass to which things had come. There were those who had become "enemies of the cross". In such a state of things the Spirit of God is pleased to show us in what the apostle found satisfaction. There are many in our day of the same character as those described by the apostle, not enemies perhaps of Christ, but enemies of the cross, that is, who sanction the flesh. If the state of things which characterised the apostle's day marks ours, I do not see why there should not be here at the same time that which is for the Lord's satisfaction, something which He can approve. I do not believe we could have a more just ambition than to give satisfaction to the heart of Christ.
The church here is correspondent to Christ in glory. There is a connecting link between the church now and the church in glory. The house of God, that form of God's dwelling, will come to an end, the heavenly city will supplant it; but the body of Christ is the connecting link between the present and the future; it will be as real then as it is now.
The moral idea in the body is that the mind is set forth in it; my body is the part which is patent, my spirit cannot be penetrated, but the body is that in which my mind is set forth. So, too, the body of Christ is that in which Christ is set forth; you get
{441}
the expression, "Christ in you, the hope of glory", that is, Christ set forth in His body. The church down here is morally the reflex of Christ in glory; it is the mystery, the presentation of Christ in a body, in the scene from which He has been rejected. It is not we to be seen, but Christ; not simply Christ in the individual, but Christ in the company.
In chapter 2 of this epistle we have the company -- the circle. In chapter 3 is the race, and that is individual; there is a race, and there is a circle. Chapter 4 is supplementary, and gives the bearing of one who is running the race of the third chapter. There are two things that mark the Christian -- the calling, and the race. These come out in Hebrews, in which chapter 10 gives the calling, and chapter 12 the race. So here in chapter 2 we get the Christian circle, with which the calling is connected. If you are answering to the mind of Christ with regard to the circle, then you will run the race; chapter 3.
But previous to speaking about the company, we find the apostle describing the outward state of things in profession and in the world. This is brought out in a remarkable way in chapter 1; the scene is not rose-coloured, but the real state is laid bare to us. Much corresponds to what marks the present time, and if so, let it be our desire to see a company answering to what is set forth in chapter 2. The Lord's arm is not shortened, He can work this now.
I will speak of the outward state of things in connection with three centres: (1) Jerusalem, where Christianity began; then (2) Antioch; and (3) subsequently, Rome. These were centres of the Spirit's activity in the testimony. What opposed the testimony in Jerusalem was the religious element; the Jewish leaders, the priests and scribes, were the opposers. God's testimony now, as then, is Christ Jesus in glory; and God does not display anything until He has first set it forth in the way of testimony; this is
{442}
God's way, and it could be proved all through Scripture. The promises were given in the way of testimony, and they are not in display yet, though confirmed in Christ.
The testimony now is Christ in glory, and God does not display Christ until there has been a full testimony to this. We form part of that which is the present testimony to His glory. The testimony consists not in what people say, but in what they are. Testimony, in the divine thought of it, is what people are. Abraham and those who had promises gave testimony to them by what they were. They were strangers and pilgrims, and sought a heavenly city. Moses¬ testimony was in identification with the people of God in reproach. If we are in the light of Christ's glory, we must accept the other side too, we must be identified with His reproach -- with the cross. Do you think that anyone in the light of the glory of the Lord is governed by what people are here? He is carried in superiority to all here, and that is the testimony.
If you read the beginning of the Acts you can see what the apostles bore witness of; what had they to testify of but the sufferings and glory of the Lord? The apostle Paul did so, too, when he was converted, but he gave witness also to His fuller glory -- that He was the Son of God. The twelve bore witness to the exaltation of Christ as the Holy Spirit taught them, but in the apostle Paul's case, Christ having been revealed to him from glory, immediately he preached that He is the Son of God, and this was additional light to what the twelve had testified. "It pleased God to reveal HIS SON in me", and this was for preaching.
The element at Jerusalem which opposed the testimony was the religious one; it would not tolerate a testimony to an exalted Christ. We have not quite the same character of opposition now; it came directly from the Jewish leaders. Now God has
{443}
scattered the Jews all over the world. The opposition was from without.
At Antioch you get a different form of opposition. The effort of the enemy there was to mar the testimony by bringing in a Judaising element -- insisting that Christians should be circumcised and keep the law. This opposition was from within.
If we pass on to Rome, we do not get there the religious opposition, but the world-power, and the apostle was held in bondage by the world-power. This identifies that time very much with the present; the testimony has come under the world-power -- not in the literal way in which it was in the apostle's day. The world-power is allowed of God in the interests of the testimony, not to dominate it as it does. It was never the intention of God that the world-power should take the control, any more than that the apostle of the testimony should be held in bondage by it. From that time to this, more or less, the testimony has been held in bondage by the world-power. This is what marred the Reformation, it was fettered, and so is the testimony now, by the world-power.
Now I turn to a few details in the chapter in verses 12 - 20. I ask what possible satisfaction could the heart of the apostle have had in the general state of things in Rome, and even in regard of the testimony? Some were preaching Christ of contention. Yet what came to pass in the providence of God was that it became manifest that the apostle was not in bonds as an evil-doer, his bonds were in Christ -- this was manifest in the palace, and to all. This was important, because, if it were not so the testimony would have been marred. This fact of his being vindicated gave an impetus to preaching, but a great deal of mixed motive was betrayed in the preaching. Though there was not satisfaction to the apostle in this, yet his heart was great enough to rise above it. And there was another thing -- he saw it would work for his salvation.
{444}
Personally with him the point was that Christ should be magnified in his body. Salvation here means his complete deliverance from all the power and workings of the enemy, not from prison and bonds. The way of it was by their prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The apostle was so transparent that he could say, "To me to live is Christ", and so Christ was magnified in his body. This, too, was his earnest expectation and his hope.
But we see, too, his thought in regard of the saints, not merely in regard to himself. There was that at Philippi in which the heart of the apostle could find satisfaction, as we see (verses 24 - 30). One point which strikes us is the remarkable way in which his heart went out to the saints. He was in a strait, having desire to depart, but he chose to remain for the sake of the saints, he partook in the affection of Christ for His own.
Nothing can be more beautiful than the affection of Christ at work in him, and exercising him in regard of the saints; it was the reproduction in him of Christ. You cannot understand the church if you do not apprehend the devoted affection of Christ for those whom the Father gave to Him. Death did not change Him, nor resurrection; His affection is ever the same.
Now as to the saints, the apostle wanted that their conversation should be worthy of the gospel of Christ; they were not to be afraid of their adversaries; no one could be afraid of adversaries if they stood in the light of the gospel, in the light of the glory in which God has been pleased to shine forth. We first taste the grace of God, but when the heart has become acquainted with that we learn the glory of God, that is, the effulgence of God shining out in Christ. God has achieved all the purpose of His heart; every attribute of God is set forth in a Man, and that Man is vested with power to conform all to the pleasure of God. Every attribute of God is effulgent in the face
{445}
of Jesus Christ; but more, He has power to subdue everything to Himself, but all has to start from the right hand of God. The new man is created "after God", in righteousness and holiness of truth. That is the work of Christ at the right hand of God, and of the Holy Spirit down here. The light has come in to discover the lost piece of silver; and the light is the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. The first act of Christ from the right hand of God was to give the Holy Spirit, and His last act of power from that place will be to conform us to His own image in glory.
This is the gospel; God has no testimony but the gospel, and the gospel is the light of the glory of God. Outwardly, or apparently, we are in the world, but our souls are in the light of the glory of God. It is only thus that we can walk worthy of the gospel and not be afraid of adversaries; Christ is at the right hand of God in power. We can only bear testimony to His glory as we are in the light of His glory, and in the consciousness of the power with which He is vested to conform all to Himself. This is what God has achieved for Himself.
And our conversation is to be that which becometh the gospel of Christ; and as servants we should be characterised by the affection of Christ, which enabled the apostle to sacrifice his own personal advantage for the sake of the saints. That was really divine affection. May these things mark us more.
{446}
(2) A GENERATION ACCORDING TO GOD
@Philippians 2
It is interesting to observe the progress of the truth in this epistle. Philippians is not doctrinal, it is a practical epistle; it is not exactly an unfolding of the purpose of God, but highly experimental. Sin is not referred to in it, as has been said. In chapter 1 is opened out the state of things which existed in the apostle's day, of which he makes no secret. The apostle was held in bondage by the power at Rome; this was not encouraging, neither was the state of Christians encouraging; he speaks of all seeking their own, and of those who were enemies of the cross of Christ.
In chapter 2, however, we get the generation which is according to God, what might be called a divine generation morally; "children of God", the Philippians were to come out here in that light. The passage does not refer so much to their position, but as to how they were to come out morally. "Blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life". The apostle desired that the saints might be here answering to that which is according to God.
We have to remember that there is divine power here to effectuate in the saints that which is for His pleasure, "it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure". The Spirit of God will carry out that which is for God's good pleasure; it may not be anything great in display, nor yet may it be operated in the channels we might expect, but none the less there is mighty power down here, undiminished power to effectuate what is according to God; the Spirit of God cannot be bound. It
{447}
is a great thing to be in the line and circle where the Spirit of God so works. In the apostle's day what was wrought was that the little company at Philippi should be here bearing the character of the children of God; they were not of great account in this world, for they were but poor; and this is encouraging to us; nothing possibly can exceed our smallness and insignificance, but so it was, too, with the Philippians.
Chapter 3 presents the race, and is individual, and most important in its bearing; the race is also referred to in @Hebrews 12, and again in @1 Corinthians 9, "So run I, not as uncertainly", the apostle shows there the purpose which energised him in running. We do not run a race as a company; it is each one for himself trying to reach the goal.
There are three things which come out in the second chapter: (1) the mind of Christ Jesus, which is also to come out in the saints; (2) the exaltation of Christ; and (3) the generation which was to be here according to God, "blameless and harmless, children of God, without rebuke". I believe the whole is based on the first point. The exaltation of Christ, and the Christian circle here are both based upon the "death of the cross". The Christian circle is the vessel of testimony, for the saints are to shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life. There is but one subject of testimony now; it was not always thus. God has had different testimonies at different times; but the testimony now is Christ at the right hand of God; Christians are said to be "light in the Lord". God has given testimony to the glory of the Lord, and He would have us in the light of it before Christ comes out in display. The Holy Spirit has come down here to report the glory of Christ, and the vessel of the testimony is in the light of that glory. Saints are not anxious enough as to being suitable for that testimony; we all like to be in the light of it.
Now, death is the basis of all; it must be so, for
{448}
there was a man down here after the flesh, under death, under law, and under curse; until that man was set aside to God's glory God could not carry out the purpose of His will; God did not do this until that man had been fully tested, without law, by law, by prophets, and finally by Christ. That man was the difficulty in the way of God.
What has come to pass is this -- a divine Person has come forth, and that Person has gone down into death in order that that man should be for ever set aside to God's glory; thus to remove out of the way what was in the way of God carrying out His purpose. We have on our part to enter in mind into that which Christ entered into actually; we have to come in mind to letting that man go, otherwise there is obstruction to the work of God in me. There could be nothing more important than to come to that: "Let this mind be in you". Death was the point to be reached and God reached it shortly in Christ; we have to reach that end by another road, and it often takes us a long time to reach it, and if you do not reach it, there is constant obstruction in God's ways with you. We are sometimes indisposed to go that road.
But to return to Christ (verses 5 - 11); there are two steps in the course which He took: (1) "He made himself of no reputation"; (2) "He humbled himself and became obedient unto death". He is not spoken of as humbling Himself until He had become a man. He did not consider Himself even when in the form of God, He made Himself of no reputation. How often we assert ourselves, but He made Himself of no reputation, of no account.
Then we have the second step, "He humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross", and death meant the removal of the old man from before the eye of God. When Christ died the man that stood in the way disappeared from under the eye of God, and to God's glory. There were two
{449}
things -- the old man was gone, but more than that, God was glorified where that man was set aside; the man after the flesh who was the obstruction to God carrying out His purpose has disappeared. The apostle had reached death and crucifixion for himself, he could say, "I am crucified with Christ"; we get to it often in a more tedious way.
Are you all content to be as clay in the hand of the potter? If so, you have come to that mind, that the old man has gone. All have to come to the mind of the cross, not to its judgment, for Christ took that. If you do not, you maintain a great obstruction to God's having His way with you.
Now I come to the second point (verse 9), "God also hath highly exalted him". All is put under the hand of man, but not under the hand of the man who offended, but of the One who glorified God; God has highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every name. Name implies renown; it is not the thought here of the authority of Christ over those who believed, but of His universal authority, "every knee shall bow". There are those who are bowed now in grace and faith, but the thought here embraces all. We confess Him now as Lord, with the mouth, but "We see Jesus crowned with glory and honour", all is put under that Man; the world to come is put under man because He has accomplished redemption.
When all which stood in the way was removed, God had a free hand, and He put forth His mighty power, and raised Christ from the dead and set Him at His right hand. When God began with Adam, He began with the dust of the earth, but the starting-point for the carrying out of God's purpose is now the right hand of God -- all emanates from that point. There is given to Christ universal dominion. @John 5 confirms this in verses 22 - 26; we have there two things: "The Son quickeneth whom he will", and (2) all judgment
{450}
is committed to Him, thus there is authority over all. He quickens whom He will, for He is a life-giving Spirit; but it is given to Him also to execute judgment; "as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man". Christ has taken in hand the solution of every moral question, He has been manifested to undo the works of the devil. The offending man had to be removed in another Man, and that Man is the Son of God; and God has now exalted Him, and every knee is to bow to Him, and every tongue to confess Him Lord, to the glory of God the Father; universal authority is given to Him. He is now a life-giving Spirit, but will also execute judgment.
The next great consequence of the death of Christ is a divine generation here, Christ set at God's right hand in heavenly glory is the new starting-point for God. Christians are of the Man who is at God's right hand, for He is a life-giving Spirit, and He operates in all according to God. Who would have thought as regards that little company at Philippi, that the power of God was there? The power of God is still here for the church, that it may be according to God. The power of God is not here merely for the gospel, as many think; the church is the vessel of testimony, and the first activity of God's power is in the church. "It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure". God had wrought, Jew and Gentile had by the Spirit become one body, and that body was Christ's body.
If you look at the character of the company, they were to be without reproach, "blameless and harmless". They were children of God, formed by the love of God; and in return, loving God. It is the generation spoken of in the end of @John 17, "that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them". How very few of us understand what
{451}
it is to be in the love of God; to love God is properly descriptive of Christians; "all things work together for good to them that love God". So also in @1 Corinthians 2, "the things which God hath prepared for them that love him". It is not a special class of Christians, but a proper description of them, though they may not be in the sense of it.
We come now to the vessel of testimony, "among whom ye shine as lights in the world" -- there was no light but the Lord. The apostle did not preach himself, but Christ Jesus the Lord, He is the light. Christ is Man under the eye of God, in whom all is established for God, "we see Jesus crowned with glory and honour". God has been glorified in the Man in whom the offending man was removed, and now the Man in whom He has been glorified is at His right hand. No one would think that we are going to shine in our own light. Precious stones have no light of themselves, they reflect light; the Lord is the source of all light. A diamond in a dark place will not shine; put a Christian in a dark place as to his soul and he will not shine; let him be in the light of the Lord and he will shine. Our fellowship would be attractive if we were all kept in the light of the Lord, there would be nothing wrong or crooked then; we should reflect light as the moon reflects the light of the sun.
We can tell, too, where the water of life is to be found, we hold forth the word of life, and seek to make plain that "whosoever will" may take of the water of life freely. This is the practical result of having reached the cross. It is a great point when you reach the cross, you have got rid of a great hindrance, having put off the body of the flesh, and you are formed in the divine nature; all is from the right hand of God.
May God give us so to see the great reality of these things, that we may accept death, which is deliverance;
{452}
that thus there may be no practical hindrance to God carrying out His purpose in us. If the Spirit of God is occupied in contending against the flesh, there will not be much progress. His proper work is to work in us that we may will and do of God's good pleasure.
{453}
(3) THE RACE
@Philippians 3
This epistle has a peculiar interest to us, for there is a moral connection between what comes out in it and the present time. I admit that it was written at the time when Rome was in the plenitude of its power, and the church in a different condition from what it is now, but still, if we look beneath the surface, there are points which correspond to the present time. First, the world-power had asserted itself in regard of God's apostle. Paul was not a self-constituted apostle, he was God's messenger, God's apostle. He had a testimony from God, and the world-power held him in bondage. So the world-power today claims authority over the church of God. The Queen is recognised as the head of the church in England.
There was no lack of preaching in the apostle's day; many were emboldened to take part in the preaching, for it had become manifest that his bonds were in Christ. The apostle rejoices in the fact of the gospel being preached, but there was not much comfort if he looked at the motives at work in it; this, however, is regarding things as they are viewed in chapter 1, outwardly at Rome.
But in the next chapter we get another standpoint, that is, from the divine side, on the platform of resurrection. This world is the platform where man works, where forces come into collision; but resurrection is God's platform. Sin has been removed and the old man condemned, and God is now free to act according to His will towards man; God is free to justify; and on the platform of resurrection to fulfil all the good pleasure of His will, to act according to Himself. In connection with that there are two things which are the present fruit of the death of Christ, and are what
{454}
God has established on the ground of resurrection. One is the exaltation of Christ, and the other is the Christian company down here.
Christianity is not properly an order of things connected with this world; many regard it so, they go to church and pray for the queen and in regard to many things in the world, but they do not apprehend that the platform for God and the world to come is resurrection. A wonderful revival has come to pass on this earth where Christ was rejected, that is, Christ has been revived. He comes out now in the saints. There is thus the revival of Christ in the very scene where He died. God's good pleasure in the Philippians was that in them there should be such a revival of Christ. The colour in which these Philippians were to come out was of *Christ*. They were a poor people in this world, of no account in man's eye, but a vessel in which God by His mighty power would revive Christ.
The saints are a new generation, morally outside this world, and on the platform of resurrection; and in them there is the testimony of Christ down here. There is the testimony of Christ in resurrection glory at the right hand of God; and there are, too, the excellencies of Christ coming out in the saints down here. Christ is revived in the Christian circle; sin and the flesh have been removed, and the saints are the vessel in which Christ is displayed. It is God who worketh in them both to will and to do of His good pleasure; the good pleasure of God is *Christ*. On the other hand, God works with His saints on the ground of resurrection to deliver them from everything that is not *of* Himself; from sin, the flesh, and the world, and to bring them to the point that they are risen together with Christ. And what is the effect of that? They are here in the character of God in Christ, "blameless and harmless" -- a divine generation -- children of God, shining as lights in the world; the
{455}
little circle being thus the vessel of God's testimony down here. Christ was God's testimony when here; now the church is the vessel of it; but all depends upon God working in us, both to will and to do of His good pleasure.
The Christian can be set free from the bondage of sin and the flesh. So long as we are here sin and the flesh are in us, but a Christian can say, 'I have greater pleasure in refusing the flesh than in yielding to it'. I am free by grace of its control. So too in regard of the world, God has wrought to deliver us morally from this world; and as you are delivered you find the Christian circle outside the great systems of this world. So long as Christians are connected with these they are more or less hid, but they are brought to light when they are apart from the world; they are manifest as the elect of God, holy, and beloved. One could not insist too strongly upon these two consequences of Christ's death: His present exaltation as man, and the Christian circle here in which God works according to His pleasure, bringing the saints into deliverance.
Chapter 3 is of a different character, the apostle brings before us there the true character of what has a place religiously down here, and that the Christian course is a race. There are in the chapter two features which connect what is presented with the present time. At the beginning of the chapter apostate Judaism is seen, at the end of the chapter apostate Christianity, and between these is the race (verses 2, 3). "Beware", is the warning in verse 2 "mark them" in verse 17. At the beginning of the chapter we get terms which describe apostate Jews, "dogs" and "concision"; dogs is a term of opprobrium, and indicates people without moral sensibility of conscience; and concision (not circumcision) that they rested in what was outward, a mere rite. The apostle's word is to beware of such.
But at the end of the chapter we get "many walk",
{456}
and the "many" means the mass. The apostle speaks in strong terms of those as enemies of the testimony of the cross, and that because, I suppose, they sanctioned the flesh. Anyone who gives licence to the flesh is so far an enemy of the cross; such glory in their shame. Christianity had come to this in the apostle's day; the conduct and course of many was a practical denial of Christianity. We can readily see how these things connect themselves with the present time. The church had largely departed before the apostles went, and the "last times" set in immediately after them. If we look abroad now in Christendom it is easy to see those who live selfishly -- for themselves -- while professing the truth.
Now I want to present the contrast to all that. The apostle speaks of running a race; he does not speak of himself as an apostle here, but as a saint. He was a man of like passions with ourselves, but he is brought before us as an example. It has been said that he was egotistical; so in a sense he was; but God intended to set forth in him what His mighty power could effect and compass in a man like ourselves.
It is very important in the first instance that we should find the Christian circle, those who are delivered from the present course of things down here. Our obligations to the Christian circle are foremost; social obligations are secondary. There are no special obligations of the Christian in regard of his business; a Christian goes through the world to provide for his household, but there are but two spheres where Scripture recognises him, first, in the Christian circle, and secondly, in the social circle; but the Christian circle is to have the precedence and the social is secondary. The one is eternal, the other for time. God may break in upon you if you give the social the precedence. If you have found the Christian circle, you fulfil the obligation to love, to let your affections out to Christ and to the saints. If you have reached
{457}
that, then in coming out from that circle you run a race.
The race is connected with the calling, the calling is on high in Christ; there is something to pursue, and when the calling has obtained complete possession of the soul, you have obtained the prize. I turn you now to Ephesians to show you what the calling is; @Ephesians 1: 3 - 5. We have there the calling. It is very simple; the scene of it is heavenly places; the character suited to it, "holy and without blame before God in love"; then the relationship, "predestinated to sonship to God". These are the three great thoughts: (1) heavenly places; (2) the divine nature; and (3) relationship -- sonship. Now the calling never can be consummated down here, because it belongs to heaven. The calling being set before us as a prize is to take complete possession of the soul. We have to be where Christ is, to actually reach the goal; but we can be in the light and power of it now.
Now a race puts a man to the test. There are three things necessary in a race -- patience, purpose, and training -- this is true even in natural things. Many start well, but patience is essential; it is not enough to begin, nor to go on spasmodically. The point is to have an end in view, and not to be diverted from it. Thus purpose is very closely connected with patience. We do not get tired, and weary, and jaded, the grace of Christ sustains us. Anyone not in the light of the calling gets jaded. Justification and the grace of God in bringing a man out of Egypt may lose their freshness in our souls if we do not go on to God's purpose. We have to keep our eye on Christ, for He is the Forerunner; He has got there, and is the pattern of those who are following. He is the leader of our salvation; the shepherd, like Joshua; and purpose means to keep your eye on Him.
Training, too, is very important; we must have the flesh in subjugation. I would ask, What do you
{458}
feed upon? Some feed upon Christian literature; that will not train you. God's discipline will train you. We should not deprecate God's discipline, but rather invite it; God's chastening is our training, that we may "be partakers of his holiness". The flesh is thus held in subjection. If we continue in the race in power, patience and purpose show that we are in training. We are maintained in these by the power of God working in us.
The apostle puts as the first great point, "that I may know him" (verse 10). This is a crucial point; I may know about Him, but here it is to know Himself. Some Christians are more spiritual than others, and it is a real pleasure to know a spiritual Christian; still, no one can come up to Christ; He is perfect in every way, and we have the opportunity to know Him just as the disciples did who companied with Him when here upon earth, and that is more than knowing any saint.
The next thing to know is "the power of his resurrection", that by which God will overturn the whole course of things in this world.
The calling means complete likeness to Christ, according to all Christ is; He was unique when here; but many will be like Him as He is, and God would have this thought to take possession of our souls, "that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus".
One word more -- you do not indulge in reminiscences. You forget the things behind. Some bemoan the past, the good times that have been; but we have to do with the present, and it is a great thing not to look at the things behind, but to the things which are before. There is no behind with the Spirit; the brightness of the church at the beginning will be eclipsed yet by the brightness when she comes down from God as the bride, the Lamb's wife, out of heaven. There are thus greater and brighter things before us
{459}
than ever were behind us. The great point is to go on with the Spirit's present. "Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded". Perfect means those who have reached God on the resurrection platform in the power of the Holy Spirit, outside of the course of things down here; such know the love of God and are freed from the power of sin and the flesh.
No one can say that this is a chapter which is impracticable, or unavailable; it is available for us, and therefore let the truth have its place with us. Christianity is a great thing down here, but the consummation is in heaven, and therefore we look for complete conformity to Christ in glory; we look for the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour from heaven, who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the working whereby He is able to subdue all things unto Himself. That is the end.
May we prove God's mighty power working in the saints, producing patience, purpose, and training, God's calling having complete possession of our souls. May the thought of it encourage us to run the race, "looking off unto Jesus".
{460}
(4) THE MARKS OF ONE RUNNING A RACE
@Philippians 3: 20 to @Philippians 4: 23
I think that it is worth while to draw attention to the intensely individual character of what is presented to us at the end of this epistle.
There are two parts in the epistle: (1) chapters 1 and 2, in which we have the apostle's desire that the saints should fulfil his joy; that these Philippians might be here, morally a divine generation, children of God, in principle occupying the place that Christ had occupied down here. Christ was to be seen in the little company at Philippi.
In the second part, chapters 3 and 4, all is individual. The apostle had had every element of religious distinction, but he was now running a race, and getting farther and farther from what had lent distinction to him as a man, and nearer and nearer to the calling of God, which is the only real distinction. What sort of distinction would that of an archbishop be in the presence of the calling of God! Death is upon all worldly distinction. I thank God that in His providence I have neither been placed in degraded poverty nor high up in the social scale, for all in this world is dung and dross, and nothing worth, all ends in death. The bitter waters of Marah, of death, are here; things being as they are and Christ absent, it must be so. Our true distinction is the calling of God. In @Romans 8 it is said, "We groan ... awaiting sonship ... the redemption of the body"; in this you get what the calling is, namely, sons of God, and the effect of the light of it. That is the distinction of Christians, sonship to God; I do not covet distinction in this world, where death is upon everything, I would prefer obscurity.
The calling is that which God has prepared for Himself, and if you bear that in mind you will readily
{461}
get an idea of what He has prepared for us. @Ephesians 1 first gives the calling, what God has prepared for Himself; and then unfolds what He has prepared for us. The new covenant is what God has prepared for man. So, too, in @Hebrews 12 there are two parts presented, first what is for God, and then what is for man: "Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven"; all that is what God has prepared for Himself. Then we come to what He has prepared for man, "to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling", etc.; all this is for man, but the calling is what God has prepared for Himself; we are brought into sonship for Himself. This side of the truth is what people are slow to enter into. If you enter into what God has prepared for Himself you will have a much clearer understanding of what God has prepared for men.
Now as to the apostle in the race -- the race is in a sense in a man's spirit. The apostle's soul, his whole energies, were bent upon grasping, that is, apprehending, that for which he had been apprehended of Christ Jesus, and he became in mind more distant from where he had started. But I pass on to the end of the chapter; the apostle speaks there of a class, of whom it could be said, "whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things"; the apostle seems here to reach the climax of what he could say of those who began as enemies of the cross. Earthly things may be politics, and many think that something is to be effected for God by politics, but nothing will be effected morally that way.
The apostle's course was the contrast of all this; he says, "Our commonwealth [our citizenship] is in heaven". If you take up politics, let it be the politics of heaven! There will be no great revolutionary
{462}
change on earth, save as consequent upon a change in heaven. When the devil and his angels are cast out of heaven, that involves a momentous change on earth. All is waiting for the church to be in heaven; the man-child Christ is caught up, and the devil and his angels cast out, and no place found for them there. The result is that, having come to earth, Satan occupies himself with the politics of earth. The Roman Empire may revive under the hand of man, but what will give it in its last form force and power will be that it is energised by the devil, who has been cast out of heaven. The great importance to us of that is that we have to look to heaven as to things on earth; for changes that men contemplate are often thwarted, and you get a far truer idea of what will take place on earth by looking to heaven.
I want to give an idea of the thought of "our citizenship is in heaven". A city in Scripture is symbolical of rule. Babylon has ruled, and the heavenly city will rule, and the effect will be that two great things are brought into this world, that is, liberty and light; the nations will walk in the light of the city. When the heavenly city is displayed it will bring with it liberty and light for the earth. Our privileges are connected with that city. "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother". Liberty is connected with it, for it brings in the light of God, and there is liberty only in the light of God. People are in bondage because they are not in the light of God. The heavenly city is full of the light of God, and therefore it is free; there is no bondage there. Our privileges are properly connected with heaven; our citizenship is not of any city on earth. A Roman would have understood what the apostle meant by citizenship, for great privileges attached to Roman citizenship.
Now you cannot understand anything of what God has established save as presented to us in Christ. So in regard of a city, you cannot get the spiritual idea of
{463}
it save as you learn the principle of it in Christ; all is set forth in Him. I do not know much about it, but I see that the only way to understand what my privileges are, what liberty and access are, is to learn them in Christ. I am as free as Christ is, and have liberty of access. Our links are within the veil; we do not judge of God by providences; the Forerunner has gone within the veil and our souls are anchored there; we learn what our privileges are as citizens of heaven, in Christ.
I have spoken of the great change which will be effected when Satan and his angels are cast out of heaven, when that takes place which the Lord foresaw in spirit in @Luke 10: "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven". There is another change contemplated here in the coming of the Lord! He will subdue all things to Himself, and the heavenly city will be displayed; death will be swallowed up in victory; death will be subdued. The rule of death is universal now, but it will be subjected and the Lord will introduce then light and liberty into the world. This will be a greater change than that brought about by Satan and his angels being cast out of heaven. What a mighty change it will be when all the moral darkness here is rolled away and God comes in to reign.
Things are not getting better on earth. We see a sort of civil war; not actual bloodshed, but class set against class. We see, too, on the one hand the most abject poverty, and on the other hand extravagant wealth; that is not according to God, and there will be a great change here. The coming of the Lord will effect it. He will bring in liberty and light, and annul death. When He comes we shall be conformed to Him, our body of humiliation fashioned like unto His glorious body; in condition even we shall be completely like Himself; that is what the coming of the Lord means to us, the change it will effect.
If we get hold of that it will give stability to us.
{464}
So we have in chapter 4: 1 the exhortation, "Stand fast in the Lord", and if we do so we shall "rejoice in the Lord". There is a power at the right hand of God which will bring about the mighty change I have spoken about in regard to things down here. I do not expect anything from man or his actings, all my expectation is from the Lord; He only can bring liberty and light into this world. No one could stand fast in the Lord unless as seeing the importance of the coming of the Lord.
Chapter 4 is the life and conduct of a man who is running the race; it gives the marks of such. The first is that he has much concern and exercise about individuals, he cares for the Lord's people. The more you are in the reality of the calling, the more you are concerned about the progress of individuals; the apostle was so here. "I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord" (verse 2); then he refers, too, to those who had laboured with him in the gospel.
The second mark is freedom from cares; we may not be free of trial, but there is a way by which the mind of the saint may be free of anxiety; the way is, "Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God". The heart of the believer is established in the goodness of God, so that he can go to Him in everything, and the answer he gets is divine peace. We are often fretted by trifles. The "little foxes" spoil the vines; one often does better in great tests than in small ones. It is a great point to take everything to God, "your requests", though sometimes God is too good to give us our requests. Progress is often hindered by saints being corroded by cares here. There is a way out of it in the peace of God keeping the heart.
The third mark is superiority to circumstances. These chapters are intensely individual. In chapter 3
{465}
the apostle speaks of "my Lord", "the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord"; here in chapter 4 he speaks of "my God", "But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus". The apostle had ups and downs, he was not callous, not unaffected; if he abounded, he was exercised; if he suffered need, he was exercised. If he had not been exercised he could not have said, "I know both how to be abased", etc. God has not appointed things to be even for us, and for this reason, that we might be exercised by them. With the apostle there was not indifference, but superiority. He did not falter either in need or in abounding.
Now the fourth mark is rejoicing in the ministration of the saints; the apostle did not look for anything, "not because I desire a gift" -- it is morally low to do so -- but he valued their ministrations as fruit for God, and therefore acceptable to the apostle. Any effect of grace in saints is fruit for God, and acceptable to the servant. The apostle was appreciative of everything that was moral in the saints.
If you study this chapter you will see that these are the marks that come out in one who is running a race. The apostle was doing so; he was getting away in spirit from all that gave man religious distinction, while his soul came more and more under the power of God's calling.
May God graciously exercise us in this way. Things are not much altered from what they were in the apostle's day, they are in many ways analogous. In such a state of things we get the mind of the apostle, that we might follow him (chapter 3: 17), to apprehend the calling of God, what God has prepared for Himself. People often labour to find out what God has purposed for man, and never get the consciousness of it, because they fail to lay hold of what God has prepared for Himself; in seeing this you enter consciously into what God has prepared for men.
{466}
@ACTS 13
It is interesting that in the end of chapter 11 and in chapter 12 we see two powers acting that the world knew nothing about. The Spirit of God *foretells* to the church the famine which was to affect the whole world, and next we see prayer made by the church to God for Peter who was to all appearance fully in the grip of Herod, and Peter is delivered.
In these two things, therefore, the famine and the sword, we see special forewarning and help for those who were dear to God's heart down here.
The church was let into God's mind by the Spirit -- the secret of the Lord being with them that fear Him; and you get the same idea in connection with Abraham when the Lord says, "Shall I hide from Abraham?" etc.
Then in chapter 12 we see how the persecution produces exercise; and prayer as a result is made by the church without ceasing for Peter, because he really was bound up with God's testimony, and so Herod is foiled in his plans, and Herod himself comes to a most ignominious death. Herod was a crafty Idumean, and yet he pandered to the Jews (chapter 12: 3), making nothing of the testimony of God, and God interferes in the matter Himself. It is a dangerous thing to interfere with God's testimony, and Peter represented God's testimony; it was, as it were, bound up with Peter. It is a remarkable expression at the close of chapter 12, "the word of God grew and multiplied" -- God took care of His testimony; the heart of the Christian should be bound up with God's testimony. Prayer was made for Peter, but the reason was that God's testimony was bound up with him. The testimony of God is always bound up with individuals as we get in 2 Timothy: "the same commit thou to
{467}
faithful men"; the Spirit works by living men. The heart of every saint ought to be bound up with the testimony. The moral testimony of the church is needed to support the public testimony.
Ques. "Be not thou ashamed of the testimony of our Lord". Is that the gospel?
F.E.R. Yes; the gospel really sets forth things as they are. The vain show of this world will not last for ever, that is the great point of the gospel, to set forth things as they really are. It is the truth of the glad tidings, that is, things as they really are. One important thing in chapter 12 is that John Mark comes into view, his mother's house is mentioned as a gathering-point for prayer. Care has been taken that we should know something of the writers of the four gospels. We have details of Levi as well as Mark, Luke and John. J.N.D. used to connect the scripture "knowing of whom thou hast learnt them" with the thought that God had given us some details of the men who wrote the gospels. Chapter 12 closes up God's testimony to the Jews. In chapter 13 the Gentiles and Antioch come before us. It was needful for a time that Jerusalem should be the centre. Antioch now becomes a kind of centre, and at the close of the Acts we find Rome really the centre of the Spirit's activities for the Gentiles. How real the Spirit's presence is made for the church -- the Spirit "said", and "they were sent forth by the Spirit". In the early church I do not see that there was any officialism.
You will never have a repetition of what occurred in the early church. In the early church all was regulated by the Spirit. Brethren have tried to build up a system on scriptural lines and I think it will prove a complete failure.
Ques. What is meant by "ministered unto the Lord"?
F.E.R. All ministry is really to the Lord, though it was to the saints it was really to the Lord. Paul
{468}
here traces the history of the children of Israel down, but skips over Solomon entirely; he passes directly to David's true seed, even to Christ. The ark was carried away into the land of the Philistines, the glory was departed from Israel, but then it was that David sang of mercy in @Psalm 136. His mercy endures for ever, and mercy brings in the thought of the sovereignty of God; and David brings up the ark to mount Zion, which all speaks of mercy.
God blessed Abraham in connection with the *world to come*; he was told to come out of this world. Israel in David's time lost the ark which was their glory, and it was carried away because of their unfaithfulness -- the staves, Beauty and Bands are broken, and God comes in on the ground of *mercy*.
David prepared for the house which Solomon was to build for God; Christ, while here on earth, prepared for the building of the house of God in the hundred and twenty who were there ready at the day of Pentecost for the coming down of the Holy Spirit.
What marks the present time is that the blessing of Abraham comes to the Gentiles that they may receive the promise of the Spirit; that is the reconciliation of the world.
Faith comes by the report and the report gives us things as they are. The Head of every man must be in heaven; no man on earth is or could be big enough to be the Head of every man. We get this thought really in what the apostle quotes here from Isaiah: "I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, and for salvation to the ends of the earth". If the sun were on earth, it would not be seen: it must be in heaven that nothing may be hid from the heat of it.
The mercies come out chiefly in connection with David because he it was who had sinned so that there could only be mercy for him.
With regard to the life practically of a Christian, it
{469}
is not really righteous for a Christian to live any other life than by Christ; for his natural life is forfeited -- is gone.
If a man takes up an encumbered property, he takes up all the encumbrances with it; so God in redemption took up all the liabilities which lay upon man.
{470}
CHRIST OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SUPPORT
@Romans 8: 28 - 39
I desire to say a word or two as to the way in which the completeness of the believer's justification comes out in this passage. I have no idea of entering into what is presented to us in the passage as to the purpose of God, for you get an unfolding of the purpose of God here in relation to saints (verses 28, 29). "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are the called according to his purpose", etc. But what I wanted to say a word about is as to two thoughts which are found in what follows: the one is, "Who also maketh intercession for us"; and the other, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" I want to bring before you, on the one hand, the way in which the believer is represented; and on the other hand, the *love* of the One who represents him. Believers are represented before God; Christ makes intercession for us; that is representative; but there is another point of all moment and that is the love of the One who represents us. We are supported by His love: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? ... Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loveth us". The love of Christ is the real support of saints down here in the conflict to which they are exposed as in the wilderness.
Now I do not think this interferes with the ground which you get in other epistles, like Colossians or Ephesians; I think it answers more to what took place typically with the children of Israel in the wilderness. When they came out of Egypt it was the work of the enemy to harass and cut off the weak. Romans refers
{471}
to the wilderness: chapter 6 answers to the bitter waters of Marah; chapter 8 to the brazen serpent; and between the two (chapter 7) is the ground of law. The real support of saints in suffering here is the love of Christ -- and "we are more than conquerors through him that loveth us".
It is a very important point to see that God has been pleased to set forth the justification of believers in Another. I should find it difficult to prove in myself that I am justified. If I were challenged on the point I should be compelled to refer to Another. No one can prove in himself his justification. In a certain sense, I think it may be different in the time to come. In the millennium a man will, I suppose, be outwardly and manifestly clear of the judgment of death that is upon him, though even then the Lord is their righteousness. No one now can say, I am perfectly clear of death. You are free from it as regards God, and the acceptance of it is to you a means of deliverance. "Death is ours"; but you are still subject to it, as to your life on earth, and so long as you are subject to it it is evident you could not in yourself prove that you are justified. You are compelled to point to Another in order to demonstrate the fact that you are justified. Christ "was delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification". If you ask me to give proof and evidence that I am justified in the eye of God, I can only point to Christ risen. If I am not clear of death in myself, I am clear of it in Christ risen. He is risen for our justification.
I can go a point further; I say this -- I am livingly connected by the Spirit with the One in whom I am justified. He is my life. That is the work of God as I understand it. The Spirit of Christ effects this. I am connected with Christ by a living link, but *He* is "raised again for our justification". *Christ* is the end of the law for "righteousness to every one that believeth". *Christ* is the righteousness of the believer.
{472}
The point of justification is not merely that you are clear before the eye of God, but that you are out of the reach of the power of the enemy. You see it in the history of Israel; they were sheltered from the judgment of God in Egypt, but there was another thing, that they should be beyond the reach of the power of the enemy. It was the purpose of God to destroy the enemy -- to break his power, that the people might be for ever free of Pharaoh and his hosts, of everything that was against them. Pharaoh really represented the power of the spiritual enemy, and justification is not merely that you are clear of the judgment of God, but that you are free from the power of the enemy. He is now declared to be the enemy of God.
Well, now, what I see is this: If I look at Christ risen, I see my justification. Supposing there was such a thought in the mind as that a believer was justified in himself, it would be very possible to bring a great many charges of inconsistency against him; and no doubt many Christians are greatly troubled by the sense of their own failure. They measure their acceptance before God by their own state, and so get into bondage. As long as that is the case you expose yourself to a certain extent to the power of the enemy. What I see that God has done is this, not only has Christ been delivered for our offences, but that we might be conscious that we are completely justified in the eye of God. He was raised again for our justification, and we are justified with respect to the judgment of God that was upon us. We are justified as completely under the eye of God as Christ is risen, not only as to the offences, but as to the judgment of God that was upon us.
That is the way in which the Red Sea presents itself to me; not exactly as final judgment, but the judgment of death that lay upon man. It is deliverance from the power of death. Through the grace of God I am clear of that, because not only was Christ delivered
{473}
for our offences, but raised again for our justification. It is useless to charge me with inconsistencies. I admit them, and am fully conscious of them, but my justification is complete in the sight of God in Christ risen from the dead. Not only shall I never come into judgment, but I am free before God from the penalty of death that lay upon me; even while down here I have life in the One in whom I am justified. That is what the apostle appeals to in chapter 8: 33; "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth". Now mark the rest. "Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died", he does not stop there, "yea rather, that is risen again". For justification the apostle does not stop short of Jesus risen.
Now I come to a further point, "Who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession". That is, that the One raised for our justification represents saints in the presence of God. What for? That they may not fail. He makes intercession. You could not have a greater proof of God's purpose than the completeness of Christ's work than that the One who was delivered for our offences is risen again, and is so free of all that He died for that He is at the right hand of God, and maketh intercession for us. God has not only freed us from His own judgment, but He has freed us from the power of the enemy; we are free from fear of accusation of all kind -- all charge of inconsistency, or whatever it may be.
One word more and one of great moment, and that is that Christ *loves* you. A great many people hold doctrinally that He makes intercession for us, but have a very poor sense that He loves us. It is a wonderful thing to think that He loves us. He is not only so free that He can make intercession for us but He loves us. The passage quoted, "It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth?" is a passage applicable to Christ Himself. These verses were true of Christ in
{474}
a certain sense in the presence of God (see @Isaiah 50: 8, 9), He is out of death. And then He is risen, not only to make intercession for us, but to support us in the pathway here, and to uphold us in conflict.
This does not go so far as the priest in Hebrews. It is not here a question of conducting us into spiritual privilege, making us conscious that we are His companions in the sanctuary. That is not the point. The point here is more what we are exposed to. The Christian is exposed to what Christ was exposed to -- "For thy sake we are killed all the day long", etc. We may go to the wall in the world, and get into a good bit of opposition and persecution, but we are more than conquerors through Him that loveth us, and nothing can separate us from the love of Christ. He is so free that He can represent us in the presence of God, and, on the other hand, nothing can separate us from His love.
I venture to say to all here, that is true to the youngest. Christ is the representative of *all*; He loves *all*. He is not your representative because you appreciate Him or understand it. He is the representative of the least as well as of the most advanced. All need Him -- none of us can do without Him. Then He *loves* us all. What a thought for us -- exposed as we are to conflict down here in this world! You may say you do not know much about the conflict -- "killed all the day long; accounted as sheep for the slaughter". But you may have to know it; you may come into it, and you may depend upon it, that whatever pressure or trial you may come into, nothing will separate you from His love; whatever opposition you have to encounter, you are more than conqueror through Him that loves you. That is the great point. It is a blessed thought to me that Christ can carry me superior to anything and everything to which I may be exposed. On the one hand, no charge against me can stand in the presence of God, because Christ is my justification;
{475}
on the other hand, in all the trial and pressure down here I am supported by His love. And the apostle goes still higher, in a certain sense, when He says nothing shall separate us from "the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord". I do not think that is exactly the love of God as enjoyed in the holiest, or in heaven, but rather love which reaches us down here in the conflict to which Christ was once exposed, and we are thus supported in the pathway of Christ Himself.
Well, beloved brethren, it was only just those two thoughts I had before me -- Christ our justification and our support. Christ risen represents us in the presence of God, on the one hand; and on the other, we are supported by His love down here.
{476}
@ACTS 15
(With allusions to @Galatians 2: 1 - 10)
The great point before Satan and his tools was to make the church part of the world system, and the battle as to this has to be fought at Jerusalem.
The great point with many is to have an orthodox faith; but Jesus said, "I am come that they might have *life*, and that they might have it more abundantly". The Spirit is life, Christ living in us and we in Him. The saints in Galatia were very much exposed to Judaising influences, because people came down from Jerusalem and influenced them, so we see God so ordering it that the matter should be gone into and settled at Jerusalem.
Paul went up by revelation; the important point with him was the gospel which he preached; it was not a mere question of circumcision with the apostle, it was a question of *living*. There is such a thing as circumcision in the spirit, it is now spiritual circumcision, that is, of the heart. 'Concision' is used as a term of contempt. Had circumcision been submitted to, the church would have become a sect of Judaism, and the heart would not have been gained for God, and there would not have been *life* for God; Christ came in order to bring in *life*.
The Christianity of today has become a mere creed, and you must be orthodox; but when the Spirit is seen as life, circumcision takes its true place, and it is then that of the heart. You can only put off the body of the flesh in the power of the *Spirit*. You enter upon new ground, resurrection ground, and you want to apprehend what God was about when He raised up Christ from the dead, "faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead". In @Galatians 2: 2 we see the wisdom of the apostle in speaking
{477}
"privately to them which were of reputation" -- to those who were conspicuous, before he brought it forward in a more public way. It was thus *settled* for the spiritual ones before it came forward publicly. Then the troublers evaporated in talk, and then Peter tells them how God had chosen him to go to the Gentiles and had given them the Holy Spirit, apart altogether from circumcision. Abraham was taken out of the world in the first instance; why, then, should not God visit the Gentiles to take out from them a people for His name? The promise to Abraham was, "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed". In @Acts 15: 12 we see "the multitude kept silence", and then wisdom came in by James. It is wonderful that God should allow us to see what was attempted to be brought in to corrupt the gospel. The great point for us is to understand what the gospel means; the point of circumcision was settled once and for ever, but for us it is a great thing to see the principle that was involved, namely, was the church to be incorporated with the world? And for us to see what God intended by Christ: He came that we might live, and not to live according to the course of this world, but to live by Christ; it is that we might live in the present by Christ and not as a future thing, as Paul could say, "Christ liveth in me". If I *live* in Christ, then Christ lives in me. Christ has brought us into the liberty of sonship -- liberty belongs to sonship, and for sonship you must have life and the Spirit. It is the sense of divine love that enables anyone to cry, Abba, Father. The Galatians needed to be brought into liberty, therefore he puts before them sonship. You get three points brought out in Galatians of import as bearing upon liberty: (1) Abraham is our father; (2) I am a child of promise as Isaac; (3) Sarah is our mother, and then you have the exhortation: "Stand fast therefore in the liberty".
You want to insist on what the coming of Christ
{478}
really meant, namely, that we should live by Him; @1 John 4: 9. We want to understand the reality of our relationship with God; God could not give less than sonship, for the last Adam is the Son of God. There is a mighty energy in Him in the Spirit of God; and of the believer it says, "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water". Everything for us depends on the measure in which we know the love of *God*.
<blockquote> "O love supreme and bright!<br>Good to the feeblest heart". (`64:6)</blockquote>
As to things to be eaten, and the rest, God goes back here to the original word to Noah: the blood was not to be eaten, it was to be poured out to God; all life belongs to God. You need not ask questions, but if it comes before us, we must not eat. Acts is a very interesting book, there were many difficulties and trials, but all were surmounted by grace. The great point for us is to maintain the gospel in its integrity, and the aim of it is life in Christ.
