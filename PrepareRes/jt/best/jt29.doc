SPIRITUAL INSTINCTS IN SERVICE
@Luke 3:1 - 21; @Luke 4:1 - 14
J.T. Luke deals with things from the outset. I thought it would be well to consider the application of this principle to those who serve. We have the details here of John the baptist, and of his infancy, and also of our Lord's. I thought particularly of John, the first of whom it is said he was filled with the Holy Spirit from his infancy. It is important to have right spiritual instincts. Instead of what would stimulate the natural, we have the Spirit in the Baptist from the very outset; He would produce right feelings and instincts. "The child grew and was strengthened in spirit", it says, "and he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel". If the principle is brought out as to ministry, on the one hand spiritual instincts are developed from the beginning, and on the other, what is natural is kept in check and worn down by desert experience. John was not only in one desert, but in deserts; and then the word of God comes to him in the desert.
D.L.H. Do you make any distinction between wilderness and desert?
J.T. We have the word 'deserts' in the end of the first chapter, and 'wilderness' here in the beginning of the third. It is the same word in the original. What had you in mind?
D.L.H. I had heard some attempt to make a difference. I do not know of any.
J.T. The suggestion is that the Spirit, being there from the outset, would produce right instincts. John's was an extraordinary case, pointing to the importance of right instincts underlying service, not only intelligence
{2}
and understanding, but instincts and feelings. There would be an enormous advantage in the Spirit being there from the beginning of his history, and then, too, there was something further in the desert experience and the kind of garments he wore and the food he ate. I think it all conforms with divine requirements.
F.F-t. Is it significant that the *word of God* comes upon John? Is it to such that the word of God comes?
J.T. It would so appear. Scripture gives us the setting -- the governmental circumstances. The word of. God comes to such an one as this amid these circumstances. He was not among the governments of the day. John appears as another development outside of them altogether; in the midst of all these dignitaries, to such an one has the word of God come. Here was one having a secret history, a history known to God; in the midst of all these political and religious circumstances there was one who was spiritually matured as under divine care. It is not mere history. It is to bring out the divine requirements in service.
P.L. Do you get that in Timothy? He is a typical man of God in those circumstances. Do his tears suggest instincts suitable?
J.T. Tears are a sign of deeply wrought feelings. Timothy came in where he was needed.
D.L.H. Tears would come in in relation to the ruined state of things. I do not know that it speaks of John the baptist weeping.
J.T. With John we have brought out what God requires, and whatever we may think that stands. There are no short cuts to the service of God.
F.F-t. Do you refer to the sensibilities that are begotten spiritually in private life?
J.T. Exactly -- known to God. Paul spoke to Timothy of the prophecies regarding him preceding --
{3}
the mind of God indicated beforehand. You could hardly expect the presbytery to lay on their hands until there was something there they could note, but God noted everything beforehand. Even the movement of John before he was born is noticed. Anything that responds to Christ in whatever little measure, God notices that.
F.F-n. Would the tears begin in private?
J.T. No doubt. You would begin to *feel* things.
F.F-n. The prophet says, "My soul shall weep in secret", (@Jeremiah 13:17).
J.T. John was marked off before he was born as one who should not drink wine or strong drink; he should be filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb, and he should thus turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, that is to say, he would be in the spirit and power of Elijah, who would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, and thus make way for the Lord. That was the prophecy preceding, but the realisation of all this depended upon training. He was born into a remarkable household. His father had just been under serious discipline, and in the naming of the child he shows that he had learned from the discipline, because instead of naming him Zacharias on the natural line, he wrote down that his name was John. That was an immense thing for John. The father's discipline under the hand of God (and the mother was in it as well) had John in view, showing how God takes care of His servants. So Zacharias gives his name John, and then his mouth is opened and he speaks, praising God.
F.F-n. Do you think that was the result of Zacharias¬ private discipline?
J.T. I think it was. He was not unbelieving now; he had been. Then it says that he prophesied, and his ministry had reference to Christ, not to John, that is to say, in that household Christ is brought in.
{4}
John is brought up in that atmosphere where the father begins to speak, not about him, but about Christ. God had raised up a horn in the house of David, not in the house of Aaron; but then Zacharias turns to the child and says, "Thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest". Thus we see the divine preparation in the household for this special vessel. Then the training was in keeping with all this; it says, "he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel". There was no effort in the training to produce anything in him that would appeal to man's flesh.
F.F-n. Are you speaking now of maturity in regard to service as relating to special servants, or for all to take it up?
J.T. Oh, for all! You do not want to show your child to the world. The showing of the child is to Israel, that is to say, the people of God. The training is in keeping with that. Training for the world is very different.
G.C. How do the deserts apply today?
J.T. That would be keeping the children from the things of the world. You have no other thought for them than that they should be shown to Israel, so to speak, in due course, and if they are to recognise what is spiritual, no worldly training or culture will help, but will hinder. On account of the way many children are brought up, when they are shown to Israel they are very defective; they need to have the reproach of Egypt rolled away. John never needed that. I think Timothy is an example of what can be done. Timothy's father, being a Greek, would hardly help, but the mother's faith must have been strong. The emphasis is on the mother and grandmother. Faith *dwelt* in them.
F.F-n. Would the father being a Greek furnish an indication of the conditions in which the child was brought up?
{5}
J.T. Faith is not said to have been in the father, but in the mother and grandmother. The preponderating influence was evidently with the mother. Both Zacharias and Elisabeth were believers, and they were greatly helped by discipline. The best kind of faith, the most enduring, is brought out of the furnace. Here is a child whose parents¬ faith had been nourished in discipline. Zacharias had asked for something but he did not believe he would get it. God says, I will give it to you anyway, and then I will bring you to it, and that was by discipline. Then, as we have seen, John was in the deserts until the time of his showing to Israel. The Lord is brought in in the next chapter; but I thought that first in John we might see how perfect the result was, that in the midst of these dignitaries in the world -- all under the government of God in their places here -- was a man He could take up. His secret history qualifies him for the word of God to come to him.
Then it says, "he came into all the district round the Jordan". He selects his area of service, all in keeping with his training. He does not go to the places of religious repute to serve. He could easily have attracted attention in Jerusalem, but instead of that it was the district of the Jordan, with all the spiritual memories and teaching that centre around that river. As instructed in the way of the Lord, the minister who should finish up the old dispensation would be learned in the Old Testament. He would know the significance of Jordan, for the truth centring in Jordan abounds in the Old Testament. That is the next thing that would come out in a vessel -- he would know "the way of God", compare @Acts 18:26.
C.F. Does the Lord begin at Jordan, too?
J.T. Quite. He comes to John there.
C.F. Is that why Jordan (baptism) comes before the genealogy in Luke? In Matthew it is after.
J.T. I think so -- to bring out the *order of man*.
{6}
In Matthew it is royalty, but in Luke you get the genealogy identifying the Lord -- that kind of man -- with our race right through Adam to God. It is to bring out what the Lord was. After all had been baptised He was baptised; He was the last apparently. He did not put Himself forward; He claimed no distinction, and as baptised He is *praying*. There was full maturity there; the order of man was fully come to light, and heaven owns it; and now He is identified with our race. Marvellous grace!
G.C. Does He have in view in His service to bring man into accord?
J.T. That is it. What you get in John is that he is instructed in the way of the Lord, and his ministry is governed by the light of it. Isaiah is quoted. In the next chapter Isaiah is again quoted, or read, by the Lord -- the passage that governs *His* ministry. Here we get a passage that governs John's ministry, so evidently we need to be governed by the light governing the position, that is to say, by what the dispensation of God is. If we are governed by that light, we are acting with God. Paul emphasises that the Corinthians were not so governed. Then the next thing is that John sees the people -- the crowds, it says -- coming to him, and he makes no distinction; he calls them a generation of vipers. That was a very strong word to use in preaching, but the point to see is that he *touches their consciences*. He knows what to say.
F.F-n. This was making straight the way of the Lord. I was thinking that the Lord begins in a very different kind of way.
J.T. Oh, very different! It is on the line of grace, but John is on the line of reformation.
H.McM. What does the Jordan stand for?
J.T. It generally means death; it is a leading subject in the Old Testament, with which John was no doubt conversant, so that he begins there.
{7}
H.McM. Is it death and resurrection -- the two together?
J.T. Yes. It stands for death, but death as overthrown by the power of God. But in using this expression, "offspring of vipers", he makes no difference. In Matthew he referred to certain ones, but here he touches the consciences of all, so that they begin to ask what they should do. The ministry was effective. That is the important thing!
J.M. Would you say that the way the servant gets at consciences marks his own individuality?
J.T. I think each has his own way of getting at people.
D.L.H. This would be somewhat on the prophetic line, would it not?
J.T. It would. One has often noticed in @Acts 2:11 that those upon whom the Spirit came were speaking of "the great things of God", but there were no convictions; when Peter spoke a little later there were three thousand converted. He had his own divinely given way of getting at them and of applying the truth.
J.M. It is always the truth.
J.T. It is, but you must know how to apply it.
P.L. The Lord was a "polished shaft", (@Isaiah 49:2).
Ques. Would you say there is room for such a word at the present moment -- generation of vipers?
J.T. Whatever word you use you need to get at people's consciences, so that they begin to ask questions.
H.McM. Would this be our warrant for open-air preaching?
J.T. Surely, but I do not know whether we should use the word 'open-air'. It is preaching, whether indoors or out of doors. Preach wherever you can.
F.F-n. And not always to crowds.
F.F-t. The preacher must have his conviction of sin very deeply to be able to apply it.
{8}
J.T. You may be sure the Holy Spirit had taught John how to repent, how to judge the meanness of his own heart.
F.F-t. And Peter, to whom you referred, knew it very deeply.
F.F-n. I wondered whether the tears would come in there, that is, in the matter of learning what you are yourself. Peter had to weep bitterly.
J.T. Quite so. No doubt he was effective as having gone through that.
D.L.H. John seems to be still on the responsible line, so in answering these questions he points to certain practices which would prove where they were.
J.T. Yes. It is not christianity, but you have general principles noted. He is preaching according to the dispensation under which he is working. It was preparation for the Lord, according to the ministry John had received. He puts them to the test, that is, the question of equalisation, levelling up and levelling down, making straight ways. The different classes come to him, the tax-gatherers and the soldiers, and he has a word for all of them. But we are not reformers; reformation does not belong to this dispensation.
F.F-t. Here it is a people to whom Christ could come.
J.T. Clearly. Then you will notice that a ministry of this kind does not end in outward triumph, it involves suffering -- in John's case imprisonment and death. The passage would also lay stress on the wickedness of Herod -- of that kind of man. He added this to all his wickedness that he put John in prison.
E.H. Referring to the thought of preaching, what does the apostle Paul mean when he says, "I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest ... when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway", (@1 Corinthians 9:27).
J.T. It means just what we are saying. In John
{9}
we see one who kept his body under. It is an athletic figure. In service you keep your body under, that is, you do not allow the natural to come up. You are not satisfying your own ambitions; you do not want to shine as a preacher; you are judging yourself all the time. Many do not do it. They preach, but they become castaways. In no way does it mean that Paul could be lost, but in what he is doing he is seeing to it that he should not be. He is a model for us in this respect.
J.M. The vessel would be done with as to usefulness otherwise.
J.T. Just so. He would be a castaway. The man who does not keep his body under is not saved characteristically at all, yet he may be a preacher. The first epistle to the Corinthians emphasises how far a man may go without being converted.
Now I thought we might just note here the Lord as setting forth the order of man that pleases God. He is baptised, but comes in after the others, and He is praying, showing that He is dependent upon God, and heaven owns Him. Then we have His identification with our race, and then in the next chapter, He being "full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness forty days, tempted of the devil".
G.C. Following your thought as to conviction, John produces conviction. Does that make room for bringing in Christ?
J.T. Quite. Repentance opens the way for the presentation of Christ, but then you see the perfection of maturity in the Lord. John is filled with the Spirit, but the Lord is led of the Spirit. That is to introduce the dispensation in which we are, the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, and the Lord has His place as one who was subject. He was led of the Spirit to where the flesh would not go -- into the wilderness -- and it is to be tempted of the devil; not
{10}
that there was anything in the Lord, but as a model for us. I think the suggestion is that the Lord would not go in the devil's way otherwise, nor should any of us.
P.L. Does it suggest that every servant has to be tested as to the motives that govern him in his service?
J.T. Yes. The first thing in the desert is: Can you live on the word of God? When it is a question of the Lord's service, one is sure to be tried in his temporal circumstances, and unless he goes through this experience and triumphs in it by dependence upon God, he is sure to fall under the influence of men, of money. It is set down as a model for us.
H.McM. Is it important that He returns from the Jordan?
J.T. It is important. You begin from where death is overcome. Then the next thing in Luke is the glory of this world. You may overcome on the line of dependence upon God for your daily bread, but you may get on in the world and make money, so the second temptation is in regard to the kingdoms of this world. It comes third in Matthew, but second here.
F.F-t. Would living by the word of God be like a secret spring? I was wondering as to the force of the word of God here in Luke. It is different in Matthew, is it not? There it is "every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God", (@Matthew 4:4).
J.T. Here it is "*every* word of God". It would not be the word of God in a general way, but in *detail*.
F.F-t. Yes, I wondered if it would mean for us the living expression of God.
J.T. Yes -- His mind, and that in detail. All is essential. As in Matthew, there is a freshness in the words that proceed out of the mouth of God.
F.F-t. The word of God is a feature in Luke. Later we get, "The seed is the word of God", (@Luke 8:11).
{11}
F.F-n. Would this answer to the manna -- every word of God?
J.T. Yes, quite. The manna was of course the Lord Himself -- what He was here for us, but the word of God brings us what is His mind; that is the food for the wilderness. We need every word of God, we must not miss anything.
P.L. What God is saying at the moment is the most powerful weapon against the enemy.
F.F-t. So Luke speaks of attendance on the word. That would be the same line, would it not?
J.T. Yes. So Mary is a model. She sat and listened to what the Lord was saying; she missed nothing. So with Anna. She departed not from the temple, which was the place of communications. She would not miss anything, and sure enough she came in at "the same hour" when wonderful things were happening. Simeon was just speaking the mind of God as to the Babe and she did not miss that.
H.W.E. All this is on the line of preparation for service.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. In Matthew it is what proceeds from the *mouth* of God; that is, it is original. It is direct. There is such a thing today -- that which comes from the mouth of God.
P.L. So that "the Spirit speaks expressly" in the house, (@1 Timothy 4:1).
C.F. It would be in connection with the written word.
J.T. Yes; but you must remember that for many years after the death and resurrection of Christ there were only the Old Testament scriptures, but the word of God was being ministered all the time. That is the spoken word; it is living and operative.
Now I was thinking of the second temptation here, how particularly appropriate it is to young brothers, because the world has a terrible force. Of the young men it is said that, although strong and that the
{12}
word of God abides in them, they are still in danger of the world. Luke has the gentile more in view, because the gentile is more attracted by the world, in a political sense, and exposed to it than the Jew. With the Jew it would be more the temple, the religious feature, which is the third temptation here.
F.F-t. These things come up in new forms, do they not?
P.L. And the enemy tries every temptation.
J.T. Just so. It says the devil "having completed *every* temptation". He omitted nothing. That is a terrible thing to think of, that he would not leave a stone unturned to divert one from the path. But he is defeated, and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee. He is now entering on His service. *He* is doing it. It is not now the Spirit's doing, although the Spirit is available.
Ques. Why does it refer to the power of the Spirit?
J.T. To show that as a perfect Man here He did everything by the Spirit. "If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you", (@Matthew 12:28). The first lesson is the greatest, to be led by the Spirit.
Ques. I notice it says that the devil led Him. Has that any force today?
J.T. I suppose to bring out, as God permits, the power the enemy has, but he had nothing in Christ. I always feel it is not what the devil *can* do; it is *what God may permit* him to do -- a solemn thing. So that in 2 Samuel it is said that God moved David to number the people. In 1 Chronicles it says that Satan moved David, showing the solemn thing that God allowed all this.
P.L. Satan had to get permission as to Job.
P.T. Is not the subtlety of the enemy seen in introducing the element of doubt -- the word 'if'?
{13}
J.T. Indeed. His skill lies in deception. He is the deceiver.
F.F-t. "Led of the Spirit". In the teaching of the gospel are we brought to @Romans 8? Would that be where the education lies for us?
J.T. Quite so. We are marked off as sons of God as led by the Spirit. It is in that way that the kingdom of God is developed -- "not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit", (@Romans 14:17).
F.F-t. So that in passing through the training you would refuse the flesh and allow the Spirit full sway.
{14}
NUMBER TWELVE
@John 3:35; @Revelation 7:1 - 4; @Revelation 21:9 - 16
I have in mind to say a word about administration. Now, in order that there should be an administrative agency here for God, there must be trustworthiness in those who form it, for what is to be administered is precious. It is of God; it has cost Him much and so He withholds committing it until there are those who are to be trusted. Now the ministry of John the evangelist is to bring out this very feature. He tells us that the Father loves the Son. It will be observed that this statement appears *after* the Lord's ministry had begun. John does not wait for the imprisonment of John the baptist to begin his record of the ministry of Jesus. Indeed, he tells us expressly that "John was not yet cast into prison", (@John 3:24) and yet the Lord had been gathering certain ones to Him and working signs among the people. The synoptic gospels relate that John was cast into prison before our Lord began His ministry, whereas John tells us expressly that he was not cast into prison; he does not tell us at all about the imprisonment of John the baptist, and mentions nothing of his want of faith as the others do. He enlarges on his very words to bring out the glory of the Son of God.
The Spirit of God loves to use our words if they are sufficient to convey His mind, hence the voluminous quotations that you get in Scripture from believers. Indeed, in the beginning of Hebrews, where the Holy Spirit enlarges on the glory of Christ, the quotations are nearly all from the book of Psalms. The Holy Spirit could speak directly. He could use His own words to unfold to us the glories of Christ. He does indeed do that in the opening of the first chapter of Hebrews; but then he brings in a list of speakers
{15}
from amongst the saints, as if he would honour the saints by quoting their very words to depict for us the varied glories of the Son of God. And so the Baptist's words are quoted in this gospel for this very reason. He is quoted at length in the first chapter to show how small his estimate of himself was, and how great his estimate of Jesus. He is quoted as saying that "he who sent me to baptise with water, he said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit". And then he adds from himself, "And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God", (verses 33,34).
And so the narrative goes on to the end of this chapter, where one says to John that Jesus baptised. The Baptist answers, "A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven" (verse 27); he sweeps away, as it were, in a sentence the whole fabric of sacerdotal and hierarchical christianity. It is not from above. Nothing is of any value in his mind save what is from above, and so, "He who comes from above is above all", (verse 31). You see how the Holy Spirit uses the words of the Baptist; He reserves him, as it seems to me, for this very purpose, that he might join in the great chorus of loving voices who depict the glory of Jesus. This is the time for learning to do that, beloved brethren. This is the time for learning how, as proving the Lord, as loving Him, to speak well of Him. And so John the baptist is a model for us. He says, "He must increase, but I must decrease", (verse 30). He was a friend of the Bridegroom, and he rejoiced to hear the Bridegroom's voice; hearing it he says, "this my joy then is fulfilled", (verse 29). So that John the baptist does not disappear from the scene in this gospel in the prison, nor in unbelief, nor under a cloud in any way. He disappears like the setting sun, as its countless beams radiate round the western horizon. He goes down joyfully, and he
{16}
leaves Jesus in supremacy as the rising sun to dominate the day. The Baptist's words merge in the words of the evangelist. There seems no mark of distinction. It is as if God would honour his spirituality, although he belonged to a previous dispensation. In spirit he was in ours in his appreciation of Christ -- the great link between all the dispensations; for all are held together, every family of God named of the Father is held in relation to all the others, in love for Christ. He is the binding stone of the whole structure of God.
And so as John's speech finishes the Son of God stands out in His solitary greatness and dignity. It is said, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hands". However different it may appear at the present time, beloved friends, and however much power is in the hands of others ostensibly -- government, and so on -- all *is* delivered (not shall be delivered) into His hands. If He is not exercising it in a public way, it is because He is the perfect Administrator; it is because He would administrate what there is to administer in keeping with the mind of God. Hence in the next chapter we find Him wearied with His journey, "just as he was", (chapter 4:6) as we are told, sitting on the well. He is the Son and has all things in His hands; the government is upon His shoulder; all that God has to display publicly is in His hands, but for the moment He could be a lonely traveller through this world. It was due to God; it was in keeping with the divine way, and so as the solitary, needy soul from the city confronts Him, He administers, He unfolds what He was there for: "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give, me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water", (verse 10). He was in possession of this priceless treasure. You see it was given into His hands and He proposes to *give* it.
I only touch on that -- that the One into whose
{17}
hands all things are given is loved. Why is He loved? Because He is lovable. John makes a point of lovability. Some of us forget that. If I expect to be loved I seek to be lovable. If I seek love I shall remove in myself what would hinder it.
Jesus was loved before the foundation of the world, but that is not the point here. The point here is that He had been ministering, He had been moving about in this world for thirty years and had already begun to minister. He had already begun to speak about God to men. He had already begun to speak about the love of God, that "God so loved the world" (chapter 3:16); He had already begun to speak about new birth and about His own death -- that He would be lifted up ignominiously as the serpent was lifted up in the wilderness. All that had come out, as it were, voluntarily. It had to come out. It was there in volume, for He was "*full* of grace and truth", (chapter 1:14). John is not concerned with what preceded Christ, though the others are. It was the Son of God come into the world and He must act from Himself, and so the Father loved Him.
You say, How does that bear upon us? Well, it is that you begin to do something for God. From the very outset of your spiritual history there are instincts Godward, and these begin to act. They are bound to act. No doubt we may hinder them, but God takes note of every action flowing from His holy nature in us, and we become lovable to God. God can love before we are lovable; such is the love of God, and so it is with the christian, too. As he knows love as it is in God he can love, although there may be unloveliness in the object. The working of the divine nature in the christian is Christ reproduced. You thus become lovable; and you become trustworthy, for he that is faithful in little, however little, is faithful also in much; and "unto everyone that hath shall be given", (@Matthew 25:29). However little it may be, if you have got something, you can get more; that is the divine way.
{18}
I now turn to Revelation. I want to speak about the number twelve, because it denotes this very thing. It is a number much used in Scripture. It stands out from the time it is introduced right on to the end of Scripture. And what I want to say about it immediately, so that you may understand what I have in mind, is that it is a number of *great flexibility*. The schoolchild understands how divisible it is. It is a number of great flexibility, and denotes what the saints are as formed in the divine nature, as in the hands of the Lord for administration.
Now if I am to be in that, you can see that I have got to strip myself of mere individuality and independency. I must be so in the hands of the Lord in relation to all others who are in His hands, that He can send me at His pleasure without any question on my part as regards the rightness of His actions. *I am held in relation to all the others*. I am held in a company that is perfectly divisible in His hands and can be disposed of by Him. As I advance I come to know the wisdom that is in Christ as Head, and I see that He must be free to dispose of His people for the good of all. I see that He knows, and so I surrender myself entirely, as that great vessel Saul of Tarsus did when he said, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (@Acts 9:6) What had Saul already seen? He had seen Christ in His people. He had come up against them in his wilful way of persecution. But what were they? They were in the hands of the Lord. The Lord said to him, You are persecuting *Me*. His saints were Himself in the sense that they were His body. Is Saul to be of that? Yes, he is. He is to represent the love of Christ in its administrative service, but in order to have part in it he is led by the hand into the city. He has to learn to hear from others as well as from the Lord directly.
True enough he got his ministry direct from the Lord, but as to his instruction as a christian, he had
{19}
to learn from the brethren at Damascus. He had to go into the city and be taught, to be told what he must do. So his eyes are opened, as we have often remarked, on a brother, and that brother tells him what to do. He is to arise and be baptised. *Saul* is to disappear entirely. His sins are to be washed away, and he is to be filled with the Holy Spirit. He is merged, indeed, by the possession of the Spirit in the company, and then he goes in and out amongst them. He is with them in Damascus. He is known to be with them, he is one of them and is dependent upon them, if he is to escape the persecuting hand of the king. They let him down in a basket over the wall, through a window. You see thus how you come into the thing. You come in as dependent under God on those who were before you. You can never despise them after that. Your spiritual history begins with them. However much you may say, 'The Lord spoke to me', the saints spoke to you too and so you respect them. If I am ever to serve them I must respect them. Paul was ready to say of some, "who also were in Christ before me" (@Romans 16:7); that was something. We can never forget experienced brethren, aged brethren, and that is ever a sober, wholesome sense to have. It saves us from being independent. It enables us to be in our places so as to represent the number twelve; that is, I can now serve with others, or in relation to them.
You will observe in this chapter in Revelation, everything is held up in the governmental ways of God in order that this administrative company might be marked off. I only refer to it for the principle. I am not speaking of it dispensationally. It refers to the future dispensationally. It is as if God were saying to this world, I have got an administrative company of My own; I am going to bring it forward. You shall see on earth, brought out from the twelve tribes, an administrative company. God notifies men
{20}
about this. We understand it; we wait for it; we know there will never be proper administrative government on the earth until what is thus presented becomes effective. It is not a question of the Lord's administrative ability, but the number of the saints. They are "the bondmen of our God"; they are to be entirely under Him, at His bidding; marked on their foreheads with the seal of the living God. *Life* is that we enter into this.
We have often had it before us, that this book of Revelation gives us the fruits of all the roots of Genesis; and the root of this passage goes back to Jacob. The number twelve begins at Jacob, I mean in the history of God's ways with men -- whatever there may be in the heavens according to His providence. It is a family thought. They were sons of one man, of one father, and from that root the teaching connected with administration in secret is connected. The enemy sought to break it up, as we see in the history of Joseph, but God carried it through. It seemed to have been broken up, but as the family thought in Judah shone in respect of his father and in respect of the "little one", (@Genesis 44:20) Benjamin, Joseph could no longer restrain himself. The family thought reappears, and so it is in the history of the church. However much the enemy has sought to obliterate the family thought, God carries it through. The whole system around us to which I have referred denies the family thought, whereas it is that thought that underlies all that God is working out. I hope we cherish it. He has brought us back to the idea of the family, and, having the family, He has got the means of administration. In family love we are available to God. In all that arises of His gracious service we are perfectly flexible, as I said.
John's ministry is to bring that out, so that the work of God goes on without rivalry, without contention. It is a question of God and what God would
{21}
do, I myself being in His hands. You see here how this great administrative company is brought to light by the seal of the living God. They are to have part in this; the stamp of life is to be there, not inwardly only, but on the forehead where everybody can see it.
Now I want to point out how all the features of the twelve reappear. John goes on to show us the bride, the Lamb's wife, the holy city, Jerusalem. Her light is most precious, he says, like a jasper, and she has twelve gates. At the gates are twelve angels, and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. The vessel is great enough to include in it all the governmental agencies of God. Every instrument of His government in the past is understood, and a place is made for it. Angels have a prominent place with us, and so Israel; and although our inferiors, their very names are cherished. Love for God will always lead us to value what He has used. Paul says, "Our whole twelve tribes", (@Acts 26:7). How he loved them! And James writes to them. Faith never gives them up, and so they are there. It is a feature of the greatness, morally, of the city that she includes every agency of divine government.
The assembly thinks for God, and of those whom God respects. The identification of the governmental function of the assembly with that of angels and Israel is most interesting. The golden links of divine love are seen here. It is in the number twelve. And there are twelve foundations. Now we are coming nearer home. Who are these? On them are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; it is a question of the Lamb, they belong to Him. They belong to Jesus who suffered and died for us. We rejoice in them. It will be observed in the epistles that the foundation is connected with them; whether the twelve or Paul, the city is built upon the foundation of the apostles. The thing is given concretely. The Lord says, I will build, but it is by the apostles
{22}
and prophets. It is indisputable, there it is, the foundation of the apostles and prophets. It is no abstract idea. It is a question of what *they* did. How perfectly under the Lord's hand they were!
And now as to the precious stones -- they are *all* employed; they reflect light as we all know. In Ezekiel the king of Tyre had only *nine*, but there are more now, a greater variety for the reflection of the light of God. There are twelve, and a name is given to every one of them. You see how the flexibility of things works into the heavenly city. Every feature of administration appears there, and so that it might be clearly understood that it is not an abstract matter, the measurement is a cube. It is a solid, so to speak, a substance. It is not simply a square, it is a cube, so that the Spirit of God is not presenting us with theory, but with substance -- the thing is there. All that God had in His mind in the way of government is seen there. It is not a question here of our enjoyment exactly; the point is to disclose that there is a vessel in which to bring out concretely in the fullest sense every divine thought of administration. The city is thus the Lamb's wife. She is the vessel through whom. His government is administered on earth.
My object is that there may be some little answer to this number twelve, whether locally or generally. We are being set up as possessors of the love of God; it is in our hearts, so that we love one another; we are thus together without independency or will, perfectly flexible in the Lord's hands for whatever service He may require. It is an immense position and one covets to be in it, to be in that number, so to speak, so that one is at His disposal without a question.
{23}
ASSEMBLY MATERIAL
@Luke 8:15; @1 Peter 1:23; @1 Peter 2:1 - 5
I was thinking of the assembly and the material that is requisite for it, all God's operations at the present time having it in view. Luke has his own way of dealing with this material and so has Matthew; indeed, all the New Testament writers deal with it directly or indirectly. Matthew makes the material the result of revelation; it was a matter of revelation, and revelation is not a moral process; whereas Luke has the moral process in view, and so he deals with "the word of God".
The word of God is not exactly a revelation, although involved in it; revelation is by a divine Person directly. We have it with Peter, and we have it with Paul; in Peter's case it was revelation 'to'; that is to say, the Father had revealed to Peter who the Person was that was before him; in Paul's case it was revelation 'in'. If we go by the record of the same incident in Luke and Mark, we should conclude that Peter's answer to the Lord's query was based on what he *saw* in Christ, but Matthew refers not to that but to revelation by the Father. No doubt, when the Lord propounded the question as to who He was, they reverted back in their minds to what they had seen and heard in Him. Were He to put such a question to us we should revert back to what had come under our notice in Him. So we may assume that all the disciples, including Peter, were concerned on those lines, but then the Father acted sovereignly in relation to Peter's case. But each of them would be concerned to answer, for the question was not put to Peter specifically; it was put to them all, "Whom say ye I am?" (@Matthew 16:15). So that in their exercises (which I
{24}
may remark are those which would be wholesome and educative) the Father acts specifically in regard of Peter. He revealed to him that the Person before him was His Son, the Son of the living God. That He was the Christ Peter might have arrived at, as I said, otherwise; Nathanael arrived at it otherwise, and according to Luke and Mark doubtless Peter also, but it is quite another thing to have the truth by revelation. This Matthew presents.
We have to distinguish between revelation and declaration. In taking account of what had come under their notice in the Lord's words and works and ways, they had been occupied with declaration, and that is the sum of what John presents in saying, "the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". It was what was public and general. But in what the Father had revealed to Peter, and in the Lord's comments we learn that the material was the outcome not of the declaration, but of the revelation, that is to say, the material in result is something outside of man's ken; it comes directly from God; it is spiritual.
Now all that has to be borne in mind in connection with what I am going to say, and that is, that Luke deals with the word of God and this refers to the mind of God, not only as to who Christ is, but as to the mind of God spoken. It is a question of what is spoken, and so completely has it been spoken by Christ, that He is called definitely "the Word". He is called that both by Luke and John; (@Luke 1:2; @John 1:1).
Now the word of God, beloved brethren, coming in thus, involves a moral process in us, and I wish to show the bearing of this on assembly material. Luke in treating of the parable of the sower, regards the seed not as the word of the kingdom, but calls it "the word of God"; (@Luke 8:11). Matthew calls it "the word of the kingdom", (@Matthew 13:19) and Mark calls it simply "the word", (@Mark 4:14,15)
{25}
but Luke calls it "the word of God". Hence it is a question of God's mind and involves a moral process in those who receive it. They are to be affected by it, it is to change their whole outlook; it is to change their taste and their feelings; in a word it is to produce in them a wholly new moral being, and that being is to be "of God". They are to be like God in understanding and intelligence. It is not exactly a question of His attributes, but of His *mind*. Think of being let into the mind of God; it is not even His commandments. Commandments are imperative; we may not understand them, but we have to obey; but the 'word' gives us understanding, so that we know the why and wherefore of things. Thus Luke in treating of this parable of the sower arrives at the good ground. In all the evangelists the other ground is valueless; the only ground which is of any value is that which produces fruit that remains, and so Luke goes to the root and says, "an honest and good heart".
Now it is well to face this, beloved brethren, especially young people, because God intends you for great things. He has great things for you, and He intends you to face them, and to have to say to them. One of the greatest things is that we have to do with Christ, I mean that we are to be Levites and priests. Luke brings that out in the early part of his gospel; he brings out one person who had to do with Him most intimately; that was Mary. It was not merely that she was blessed; she had to do with Christ in the most intimate way, and she was prepared for it.
And so you get Simeon in the temple; he was to have to do with Christ; I am not speaking now of what he would get through Christ, but I am referring to his having to handle Christ. The apostle John speaks about handling the Word of life. What holy hands they must be, what intelligent hands! And so Simeon stands out as a model for us. It is said that
{26}
the Holy Spirit was upon him; his early history is not given to us; he appears suddenly as qualified to handle that blessed Babe. He was to have to do with Him. What training he must have had with God, what experience with God! He was a man who was in communion with God; the Holy Spirit was upon him, and it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit (the most intimate communication, not through an angel but by the Spirit) that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord's Christ. Subsequently to that he came by the Spirit into the temple, and being in the temple by the Spirit he received the Babe into his arms; he had to do with the Babe; he had to do with Christ. And as he takes the Babe in his arms he is qualified. The mind of God comes into his soul; he blessed God; he is a consecrated priest now; his arms are filled with Christ and he says to God, "now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word",. (@Luke 2:29). Note what respect he had for the word; he would not wish to leave before the time, "for mine eyes have seen thy salvation", and then he proceeds to unfold the mind of God with regard to the Babe.
I refer to all this that you may see that we are called upon to have to do with Christ. I am not referring to what you receive from Him as the result of His death, but that we have to do with Him. How important therefore to be formed by the word of God, that is to say, the whole moral being formed by it, every part of the being. Hence the word here is that an honest and good heart receiving the word brings forth fruit *with patience*. It is not here the quantity of fruit as in Mark and Matthew; in Matthew we have a hundred, sixty and thirty-fold, that is to say, there is decline, but still there is fruit. In Mark it is the reverse, the hundred comes last but Luke is not concerned with the quantity of fruit, but the *kind* of fruit, the state of soul in which the
{27}
fruit is borne, that is in patience -- one of the scarcest qualities perhaps that we possess -- and I am speaking for myself.
Here we are confronted with all sorts of difficulties, "difficult times", as the scripture says (@2 Timothy 3:1); they are here now, and patience is required, so that it is a question of the state of soul in which the fruit is borne. You can understand a farmer looking at his land, at the depth of the soil, at the quality of the soil; you say, 'You will have a fine crop here', but he is looking at the soil; it is a question of the soil. So Luke is occupied with the soil, not the quantity of fruit, but the kind of soil in which the fruit grows, the precious outcome of the word, in an honest and good heart. What patience God has had! The patience of God is one of the greatest of subjects. Think of God rising up early, as He says in the Old Testament, to send prophets, and that to "a disobedient and gainsaying people", (@Romans 10:21). We have to be like God if we are to represent Him when we have to do with a disobedient and gainsaying people, and we have to bear fruit in these circumstances. We see this in Noah; he preached; we are told he was a preacher of righteousness. What patience was required as the fruit was so small -- the results so little!
Now I pass on to Peter's epistle, because I want to show you how he regards the new birth. In the epistle to the Hebrews you get something that throws light on the subject as showing how the word operates as received into the soul of the believer -- into "an honest and good heart"; it takes account of the component parts, as I may say, of a believer. There has to be inward adjustment, not only outward, and so we are told in that epistle that the word of God is living and operative, it is sharper than any two-edged sword, it divides asunder between soul and spirit; it is a question of its inward operation. There
{28}
is nothing in the whole universe like it. No surgeon, however clever, can attempt to do what the word of God does. Only God Himself understands man; man is fearfully and wonderfully made; there are inward influences and movements that are beyond the cleverest of men, but they are not beyond the word of God. The word of God knows how to divide between soul and spirit, but He divides it for me, not for Himself. In Philippians we read that the saints were to be joined in soul as well as in mind. We come together and enjoy the word of God and we go home, and our souls are perhaps not much in it, but it may be are in our families. In the beginning "the heart and soul ... of those that had believed were one" (@Acts 4:32); all their goods were in the community. Now the word of God divides asunder between soul and spirit, joints and marrow, alluding to the body. There is spirit, soul and body. The word of God helps me in regard of these, so that there should be adjustment in me, that I may be intelligent as to myself. You say, 'That may mean introspection', but introspection is good; it is wholesome if it be a question of the word of God, for I know by it the principles that are operating in me and I am adjusted.
The result of all that is that there is a birth, as it says, "being born again". Now this is not the "born anew" of @John 3. There are those who reduce the things of God as much as possible; they reduce them down to a minimum so as to avoid exercise, and to avoid study and contemplation, but "a workman that needeth not to be ashamed" (@2 Timothy 2:15) must rightly divide the word of truth, and the word of truth enables me to discern a distinction between @John 3 and @1 Peter 1. In @John 3:6 there is nothing said about being born by the *word*. It is the initial thing, simply born of water and of the Spirit. The result is not a person, but "*that which* is born of the Spirit is spirit". We have to note these things, dear brethren, so as to be
{29}
intelligent. In @John 3 it is that we should be born *anew*, and that refers to the whole person, for it is from the top throughout. There will thus be spiritual instincts, for these are the outcome of the birth in @John 3. But in @1 Peter 1 it is by the word of God, and we get more than instincts, we get intelligent affections that recognise the brethren. I know whom to love, I know when to love, I know how to love; all these are the outcome of being born of the word of God, that is to say, I love with intelligence. It is a question of my mind; my mind is instructed, but then my whole intelligent being is affected because I have been born again by the word of God; "being born again ... by the living and abiding word of God". The result is you have a family of persons who are intelligent; they are of God. It is not exactly "born of God". You may say that I am making fine distinctions, but I am going by the scripture. In the epistle of John you have the expression "born of God"; that is the complete thought, as it brings God Himself in. But what I am speaking of is His word -- the effect of the word of God as bringing about this state in believers, that they may be said to be "born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the living and abiding word of God", all flesh being as grass. Family status, money and all that gives distinction according to man are left behind. "All flesh is as grass, and all its glory as the flower of grass". That is the way it should read, I think, not simply the glory of man, but the glory of flesh. Flesh has its own meaning in Scripture, and it has to be taken in its context; here it is flesh as the outcome of natural birth, and its glory; whatever it is that it may regard as glory is as grass. Do we accept such a judgment as that? "The grass has withered and its flower has fallen; but the word of the Lord abides for eternity", (verses 24,25).
Now I want you to see how all this bears on the
{30}
assembly, upon assembly material, and in order to make the thing clearer in its application to the assembly I shall point out in @Acts 18, where the work at Corinth is recorded, that Paul was pressed in respect of *the word*, for that is how it reads in verse 5. He was grieved in his spirit on account of the idolatry that he saw at Athens, but in chapter 18 he is in Corinth; we are told he arrived at Corinth and found Priscilla and Aquila and abode with them, because they were of the same craft. He wrought with them six days of the week, as it appears, and on the sabbath he went into the synagogue and preached to the Jews; but when waiting for Timothy he was pressed in regard to the word. We should notice that, because it is so urgent that the word of God should have its full action among us. Paul was pressed as to that, not as to wickedness as at Athens, he was pressed on account of the word of God. So the Lord comes to him by night and says, "Fear not, but speak and be not silent; because *I* am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city" (verses 9,10), then we are told that he remained in the city for "a year and six months, teaching among them *the word of God*" (verse 11). Now in the next chapter, which deals with the work of God at Ephesus, it is "the word of *the Lord*", and you may wonder why. I believe the explanation is that in chapter 19 it is a military idea; it is a question of the inheritance, and the assembly in that relation and the conflict that arises in connection with taking possession; so we are exhorted to "be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might", (@Ephesians 6:10). But in @Acts 18 at Corinth it is a question of the action of the word of God with regard to the "much people", for these people were to be formed into an assembly at Corinth -- and how? By the action of the word of God, for God had come in and spoken; He had revealed His mind in the word and
{31}
the saints were to receive it and understand that they were the *assembly of God* in that city. And thus the word of God as allowed to act among us brings about local conditions in connection with which God can dwell. Tabernacle conditions are brought about by the action of the word of God.
In saying that I want to link it up with @1 Peter 2 and 3. You observe the exhortation is that they should lay aside "all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings". Need I comment on this? How applicable it is to persons who are born again by the word of God. In the light of that fact you lay aside these things: malice, guile, hypocrisies, envyings, and evil speakings. These are to be laid aside; they are unfit for people born by the word of God. And then he says, "as newborn babes". It is not that they were that, there is no reproach here attached to the word 'babes'; in Corinthians the word is used reproachfully; (@1 Corinthians 3:1). Paul does not say *newborn* babes in Corinthians; Peter does here because he is dealing with taste for milk -- with unaffected, unadulterated taste. "Newborn babes"; we are to be like that; it is a question of what taste there is for "the pure mental milk of the word". You may say there is not enough for the young among the saints, not enough literature; we have to go outside to get books. Beware of that; there is no "pure mental milk" in any of those books that you get outside; you go to feed your mind, but you will feed it with something impure; it is not pure. We read in @Proverbs 2 verses 12 and 16 of "the man that speaketh froward things" and of "the strange woman, the stranger who flattereth with her words"; the books of this world represent these things to us christians; they are froward; they are against God.
Now what we are enjoined here (and I speak for young christians) is to desire earnestly the pure mental
{32}
milk of the word, for the mind needs to be nourished, and the word of God is intended for that. The nourishment is the pure mental milk of the word, "that by it ye may grow up to salvation". It is one thing to be born again by it, but it is another thing to *grow* by it, that ye may grow thereby; the growth is to salvation, so that one is free from every other controlling influence.
We were speaking this afternoon of the unconquered virgin -- the virgin daughter of Zion and of Jerusalem. It means that you are in salvation, that you are uncontrolled by anything in this world. If you have come under the influence of anything in this world that leads you into bondage, you cannot be said to be unconquered by it. You grow up to salvation here by the pure mental milk of the word, "if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord is good". He *is* good; you see every day the instances of the goodness of the Lord.
Having arrived at that point, it only remains to show the connection with the assembly in Peter's way. Peter uses the word 'stones', the figure, no doubt, arising from the revelation to himself, and what he was as being a stone; he says, "To whom coming, a living stone". I hardly know any passage that tests us like this as to whether we are material for the assembly. To whom are you *coming*? To One who is good. You have tasted it; the word 'taste' refers back to the "newborn babes"; you have tasted that He is good. Now in coming to Him you recognise that He is rejected of men, cast away as worthless. Are you prepared for that? That is the test. He is held to be of no account at all by men; He was presented to them, they had every opportunity of proving Him; then they cast Him away. They were building, but they cast Him away as worthless. That is the One you come to; it is in that connection the passage lies. The members of the assembly come to
{33}
Christ knowing that He is rejected, and rejected in the most scornful way "as worthless"; that is the way men look at Him and, of course, I am reckoned worthless as identified with Him. But He is chosen of God and precious, so that in coming to such a One as that, we are owned of God. He says, 'You will do for Me; whatever they think of you, you will do for Me'; you are "being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ".
Well, that is the relation, as I understand it, of the word of God to assembly material, and God is looking for assembly material. He is not looking for quantity, it is not a question of show in the way of numbers, it is a question of suitable material; all the workings and the operations of God today have that in view, that He might have material for the assembly. May God help us to pay attention to the word, that it may have its action in us individually and in relation to the assembly.
{34}
THE TESTIMONY PASSED ON IN FRESHNESS
@Deuteronomy 31:14 - 30; @Deuteronomy 32:1 - 4,44
It is said in @Ecclesiastes 1:4 that "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever". I have in mind that there is that which is of God on the earth, and that it is to be maintained and passed on from the generation that is passing away to the one coming. I have selected this passage in Deuteronomy because to my mind it fits in with these thoughts exactly, that is, we have Moses as representing a generation -- one marked by extraordinary events. Moses may be taken, indeed, as representative of those who are faithful in the maintenance of what God intends to continue, and we see the continuance in freshness in him.
Earlier, we have in Jacob a generation in connection with which also there were extraordinary events. He, too, passes away in freshness and energy. He, like Moses, passes on unimpaired to the coming generation what he held and treasured. You will recall how he strengthened himself upon his bed and conveyed to his sons the mind of God; in a most striking manner he was able to pass on unimpaired what he had maintained and cherished to those who followed.
So in a later day we have David, another great servant, representing a generation in which there were great events in the unfolding of God's mind in testimony. According to Chronicles he passes away in vigour. It is true that in 1 Kings he is seen as weak and heatless, needing external warmth to keep him alive; but in 1 Chronicles we have a different David -- as if God would maintain this great principle -- for we read there that he stood up upon his feet.
{35}
Doubtless he had learned to do that early. Many of us do not begin thus. You will all recall how the man in @Acts 3 who had been lame from his birth stood up; he had never experienced such a thing, he had never in his life stood up upon his feet. Peter takes him by his right hand -- for God would use every opportunity, every advantage, to help him -- and in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean bids him rise up and walk, and immediately his feet and ankle *bones* were made strong. Without these being made strong he could never have stood on his feet; but as he leaped up, in the consciousness of power in himself which was to be realised in a fuller way later -- in the consciousness of *that*, he stood on his feet.
I would say, beloved young people, that apart from that experience, that is, the power of balance spiritually, you can never hope to be material for the assembly. Unless that is learned at the outset, that is, how to balance, in other words, the power to stand up, we shall never be material for the assembly, we shall be a public charge; we shall be leaning on others. We all know how infants need help in learning to stand and walk, but this man at the very outset of his spiritual experience stood. He was not to lean on others, he was to be an asset among the saints, and so he enters with the apostles into the temple, and he walked and leaped and praised God; and he *held* Peter and John; he held them, they did not need to hold or support him.
Now, obviously, in the passage referred to, David had acquired this power and carried it through; he had learned early to stand upon his own feet. You may be sure that he needed that ability, that balance in his conflict in his youth, when he met the lion and the bear. He had had, too, to stand up against the rebuffs of his elder brethren in the presence of Goliath's challenge. One who had not learned to stand upon his feet would have withered under such a rebuke
{36}
from his eldest brother -- one of Saul's army, but he says, "What have I now done? Is there not a cause?" (@1 Samuel 17:29). There was a cause -- a great cause. The sequel shows what it was, and how fitted and equipped he was for it. What would he have been in the presence of Goliath had he not gone through this experience in his younger days? And so in his old age it is recorded in @1 Chronicles 28:2 -- as if the Holy Spirit would give us a picture of the vessel according to the mind of God -- that he stood up upon his feet and uttered most wonderful things. He spoke of headship -- something that we all need to learn and very few understand. But before David passes away, what was illustrated in his ministry in the ordering of the service of God, for he himself was head, he attributes to God: "Thou art exalted as head above all!" (@1 Chronicles 29:11) he says to Jehovah. That is the end of spiritual development and growth; a blessed end! It was not with him as it was with Nebuchadnezzar, "Is not this great Babylon, that I have built?" (@Daniel 4:30). He says, "all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee", "all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own", (@1 Chronicles 29:14,16). He stood upon his feet before he passed away to make one of the most remarkable utterances on record. The Holy Spirit tells us of it, and that his history, his acts first and last, were written by Samuel, by Nathan and by Gad, men of extraordinary spirituality and intelligence, as if to emphasise the principle of passing on what is of God.
Now Moses stands out strikingly amongst all these great vessels. He had arrived at the age of a hundred and twenty, or nearly so; but he is to die, as Simeon later was to die, according to the word of God; (@Luke 2:26,29). It is a very great thing to live by the word of God, but to die by it, and that God should
{37}
mark the period of one's decease, is a great honour. And so here Jehovah Himself summons Moses and tells him that he is about to die, and that he and Joshua are to appear *in the tabernacle of the congregation*.
Now this is a most remarkable occurrence; it is full of instruction in regard to the epochs making up the history of the dispensation, in regard to the passing of active service and leadership from one set of hands into another. I wish to call attention to what took place in the tabernacle of the congregation in this connection, a connection that perhaps has not been much observed, but one of immense importance. As set up and anointed, the tabernacle is the great central figure in the history of God's people. In the book of Leviticus God *calls* out of it; this underlies the epistle to the Corinthians; it is a question of *calling*; the saints are "called saints" -- the divine call issuing forth from that which God has set up here and anointed, and so believers were gathered in.
In Numbers it is God *speaking in the wilderness*, that is to say, it is God taking account of us in our circumstances in a scene of adversity and trial. Let no one assume that God is at all indifferent to our position in the wilderness; it is Numbers that gives us the different encampments; they were written down by Moses by the commandment of the Lord (@Numbers 33:2) to remind every christian that his particular wilderness circumstances are taken account of. God knows them and He is with you in them normally; so that Numbers is the speaking in the wilderness but out of the tabernacle; the emphasis is on the fact that we are in the wilderness, that God knows it, and that God speaks in it: "The Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai". Now that is Numbers; and so, in every movement of the people, God is there. In fact, in chapter 10 in their first movement from one camp to another, the ark left its own place and went before them -- a most
{38}
touching allusion to the service of the Lord at the present time. Normally He is entitled to the most honoured place amongst us, and every attention, but He leaves that and takes the most menial and arduous and exposed position in order to find a resting-place for us. Such is divine love in the wilderness! It is God in His love moving with us in all our movements, and taking up the most arduous tasks for us. We can reckon on that. There was not a word said about the ark doing that in the directions for the journeyings of the camp, but as the people moved the ark left its place in the very centre of the camp and went before -- exposed itself, so to speak, to find a resting-place.
But in Deuteronomy there is very little said about the tabernacle of witness or of the congregation, because it is a question of spiritual formation in this book. There can be no passing on of the testimony *merely* as a question of light. Deuteronomy is the period in which the Spirit is operating typically. He has come in; He comes in after the brazen serpent. It contemplates, therefore, development, spiritual development in the saints. Without this the testimony must die out, the light must disappear. We may have our Bibles, and there are creeds and catechisms, but the testimony is not in these; and precious as the holy Scriptures are, even they do not convey in themselves the full divine thought. Without spiritual activities, spiritual formation, spiritual growth, the testimony must die. So that Deuteronomy is not a question of light, of what is objective, that is to say, the tabernacle, but of the subjective work of the Spirit, and all this is fully expressed in the great mediator, in the great figure of Moses; so that it is the words of Moses. And then we are given the geographical position in which these words were uttered; (chapter 29:1). Wonderful words! In chapter after chapter he urges motives for the people to love God. In a most skilful manner he urges upon
{39}
them that they should love God; that God has loved them, and at the end he says, "Yea, he loved the people!" (@Deuteronomy 33:3). God loved them, and that love was to be in the people's hearts. So there were two covenants in Deuteronomy. We have one made in Moab besides the covenant that was given earlier at Horeb. You can understand how these two covenants, the first and the second, were intended to enforce the love of God, to bring it home to the people so that it should be in their hearts. It is not simply the love of God objectively, wonderful as that is, but it is the love of God in our hearts, "shed abroad in our hearts", as it says in @Romans 5:5, "by the Holy Spirit which has been given unto us".
Now in the light of these things Moses is to die; and God summons him and Joshua to the tabernacle. If leadership is to pass on from Moses to Joshua, it is to pass on under the most advantageous circumstances; it is God's doing and no transmission can be valid, or effective, or abiding save as it is done by God. Many may essay to be leader, as Adonijah said, "I will be king" (@1 Kings 1:5), and many, like him, have taken things into their own hands, but it is God's disposition, and everything in the divine service and administration must be a question of divine disposition and that disposition is in the tabernacle; it is in relation to the whole system of things that God has set up in Christ; it is no local matter. The tabernacle does not denote what is local, it is universal, it represents the whole system that God has set up in Christ, and that stands, "The foundation of God" (@2 Timothy 2:19) stands; nothing can touch it, and all His dispositions are in that relation; they are general, so that God summons Moses and Joshua to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. God does it.
Now the history of Joshua presents to us a most interesting subject, but I cannot dwell upon that now; but it ought to be studied by every young brother
{40}
and sister. He was known to Moses, he was Moses¬ minister; at times he was much behind his master, but his history in the main indicates spirituality. I do urge on young people the importance of spirituality -- the importance of light, to be sure. But if you take a man like John the baptist, he was filled with the Holy Spirit from his infancy, but the intent was that he was to be spiritual from the outset, and before he had light; his spirituality preceded his intelligence. Intelligence without spirituality is a dangerous instrument. He was filled with the Spirit, we are told, from his infancy; there was the development of spiritual instincts with him. And then he was in the deserts -- mark you, it is in the plural -- where there is nothing for the flesh. How he would learn to keep his body under lest when he had preached to others he himself should be a castaway! (@1 Corinthians 9:27). It is a question of the ability to keep the body under, that is to say, its natural desires and propensities by the Spirit; by the Spirit we are to put to death the deeds of the body, otherwise we are sure to be cast aside. And so John was carefully guarded, first by the giving of the Holy Spirit in his infancy and throughout, and then he was in the deserts until the day of his showing unto Israel (@Luke 1:80), that is to say, God saw to it that this great vessel should be spiritual. By constant self-judgment we are to make room for the Spirit. Above all things be spiritual, that is to say, make use of the Spirit by self-judgment; the intelligence will come; there must be intelligence, and the Lord gives understanding; but as we see in Timothy the instincts of faith were there, and intelligence followed; hence his service. And so with Joshua.
The first great exploit of Joshua is in the battle against the Amalekites. Now, this is all for young people -- it is a young people's battle particularly. Although God would unfurl the standard, and said
{41}
that He would carry on that conflict from generation to generation, yet it had to be begun then. The things written were to be rehearsed in the ears of Joshua that God would utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens. Amalek is a question of the power of Satan in the flesh, that is the issue there, and Joshua, on the principle of prayer and dependence and intercession on high, overcame -- an immense beginning for a man who was to lead Israel into the land of Canaan. He began by overcoming, typically, Satan working in the flesh, and then he accompanied Moses on high, and when Israel went wrong he remained in the tabernacle. The tabernacle having been pitched outside the camp, the place of reproach, he was not ashamed of it and remained in it as a young man. We read that Joshua departed not out of the tabernacle. You see the education of the young man, what spiritual education he had. And yet, notwithstanding all this, in @Numbers 27 when Moses is told he is going to die, he beseeches Jehovah to appoint a man over Israel who should lead them out and bring them in, that they should not be as sheep that have no shepherd; he does not mention Joshua. He does not venture to propose his successor; there is no such thing in Scripture as apostolic succession. The great prototype apostle, Moses, refrained from it. He asks Jehovah to appoint a man; and yet he knew that here was an eligible man whom he knew well, but he did not dare to appoint him until Jehovah spoke. It shuts out all personal predilections and preferences. It is God's doing and God's preference. You may say, I like this brother here and that brother there, but it is God's doing; it is God's province to dispose of His servants. "Separate me now", the Spirit says, "Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". (@Acts 13:2). It is a question of the Spirit. I might like this brother here, and that brother there, but
{42}
what about the Holy Spirit? Is He remiss, is He neglectful? Perish the thought! He is down here, another Comforter, to look after things here, and He is ever active.
And so Moses refrains, and appeals to Jehovah, and Jehovah says, "Take thee Joshua the son of Nun". And what is the commendation? "A man in whom is the Spirit", not a man who can answer the great questions of the moment. In the handling of the testimony of God the Spirit must have His place, and so now here in view of all this God summons the great servant that is about to die and the younger one who was about to take his place, and they are both to appear in the tabernacle of the congregation, the tent of meeting -- that is to say, where God is, where God meets with His people -- and then the glory, the pillar of cloud, comes down over the door of the tabernacle where God indicates His mind. The door is the place of decision, the place in which God indicates His mind.
Think of the glory coming down in connection with the passing of the testimony from the hands of one generation into that of another; out of the hands of one servant into the hands of another! It is a question of the tabernacle of the congregation and refers to the whole divine system; the whole divine system is as it were involved in this; it is no local matter. Think of how important these matters are, and of having to do with them! It refers to the divine, universal system. Think of God who made the heavens and the earth, and who upholds all things, being occupied with this matter -- the passing of the testimony from one servant to another, and when He came down the glory appeared at the door.
Well, Joshua is to receive a charge, but he and Moses are to serve together in a song. You say, You are making room for poets! That is not what is in view here. This song is more than poetry, it is more than rhymes -- much more. Rhyming is a
{43}
matter of words; poetry as ordinarily understood is a matter of skill in the placing of words, the substance may be a mere nothing; it may be a couch, or a house, a lake or a river, or even a tree. What spiritual substance is there in these things? Not any, but here we are dealing with substance in this song. Hundreds and hundreds of years later we read of "the song of Moses"; there is substance in *it*. But what I want to point out is this, that Joshua is allied in this peculiar service with Moses, to show how beautifully the old servant and the young one were merged in perfect harmony; there were no cross purposes. You cannot have cross purposes if you are going to write a spiritual song together; you must be one. Moses wrote the song, but Joshua had to do with it. It was attributed to Moses, to his freshness, to his spiritual faculties, to his intelligence, and it is attributed to Joshua that he was equal to join in this great service with Moses. He joined with Moses in speaking this song in the ears of the people. He will have something of his own, something distinctive from the Lord in time, but for the moment Moses is leading, and Joshua is joining with him, and you have a song, a standing testimony issuing forth at this juncture; it is something that will be retained in the heart and in the mind. We see thus how the testimony goes forward; it is what is in the saints in a spiritual sense issuing forth at this juncture, and it is to remain with them for ever.
I wonder what you understand by this, by the song issuing forth from Moses and Joshua as recorded here. It is put in the mouths of the people, to be retained in the heart, something to be remembered, something to remind us in a positive way of Moses, and on the other hand it is a song well worthy of close attention, a constant rebuke, as its terms plainly show, to the flesh in ourselves!
It begins, "Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will
{44}
speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew". It was not with Moses a question of his years. What a man he was! What freshness marked him! If you sat down by Moses, how much he could have told you, not of what happened in Pharaoh's house, for he would never tell you about that except to humble himself by it. There are those who live in the past and like to recite things that happened -- early reminiscences. These things may be interesting to some, but they do not feed the soul. What does Moses say at the age of a hundred and twenty? As we read, "Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak". He speaks of rain, dew, etc. What an old brother he was, as we speak! How refreshing! How he retained his freshness! These first four verses stand out as a tribute to Moses. How pious souls in Israel afterwards would cherish them and envy such a state in advanced old age! With what glory this great man departs! And then Joshua had part in it. He needed spiritual development and he was not now a youth, but a man of such experience as enabled him in a comely way to have part in this service with the great mediator, Moses, for he had part in the delivering of this song to Israel.
Now, beloved, that is what I had before me in referring to this song -- that there might be at this juncture the passing on of things in a positive way to the coming generation. We see them coming and Joshua is a great model here, so that the coming generation and the one passing away join together in a song, in presenting what is positive and what is to remain in the hearts and in the mouths of the people of God. The law, on the other hand, as written and completed, as we are told here, was to be placed at the side of the ark by the priests who carried the ark. There was a book, not simply ten words, and those who carried the ark actively were to deposit
{45}
it at the side of the ark, and there it is. That is the objective thing contained in the law in relation to the tabernacle, but the song was to be in everybody's mouth, to be kept in the hearts and in the mouths of the people of God.
{46}
THE PRISONER IN THE LORD
@Ephesians 3:1; @Ephesians 4:1; @Genesis 40:1 - 23
J.T. I have been thinking of the idea of a prison as connected peculiarly with Joseph, and of the way in which the thought appears in the New Testament, especially connected with Paul -- the greatest light emanating from it. The idea peculiarly represents limitations -- sufferings, of course, but limitations; and in the two persons mentioned we have the acceptance of the limitations as from God. The apostle, as we may notice, regarded himself as the "prisoner of the Christ Jesus" in chapter 3, although outwardly in the hands of the Romans. In chapter 4 he is "the prisoner in the Lord", meaning that he is there in relation to the Lord, not simply that the Lord has made him a prisoner, but he is there in that relation. The emphasis laid in Genesis on the king's prison will be noted. In chapter 39:20 it says, "Joseph's lord took him and put him into the tower-house, the place where the king's prisoners were confined", and the others were imprisoned "into the place where Joseph was" -- that is the setting.
D.L.H. What are you gathering from the distinction between the king's prison and where Joseph was?
J.T. That they were placed where he was was the advantage for them; all was under God, but correspondence with Joseph's position involved light for them; it involved the solution of their exercises.
J.S. Do you mean that our own apostle addressing that letter of the greatest light from the prison would indicate that we should accept limitations in accord with where the voice comes from?
J.T. That is the point he makes in writing to Timotheus -- that he was not to be ashamed of the
{47}
testimony of our Lord nor of the apostle as His prisoner.
J.S. That would lead to the maintenance of the light; otherwise it might be lost or diminish.
J.T. There should be correspondence with the apostle's position. Timotheus, although not actually in prison, would be in correspondence with Paul's position; it is in that connection the light shines and the solution of all our exercises comes about.
D.L.H. Was not Timotheus himself in prison at one time? "Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty", (@Hebrews 13:23).
J.T. He was indeed, though not when Paul's letter was written; the apostle emphasises his position in the prison in writing to him. He was bound, and it was in relation to the testimony of God, but the word of God was not bound; his imprisonment was not an accident or the outcome of any misdemeanour on his part. He suffered ostensibly as an evildoer, but it was on account of the testimony of the gospel; (@2 Timothy 2:9).
P.L. Do you get that thought in regard of Joseph in the psalm, "They afflicted his feet with fetters his soul came into irons", but then it says, "the word of Jehovah tried him", (@Psalm 105:18,19). Was the word of the Lord in that sense not bound?
J.T. Yes; his education was also in view, of course, "until the time when what he said came about"; that is, I suppose, the light he had from God, as recorded in @Genesis 37. In that chapter he was seventeen years of age and he had light from God which alluded to himself, that he should become an object of reverence to his father and mother and to his eleven brethren, that is to say, he had light typically as to Christ's resurrection and His ascension. In the interval, until that came about, the word of the Lord tried him; he had his own needed education. What comes out in this chapter is that he is in the
{48}
place where the *king's* prisoners were kept, and those that needed interpretations are put into that prison; it was to their advantage. What I mean is that the mind of God is contingent on being in accord with the position of the vessel of the testimony, wherever the government of God has placed it. If it be in limitation we have to accept that, and our non-acceptance of it means our being deprived of the mind of God, whereas our acceptance of it implies that we shall have the mind of the Lord in that position. "Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding", (@2 Timothy 2:7). 2 Timothy is a question of regulation (I mean that is involved in it); it is a question of where I am in relation to Paul. The government of God has affected Paul -- he is limited; the special vessel of the testimony is seen at Rome limited, and it is wisdom to accept that. The endeavour to ignore or break away from the limitation involves loss.
J.S. How do the limitations apply to us?
J.T. In the government of God, the vessel of the testimony is greatly limited and restricted.
Ques. Do you regard the vessel of the testimony today as answering to Paul's position in prison?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. In what way, other than general limitations?
J.T. Well, we are suffering under the government of God from several things. The Spirit of God is greatly hampered by the general breakdown of the public body, and He accepts it.
Ques. Is there any loss spiritually on account of this?
J.T. Well, there is; there is loss. We have not got what they had in early days; our meetings are nothing like what they had; all that can be said now is "thou hast a *little* power", (@Revelation 3:8). The restriction, the limitation, is called attention to there, and that a door had been opened. "I have set before thee an opened door", not an open door, but an
{49}
*opened* one, that is one that had been shut. The Lord has moved and opened a door; that, I think, points to the limitations that had existed.
Ques. Do you suggest that there was gain to the prisoners through Joseph being in the king's prison?
J.T. Of course there was; it was to their great advantage that they were put there. That is how it is stated in chapter 39:20, "Joseph's lord took him and put him into the tower-house, the place where the king's prisoners were confined", and he was there in that prison and Jehovah was with Joseph there. Then it says in the next chapter that the other two prisoners were put "in custody into the house of the captain of the life-guard, into the tower-house, *into the place where Joseph was imprisoned*" (chapter 40:3); that was to their advantage.
Ques. Is that the setting the apostle has in view in @Ephesians 3, where he tells them not to faint because of his tribulations, for it was their glory?
J.T. Just so. And he was the prisoner of the Christ Jesus *for them*, he says; that is no small matter; it was for the nations, so that those of the nations came into the gain of his position.
Ques. Do you suggest that to get the gain of Joseph's service we must not look at him as one of the king's prisoners?
J.T. But he was one of them; he was there, he was where the king's prisoners were kept. Paul was in a like position at Rome, and he received all who came to him; it was a question of coming to him. He was not free to carry on his apostolic service as he was wont to, but he received all who came to him.
P.L. "Onesiphorus ... was not ashamed of my chain but ... sought me out very diligently", (@2 Timothy 1:16,17).
J.T. Quite. That was the gain of it. You may depend he got something that day; he did not go there for nothing, that seeking out was not for
{50}
nothing; the apostle would have told him something worth while.
Ques. Is Onesimus an example of a serviceable vessel born in prison?
J.T. I should say so. He is a contribution to the assembly begotten in the prison; he is sent back as a "brother beloved" -- one of the best contributions. You can hardly conceive of a better than that -- that a brother beloved should have been sent to any locality out of the prison where Paul was; and his own child; he says, "my child", @Philemon 10.
P.H. "Whom I have begotten in my bonds". The brightest features of the truth have often come from prison, have they not?
J.T. Yes, the very brightest. Take Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, Philemon and 2 Timothy, are they not all a witness to us of what issues forth when the limitations are accepted? I do not know that the apostle accepted the limitations fully on the ship, for we have no record of anything in the way of light coming from thence during the time of his voyage to Rome. It was in the definiteness of his acceptance of prison conditions that there was result.
P.H. Conditions from which in his case he was never released.
J.T. As far as we know.
P.L. Were the prophets, as vessels of light, very much on that line? Ezekiel accepts the conditions: "I was among the captives by the river Chebar", then he says, "the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God", (@Ezekiel 1:1).
J.T. That is very good indeed.
Ques. I suppose, whether actually or morally, the prison plays a great part in the history of God's testimony here, does it not?
J.T. The thing is to accept the conditions of limitation. In accepting them the light comes. It was well that Onesimus, as we have been hearing,
{51}
should come into contact with Paul in those circumstances. I suppose you could find nobody like him as a product, one that should be Philemon's for ever; for we have to live with the brethren, beloved, we do not want to part with them for ever.
Ques. Are you feeling that there is a hesitancy to accept the limitations?
J.T. I am sure there is.
P.R. It needs faith.
J.T. Well, yes, and it needs reduction, for there is reproach attached to a prisoner's chains -- to governmental limitations.
P.L. Do you see this in John, too? He is in the isle that is called Patmos in connection with the testimony of Jesus, and he gets the mind of Christ as to the whole situation in regard of the assembly.
J.T. Quite, he accepts the banishment. He was "in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ", (@Revelation 19). But then, he not only accepted the position of limitation, but he had power in his soul to take up his privileges, he was in the Spirit on the Lord's day -- he had power in his soul. We see in the prison at Philippi a similar experience; the limitations were accepted, but there was power inwardly. At midnight, that is to say, when one would be weakest physically and seeking rest if possible, they prayed and sang praises to God; in the limitations there was power inwardly. Now what you get in Joseph is that he was not at all under the pressure of things. He was given to serve these two men, and he might have been perfunctory in the service because it was a menial sort of thing, and he was conscious of being there unrighteously; but he was sympathetic with them. It says, "Joseph ... looked on them, and behold, they were sad", and he said, "Why are your faces so sad today?" (@Genesis 40:6,7). Being sympathetic with them, refers to the buoyancy, the inward power, that the spiritual man has, so that,
{52}
although he himself is in limitations, he is with God and able to help others. He had said, "Why are your faces so sad today?" He need not have said that; all he had to do was just the ordinary duties, but he was sympathetic with them. I have no doubt that any drooping saint turning into Paul's hired house would get set up. There is a certain sister well known to many of us, and it was told me that if any of the saints got down a bit and went to see her they got lifted up -- and she is in prison, having been bed-ridden for about fifty years! But there is power inwardly -- that is the idea.
M.W.B. Your word is of great encouragement to those who are limited, for so many are on sick-beds or in circumstances of great limitation, but what you are bringing before us may be an opportunity for the spread of the testimony.
J.T. It is an opportunity. One knows many who are limited outwardly, but not inwardly; they are enlarged inwardly.
Ques. Was the little maid in Syria a typical case?
J.T. Yes, indeed! She was a captive. I think of her as representative in a concrete way of the teaching of the previous chapter (@2 Kings 4). There we have the whole truth from Romans to Ephesians brought out in a typical way, and I believe that she embodies this, because, although a captive, and in most menial circumstances, she is buoyant and full of spiritual feelings. "Oh, would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria!" (chapter 5:3). She is full of the thing and she has no question about it; she knows the virtue that is with the prophet.
Ques. Would she eventually glory in the limitations?
J.T. She might well do so, if she knew that you and I would be talking about her here.
Ques. Was what we have been speaking of the result of Joseph cherishing the testimony in his heart?
{53}
J.T. Quite. "His word" was what he saw in his dreams and this regarded himself. He saw wonderful things as to himself -- his brethren bowing down, and the sun, moon and eleven stars making obeisance to him. He was buoyant as possessing such light, and the more the pressure on him, the more the light shone. I think it is very remarkable that he noticed the countenances of the two men; the one who has done no wrong becomes the servant of those who have. We should be sympathetic with people in need, instead of being down under the irksomeness of things and, it may be, complaining -- being buoyant in the light, the wonderful light there is that belongs to us, that has reference to ourselves -- the light of the calling of God -- and sympathetic also with the need, the suffering, that exists.
M.W.B. Sometimes we find that the prison is the fruit of failure in some way, not only with individuals but perhaps with meetings. A prison condition exists, great limitation, an evil report, it may be, in the district as to the gospel. Would you still apply the thought in such cases?
J.T. I should. I should say that under all circumstances there is gain in accepting whatever limitations there may be. If you accept the limitations, God will help you in them. I am sure you have found that.
M.W.B. It is a wonderful principle you are bringing out which applies to us, not only individually, and which is most essential, but which applies also to districts which are under the government of God, where it is obvious that prison conditions exist -- that there is hope in the acceptance of them.
J.T. That is the point. The acceptance of the condition brings God in; He never denies us when we accept them.
P.L. You spoke of buoyancy. When Jehovah turned the captivity of Zion, it says, "Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
{54}
rejoicing", (@Psalm 126:2). There had been that inward buoyancy which now breaks out.
J.T. Quite, they had accepted the limitation. They refused to sing the songs of Zion in a strange land; that was intelligent; those songs belonged to certain settings.
Ques. When you speak of the 'king's prison' do you suggest that the Lord may designedly put us into certain positions that we may get the light that is there for us?
J.T. I think so; even though the enemy may have had a hand in it, as with Joseph, yet it is God. In David's case, in one record we read that Satan moved David to number the people, and in the other record, Jehovah moved him to number them. In either case it was God, He wished to bring about conditions through which He could meet David and bless him; these conditions were necessary. There was a design on the Lord's part on account of what was there for the help of those who accepted it.
Rem. The apostle speaks of the thorn in the flesh as the messenger of Satan (@2 Corinthians 12:7) and speaks of glorying in his infirmities. Would that have a bearing?
J.T. It would. "For this thing I besought the Lord thrice"; then he left off, because he saw it was a fixed limitation. There are temporary limitations, but there are also fixed ones, and the prison at Rome was, I suppose, a fixed one, but then he was buoyant in it; he received all who came to him there.
Ques. Would you say Joseph did not look on his as a fixed limitation?
J.T. No, for he asked to be remembered so as to come out of it, and he did come out of it. God took him out in a remarkable way, He took him out in the way he meant to be taken out, for the butler remembered Joseph, although in a forced and tardy way.
{55}
Ques. Would you say those who accept the prison conditions are the ones who really remember Joseph today?
J.T. They are indeed; they do not forget Him.
R.B. If the prison conditions are accepted, the light is assured; we see that in the addresses to the assemblies; (@Revelation 2,3).
J.T. I think that is the point; we are enabled by them to discern where we are. There is an opened door, and it is a question of discerning just where we are and what conditions apply, and it is in the humble acceptance of them, I believe, that the greatest light will come out.
Ques. Do you connect the limitations in a broad sense with the path of separation set out by the Lord?
J.T. I am speaking more of things which the Lord has allowed to happen, and for which we are all responsible. Whatever has happened in the public body is a question for each one of us to face; these things cannot be altered.
In imposing those conditions God's wisdom is seen, because in accepting them we gain through the discipline involved and we hold the truth more firmly. It is in discerning what God is doing in that way and bowing to it, that light comes in. We see what there was here. These men were where Joseph was, and they found a sympathetic touch with him. He had himself more cause for complaint than they had, but he is not complaining; whereas they were sad, but their sadness was caused by the light beginning to operate. So the dreams are told, and you get the unfolding of remarkable things in the interpretation of them.
J.S. You seem to have in mind the heavenly position a good deal.
J.T. What we are at is to show that the acceptance of the limitations owns the hand of God. You own
{56}
the hand of God in them. Paul, I believe, came thoroughly to it, so that he says, I am here the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you. I would have gone to the Jews, but I am here for you. He accepted it. And then in @Ephesians 4:1 he is the prisoner in the Lord; he is perfectly restful in it now. It is not 'of the Lord' but "in the Lord". There is nothing on his conscience at all, he has arrived at the thing thoroughly, and so the light is streaming forth from him in those circumstances. Here in Joseph's case they tell their dreams, and he says, "Do not interpretations belong to God?" he is connecting them with God. He was conversant with visions; but he says "interpretations belong to *God*". You see thus how thoroughly he is with God; Jehovah is prospering him in these limitations. If anyone has a difficulty, God can meet him; God is doing it. There is thus a beautiful testimony to God in the prison.
Ques. Would you say that God interpreted Joseph's limitation in that way in the psalm where it says, "He sent a man before them: Joseph was sold for a bondman", (@Psalm 105:17)? Paul interprets his imprisonment in that he says he is the prisoner of the Christ Jesus for the gentiles.
J.T. Yes. Here they say, We have dreamed a dream, but there is no interpreter of it; there is the acknowledgment of their poverty. That is the case with thousands of people; they do not know how things are; 'There is no interpreter', they say. It is well when people come to that. They have the dream, but it is no use to them, "an interpreter, one among a thousand" (@Job 33:23) is the one they want. Where is he? He is in those limitations. Why? He is there of God; it is the place where the king's prisoners are. He is a man, a man of sympathy, but he is an interpreter.
Ques. When that sympathy is mentioned the prison is spoken of as "his lord's house". Would that
{57}
suggest the sympathetic interest and affection with which he viewed the prison?
J.T. No doubt. Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God?" that is to say, he diverts them from any idea of a specialist. We must not look for specialists; the specialist will not always hold, but God will not fail us.
Ques. Did the prophets feel the need of an interpreter?
J.T. Well, it was revealed to them that the things they ministered were not for themselves but for us; they were set right about that.
C.C.E. Have we not found that people who have not really accepted the limitations you have referred to have, in a general way, lost light in the history of the testimony?
J.T. I think they have. And I will tell you what I think the people of God have suffered from -- specialists, men regarded as specialists on certain lines; that diverts you from God, does it not?
C.C.E. Quite.
J.T. So he says here immediately, "Do not interpretations belong to God?" but then he adds at once, "Tell me your dreams". He is not advertising himself as an interpreter; he is not that. It is not the time for assuming to be anything; but anyway, tell the dreams. If God is interpreting dreams, there is no knowing whom He may use. The thing is to connect those in need with God.
Rem. And Joseph was ready.
P.H. We ought to be able to help our brethren on this line. You were referring to an interpreter, one among a thousand.
J.T. You see how this principle comes in in Job, which is a book of limitations. God puts Job in prison, so to speak, and the instruction comes out in that connection. The interpreter, one among a thousand, is one who is "full of matter", first of all;
{58}
and one who can wait till his elders have finished speaking -- that kind of man. He is certainly no advertiser, no specialist; he is waiting till others have spoken.
P.L. Certainly he has a good deal of buoyancy; his belly "is as wine which hath no vent", (@Job 32:19).
J.T. Yes, exactly, and he is full of matter. We often hear persons taking part in the meetings because they have something, but this man had not only something (and it was powerful in him), but he was able to hold it till his elders had spoken.
Ques. What do you mean by the term 'specialist'? There are different gifts.
J.T. Well, there are those who have had a recognised ability for certain things, but they fail you. We must move on with God, for the man who has helped you today will not necessarily help you tomorrow.
Ques. Have you in mind difficulties arising among us in various ways?
J.T. Well, whatever thing has to be solved, *God* will do it; it is His province.
Ques. Does the key of David come in on that line?
J.T. It is the Lord who opens and shuts; but how great a thing it is to turn to Him! to turn to God in the recognition that He has things in His hand. In turning to God in subjection to Him, and to one another, the difficulty will be solved.
Ques. Would Daniel and his three friends answer to that?
J.T. Quite; Scripture abounds with evidences of what we are saying.
Rem. I thought Daniel and his three friends turned to God and then God was able to make known Nebuchadnezzar's dream to him, and he said, God would give him an answer.
{59}
Ques. Does Paul bring God before us? "If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you", (@Philippians 3:15).
J.T. Exactly. We must not force things. As time is given God will surely make His mind known. "God *shall* reveal even this unto you".
Ques. What is the distinction between "prisoner of the Christ Jesus", and "prisoner in the Lord"?
J.T. I think the Christ Jesus is the One who has done things for God; He is the *anointed* One, and He has the apostle now where He wished him to be -- among the nations instead of among the Jews.
Rem. So the mystery, the assembly, is revealed under those conditions.
J.T. That is what he goes on to say; and he wished them to know that. Then "in the Lord" in chapter 4 means there is nothing on his conscience he is not a felon, but under the Lord in the prison.
Rem. Chapter 4 has more to do with walk.
J.T. Yes; and the authority of the Lord. The next thing is Joseph says, "tell me your dreams, I pray you. Then the chief of the cup-bearers told his dream to Joseph ... and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup". It was as if the mind of God was that the precious life of Christ should be seen in those circumstances -- the vine, the branches, the blossoms and the ripened grapes, all in the order of nature, and the grapes pressed into Pharaoh's cup which was in the hand of the cup-bearer. It seems to me that in those circumstances the light that shines is the beautiful life of Christ pressed out at the end for God -- the life of Jesus.
Rem. The true vine.
J.T. Yes.
Rem. Very much like Aaron's rod that budded.
J.T. Well it is, in the sense that the fruit developed in its own order, but here it is pressed out instead of ripened almonds, the latter denoting faithfulness and
{60}
watchfulness. Here you have the result *for God*; it was into Pharaoh's cup they were pressed.
Rem. You can well understand the remembrance of such an one.
J.T. Then in the baker we have the opposite to that, where instead of Pharaoh getting the bakemeats, the birds got them. There was no ability to keep things for God -- really, you might say, marking the history of the assembly. There is that which is for God, corresponding with the life of Jesus, and there is that, alas! which is for the enemy which should be for God.
D.L.H. There is a passage which seems to correspond very much with that: "We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: to the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life", (@2 Corinthians 2:15,16). God got His portion, and then there was blessing. On the one hand some got life, and found the testimony to be life unto life; but on the other hand, there were others to whom it was death unto death. I suppose that is true still.
J.T. Just so. In 2 Corinthians the apostle enlarges on that thought as to the life of Jesus, speaking of bearing about in his body the dying of Jesus -- what it was for God.
R.B. How beautifully the Spirit of Christ is seen in those words, "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage", (@Psalm 16:6). That is what you mean, is it not? Limitations were accepted fully by Him.
J.T. Quite.
Rem. So that if we accept the government of God -- the prison conditions -- there will be light, and there will be something for God -- the grapes.
J.T. Yes. There can be no doubt the first dream alludes to that, to the life of Jesus coming out in measure in the saints. So in 2 Corinthians the apostle
{61}
is able to bring himself forward in this connection -- how he corresponded with the life of Jesus; but in *them* the enemy was getting what belonged to God. The Corinthians were wonderfully endowed by God, but it was not intended that these endowments should be used for themselves or the enemy; but the enemy was getting the very things God had enriched them with; they were being used for their own glory.
Ques. Would that be through lack of watchfulness? The butler says, "a vine was before me"; he was not going to lose anything; but the baskets were on the baker's *head*.
J.T. Quite, the head was the difficulty; that was the trouble with the Corinthians, and as sure as possible if we rely on our natural ability, the enemy will get an advantage. We may be possessed with what is of God, but the enemy will get it.
Ques. Would you allow the thought of suffering in connection with this? If the life of Jesus is reproduced in the saints, there would be suffering.
J.T. Yes, it is in the suffering the grapes are pressed. You see the care with which the cup-bearer follows the thing up; there is no lapse, the grapes develop, and he uses them as they ripen; whereas with the baker the enemy is allowed to take away the things that were for Pharaoh.
P.L. Does not Abraham keep the birds away in the vision he had? (@Genesis 15:11).
J.T. He did; he was watchful. You see in Protestantism the 'tree' in which the birds of the air have a roosting-place, whereas in Rome the birds of the air are in a cage -- it is "a cage of every unclean and hateful bird" (@Revelation 18:2); they are caged, but nevertheless they are hateful.
Ques. What is the experience today that would answer to giving the cup into Pharaoh's hand?
J.T. I think it is following the thing up; whatever there is, you see to it that it is for *God* and that God
{62}
gets it. There is the vigilance with which the butler follows the thing up.
Rem. So it is not enough to have a personal appreciation of the life of Christ, but it should be presented to God.
J.T. Quite. The cup-bearer was thinking of Pharaoh; the other carried the bakemeats in a loose, unprotected way.
E.R. That was the butler's entire business. I think it is very important to recognise what our business is and to be set for it.
J.T. Yes, quite; to follow the thing up. Fruit comes in its order, and then, when it is ripened, we must see that God gets it.
{63}
HOME TEACHING
@John 1:35 - 39; @John 7:14 - 17; @John 20:15 - 18
I have been thinking, dear brethren, of *teaching*. You will remember how it is said of an intelligent man, as he is called in @Acts 13:7, that he was "amazed at the teaching of the Lord". Being an intelligent man he would have had to do with teaching, but he had not had to do with anything like that which came to his attention in the ministry of Barnabas and Saul. This is noted in the section in which we are told that Saul was also called *Paul*.
I turned to John's gospel, therefore, because it emphasises the thought of teaching, especially in its use of the title Rabbi, applying it to the Lord. It is explained, as you will observe, in this first passage, which I read in order that we should know what was meant. I apprehend that the title or designation has allusion to distinguished teachers, such as the scribes would aspire to be, as known of men, as the Lord said, "They ... love ... to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi", (@Matthew 23:5 - 7). The evangelist John emphasises the use of this title as applying to Christ above the other evangelists. There can be no doubt that he means to convey the distinguished character of the teaching.
I selected the first passage because the title is applied by the two disciples who followed the Lord immediately on His challenging them as to what they sought. It reminds one of what is known in the scientific world, of which one knows little, of certain subtle forces which attract into their own currents. So these two who heard John speaking, followed Jesus and immediately find themselves in the drift or current that was moving with Him; for the movement of Christ necessarily moves everything in a
{64}
moral sense, and *He* was moving, He was walking. Thus they are, as it were, linking on with the thing, and without there being any premeditation or, so far as we know, any previous knowledge of the Lord, they addressed Him as Rabbi, as if their minds were charged with the idea. This suggestion ought to appeal to young believers, for they are made conscious, as directed to Christ and as coming under His influence, that teaching is there, that a Teacher, indeed, is there, One of whom they have need.
They had heard, it says, John speaking. We are told what He said, but that is not what is emphasised in regard of them; it was a question of the speaking; they heard him "speaking"; it was the kind of subtle spirit, as I may call it, which accompanied the words, more in value in a sense than the words themselves. As the apostle Paul says, "Whom I serve with my *spirit* in the gospel of his Son", (@Romans 1:9). In listening to him presenting Christ, the glad tidings of God's Son, the words, of course, would be wonderful, but the spirit of the thing would be more wonderful. And so we find with Paul; he with Barnabas entered, as we read, into the synagogue "and *so spake*" (@Acts 14:1); it is the kind of thing. So here they heard John speaking, and followed Jesus. It is, so to speak, one kind of positive linking them on in their spirits with another positive -- a greater. The work of God in this world involves immensity. Scientific men indicate to us, indeed we know by observation, what an immensity of variety there is in the physical system; but how much more so in what is spiritual. John singularly corresponds with the physical system in presenting what is spiritual, not that he takes up the terms, but as under the influence of the Spirit of God he brings the thing forward. It is a question of the work of God and what accompanies it. So they heard John speaking wonderful words, to be sure: "Behold the Lamb of
{65}
God!" but it is what was behind the words, the kind of indefinable thing that went with the words, which found correspondence in these disciples; they "heard him speaking, and followed Jesus".
Well now, I want to show how this peculiar influence that was operating linked on in their minds with the abode of Christ, and you will see how obvious it is -- especially young ones -- that in coming into the current of things that the drift is toward a *home*. Most of us have been in school in a literal sense, we have had teachers. You may get a teacher of mathematics, for instance, who is excellent, it may be, but you have no desire to go home with him. It is not so here. The Rabbi, the Teacher (for the Holy Spirit is careful to tell us the word means 'Teacher' ), where does He live? You can see how excellently set this is in John's gospel, because it is the home he wishes to lead us to -- the heavenly home, and so, "Where abidest thou?" The Lord knew well what was going on in those hearts, but everything is in perfect order here, in keeping with the idea of movement and influence. The Lord turned and saw them following. It is as if He were to say to us, If you have got a little light, if you have come in any way under this powerful influence, what effect has it on you? Is it affecting you? That is what the Lord would convey to us. He *turned*, it says. Think of what that meant! It was greater than the sun stopping in the heavens that He should turn round to see two people following: "Jesus turned, and saw them following". He wishes to convey to us how He prizes the movement that is the fruit of the work of God. That is what He is looking for; nothing else is of any value.
And so, seeing them following, He challenges them, because He would bring out more, for He loves to hear what they have to say, viewed as subjects of the work of God. The work of God is always true to
{66}
itself, and He knew the extent of it, hence He says, "What seek ye?" And they say, "Rabbi, where abidest thou? He says to them, Come and see"; that is to say, the idea of teaching, the drift of it is towards the abiding-place. Do you think the Lord was silent as they reached that place? What words would flow from His lips surrounded by the home circumstances, as I may say, the home furnishing, where the rigour of the school, and of the schoolmaster, would be absent! They would be in the environment of the home and learn there. What thoughts would be conveyed to them!
What emanates from these remarkable circumstances is the idea of the assembly. No one can be in the assembly rightly save as taught, and, I may add, taught in the abiding-place; that is to say, you get the impression in the abiding-place and you say, This must be in every way provided for, so that in a world of opposition we may have the home and its comforts and its environment before we reach it in finality. We are brought to the thing so that we might value it, and as we value it, we conserve it, and we want to see that as far as in us lies that thing is here.
Andrew, therefore, goes and finds his brother Simon and he brings him to Jesus, and Jesus looks on Simon and says, "thou shalt be called Cephas", and again, so that there may be no mistake as to what this means, we are told the word means "a stone". Now you see the teaching includes the idea of permanency, something that stands the test here. These disciples were thus receiving their first impressions of Christ, and if the Lord has His way with us, the first impressions He makes on us are the best. They may need development, we may need to be brought more fully to them, but they are all there.
In the name given Simon we have the idea of material for a building, and so you say, This wonderful
{67}
place where I have been with the Lord, where He abides, is to be a structure of which I am to be part. It is His thought that I am to be material for this building. It is "Wisdom's house". There is to be a house which is to be known as such, furnished with everything that wisdom can devise. It is love acting as wisdom. As the material appears, Christ, being Wisdom, names it, and in due course wisdom builds.
Now, I am not saying that all this is in John, but I am giving the setting of things here, and if you are ready for the teaching of the Lord as John presents it, you are brought into the divine abode; you are impressed with the divine thought initially, and then you are given to understand that you are to be material for the maintenance of that here in this world; that there should be here, where the opposition is so intense and inveterate, material that will stand. We have the thing in Peter's name: "Thou shalt be called Cephas".
That is what I may call the initial lesson in the home instruction. The home circle is the place for teaching, and that applies literally too. Whatever schools may be, they never supply affection; in the very nature of them they do not supply affection, nor are they intended to do so, they are intended to teach the elements, whereas John's sphere of teaching is in the home circle, and such a circle! It is indeed the circle where Jesus abides -- that is the place; and as I said, the subtle drift leads you there. The mind is drawn that way; and the Lord says, "Come and see", for He loves to see you coming. Every movement of the work of God is delightful in His eye; it is the movement you see in John resulting from the work of God, "Come and see".
And so, too, I would appeal to you, "Come and see" where the Teacher abides -- this great Rabbi that John presents to us. Nicodemus entitles him similarly -- another man who knew what teaching
{68}
means, for he was a teacher of Israel, as the Lord said. He says, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God". He connects the Lord with God. This is a sure evidence of the work of God in the man, and this is ever true to itself, as I said.
Well now, I want to go on to chapter 7, because in these last days the teaching of the Lord is in accord with John's gospel; it is home teaching. From the days of the so-called 'Fathers' there has been little or nothing of home teaching; it is lamentable going back in assembly history to note the sudden disappearance of it. You hardly get any of it outside the Scriptures until you come down to our own times. In our own times, thank God! there has been a revival of the idea. The work of God began to show itself in this connection; it shows itself in movement toward Christ and in desire to be where He is. The test of it is movement in relation to Him. In the thought of dioceses, parishes, cathedrals, there is no idea of movement, it is a fixed order of things, nor is there any idea of a home. They may talk of reservation of the sacrament in these buildings, but does that make them a home? Not at all! It makes them idolatrous; there is no 'real presence' in these things at all. The real presence is in the assembly, and God has brought us back to that; He has brought us back to the idea of the home, the work of God showing itself in response to Christ in this relation.
In our times some heart touched by the Spirit of God in regard of Christ began to speak, and others heard the speaking and they followed Jesus. No more sectarianism, no more partyism! It is Jesus and where He abides -- that is John. And so the teaching, the home teaching has necessarily taken a private or obscure form; and surely we are content to be obscure, if we realise and value the home. Privacy belongs to the home. Of course there is public testimony
{69}
but part with Christ in the home precedes it. That is the drift, beloved, in John's gospel; you get the impression of the home and the teaching there, and you say, I do not want anything outside of that -- that is the thing; no more theology, good-bye to theology and to doctors of divinity now; none of these things belong to the home, to say the least of them. As I said, all these things are fixed here; you would assume that they are to go on indefinitely; whereas the idea of christianity is movement. It is a question of following Jesus and hearing speaking of Him; He is moving. We are going out of the world, going through it and out of it, not setting ourselves up in it. And so the Lord is walking and John is speaking about Him and the two who heard him speaking follow Jesus, for He is the Teacher. Much might be said by way of reproach as to the kind of teaching, and the kind of teachers, but there is this teaching of the Lord, there is this distinctive teaching that goes on in relation to the home, and no christian can afford to be without it. If my speaking this evening were to attract anyone to Christ, one would rejoice, for that is the end of all ministry. There is such a touch, as in the case of John, such a kind of speaking that the hearers followed Jesus. They wanted other teaching and they got it, as I said, in the home.
But although all this is obscure and private, as I said, chapter 7 brings in the public side of it. You will notice, however, that in the beginning of that chapter the Lord is walking in Galilee. In chapter 1 we are not told where He was walking; but He *was* walking; whereas in chapter 7 we are told *where* He was walking; He was walking in Galilee; the allusion is no doubt to the remnant, to remnant times. There was a murderous element in Judaea, hence the blessed Lord accepted the limitations; He walked no more in Judaea, because they sought to kill Him.
{70}
You see what Judaea did for itself, and what christendom has done for itself in turning against Christ. It has restricted Him, but therein is the loss; but Galilee, that is to say, the place of reproach, is gaining. Galilee is where He is walking, but there were those even in Galilee -- His brethren -- who wanted to make a show: "If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world", (verse 4) What a subtle suggestion that is! How many have fallen before it! We may well take note of it. It was Satan's temptation, through those outwardly related to the Lord. If He had ability from God to do these wonderful things, why not trade with it, capitalise it, and use it to make Himself prominent in the world?
John the baptist, earlier, had stood the test of that temptation. They sent to him priests and levites from Jerusalem; (chapter 1:19). What an honour! but what flattery! what an effort of Satan! They were ready to confer anything on John could they have done it, because it would have put honour on them. But John says, No, I am just a voice, "I am not the Christ ... but there standeth one among you whom ye know not ... whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose". That was the position -- they were ignorant of the One who stood among them; but John eulogises Christ; he refuses to eulogise himself; he was not worthy to tie His shoe latchet. What a fine tribute! and what a fine model is John the baptist in this gospel for us! He is set down as such; there is nothing said about his failure in this gospel. And so the enemy comes to Christ: "Shew thyself to the world", he says. The Lord says, "My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready". Whose time? Those who are in relation to Christ outwardly, but who have no faith at all, "For neither did his brethren believe in him", it says, (verse 5). It is persons who do not believe who speak thus; they want to make a show. Persons who do believe on Him retire
{71}
with Him, and are content to be in obscurity; they have the home instead of publicity, and that more than suffices.
But then this wonderful teaching is bound to come out; and it is, indeed, God's mind that it should; that there should be a testimony even in Jerusalem, even in Judaea, in spite of all the opposition to Christ there. Thank God, we see something of that in our day, and we do not grudge anything that reaches them; in fact, the teaching has reached them. The Lord went up to the feast, as in secret, but it was in love -- another wonderful overture of God to the Jews, notwithstanding their opposition! There need be no restriction or reserve in regard of the nominal people of God; let them have everything that we can give them. The Lord went up, we are told, and taught in the temple, not as in public, but as in private. Let the teaching tell its own tale, and it will! However much they may despise the Teacher, the teaching has its own voice, as it has had in christendom; a living voice has been heard there. God has spoken to the apostate system, and is speaking, and will speak, for His patience is involved in it -- the patience of God: "sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them", as @Jeremiah 7:25 says.
But what happens? If we read the chapter, we shall see the effect of it. One thing is, "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" That is the problem -- *having never learned*. Ah, how ignorant they are! knowing nothing at all about the home teaching, they may say, You have never learned, you have no degrees; they know nothing about the home. I am urging upon all to cultivate the home. Let them say what they please, the teaching tells its own tale; here they had to admit it. So if you run down the chapter you will notice how they are set against one another, and divided in their opinions. But there
{72}
stood Christ in majesty amongst them, and He says, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine". That is a voice for christendom. Why do they not know? Because their wills are at work. If anyone is ignorant, it is because his will is at work, there is no other reason. Wisdom's teaching is plain; there is nothing crooked or perverse in it. And so, the Lord says, "If any one desire to practise his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine". It is a great thing to accept the reproach as to where we have got the things, never having learned, as they say. The things themselves have their own voice, and wherever there is the desire to practise God's will they will be accepted, and they are being accepted. The work of God in this chapter is that they do the will of God. I am not seeking publicity, I am doing His will; I desire to practise it, so that the doctrine is known to be of God; it has its own credentials to those who are doing the will of God.
In going on to the last scripture, I want to show you how this principle runs through. In the interval, as you know, the Spirit comes in; the Spirit comes in as the Teacher; as the Lord says, "He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you", (@John 14:26). He is here, as it were, carrying forward every word of Christ, nothing falls to the ground. Not only what is written, but every word of Christ is maintained by the Spirit; He is the Teacher, and so He says, further, "I will send to you ... the Spirit ... who goes forth from with the Father", (chapter 15:26). The Holy Spirit has come down from being with the Father, that is to say, He has a perfect knowledge of the Father's thoughts about Christ. Think of One coming forth from that abode, into which the Son has gone, to witness of Christ! He is the witness of Christ. So we have here, in the Spirit, perfect *firsthand* knowledge of the Father's thoughts about
{73}
Christ; He is here sent by Christ, as having been with the Father, to witness of Him.
Now all that, as I said, intervenes; so that when we come to chapter 20 we have Mary in the most interesting, the most touching circumstances, but still needing teaching, as if to remind us that affection alone, from John's point of view, however precious, is not sufficient. And so the Lord says, "Mary"! It is a question of the state of her heart. How precious to be called by name Yet it is a feature of John that the Lord names us; He would call us by name. Here He says, "Mary", and adds no more. It is a real revival of the link, a known voice pronouncing her name, and she says, "Rabboni", as if again, as I said, governed by the subtle spirit involved in the work of God, and again we have the interpretation of it; it means 'Teacher'.
We are now approaching the very highest position, beloved, but we need teaching. How many of us are interested in the teaching that belongs to *ascension*? What I have been saying as to the abiding-place involves much, but what about the teaching referring to ascension, and the relationship we are brought into in regard of the One who is ascending? How well we may say 'Rabboni'! How one is conscious of it oneself, how little one knows of the inwardness of these circumstances, for that is one point in John, that we are led inward.
And so the Lord says, "Touch me not", as if to say, This teaching is not to be connected now with the earth or with the garden, for at the best, however perfectly furnished our gardens may be, there is a sepulchre there -- an empty grave; desolation marks the whole scene, however perfect the landscape -- the garden remains desolate. The teaching is not to be in regard of it; it now has to do with something else. "Touch me not", the Lord says, 'do not connect Me with *that*'; after all, it is desolation, there is an
{74}
empty sepulchre in it. "Touch me not", He says, "for I am not yet ascended to my Father". The link is to be up there. How much she needed teaching in regard of all this! Then He says, "go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". The teaching is all there, and in that blessed inward relation now; that is the thing, and she is to convey the first great message regarding it; she is honoured in that way. Favoured woman, to be so honoured! The Lord would say as a rejoinder, She well deserved it; yes, she did; she shines above the two great leaders, Peter and John, in this connection. They went to their own homes, but she remained at the sepulchre; she saw the angels, she heard them speak; they reminded her of the dignity of Christ; they sat one at the head and the other at the feet where He had lain; but He was not there.
Now He is here to call her out of the garden into the heavenly paradise of God, where the tree of life is. And so He says to her, "go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". And she delivers the message in a comely way, showing how perfectly she was in accord with the teaching. She is now among the taught, the instructed, "the wise", as Daniel says: and "none of the wicked shall understand" -- that is to say, those who are self-willed -- "but the wise shall understand", (@Daniel 12:10). As a truly wise, instructed, subject person she goes to the disciples, and instead of taking the place of a teacher, she says that she "had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her". Very simple, but very powerful! What credentials have any of us, however many words we may use, unless we have seen the Lord? That is the thing, she had seen the Lord. "Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?" says another great lover of Him (see @1 Corinthians 9:1),
{75}
and so he could speak of Him. Mary had seen the Lord, and He had spoken these things to her. That is all, but how powerful! You can understand the disciples receiving such words and pondering over them, and the Lord comes and stands in the midst where they were -- where these persons were who had received this message, who were to be the recipients of all that it meant, who were dignified as His brethren. As the ascending One, He stood in their midst and said, "Peace be unto you". They were among the instructed, they had the teaching, the most exalted teaching as conveyed in Mary's message.
How much has been spoken of it since. Volumes have been spoken of it; that wonderful message can never be exhausted. I suppose there are no words written so pregnant with meaning, so inexhaustible as those words to those who love Christ, to those who love the home. Those who go to the seminaries do not know anything whatever about them. It is those who love Christ and who learn in the home circle who value such a message as Mary brought.

READING ON @MARK 13
H.H. Could you give us in a few words an outline of this gospel?
J.T. Well, it may be said to be the only gospel that speaks of the Lord as being in full manhood at the outset. It introduces Him as the Son at once. Matthew speaks of the Child and so does Luke; John involves His birth -- His childhood -- in the term 'flesh', but Mark only introduces Him immediately as the Son of God, so that it is obviously a levitical book, that is to say, the Lord is regarded as in the levitical position at the outset. He waits till John is delivered up; in John's gospel He does not. In all the synoptic gospels He waits till John is delivered up before He actually begins to preach and serve, but in John's gospel He begins before John is cast into prison, showing that it was a divine Person here doing what was to be done, whatever that may have been. But Mark particularly records that it was after John was delivered up that He began to preach, and he introduces Him as the Son of God at once, so that obviously, as has often been remarked, the Servant, or levite, is in view. The passage in @Isaiah 9, "Unto us a child is born" is recognised in Matthew and Luke and implied in John, but not in Mark. It is, "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God", (@Mark 1:1).
P.L. Does that connect the levite with the firstborn?
J.T. Yes, I think so. Sonship necessarily underlies the service that is acceptable to God, that is to say, dignity and maturity. I suppose that is what you have been engaged with all through in the consideration of the gospel.
H.F.N. Yes, I think so.
{77}
J.T. Here in this chapter it says that the Lord is leaving the temple -- a movement which has its own meaning. It is not a question of being obliged to leave it, but that He is doing it of Himself.
Ques. Would you say what the link is between that and the widow?
J.T. I think the widow represents the subjective side, answering to God in the old system. There were those who recognized "the treasury" to the very end, but it was for the Lord to make the change.
H.F.N. We were wondering on the last occasion whether chapter 12 was not the great education of the levite in view of an apostate state of things -- a fresh chapter in his experience. Would you go with that?
J.T. Well, quite.
H.F.N. Would this chapter flow out of that? There the Lord is seen sitting over against the treasury, and here He is seen sitting on the mount of Olives.
J.T. I think chapter 12 is the apostate state of things ("they left him and went away", verse 12), but what is of God is owned to the very last both by the Lord Himself and the woman. He is looking on, and she represents the recognition of what was of God to the very end. Then He has to make a change and the change is made in this chapter where He leaves the temple and takes another position on the mount of Olives. The woman is in the recognition of what was there as owning what was of God to the last.
H.F.N. Would you mind opening up the thought in regard to the Lord sitting on the mount of Olives?
J.T. I think it sets forth the present time, the new order of things connected with the Spirit, but there is the fullest care taken of the old before He leaves it. Chapter 11 shows what attention He paid to it, and how He walked in it and answered questions. Then in chapter 12 the apostate condition is dealt
{78}
with, and He sits over against the treasury and takes account of it to the last moment; the woman is the subjective side corresponding to that. For her there would be relief by faith in His movements. He moved out. As we get it here, "as he was going out of the temple", and then it says, "as he sat on the mount of Olives opposite the temple". That is what is done; He moves of Himself. It is deliberate movement made in freedom. He leaves, and in going out the disciples call attention to what it was He was leaving. He knew what He was leaving. So it is in leaving today; the thing should be done; you are not forced out, but you are going out intelligently; morally you are quite aware of what you are leaving. Whatever there may be worth speaking of morally you know all about it, but you are leaving nevertheless. As a matter of fact the temple continued for a good while, but the Lord was leaving it then.
Ques. Why is Andrew brought in here?
J.T. He is a very important servant from John's point of view, for he brought in Peter; but whilst he served well at the beginning he missed the mind of God in regard to food in chapter 6 and in regard to the Greeks in chapter 12. Nevertheless, he is a very important servant in that he was one of the first who followed Jesus. He was one of two of the most distinguished, in the sense that they were the first to follow Jesus according to John. Here He is linked up with Peter and James and John, so that he comes in the fourth in distinction.
S.J.B.C. Have you any thought as to who this disciple was -- one of His disciples?
J.T. I think when it says, "one of his disciples" it is to describe all of them; he would represent them all. The four are mentioned after. But we ought to keep to the two main points here, which are, leaving the temple, and the position on the mount of Olives.
P.L. Do you think that in the four being mentioned
{79}
we have the thought of construction before us in Mark? There are four carpenters in Zechariah, and Mark is the only gospel where the Lord is referred to as the Carpenter.
J.T. Well, I thought Andrew's place would have reference here to the fact that he brought in Peter according to John. He represents the element that would bring in material for the assembly in view of the Lord leaving the Jewish system. He was needed to bring in material for the new building.
P.L. Quite so. Does the mount of Olives suggest the domain of the Spirit through which the Lord would appeal during the dispensation?
J.T. I think so, but if Andrew had been in keeping with that, he would not have made much of the Greeks. Andrew and Philip are brought in together and they fail. In connection with the question of food, the Lord "knew what he was going to do", but He tested these two as to how the thing could be done. They are also connected together with the Greeks. They seemed to be impressed with the importance of the Greeks coming up, and I think the mount of Olives would check that spirit. The Greeks as such were important in the eyes of Andrew and Philip, but the Lord points out to them in His answer that the corn of wheat has to fall into the ground and die. They attached importance to certain persons of distinguished race or history coming into the testimony, and the Lord discredited that. It seemed as if those two brothers thought it was a matter of special importance that the Greeks came up to see Jesus, but the Lord Himself did not attach any importance to them because of their special place in the history of the world.
M.P. Would that correspond with what we have in @1 Corinthians 1:20? "Where is the wise? where scribe? where disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?"
{80}
J.T. I think that is the ground the apostle goes on. He alludes to the wisdom of the Greeks, their great ability in language, learning and literature, and I have no doubt Philip and Andrew had in mind that it was a great thing for them to come, but it is not a matter of any special importance to the Lord. He is no respecter of persons, that is to say, christianity discredits what is spectacular, because God is no respecter of persons.
H.H. "Certain Greeks", it says. What would the temple idea be at the present moment?
J.T. It is the accredited system; the temple stood for that. It represented the accredited system of religion at that time clearly.
Ques. How are we to apply that now, as to the accredited system?
J.T. Well, there is an accredited system in this country, an established religion, and it is not only accredited in the world, but also by law. How are you going to get out of what is established by law and keep a good conscience? You have to understand sonship in order to do that. It is not only that the thing is wrong, but it is established by law; it is marked by antiquity and all that goes to make a religion respectable in this world. Now the Lord was leaving *that*.
J.J. Do you think the Lord had in mind to transfer everything that was good in the old into the new? He could do that.
J.T. I thought that was represented in the four.
J.J. I was thinking of the woman you were speaking of.
J.T. The Lord shows in the woman here what has to be carried over in the four. She represented what was subjective in the old and she was there till the last moment, but here is One great enough to make a change. It requires moral greatness to move out of that which was established by law and which had in
{81}
this case divine credentials. It took great moral power to do that; we see the reality of what it meant to come out in the Acts. The old system was not great enough for this poor widow -- she cast in "the whole of her living".
H.F.N. Is that only done by learning what the mount of Olives suggests? Does the power for it lie there?
J.T. I think so. As He is leaving the temple the remark is made, "see what stones and what buildings!" And the Lord answers, "Seest thou these great buildings? not a stone shall be left upon a stone which shall not be thrown down". That is a settled thing; they are seen in that light on the mount of Olives, that is to say, there is light in the movement out as to what is going to happen to the things you are leaving, however well founded they seem, and however ancient. You are made intelligent as to what is to happen to them as you are leaving.
H.F.N. You made reference to the Acts. Would it come out in connection with Stephen? There was a wholly new centre. The temple had stood for a centre of light.
J.T. I think it would. He represents all that there was in the old; he goes over the ground in a masterly way, and his death meant the end of that system; devout men buried him. There is nothing about the literal burial of the apostles. Stephen's burial is significant because it fits in with earlier burials. There was light in his face as the face of an angel, and the light from heaven in chapter 9 is a clear indication that the old system was over and done with.
H.F.N. Your reference to Stephen in relation to burial is very interesting. Would you mind opening it up a little more?
J.T. Well, I think it is burial in the way it is
{82}
spoken of in the Old Testament. He is regarded as representing what was in Israel and ending it in the full light of heaven; the thing is buried. "He saw the glory of God, and Jesus", and his burial is in that light. Sarah's burial represented the end of that system and Rebecca took her place, and I think the church in the full sense (Rebecca) comes in after Stephen's burial. He is buried in the full light not only of resurrection but of heaven; he is buried in the light of Jesus in heaven, so that everything is secured. There is no doubt of all coming to pass that was in the mind of God about Israel. The Spirit of Christ marked Stephen.
H.W.S. Is there anything in the thought of privacy connected with the new position?
J.T. I think it points to the access we have to Christ. Those four disciples took advantage of the position He took up. He took up another position, and they took advantage of the access. No doubt the others could have taken it, too. Those four would represent those who take advantage of access to Christ in the new position, and thus know what is coming. They are not content simply to know that the stones are to be thrown down. It is an entirely new position in this chapter, and the Lord is calling attention to the new thing by sitting opposite the temple. They want to know what is going to happen. "Tell us, when shall these things be, and what is the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled", that is, they represent those who wish to know the whole truth. They are not content with an inkling, with the first glimmering of light, as many are, but want to get it all.
Ques. Is that the spirit of the woman at the end of the previous chapter?
J.T. Well, I think so. Her act is intelligent and commented on by the Lord. It corresponded with Himself and is that which enters into christianity;
{83}
it is complete self-sacrifice. It was too great for the old system.
Ques. Do you think the four would give a universal character to the new position?
J.T. I think they would -- the new material that He would bring in.
J.J. Why does the Lord give the new light in a prophetic setting?
J.T. That would be to release their minds from the old system they were engrossed in, and He gives the facts right on to the end. It would have a delivering effect upon them, and would acquaint them with what should happen in order to set them free of it.
J.J. Is it similar to the way Paul addressed the Thessalonians, giving them all the facts right to the end?
J.T. Quite. It is very like Revelation -- what the Lord says about Himself -- that the Son does not know is explained by the book of Revelation.
H.H. And would Mark's own exercise as a servant underlie this, in considering what the new system was?
J.T. Quite. The light in this chapter would help him.
H.H. I thought it was because he got help in his own recovery that he set it out in this way.
J.T. Undoubtedly. It is the bearing of the whole thing on the servant here.
Ques. Would Antioch represent the new position at all?
J.T. I think it does. The light from heaven in @Acts 9 is a plain reminder that it is not from Jerusalem; that place was done with; it is from heaven, and chapter 10 is the substantive thing. Light is one thing, but substance is another. Chapter 11 brings out the preaching of the scattered ones on account of Stephen's persecution. They went as far as Antioch; there they preached to the Greeks, and it says, "the Lord's hand was with them, and a
{84}
great number believed and turned to the Lord". There you see the material coming in, but it is still kingdom material. They turned to the Lord and Barnabas goes down from Jerusalem, but he makes no reference to Jerusalem; it is a question of learning from the light. Then we are told "he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit", and "a large crowd of people were added to the Lord". It was an extension of the kingdom; they were brought to the Lord and added to Him. Now the next thing is they make assembly material out of them. Barnabas goes and seeks out Saul and they spent a whole year at Antioch and taught in the assembly. Now you are getting material for the assembly which, I think, would correspond with Andrew, for he was the one who *led* in the bringing in of assembly material. So it says that they taught for a whole year, and "the disciples were first called christians in Antioch". Now you have them marked out as related to Christ outside of Jerusalem, and then the formation at Antioch is noted -- "The assembly which was *there*".
Ques. Did I understand you to say Barnabas would be similar to Andrew in bringing in Paul?
J.T. No; what I said was that I thought Andrew might represent the material brought in by Paul, as Andrew was the first to bring in assembly material; he brought in Peter. So that the work at Antioch proceeds and we are told there were at Antioch certain ones, meaning they were in that place, that is, in the assembly that was there. Hence we have set out the idea of a new system outside of Jerusalem in principle, and then the Holy Spirit administers there. They ministered to the Lord and fasted and the Holy Spirit asked for Barnabas and Saul. "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". He recognises the assembly that was there, and Barnabas and Saul went in a missionary way, forming assemblies. Then we are told that in
{85}
returning they appointed elders in every assembly -- not yet in every city -- but in every assembly, because the idea was to set up the thing in local settings, each church standing on its own feet; each supplied with elders. I think all that legitimately fits in here with the mount of Olives, because it stood over against the things the Lord was leaving.
R.B. Is not the privacy characteristic of the new and contrasted with the public position at Jerusalem?
J.T. I think so. "For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father", (@Ephesians 2:18). Christianity is private; although it is public in effect, yet it is characterised by privacy.
H.H. The thought of the Supper would be very important in regard to the mount of Olives -- the spiritual side of things; we need to give place to the Spirit.
J.T. I think so, in the sense of elevation and strength. The sitting here is to be noted, because sitting on the part of the Lord is taking up a definite position. It is not temporary. Then the first thing is significant. He "began to say, Take heed lest any one mislead you". That is the first thing to take notice of.
J.S. Would we be in any danger of being on the line of the old, of getting back to it?
J.T. I think that is a great danger always. We know full well how the misleading came in in christianity in spite of the excellent start made.
H.F.N. Will you say a word on the Lord here as Teacher? He is referred to as Teacher in this chapter and then in the next, "The Teacher says", (chapter 14:14). It is a title we do not often refer to the Lord. How would that bear on our levitical service?
J.T. You get it repeatedly in this gospel, as in the others, and I think the importance of teaching is seen in John in the two in chapter 1. They had been
{86}
disciples of John and now they heard him speak. They had often heard him speak and often doubtless commented on the way he spoke, for I am sure he could speak well. A man indwelt by the Spirit from infancy would speak by the Spirit of God. It is said they heard him *speaking*, and they followed Jesus. That shows how thoroughly the ministry had affected them. They were directed to Christ; they followed Jesus, and "Jesus turned", it says, "and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye?" (@John 1:38) They say unto Him, "Rabbi", and then the Holy Spirit tells us what that means. Rabbi means 'Teacher', signifying they were now ready to transfer their education to a greater. Although they had an excellent teacher, they were ready for a better one. They said, "Teacher, where abidest thou?" I think there you get the idea of teacher and of the appreciation that should be present with us of teaching. We should be able to discern what is superior; although we are glad to have anything that God gives, yet we should be able to discern what is superior. One might have said to the two, You certainly had an excellent teacher, but they discerned a greater, and so the Holy Spirit tells us what was meant by Rabbi, and they "abode with him". Thus you get discipleship in the sense of being with the one who teaches -- abiding with Him. You may get teaching at a distance, as in books and from addresses, but to abide with the teacher is the thing -- to get instruction direct and the things that go with it.
H.F.N. In @John 20, where Mary speaks of Him as teacher in the same way, would that show the completion of the line of divine teaching?
J.T. It does indeed.
H.F.N. Are there not several notable people in John who address the Lord as teacher? First the two you have referred to, and Nathanael in the first chapter; then Nicodemus in chapter 3, and Martha
{87}
in chapter 11, and then Mary in chapter 20. Would they represent a course of education?
J.T. No doubt. Mary, I suppose, represents the completion of the education, so that disciple is the term habitually applied to the saints in John and they are thus instructed. It is most important in these days when there is so much bad teaching that the saints should be on that line, not at a distance only, but on the principle of "Where abidest thou?" getting the teaching where He is.
P.L. You get the thought, "One is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren", (@Matthew 23:8). Does the allusion to the brethren suggest dwelling with the teacher?
J.T. I suppose so.
R.B. The Lord alluded to Himself as teacher in connection with washing their feet in chapter 13. What would be the import of that?
J.T. I think it is on the same line. It was a question of His superiority and greatness.
The prophetic side of our chapter is extensive, but it is there for us, and I think it ought to be linked up, especially in this gospel, with the Revelation, because the Revelation is to the bondmen of Christ. It is the "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him" (@Revelation 1:1), that is to say, the Apocalypse is not something the Lord gives of Himself, but is on the line that the Son Himself does not know. He takes the ground. The prophetic ministry is received from God. It is received by Christ and given to His bondman John to show what is shortly coming to pass, that is to say, there is full recognition of God's place in the ordering of the world. Prophecy has to do with the ordering of the earth, and God is the sovereign Ruler, and the Lord speaks to them on that line. The Father is Ruler of heaven and earth and things are in His hands. The Son takes His place mediatorially as
{88}
subject and waiting for the Father's revelation, so that, when He receives it He gives it to John, who gives it in turn to the assemblies, but primarily it is for "His bondmen". I think therefore the Revelation should be fitted in with this chapter so that we may see the position in regard to prophecy. It is God's disposition of things, God's ordering of things, and He holds it in His own power until the time comes. Thus chapter 13 stands by itself in this gospel, but it is most important for us that we should be kept from these earthly things and wait on God about them. It is God's time, it is not in our power to know about them except what is revealed. In the end of the chapter it says, "This generation shall in no wise pass away, till all these things take place". It is perhaps a difficult passage to many, but I think intelligible as understanding what the word 'generation' means, that is, not necessarily the actual people living in a certain period of time; it is so generally, but it sometimes means the kind of people without respect to duration. Take, for instance, what the Jew is and will continue to be; there is no other generation like him in the history of the world; there is little trace left of the Greeks and Romans, but if you take the Jew, he remains what he was.
Then the Lord goes on to say, "Take heed, watch and pray, for ye do not know when the time is: it is as a man gone out of the country, having left his house and given to his bondmen the authority". I thought it would be well for us to take note of the authority; He gave "to his bondmen *the* authority". If He did not reveal the time, He gave them *the* authority, whatever that may mean. It is not simply authority, but *the* authority. He passed on *the* authority to certain ones.
D.L.H. Then how do you take the thought of *the* authority as having a bearing upon present conditions?
J.T. Well, I think the first thing is to notice there
{89}
is such a thing as *the* authority. It will never do to admit there is no authority, will it?
D.L.H. It will not, indeed.
C.C.E. Do you think the authority involves the Lord's absence?
J.T. Quite. It is power to act in His absence, and then, "To each one his work".
H.H. Would the name of Christ come in?
J.T. Well, quite. The authority is a very real thing. Things are, of course, done in His name, but there is the authority.
S. Is it connected with spiritual power?
J.T. It would go with spiritual weight. What you get in the book of Numbers was that Moses and Aaron were to be accompanied in numbering by heads of houses, not those appointed heads of houses. They *were* heads of houses and that means they had power. It is not simply a question of being appointed head, but I *am* head, and if I am that, then there is power.
Ques. Do you mean the way in which Abraham is spoken of as head of his house?
J.T. He commands his house, we read; but these men were heads in their father's houses. It is not that the father is head -- he is obliged to be head -- but that a person in the house is head of his father's house. That is a different idea. The illustration of it, I think, is Gideon. His father was alive, but Gideon became morally greater than his father. He recognised his father, but he influenced his father, so that it was his father's bullock of seven years old that he sacrificed, and the image in his father's house that he overthrew. These acts challenged his father's natural rights, but he succeeded; Gideon established himself as having power in his father's house. He *acquired* the thing; he was not appointed.
D.L.H. Would it be something like the king "against whom none can rise up", (@Proverbs 30:31)?
{90}
J.T. That is the idea exactly. It is what the man *is*.
Ques. Would Paul's word to Titus convey the idea? "These things ... rebuke with all authority", (@Titus 2:15)?
J.T. That is it indeed.
D.L.H. Then that means what a man really has and not what he assumes to have.
J.T. That is the thing. I think Gideon is a good illustration.
H.F.N. He acquired power in his father's house.
D.L.H. Well, he acted like a king.
J.T. And all his conduct afterwards was in keeping with that. He refused to be king; he would not go beyond what he was. The crown would not add to him really.
P.L. Do you see this in Elisha with the double portion of the spirit of Elijah? Do you see authority there?
J.T. Well, I have no doubt. You do not want a crown. "The locusts have no king", (@Proverbs 30:27). That is in the very passage where the king is recognised, and yet the locusts have not one, but they have such as that amongst them. It is the other side of the picture, that is to say, you do not want the crown. The parable in the book of Judges is to show that. The worthless tree alone would take the crown. The fig tree, the vine, and the olive tree, were conscious of serving and that none else could do what they were doing, and they refused the crown.
Rem. So it is moral authority, not official.
J.T. And you are content with that. You are only thinking of the service you are doing, and you do not want a crown. Wherever you see aspiration to the crown, you may depend there is no service going on at all. You are content to remain in your service and leave the crown.
{91}
Ques. Would the thought of bondmen imply they were under authority at first before he gave them the authority?
J.T. I think that is right. It is not simply servants but bondmen; you belong *wholly* to the Lord.
J.J. "And to each one his work" is connected with that.
J.T. Some may be more distinguished than others, but each one has something from the Lord.
E.R. Is it not important that what we get in verse 10 should go on?
J.T. "The gospel must first be preached", quite. It seems it is imperative; it is the Lord's ordering.
E.R. I have been struck lately with the apostle in the last chapter of Timothy standing before Caesar and the nations, showing what a moment it was to him, the Lord standing by him so that the preaching might be *fully* known. Do you not think we ought to be very much stirred up?
J.T. I am sure that is right. Timothy was charged most solemnly and urgently to proclaim the word; (@2 Timothy 4:2).
S.J.B.C. What about the reference to the porter?
J.T. I have been thinking lately of those who have broken off, as one may say, from divine principles, that they are descending into a low level of looseness and confederacy; for these are the features of those who have broken away from the path of divine principles, and I believe it is because there has been disregard of the doorkeeper. The command to the doorkeeper is that he should watch.
{92}
READING ON @MARK 14
J.T. We dwelt on a previous occasion on the earlier and closing verses of chapter 13, first dwelling at length on the Lord, as it says, "going out of the temple", (verse 1) and the remark of one of His disciples as to the stones and buildings, as if to call attention to the things considered of value in that which the Lord was leaving. Then the Lord answering said, "Seest thou these great buildings? not a stone shall be left upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down", (verse 2). The overthrow of what seemed so important in the eyes of the disciple is announced, and that would deliver the disciple -- or those whom he represented -- from the thing the Lord was leaving. Then the Lord takes a seat on the mount of Olives, regarding it, I believe, as the representation of christianity as centring in the Spirit of God. "He sat", as it says, "on the mount of Olives *opposite* the temple", (verse 3). Sitting means in this connection not a temporary position but an abiding one; and there are four persons, not called disciples, who express in their names four distinguished things amongst the saints, who come and ask Him privately when these things should be. He warns them at the outset to be on their guard that they should not be misled. The first great suggestion as to taking up a position according to light is to be on our guard that we be not diverted from it. Then we spoke on the closing verses as relating to the present time also, the body of the chapter having reference to the prophetic side of things which was in the hands of God. The Lord tells His disciples those matters were in His Father's hands, even He did not know, which points to the book of Revelation as coming from God to Christ, and from Christ to John,
{93}
and from John to the assemblies. We spoke about the authority, which I think was interesting and important -- giving them *the* authority, that which was to remain. We dwelt on the side of moral weight; on this ground there are mandates from Christ at all times; we can always reckon upon that authority. I think that was about what we had.
H.H. I do not know whether you were interrupted when speaking about the porter.
J.T. There is importance given to it here. The Lord in the figure says, "and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch", (verse 34). It was a command showing that it was of the very greatest importance there should be watchfulness on the part of the porter, because among those coming in as a result of the gospel there might be an unreal person hidden. In the Acts we find persons distinguished in this world converted -- Barnabas, the eunuch, Saul and the centurion. Then there was also Simon who, although ostensibly converted, was not real. He eluded Philip's eye, but was detected by Peter; that is, I think, an important side, because a man of that type would be hailed perhaps as a great trophy of the gospel, whereas he was not so at all. He had slipped in, as far as Philip and the others were concerned, but was detected by Peter and exposed. So that I think perhaps there is a suggestion of the need of carefulness as to persons who might have distinction in this world. They are apt to be over-estimated, yet they may be subjects of God's grace.
J.J. Is there anything of importance in the divisions of the night -- evening, midnight, cock-crowing and morning?
J.T. I suppose there is a good deal in that. It is for spiritual discernment as to where we are in the periods of the night. Cock-crowing time ought to be the time of repentance. The point is, "lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping", (verse 36). There is danger in
{94}
settling down, and therefore the need of wakefulness is insisted upon under all circumstances.
Rem. I should like to know your point as to repentance.
J.T. Well, it was in Peter's case. I suppose there has been such a time as that. Peter, I think, represents Protestantism, as Judas represents more the Romish system. There has been a measure of repentance in regard of the former, but in regard of the latter there is none, because the Lord says, "She will not repent", (@Revelation 2:21). You need not expect anything from that quarter, save in individual cases.
P.L. Would the morning answer to the Philadelphian character?
J.T. I think so. The Lord is in view Himself. You feel that spiritually it is so.
P.L. The thing commenced with the departure from first love, which culminated in the Thyatira midnight.
A.H.W. Does Peter distinguish the periods of the night in his epistle in referring to the day-star having arisen?
J.T. I suppose so; it arises in the *hearts* of the saints. The morning alludes to His coming; the light of that day has already broken in upon us. It is in the light of these things that we have the Lord's supper introduced, the significance of which is obvious here. But first of all there is the state of the religious world -- its murderous attitude towards Christ, and then the condition within where He is -- the house of Simon the leper -- an antagonism not actually against Him, but against one devoted to Him. That is the form the opposition takes inside. Outside the opposition is directly against Christ; they take counsel how to put Him to death; inside the opposition is to those devoted to Him -- not ostensibly to Christ, but really so.
{95}
Ques. What do you make of being in the house of Simon the leper?
J.T. I think that would be a house of reproach; leprosy in the reckoning of the religious element outside would mean reproach -- something to be avoided. The Lord was in it, however. I suppose it would allude to those who own their leprosy and admit what they are publicly -- no pretence to being anything different. There is a full acknowledgment of leprosy being there, and that is where the Lord is.
J.J. That is not very far from the mount of Olives.
J.T. Well, quite. It is not that leprosy was working there; far otherwise, or the Lord would not have been there. It is that the thing is owned, and I think where the Holy Spirit is and that admission is maintained, any other reputation would be unbecoming.
H.F.N. You referred to the widow at the end of the previous chapter as representing the spirit of the old system; would this woman represent more the spirit of the new?
J.T. The woman at the end of chapter 12 is devoting all her living to the treasury of God, this woman has something very precious which she uses with intelligence. The casting in of the two mites was more an act of devotion; the woman knew into whose hands the two mites came and what would be made of them. That is what goes on in the house of God. You know what use is made of things. I believe that when Barnabas devoted the price of the land, he had confidence what use would be made of it, so he put it at the apostles¬ feet; and so generally, in giving in the assembly; it is intelligence. What marks this woman in chapter 14 is intelligent affection and that Christ was all to her, not only Christ in regard of what had been done for her, which would be more @Luke 7, but Christ apprehended as officially serving. She anoints Him on the *head*, but He
{96}
refers to His body, that is to say, she was intelligent as to what was acceptable to God and effective in service. The allusion is to what He was officially, I think. He, however, associates it with His body, showing that in His mind it was the whole idea. The body is a complete thought, it comes out in Matthew and Mark. So the Lord's supper as we get it here is not the memorial side, but is in view of a vessel. "Take, eat: this is my *body*". I think she is on the way, so to speak, she is leading the way in regard to an official vessel which was fully understood and covered in what He said about it: "she is come aforehand to anoint my body".
E.R. There is a difference as to the anointing between Matthew and Mark. In one case it is the king and in the other the prophet, but it was His head which was anointed in both cases.
J.T. Whereas in Luke and John it is the feet, showing that in Luke it is more the grace side and the walk carrying it to her, and in John the love going into death -- His feet were carrying Him there. But the idea of a vessel is in Matthew and Mark because, whether it be the assembly or individual service, it is a complete idea -- not only the head, it is the body.
Rem. I have not quite got the thought as to the vessel.
J.T. Whether it be the assembly or the individual, it is a complete idea, not only the head, but the body. Matthew runs with Mark generally as to facts. He begins his gospel with the word 'book'; the first word is 'book', which alludes to that very thing. "In the volume of the book it is written of me", "A body hast thou prepared me", (@Hebrews 10:7,5). That is the foundation of all books as recorded of God, and Matthew is the book of the incoming of the vessel. "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham", (@Matthew 1:1). It is the king clearly, but here in the body.
{97}
H.H. Would not @Colossians 2:9 correspond with the thought? "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". The Colossians were in danger of taking up the wrong book.
J.T. That is so. The first chapter (verse 18) is, "he is the head of the body, the assembly". That is the complete idea in Colossians, and that is the thing to get hold of. "He is the head of *the* body, the assembly", and in the second chapter (verse 9), "in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". Now all that, I think, enters into these two evangelists because there is nothing said in the institution of the Lord's supper in regard of memorial in either of them. It is not a question of remembering Christ in these two evangelists, but of *eating*. Luke alone brings in the memorial, that is, he brings in Christ in the way of love. It is not a question of building up a constitution in Luke, but of having love for Christ and recalling Him, whereas Matthew and Mark have in mind the building up of a constitution -- a vessel, so that it is food. "Take, eat; this is my body", not My flesh, but My body.
H.F.N. With regard to the thought of vessel, do you refer to something wider than the Lord personally?
J.T. Oh, yes. I think the assembly is necessarily in view, particularly in Matthew.
H.F.N. You remarked some time ago that Mark brought in the vessel of service. Would that form the vessel of service? Is that your thought?
J.T. I think that is the setting of it. You see the great ideal in Scripture of service is Paul, and he is the first to be called a vessel, that is, it is a complete thought, a complete thing. He "is an elect vessel to me", (@Acts 9:15). What you find in Paul is that the Lord had taken great care as to his reception amongst the saints, so that he should be rightly received; he got the word from Ananias that he was to rise and be baptised and wash away his sins. He did not wash
{98}
away the public reputation, because he afterwards refers to himself as the chief of sinners, but he washed away his sins. "And be filled with the Holy Spirit. And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he saw, and rising up was baptised; and, having received food, got strength", (verses 17 - 19). These are all mentioned, not incidentally, but for a purpose, indicating the idea of feeding, that is, you have to get strength. I think the Lord indicates that in these two evangelists, it is a question of eating His body; it is not the flesh but the body, which has to be understood spiritually. In John's gospel it is the flesh: "But the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world", (@John 6:51). It is that bearing of His death, but in Matthew and Mark it speaks about His body as food and His blood as drink.
P.L. Would it suggest assimilating the spirit of the Hebrew servant?
J.T. Just so. You see what is set before you in the end. He says, "Take, eat", in Matthew 26:26, "this is my body". The word 'eat' may not be in this gospel, but we see in that what was in the Lord's mind, "Take this: this is my body"; so that it is in the apprehension of what is in the book, what is written in the book, and what came out historically as recorded in Matthew and Mark. That is the thing to get hold of; that that One went down into death, because what is before us in the Lord's supper is really a dead Christ -- it is Christ dead; He went to that length -- to death -- and one has to lay hold of that and eat it to understand what the vessel is.
M.P. Would the passage in @2 Corinthians 4:11 be the fruit of it? "That the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body".
J.T. Quite. You see there "we have this treasure in earthen vessels", (verse 7). We want to lay hold of the complete idea, whether it be collective or individual;
{99}
that it is not using my head only, it is the complete person. In the Lord's case you have the anointing on the head and feet, and then you have Him calling attention to His head, His side, and His feet -- it is the whole person. So in regard to the consecration of the priest, it was the whole person.
A.H.W. Do I understand that we see "I delight to do thy will, O my God", (@Psalm 40:8) expressed in the way the Lord used His body?
J.T. Quite. We are said to be sanctified by the offering of the body of Christ, and we have to be in correspondence with that. In Matthew and Mark we have that, and in Luke we have more the affectionate remembrance of Christ.
A.H.W. So this food and the strength you speak of would enable us also to delight in the will of God.
J.T. Exactly. It is by that will you are sanctified.
D.L.H. Then is the thought in Luke what is continuous, that is, a continual memorial, and in Matthew and Mark what the soul apprehends and feeds on?
J.T. Just so. You apprehend that it implies the knowledge of "the book". "In the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God". Matthew is the filling out of that book, and it shows that the vessel was here. "They shall call his name Immanuel, which is, being interpreted, 'God with us'", (@Matthew 1:23) but there in that body, and so in the institution at the Lord's supper what you get first is "as they were eating". You notice here they were lying at table and eating when it is said to them, "One of you shall deliver me up", calling attention to the importance of eating even if sin has to be dealt with in any of us or in a company. We get the importance of food being there, as if the ministration of food helps to the acknowledgment of the thing; and then it goes on to tell us that as they were eating He took the bread.
{100}
Ques. Are you emphasising what we might call the intrinsic value and preciousness of the Person?
J.T. Well, yes, but in the connection mentioned it is not only the intrinsic value, but in Matthew it is the king, and so, in the end of that gospel He says to Mary, "go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me", (@Matthew 28:10), not that I shall see them, but they shall see Me. Here in Mark He tells them He would go before them into Galilee, which is an important thing, that is to say, it is the rejected position; we do not have to take it first. He takes it first; He goes *before them*, but in Matthew He sends a message and says they will see Him there. Thus it was their responsibility; it was what they were to do. Here it is what He would do, showing that He goes before in the place of reproach. In Matthew He tells them to go there and they would see Him, and they went to the place where "Jesus had appointed them" (verse 16) and they saw Him. That is to say, it is a governmental touch -- the Lord is supreme in government. You have to go to see Him, that is, He has everything, what you need He has, but you must go to Him to get it.
Rem. That is for the brethren.
J.T. Yes, and "the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them" and they saw Him. Then He goes after them as much as to own that they had done what He told them, and they are going to get the gain of it. So He goes up to them and they worship Him, and then He says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth", (verse 18). That is the position in Matthew, so whilst it is what He is intrinsically it is also what He is in relation to government in that gospel, and to the service of God in Mark. I think the woman's act here is to call attention to the kind of service that is acceptable so, "Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world,
{101}
this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her".
E.R. I suppose the feature of breaking the box, which we get in Mark's gospel and in no other, is an important one. Would it not show how she shuts herself out entirely in all that she does?
J.T. Quite. Tell us about the breaking of the box.
E.R. I thought it was a very beautiful thought. Not only was there the anointing there, but she *breaks* the box, representing herself.
J.T. The action of Mary in John in the use of her hair is on the same line. It is the Person who is before her.
E.R. Only in Mary's case she retains the fragrance because her heart has touched it. "To you therefore who believe [is] the preciousness", (@1 Peter 2:7).
J.T. Quite.
A.H.W. When you say this kind of thing should always be present at the preaching, do you refer to the way the preaching is carried on?
J.T. It is not to be a legal thing, but the Lord had in mind that all that this woman had done should be also spoken of for a memorial of her. It is what *she did*. Her name is not given us in John, so it is not so much the person of the woman as the thing that she represents. You want it to be evident that that is the kind of ministry. It is not clerical -- it shuts out clericalism. People brought up under a clerical system are sure to be damaged. They have not the right idea to begin with.
A.H.W. Is this the spirit that is to mark the preaching?
J.T. I think so. Paul said, "Whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son", (@Romans 1:9). That is the thing. It was in his spirit he served God. Wherever he preached, you may depend, there was some suggestion of what this woman had done; it is the thought carried through.
{102}
H.H. Do you think it would suggest the assembly material in the sense of referring to the body? Would it go as far as that?
J.T. I think that is right when the preaching has that in view. Preaching has the material for the assembly in view, and persons converted under clerical preaching are sure to be warped. It is hard to make them fit into the assembly. So the presentation of what this woman did, that is, her act, not what she said, would save souls from being damaged by the clerical idea. They would refuse ministry not in keeping with Mark's gospel.
J.J. Would "these glad tidings" in that way correspond with Paul's gospel? It seems like a special view of the gospel.
J.T. No doubt, and then, in mentioning what she did you have to mention the fact that it was the Lord's head and that the Lord said it was His body. Therefore, you would have the idea of the vessel and obviously the convert is to be a vessel. You are to be brought in as a vessel because there is no other thought in the mind of God than that every brother should be a vessel; the thought applies individually and collectively.
J.J. So in connection with the man with the pitcher of water, the Lord allows for Paul coming in; that is the kind of ministry that leads to the assembly.
J.T. Exactly.
Ques. Do you carry on the application in the thought of the cup where it says, "They all drank out of it"?
J.T. Yes, in the sense that it was one thing; it is one idea. It is that out of which we drink. I think it leads to that in which the love of God is, a vessel for the love of God.
Ques. Is your thought, in what you have been saying, complete committal to the will of God?
{103}
J.T. Just so, complete as to your whole body -- indeed, body, soul and spirit.
Ques. Does @Romans 12 suggest that in connection with the believer's body?
J.T. Yes, it is presented as a living sacrifice. The *members* are dealt with in chapter 6; they are to be used as "instruments of righteousness to God", (verse 13) but in chapter 8 the body is viewed as a whole. "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness", (verse 10). The body is thus secured, and in chapter 12 it is presented as a whole -- one complete idea.
Ques. Is Paul on that line when he says, "We are unto God a sweet odour of Christ", (@2 Corinthians 2:15).
J.T. Quite.
R.B. If I understand you, you are pressing two thoughts, one as to eating His flesh, as in @John 6, the other as to eating His body. Is the thought of eating His flesh the building up a spiritual constitution of vigour and power, and the thought of eating His body the acceptation under the impulse of His love of the yielding of oneself (the complete person) to Him?
J.T. That is the way I look at it. @John 6 is the condition that the Lord took, so that it says, "The Word became flesh", (@John 1:14); it is the condition. Hence, in @John 6:51 it is "the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh". It refers to the *condition* He took and which He laid down. It is terminated, that is, the flesh-and-blood condition. It has to be apprehended that that is terminated in His death. It is vicarious there; it is "for the life of the world". So that the eating of His flesh and drinking of His blood would be the apprehension of that condition laid down -- that life terminated. I do not live in this life in the flesh after that. He came down and laid down His life.
Rem. On the propitiatory side.
{104}
Ques. Is it based on the passover? You get the passover and the feast of unleavened bread here at the outset. What is the significance of that?
J.T. I think, carrying it to our own times, it refers to @1 Corinthians 5 as preparatory to the Lord's supper. It shows that the feast is to be kept and that it is a continuous thing, whereas the Lord's supper is a special thing. But the eating that precedes it is of all moment because you have no taste for it unless you keep the feast of unleavened bread. It becomes a mere outward thing. Then another thing comes out in these two evangelists -- Matthew and Mark. After partaking of the Lord's supper they sing a hymn and they go to the mount of Olives, meaning, I think, that it is a question of power in the soul. It is a movement not said to be led by the Lord. It does not say He did anything specially, it is what *they* did.
H.W.S. How do you apply that?
J.T. I think it is what you make room for by partaking of the Lord's supper. I certainly should be stronger after it. As a memorial it quickens my affections; I see the Lord in it. The breaking of bread is really for the eye, it is really what you see. They recognised Him, it is said, in the breaking of bread, but eating is for strength and it is in connection with the eating you have this movement towards the mount of Olives. It is a question of power in the soul.
J.J. Do you think the view of Matthew and Mark in the Supper is included in Luke?
J.T. You have to take all together, only you have to view each by itself. One would not like to think you partook of the Lord's supper without some gain, some additional strength, otherwise it is simply a thing done weekly and nothing more -- nothing added to you. There is on the one hand the question of the affections in the Person recalled. That goes on in freshness, but freshness is not everything. You
{105}
need strength and it is in the strength you acquire that you make the movement.
Rem. The bread that strengthens man's heart.
J.T. That is the idea exactly.
A.H.W. Is the idea that you are strengthened to reach this point of elevation?
J.T. Yes, I think so. Earlier the Lord goes there and sits down and they come to Him and ask Him privately, but here it is put as their doing. I do not say He was not there. He was, but it is the character of the thing; *they* were able to do this.
A.H.W. I was wondering whether the mount of Olives bears the presentation of being the Lord's own place.
J.T. I think it is heaven in the spiritual setting. I think the Lord would be there before us. It is the idea of getting strength to reach what is our own sphere. The prayer in @Ephesians 3 is different from that in @Ephesians 1. The apostle does not kneel down in chapter 1. He prays that we "should know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength", (verses 18,19) but in @Ephesians 3:14 - 17 he bows his knees "to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts". It is a question of power in the soul. I do not think there is much in light by itself, it is a question of the power in @Ephesians 3. Paul insisted in 1 Corinthians that it was not the word but the power.
H.F.N. How do you regard what follows? Is the strength in the soul not only to touch the mount
{106}
of Olives -- the spiritual region -- but also to face what follows?
J.T. Exactly. "Jesus says to them, All ye shall be offended, for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad".
H.F.N. Could we ever face that path apart from having sung the hymn and having been to the mount of Olives?
J.T. I am sure we cannot. To face the opposition we must come out in heavenly warmth and power.
H.F.N. Would it correspond at all with John? "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day", (@Revelation 1:10) and then he faced all the breakdown.
J.T. Quite.
Ques. Would that be really the gain in service?
J.T. You must face the sphere of responsibility and suffering in power. You are strengthened by eating the Lord's body as seen here.
H.F.N. Would you mind saying a word as to Mark's distinctive presentation of the sufferings of Christ?
J.T. The subject is very great. I have been thinking lately that generally in Scripture, that is, in the epistles and in the Old Testament, the sufferings of Christ are dealt with in relation to man's need, but in the four gospels you have the sufferings of Christ, the death of Christ, treated by itself. That is the greatest thing to be able to see -- these sufferings presented from four sides, because that is what we should all come to. It gives fibre to the soul to feed on them. It is difficult to speak of them really. It is more food for contemplation because the ground is so holy. We see the features in the gospels, but the understanding of the gospels requires the epistles, so that being free from our own need we can look at the thing by itself. As @1 Peter 1:11 says, "when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow".
{107}
Ques. Would that come out in the offerings in Leviticus?
J.T. It takes all the offerings to present the sufferings of Christ. The offerings are related to us; it is a question of what we offer.
Ques. So would you reckon that what precedes is for the purpose of building up a constitution to be able rightly to consider the sufferings of Christ?
J.T. Yes; He offered Himself. We have to look at His doing it. It is a wonderful thing to be able to do that, to be free, as knowing the power of them in regard to oneself, to look at the sufferings of Christ. He "through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God", (@Hebrews 9:14). There is nothing in Scripture that would so subdue and comfort the heart as that theme.
J.J. Is it not rather striking that the Lord only says, "Abba, Father", once, and it is in this chapter? In every place where it is mentioned sonship is in view, and I wondered whether that would have a bearing in service.
J.T. We are led into that in sonship. I think the word 'Abba' is generally retained in translation so that it is available to all christians and means the first breathing of the Spirit of adoption. It is wonderful that we are led into it, because it is the term the Lord uses here and in the place of the greatest pressure; Matthew and Mark give the subject of the Lord's suffering in its severest aspect. It is the sin-offering; they are the only evangelists who mention the forsaking of God. There you have the thing in its awfulness. It says, "he began to be amazed and oppressed in spirit" -- a most remarkable thing to be said of the Son of God. Then the prayer, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: take away this cup from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt". This was uttered three times. What a theme for contemplation!
{108}
BUILDING MATERIAL
@Haggai 1:7,8; @1 Corinthians 3:10 - 13
I have been thinking, dear brethren, of building material, having in view that this is the time of building, and if it is a time of building there must be material. Thus I have read from Haggai, a well-known prophet, not only because he speaks of building and of material, but because he took part in the work himself. Many of us can speak of what is needed and urge others on, but what God looks for is a leader, and to give a lead I must go on ahead.
So we find with Haggai, and his associate prophet, Zechariah, that they not only urged the builders to build, but it says *they helped* in the work -- "the prophets of God helping", as we read. One who thus puts his hand to the work deserved special attention, and I may add that prophecy is that which in the first epistle to the Corinthians is especially commended for building. Of the gifts, each of which is of value, prophecy was commended. Before, however, commending the gift of prophecy, the apostle said, "yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence" (@1 Corinthians 12:31); he could not only speak of the way of love but *show* it. It is a thing rather to be shown than defined, and so having shown that way, he goes back to the subject of gift and urges prophecy, for he that prophesieth edifies or builds the assembly. So Haggai, associated with Zechariah, demands special attention, as a man who, in a day of very small things, spoke the mind of God. He also builded, worked with the others, with the rank and file of the people, as we may say.
But I am speaking now of material, for however clear the mind of God may be as to what is required, and however skilled the builders, there must be
{109}
material, and we should note what it is. What elements form the physical system around us, or what the primary materials were, we can say but little, but we are not left in any uncertainty or cloudiness as regards the material needed for God's building. The first building that we get in Scripture, as has often been pointed out, is in @Genesis 2, but we read of the foundations of the earth being laid, which I suppose may be taken to lead to building. The word employed directly for the physical system is 'framed': "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God", (@Hebrews 11:3). The first *building* is that recorded in @Genesis 2, and there is nothing vague as to the material. It was a rib taken out of Adam, and out of that, we are told, God builded a woman. The material therefore was to be understood as the building was there, and so in the New Testament we have the material for God's building. The Lord is very explicit, first in regard of the foundation upon which He would build, and then in regard of the material which He would use in the building.
First He says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona". (@Matthew 16:17). Now that, taken as it is, is not material for the building. Simon Bar-jona refers to the believer as he is *here*, born in this world, whose history is known; such a one is blessed, that is to say, as a responsible person here, having had a sinful history, you, like Simon who acknowledged his sinfulness, are blessed. "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona". But that was only a part of the Lord's pronouncement, a part which involves much in principle, indeed, involving the epistle to the Romans, which contemplates us as responsible. Yet as convicted sinners who believe through grace, we are blessed. But then the Lord goes on with a new thing. What He says about Simon being blessed as receiving a revelation from God was not exactly a new thing, because the
{110}
reception of revelations of God was not new. Many before him had received such, not of that kind, of course, but nevertheless many had received revelations from God, and they were blessed. It was a blessed thing in each case.
But the Lord goes on as if He were saying something extraordinary, "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens". *He* has revealed that to you, "And I also, I say unto thee that thou art Peter". That is not a mere question of blessing, not that I would minimise blessing, but it is a question of material: "Thou *art* Peter", the Lord said. In @John 1:42, the corresponding passage, He says, "Thou shalt be *called* Cephas", and then the Holy Spirit tells us the meaning of that word so that we should understand. Whenever the Holy Spirit interprets a word He means to impress it on our minds that we may understand it, so that in John we get the interpretation of the word 'Cephas'. The Lord did not use that word in speaking to Peter in Matthew. He used, as far as we can see, the ordinary word Peter. We have no word to be interpreted, it was a word that was known, the Greek word for Peter, that is to say, the material was divinely provided, and the builder has to understand, has to distinguish in himself between "Simon Bar-jona", being blessed, and "Peter", if he is to have part practically, and surely, in the great system which God is building, the great spiritual system for, from this point of view, wood, hay, and stubble have no part at all. They *cannot* be introduced. It is what the Lord Jesus Christ is building, and He never used any extraneous material at all. The material was there, He gave it a name, He pronounced upon it, and then He says, "on this rock I will build my assembly". Having designated the material for the building, He speaks of the foundation.
In keeping with that we read in @Acts 19 that the
{111}
apostle Paul arrived at Ephesus on the upper line; it *is* the upper line. Matthew is the upper line, and so is Ephesians. What I mean by the upper line is this, that Luke deals with what is moral, what is in keeping with God morally down here, involving righteousness, whereas Matthew presents the thing from the side of elevation, and produces a vessel formed of spiritual material for practical use here -- the vessel of testimony. He produces it by way of the mount of transfiguration, where you have the Lord Jesus transfigured, His countenance shining as the sun -- a great heavenly thought; and then that we are associated with Him as sons; for He says, "Then are the sons free". And finally He says, "Take that and give it to them for me and thee", (@Matthew 17:26,27). We are thus brought in on the upper line -- the mount of transfiguration and sonship. It is on that line that we have the vessel of administration in Matthew -- the assembly. It is not earthly, or governed by earthly principles, it is governed by heavenly principles, and its material is spiritual. It is formed of those who are the sons of God and companions of Christ. Luke gives us the moral line, and takes us up as we are, so that we are brought together as recognising the Lord's authority, as deposited in the eleven. They were saying as gathered together in Luke, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon" (@Luke 24:34) -- *not* Peter. It is a question of Simon in his *responsibility*, and the Lord meeting him in grace -- an important side surely of the truth in our relation to one another.
Luke refers to Him as the righteous One. He introduces the centurion as saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man", (@Luke 23:47). It is the moral side, and so the thief owns Him, "This man has done nothing amiss" (verse 41); and in keeping with that the Lord prays in Luke that the Father should forgive His murderers -- another moral feature which we need in our public
{112}
position; if God is to be related to us morally, these features must be present. But Matthew is, as I said, the upper line, and I hope you will take note of it. The thoughts presented in Matthew are immense, and I have therefore taken the liberty of calling it the upper line. It involves that we should be here representative of heaven in our administrative capacity.
Having spoken of Luke and Matthew, I want to open out the link between Matthew and Ephesians. The apostle, as you will remember, reached Ephesus by "the upper districts", (@Acts 19:1). He had been there before he left Aquila and Priscilla there, and went off elsewhere in his service, and in the interval Apollos arrived and was instructed by Aquila and Priscilla. Apollos goes to Corinth, where Paul had been, and where he had built up the lower line of things, that is to say, the order of God in a city, in a locality. He had been to Athens, and there was not a word said to him in Athens about God having His people there, although there were a few; but arriving at Corinth he associates himself with two tent-makers, a man and his wife. This was not a vain appearance of things; he meant it, he lodged with them and the Holy Spirit tells us he wrought with his hands; he was a real worker, making tents. You will see we are coming down to everyday life, and it is important to see that the people of God are seen in that connection. The Lord said, "and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city", (@Acts 18:10).
Thus we are in the presence of potential material for the structure in its locality, or everyday feature. It is said that Apollos was at Corinth after Paul had been there, and after he had set up the structure there. It speaks of Apollos as at Corinth, as though he was there to hold *that* position. Apollos being there, Paul arrived at Ephesus by the upper districts, and he asked certain disciples whom he found there
{113}
if they had received the Holy Spirit since they believed. It is not a question of much people, of tent-making, or being outwardly anything -- that is not the point at Ephesus. The point is, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" (@Acts 19:2). And may I raise the question as to whether as believers you may or may not have the Spirit? If we are to approach the structure from the standpoint of Ephesus, it is most important for every professing christian to face this, for every one should wish to have part in it. "So then ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone", (@Ephesians 2:19,20). There is nothing like it in the whole universe, and it depends on the Spirit. If you have not got the Spirit, you are out of it, and so it says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" and you know what they answered, "We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come". Paul says, "To what then were ye baptized?" and they said, "To the baptism of John", and he tells them, "John indeed baptised with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him that was coming after him, that is, on Jesus", (verses 3,4). John's own words were, "He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he was before me; and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water. And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God", (@John 1:30,31,34). That is John's witness, which would point the believer away from John to another -- to Christ.
The apostle Paul heartily endorses John the baptist's ministry, but John could not give the Holy Spirit, so immediately those at Ephesus were baptised *to* the name of the Lord Jesus. That principle comes in, for it was a question of their seeing what was
{114}
available. They would go in for all that was involved in that name. It was not only protection, there were great positive things involved. Paul laid his bands on them and they received the Holy Spirit, "and they spoke with tongues and prophesied", (verse 6). The Holy Spirit in those days was a Person to people, His presence was a reality, and as if the apostle recognised the material in those twelve men, it says he remained and laboured in the synagogue for three months -- a long time for him. Certainly it sets us an example to stay a good while in a place, but it is a question here of having found material. When some disbelieved in the synagogue he leaves it and goes into a school-house, and he teaches in that school-house for two years. You see how all this is linked up with the material he had found. He remained there for two years and three months, and in another scripture we are told that he stayed altogether three years. All this work is in relation to those twelve men receiving the Spirit.
The assembly at Ephesus was built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the corner-stone. @Acts 20 is *Himself*; it brings out affection, the love of Christ as expressed in Paul. The building was complete and as Paul was leaving them he embraced them; he also embraces Eutychus in the same chapter. In his reference in @Ephesians 2:20,21, you can see the love of Christ, Jesus Christ Himself is the Head of the corner, and the response to that in the end of @Acts 20 is that the elders of the people of the assembly at Ephesus fell on Paul's neck and wept. You see what reciprocation of affection there was. It is a fine picture of the dispensation viewed from the spiritual standpoint! It is just a picture of it, but you can see how important the material was as it stood there; the apostle coming in by the upper districts and finding spiritual material, he stops there and rears up the great structure at
{115}
Ephesus. While addressed as a local company, the assembly at Ephesus is treated in the epistle as representing the whole assembly formed of Jews and gentiles, both reconciled in one body by the cross. It is a habitation of God in the Spirit. It is a spiritual thing, and as I said before, no one could afford to be outside of that. If you are to be in that, and linked up with it, you must have the Spirit in a conscious way. In the scripture I read you see all these things, for it is a question of the kind of material that is needed now.
I have been speaking of the spiritual side at Ephesus and in Matthew, but I want to speak now of what is presented in @1 Corinthians 3, for there we have the foundation that *Paul* laid. He does not say "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets"; he is speaking of what *he* laid. He says, "According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it. For other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ". The words are chosen with wisdom, as discovering the effect of his ministry in that setting, for it is a question of bringing in amongst the Corinthians the *kind of man* that shone in Jesus here below -- a Man who had to do with all kinds of men, and ever remained Himself. Never for one moment did He come under the influence of any one. He was ever Himself; from His infancy to the cross He was "the man Christ Jesus", never anyone else. You can understand how this was in God's mind when Peter and John were imprisoned and He opened the door and said, "Go ye and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life" (@Acts 5:20), that is to say, the life of Jesus in detail. "The words" -- every *detail* of that life was precious under God's eye, and it was to be preached. If you heard Peter speak
{116}
about Jesus, you would understand this -- all the words of that life, that perfect humanity as it is presented to us, particularly in the gospel of Luke, would be presented; and that was the kind of thing that Paul introduced at Corinth.
If anyone had come to him as he wrought with those two, Priscilla and Aquila, and had said, 'Paul, what is it that you are doing here?' he would say, 'Do you not know that my Master served at a carpenter's bench?' Would not that touch the heart? How it builds into your inner soul the idea of Christ! Think of Him, the Lord of glory, working as a carpenter! "Is not this the carpenter?" (@Mark 6:3) It is not the words of this *ministry*, but the words of this *life*. Ministry is wonderful, but the life of Jesus, what a life -- all the words of it! the Holy Spirit Himself choosing the words; what an interesting matter! All this was brought into Corinth, and the intent was to shut out all Greek pretension. Some Greek philosopher might come to Paul, but he could say, 'Andrew and Philip told me that on a certain occasion the Greeks came up to my Master to see Him and He did not make much of them'. He did not say, 'I would like to hear a Greek discourse or oration'. I never heard of my Master reading the Greek letters. Indeed, it is said of Him, "How knows this man letters, having never learned?" (@John 7:15) That is how the matter stood.
Is what I have spoken of found in the men of this great educational centre? No, it is not found. I may add that it is as sure as possible if I am living in a town of letters, I shall be defiled by the thing unless I set myself against it. If I am living in a manufacturing town, I am defiled by the spirit of it unless I set myself against it. The spirit of it is militant against the Spirit of God, and flesh is flesh. There is nothing that appeals to the flesh of the cultured class more than Greek philosophy, and yet it is nothing.
{117}
Paul shows in this passage that it is so. He says, "That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God".
If I lived in a centre of learning, I should read @1 Corinthians 2 and 3 frequently, for learning has nothing to do with Christ. It is useful to a point, but it has nothing to do with christianity as such. So Paul says, The kind of foundation I laid in your town was Jesus Christ, and nothing else. Build on that, and let every man take heed how he builds thereupon. So that everyone has to build. Paul does not divert anyone from building. Build, but be sure you get the right material; you will not get it from the colleges, you have to get it from Christ. It is a question of the kind of humanity that shone in Jesus, and of Him it is said He had never learned. Think of the Lord of glory having that reputation, and yet He is frequently called Master by those who knew! Even if He thought it necessary to acquire ordinary education, this would be an extremely small matter to Him. He knew *all* divinely.
The word in Haggai is, "Go up to the mountain" -- not to the university -- but to the mountain; that is the word here. "Go up to the mountain and bring wood, and build the house". Wood, in Scripture, is used in a variety of ways. It does not always mean the same thing, but in this instance it undoubtedly points to that kind of material which is needed for divine building, that is to say, the kind of man God requires. I might point out the character of the leading woods of Scripture. There is the gopher wood, the first wood mentioned in Scripture that is used in a structure. Its identity is not known, but it is a wood -- Scripture is sufficient to indicate that -- which was exactly suitable for the purpose required; it could go through the flood. It was a question of going through the judgment of God, and retaining intact through the judgment every living thing; all
{118}
was carried through. Everything that is of God was embraced in Christ. Think of the kind of man, think of that one Man embracing in Himself every divine thought, and going through the judgment, and bringing all out intact on the other side, and setting up another order according to God!
That is one most important feature. Then acacia, or shittim wood is the one used in the wilderness for the tabernacle. It refers, too, to Christ, the kind of humanity, the power of bearing, and going through the wilderness patiently. How important these features are, carrying everything through for God on the one hand, even through death, and on the other, walking with patience and love with the people of God in the wilderness! It is Christ in His love, the more excellent way, and that is what is needed. There are also the cedar, olive and other woods spoken of as used in God's building.
Now the point is to go up to the mountain, and that means *exercise*. The word 'exercise' is one much used among the people of God. Paul used it: "Herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men", (@Acts 24:16). That is a fine exercise, and if you are exercised in that way, there will be in you material for the building of God. You want a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men. I think it is righteousness, for every one that is born of Him is righteous. In every case going up to the mountain requires purpose, and that calls out the Spirit's power in the builder, but as you come to do the thing, you are surprised at what you do, and God goes with you.
Here they said, "The time is not come, the time that Jehovah's house should be built"; but it *was* the time, and the prophets of God were telling them it was. "Go up to the mountain and bring wood, and build the house". It was necessary to get suitable
{119}
material. For us it is what is according to Christ. The gospels present it to us. We are to go up to the mountain and get it and build the house. God will take pleasure in it and be glorified in it.
God is not so concerned about quantity as He is about *quality*. The wood here refers to quality, what is suitable for the building, and it is obtainable on the mountain. It is a question of exercise, of judging ourselves, and so making room for the Holy Spirit to work in us and produce the character of Jesus Christ. God will not ask anything of us which we have not the means of providing. He sent Elijah to the widow of Zarephath, saying, "I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee". Elijah goes, and he found her at the city gate. What a tax was laid on that poor widow! The prophet says, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink". He told her to bring it in a vessel. She would have to do that, but he mentions the vessel. You see how God looks for things *as they should be*. If He is asking anything from you, He is asking for it as it should be, however little it may be. It is in a vessel.
She goes for the water without a murmur; and then see the fresh test; Elijah says, "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand". How she is tested! Now it is a question of what is in her *hand*. This brings out what is there. It is God's way with us at the present time, and He never asks anything from us that we have not got. She had already made an inventory of what she had -- a little meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse -- and so she says, "I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die". She is going to eat to die, but we eat to live. Then the mind of God comes out. The prophet says, "Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel The meal in the barrel shall not waste, neither shall
{120}
the oil in the cruse fail, until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the face of the earth!" So she went and made bread with her own hand and she and her *household* (a greater thing than she mentioned) lived on that for a whole year, (@1 Kings 17:9 - 16). What a result! God in that way will demand what He knows we have, and what we have as we respond in obedience will be enlarged. As we yield ourselves in obedience to the divine will, the Spirit in us will work and the demands of God will be met -- our own needs, too.
Now that is what God proposes. He knows we can get it; it is only a question of going up into the mountain to get it. Go to the mountain, there is plenty there, plenty of wood. The prophet points out that the latter glory of the house shall be greater than the former glory. There is thus, dear brethren, every incentive to sacrifice, to go up to the mountain, to get the wood and build. May God grant us all this purpose and energy!
{121}
QUALIFICATION FOR THE ASSEMBLY
@Luke 24:13 - 48; @John 19:25 - 42; @John 20:1 - 23
P.L. Would you give us an idea as to what is in your mind?
J.T. I was remarking on certain having been said to have stood by the cross of Jesus, as a feature of John's gospel. "Now there stood by the cross of Jesus", it says. There is power to stand by the Lord in His death; and in chapter 20 the disciples are inside, conscious of the evil outside, but the doors are shut for fear of the Jews. John seems to call attention to the spiritual side in the saints -- that which stands notwithstanding opposition, whereas Luke records that the people "beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned", (@Luke 23:48). Even those who knew Him stood afar off; and then two of them, although conversing about what had happened, were going away from the divine centre.
I thought that might furnish a subject for inquiry at this time, how that in Luke the interest of the Lord in going after them is evident, and that recovery is through their minds, or intelligences. It is not exactly a shepherd using external means to bring the sheep back, but He operates in a moral way, through the intelligence and the heart, the result of which was that they returned to Jerusalem "the same hour", having *recognised* Him in the breaking of bread. So that material for the assembly in Luke has the public position in view; it is a *gathered company*, and the breaking of bread is a great feature of it.
In John it is not that they gathered or assembled, but that they *are* in a certain place, and recognising the evil outside they protect themselves against it; it is more instinctive, the doors were shut for fear of
{122}
the Jews. According to @John 20 there is nothing to reprimand in the company. In @Luke 24 there is.
Rem. In @Luke 24 the two going to Emmaus had lost hope.
J.T. Yes; and yet they were deeply interested. They were conversing together; their remarks to each other were not casual. The Lord says, "What discourses are these which pass between you as ye walk, and are downcast?" showing they were really intent in what they were saying. I think it is to call attention to the possibility of our being interested in the things of God, and yet we may be going in a direction away from where these things are centred, and thus we see that mere intelligence about the things does not hold us.
H.F.N. It is helpful to see the kind of people who stand in John; John brings before us four persons who stood by the cross.
J.T. These must have been distinguished in the testimony later, I suppose, this narrative having been written long after. Possibly the reference would be an explanation of what they were afterwards.
R.B. Is there any significance in the fact that it was women who were standing with John by the cross?
J.T. I think the women represent, as has often been remarked, the subjective side of the position and John, the disciple whom Jesus loved, represents throughout the gospel an element of trustworthiness, as one to whom the Lord could commit a charge, one who could be entrusted with something the Lord valued.
J.H.J. What had you particularly in mind in speaking of the two going away from Jerusalem in Luke?
J.T. There is a great deal of intelligence, and we can thank God for it, but then what effect has it on us? Is it attracting us towards the centre of God's
{123}
interest on earth, or have we our backs on that centre?
C.C.E. The two knew the facts, but they did not know the spiritual meaning and import of them. They discoursed about the things that happened, but they did not understand them until they had their understandings opened.
J.T. Would that not be an index to the state of their souls?
P.L. Is Luke's line connected with priesthood? He goes after the erring, but John's line is connected with headship -- the state of love amongst them that attracts Christ.
J.T. Yes; in Luke it is more the service of the priest than of the shepherd. The shepherd goes after the sheep and brings them back by external means. For instance, he carries the sheep. Here it is through their intelligence. But with regard to the remark that whilst they knew the things literally they were ignorant of their import, is not that the outcome of a state of soul?
C.C.E. Yes; surely.
J.T. In John they do not go back; they stood *by the cross* in the presence of the fiercest opposition. I think it is to call attention to the length to which those who love Christ would go -- the cross. Joseph of Arimathaea was a disciple, but secretly for fear of the Jews, that is mentioned; and Nicodemus, who came to Jesus by night; but there were those who stood by the cross (@John 19:25), whereas the two in Luke, although conversing about the things that happened, are going away from the centre.
H.F.N. Is it your thought that they were not prepared to accept the public shame connected with the cross?
J.T. That is what I thought. We might hang crosses about our necks, but to stand by the cross of Jesus whilst He was there brought them into complete identification with Him. In Luke, the crowds returned
{124}
beating their breasts; all those who knew Him stood afar off, and then two of them moved away from the place.
J.S. Do you connect the position in @John 20 with the intimacy of privilege?
J.T. Yes. They were there, and the Lord owned them in coming into their midst. They were conscious of the power against them and of the danger of it coming in amongst them, but they had shut the doors, showing that they had power. It is not a question of so many doors being in the building, but it is a spiritual allusion -- power to shut the doors of our hearts against evil; it is a question of inward power with them in John.
Ques. Is the inward power the result of accepting the reproach outwardly?
J.T. I think they go together. Luke would call attention to intelligence in the breaking of bread, and the place where they were gathered together, and that *the eleven* were there -- the authority of Christ in His apostles. Luke makes much of what is public, whilst John deals with what is inward.
Ques. Does Paul stand by the cross at Corinth?
J.T. Exactly. There were those of whom he speaks as enemies of the cross of Christ; (@Philippians 3:18). They were nominal christians; they were not said to be enemies of Christ, but enemies of the *cross*. And so he stands firmly by it in his first letter to the Corinthians.
H.F.N. With regard to the thought of that which the Lord valued being committed to one standing at the cross, does not that feature stand out in a peculiar way in John? The Lord committed His mother to the care of John, the light in regard to the brethren was committed to Mary Magdalene, and to Peter is committed the care of the sheep. Is it not a principle that the Lord commits to us whatever we are equal to?
J.T. That, I am sure, is very helpful; there is
{125}
trustworthiness. And so He breathes into them and says, "Receive the Holy Spirit whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained" -- a most important trust. As was remarked, we get the word of the cross in @1 Corinthians 1:18. Paul is standing by it. It is not a thing that I hang about my neck, it is the *word* of the cross in my heart, in my mind; I know what it means. To those who perish it is foolishness.
P.L. "Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also" (@Luke 2:23); there is the searching character of the word, as in @Hebrews 4.
J.T. Quite. The word of the cross is foolishness to the cultivated mind of this world; they may wear the cross around their necks, or carry it in their pockets, and yet the *word* of it not be in the mind at all. It is the word of the cross that is power.
E.S.H. It means that you are prepared to die, would you say?
J.T. I think you not only die, but you are identified with the Lord. Paul says, "I am crucified with Christ", (@Galatians 2:20). "But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world", (@Galatians 6:14). It is real deliverance. The Lord's supper brings all that vividly before us; it is His own device as a symbol, and is intended to bring vividly before us that He was actually dead. It is a dead Christ that is brought into view before us; the symbol is there to be seen.
Ques. Does not that lie at the root of all true spiritual state?
J.T. Well, it does, if you are identified with that. It is Christ in these circumstances, and the circumstances are vividly before you.
C.C.E. That is most helpful. It is a weekly remembrance of it. The Lord's supper, as you say, in a most vivid way brings the thing before our souls.
{126}
P.L. It is the cross of Jesus; the Person is in evidence in His dying.
H.F.N. Does John's ministry produce the kind of people who stand by the cross, and Luke's ministry prepare for John's?
J.T. They go together. Luke would bring us back to that point, but through our intelligences. Although the two have their backs to the centre, yet they are conversing about the Lord, and such cannot but be of interest to heaven; and so the Lord drew near and went with them. He could do that. There would be some moral basis for His going with them but what He had in His mind the sequel shows. It says their eyes were holden so as not to know Him; this has allusion to their state of soul.
Rem. They were "slow of heart", the Lord says.
J.T. That is the explanation of it: "O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: ought not the Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?" They were foolish.
Rem. Their affections did not correspond with their intelligence.
J.T. Just so. They had, however, hearts *capable of burning* when they heard Him conversing; that is important. If you hear people talking about the Lord and His things, although they may have turned their backs on the centre, yet they may have hearts capable of being touched. The Lord knew it was so in their case; He intended to touch their hearts.
Rem. There was movement with them when they constrained Him, saying, "Abide with us".
J.T. I think they were being gradually restored. There was something there different from what they had been accustomed to. Although apparently a stranger, so far as they knew, they were willing to invite Him in. "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come
{127}
to pass there in these days?" But then they invited Him in. But despite all the burning owing to the effect of His words, and despite the opening up of the Scriptures to them, they did not make a move to go back to Jerusalem until He had left them.
P.L. You must abide by the cross in order to have right thoughts of Christ or the brethren. "Certain of them which were with us" is different from "my brethren" of @John 20. The former attaches the saints to ourselves. But is not "my brethren" finding them by way of Himself?
J.T. Quite.
P.L. You feel the need of John's line to meet this in Luke.
H.F.N. Their eyes being opened, the moment they get a sight of Himself, they are prepared to return to the centre.
J.T. That is a point to be noted. It is through their eyes they recognised Him. All this process has the moral state in view. It is through the mind and heart that He is operating; in other words, the assembly is to be formed of "intelligent persons"; persons who have gone through a moral process. They know where they are, and why they are there. That is a great thing to come to, and that is Luke's point of view -- to have a people who are intelligent, so that they are talking of the Scriptures first, and then when He would have gone further, constraining Him to stay with them. Then in the giving of thanks and breaking of bread He is made known. The point of view in Luke, I believe, is to affect you so that you are according to the assembly publicly. The breaking of bread is what they saw; it is what is presented to their eyes, and they are enabled to see the Lord in it: "and their eyes were opened", it says, "and they recognised him". It is a question of intelligence, and the power of discernment.
{128}
Ques. The Corinthians did not recognise the Lord, did they?
J.T. They were defective in discerning the body; the apostle approaches the subject, "I speak as to intelligent persons do ye judge what I say" (@1 Corinthians 10:15), that is, you have to judge what is said and discern what is meant by it.
Ques. Does Luke, writing with method, arrive at that point?
J.T. Yes; it is to bring about the public body here, that in which the divine order is to be seen, so that the Scriptures are opened up, and they are to be His witnesses. John is dealing with the inner thing, which is in a sense the greater, because it is a question of power in your soul to stand where the opposition is, prevailing against it, so as to be independent of it. You are able to stand. They did not leave Jerusalem, but the doors are shut against the evil there.
Ques. Would the Lord's washing their feet have a moral bearing with this in view? That was a private matter, was it not?
J.T. I suppose all the instruction in John has this in view. You can see how it fits in to our own times. Power to stand against opposition, to stand where it is greatest.
P.L. Would you say it goes on to "part with me"? We can go on with all that He is going on with as drinking into His suffering spirit.
J.T. Quite.
Ques. Referring to your remark in regard of the Lord's supper as to everything being before our gaze there, would you say that Christ on the cross as the sin-bearer comes before us then?
J.T. It is Christ in those circumstances; the circumstances are vividly before us; we are brought back to the solemn fact that He was there. But I do not think the efficacy of His death comes before us so much, although, of course, we cannot ignore
{129}
that, but He was there in those circumstances, and we are brought back to that, and we feed upon it.
Rem. He was glorifying God in the place of sin.
J.T. Well, all that enters into it, but you are thinking of the Person in the Lord's supper; it is a memorial. That He was actually there is a most solemn thing to be brought back to; you are thinking of Him. You know that He is now alive and that He is not in this world at all, but that He *was* in those circumstances. In occupation with Him in them He is brought to your attention by that in which love is fully expressed. He is always expressing love, you might say, in all His care for us; but this is that in which love was *fully* expressed; that is what you are brought to see, that it is Himself, but Himself in those circumstances. It is a question, not of remembering Him *in* those circumstances, but of remembering Him *by* them; the Person you are remembering is the One who went into those circumstances; it is the Lord in death.
Ques. It has been said that we often start on too high a note. I suppose we might dwell on the Lord as the sin-offering at the commencement of the meeting?
J.T. The point is that you are occupied with the Person; it is a memorial. You face the fact that the One who is absent, who is to be remembered by the assembly, by the saints, was in death. There is no circumstance that brings Christ to you so vividly as this. If it were a question of remembering Him *in* His death, then you would expect the saints to have had the Lord's supper during the forty days between His resurrection and His ascension; but they did not; there is not a word said about the Lord's supper during the forty days. The incident at Emmaus was not the Lord's supper; it was an ordinary meal. It was incidental; but directly He goes to heaven and the Spirit comes you have the breaking of bread.
{130}
F.E.S. In emphasising the fact that we recognise Him in the breaking of bread, what had you before you?
J.T. Their intelligence is appealed to; they recognised Him. That shows that the breaking of bread brought Him before them. They must have recalled what they had known earlier -- they recalled His features.
H.F.N. Would the Lord opening their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures have any connection with what you have been saying?
J.T. I think it would; the two returned from Emmaus, it says, the same hour, and they found the eleven -- that was a mark of intelligence, because the eleven represented the Lord's authority. And then, not only the eleven, but those with them -- they found the company; and they were saying certain things -- that the Lord was risen. In John there was not a word about anything they said. It shows that in Luke it is a question of their intelligence; they were saying, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon". They had in their minds that the Lord was acting on the line of grace and that is in keeping with Luke. Then the two relate how He was made known to them in the breaking of bread. These remarks are full of intelligence, if you examine them and connect them with the Holy Spirit and the unfolding of the truth of christianity. They are able to see the meaning of the movements of the Lord as well as His words. "And has appeared to Simon" meant a good deal as exemplifying spiritual intelligence. So also that He was made known to the two in the breaking of bread; it means really the opening up of the truth of the Lord's supper. That is what the Holy Spirit records in Luke. It shows that those who come into fellowship should be concerned about intelligence -- to know what they are doing. They have love, of course, and love is the great thing;
{131}
John would emphasise that; but Luke would say there must be intelligence. The public body is formed of those who are intelligent, and who recognise authority. Then Luke goes on to tell us that the Lord came in as they were saying these things. It is not a question of what was in their hearts, as you would expect in John; it was the things they were saying -- "And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst, and says to them, Peace be unto you". But they "supposed they beheld a spirit. And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts? behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself". There again you have a touch of intelligence because it was His feet. In John it says that He shewed them His hands and His side, that is to say, it is more the *love* side in John. Then another thing is worthy of notice; in Luke we read He stood in *their* midst, that is in the midst of people of that kind; in John it is "in *the* midst", to show the position which the Lord takes up.
Ques. Does not that limit the thing rather to those who are intelligent?
J.T. I would not like to differentiate so much as that, because whoever were there, He was there in their midst. There are those who discern Him and those who do not, but I believe the Lord comes in in relation to all, that is, into the midst of a people who are thus gathered, and who are thus the subjects of His grace.
R.B. There are no absentees in that sense; they are all gathered.
J.T. Thomas is not said to be absent here.
Ques. Why the unrest? why were they terrified and affrighted?
J.T. That is to bring out another feature. There may be intelligence but an inward state that requires adjustment. It is extraordinary that they should
{132}
require adjustment in regard to the Lord Himself -- that it should be Himself whom they supposed to be a spirit. His appearing here is the final touch to bring them to apprehend Himself.
J.S. You would say that the Lord would be greatly endeared to those two who had failed in affection; they would say, It was His faithful service that restored us.
Ques. So that on the Lord's day morning, if we are going in this direction, we should look for the Lord to come in and take the lead?
J.T. Well, He is absent, and the Lord's supper is to bring vividly before us the circumstances in which love is set out; the facts of His death are there before us, and this has a very sobering, solemnising effect. That, I think, is what the apostle is pressing in @1 Corinthians 11:29; "not discerning the Lord's body", he says. And then in respect of misbehaviour, whether outward or inward state, it is in respect of the body and blood of the Lord, they are guilty. It is the solemnity of the thing. I have been impressed lately with this -- the Lord is bringing before us vividly the circumstances in which love was shown, in which alone, indeed, it could be fully shown. Love may be shown in other ways, and is constantly being shown by the Lord, but these are the circumstances in which it could be *fully* shown.
Ques. Would you emphasise the thought of a dead Christ in the memorials as showing the extent to which love went?
J.T. That is the way I look at it. It is a dead Christ before us, His blood separate from the body. These are the circumstances in which love is fully shown, and there never can be any increase in that; it is the full expression of love. That is where Christ was. The Christ that I am remembering was in these circumstances, so that the symbols of Him in those circumstances is the memorial.
{133}
Ques. Is it in the light of the risen One that we cherish the death of Christ?
J.T. Oh, surely. You are remembering the Christ who is absent, who is gone into heaven. In Luke He is carried up into heaven. In @Acts 1 a cloud received Him out of their sight. Here in Luke it is to call attention to heaven's receiving Him, but in Acts it is the beginning of the *faith* period. The Lord's supper looks on to the faith period when He is out of sight literally, and so we remember Him, and the symbols denote the circumstances in which love is known. It is in His death that love is fully shown.
P.L. Do you get the two lines in Joseph? He pleaded to be remembered by those to whom he had rendered a service in love; that would be Luke's view -- the explanation of the dream in prison; while the great sustainer of life would be more John -- Joseph on the throne.
J.T. Quite.
Ques. It says in @Deuteronomy 21:23, "his body shall not remain all night upon the tree"; is that in any way connected with the Supper?
J.T. In the Supper it is not a question so much of the curse but of the circumstances in which love was shown. He laid down His life for His friends.

NEARNESS TO CHRIST AND PUBLIC SERVICE (1)
@Ephesians 2:11 - 13,17,18; @Genesis 43:31 - 34; @Genesis 45:1 - 4
S.L. Do you suggest that these scriptures contain the way of the recovery of affection, not only to the Lord, but to one another?
J.T. Quite so. Ephesians presents what God has effected in Christ. We have been brought *near* -- brought near through His blood. I was thinking of the difference between being brought near and drawing nigh, the former is what God has effected, the latter is our side. I thought Genesis would help us as to how we are brought near, as already in the relationship of brethren, but at a distance from God and from Christ practically, through our state. Ephesians, in keeping with the parable of the prodigal son, shows us how we are brought near who were afar off -- we have been brought near in Christ, through His blood, and then we have access to the Father through Him by the Spirit. That is the truth from the divine side, but it has to be taken up; and it is in taking up the privilege of drawing near to God by the Spirit that the question of our state and associations comes up.
R.W.G. Speaking of state and associations, do you get these in what you read in Genesis?
J.T. Yes. Chapter 43 gives an extraordinary set of facts. Joseph has bread set on for him by himself, for his brethren by themselves, and for the Egyptians by themselves. That does not indicate nearness or family relationships. Although there is food and the position is in the house, as the chapter teaches, yet we are impressed with the distance that
{135}
existed, the distance with which, in the antitype, many are content -- content to be fed alone, to remain by themselves, different coteries or sets feeding by themselves; but it does not satisfy the Lord's heart.
R.McB. Would that be occupation with self, do you think?
J.T. Well, division is there, groups feeding each by themselves.
W.W. That is what the Corinthians did.
J.T. Quite so. That sort of thing sprang up there, and has developed into the grossest forms now. The Lord is not indifferent to it, nor has He been. He cares for all His own, nevertheless.
P.J.G. You mean in all the systems around?
J.T. Yes.
H.H. Is it not important to see that from the divine side all the distance has been dealt with, as in Ephesians and in @Luke 15? But, as you were saying, the exercise is as to how far we are in line with the fact of all that having been disposed of. Is that your thought?
J.T. That is right. I am thinking particularly of the passages in Genesis showing typically that groups feed by themselves; whereas the Lord has to eat by Himself, so to say, in those circumstances. In view of a move such as is depicted in the chapter, the *house* comes into view; as soon as they bring Benjamin down to Egypt, the house is in view and one over it. And it is said of Joseph that he came home at noon, so that from his point of view the conditions were there, the family affections to be reciprocated from his side, but not from their side; and certainly not among the Egyptians, for, they could not have anything to do with the Hebrews. They had their own discriminations.
J.McM. Thinking of what God has effected, is that why we "are made nigh by the blood of Christ"?
J.T. Yes; the blood represents death, in the sense
{136}
that it can be applied, I think. It is that side of the death of Christ that has to do with God's rights.
J.B. Do you think that Joseph recognised that in Judah, and that he could then ask them to draw near?
J.T. I think he did. In Judah's speech you have the recognition of the rights of the father and of the child. Judah represents progress being made. Chapter 43 is the house, Benjamin being in view. Benjamin, I think, is the overcomer; not yet having overcome, but he is in that way -- he had no part whatever in the guilt of the ten. So that as he comes into view you have the house and one over it who is in the secret of things. But what has been said about Ephesians is a good basis to go on, that from the divine side we are brought nigh by the blood. We have a status before God from the divine side, and His rights are fully met by the blood of Christ.
R.McB. "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?" (@Romans 8:32). God has come out thus.
J.T. Yes; He has come out to bring us near, that is the point. Love abhors distance, and He would have gentiles near, but if He brings them near, it must be in keeping with His own rights; so, while the status is in Christ, it is by His blood.
R.A. Would you say that the blood suggests the thought of the removal of distance?
J.T. Exactly; it is that which may be taken and placed before God. It is placed before God in the sin-offering, so that the distance is removed thus. It is not only that God can come out, but also that man is brought near. In Ephesians it is not that God has reached man where man was -- that is Romans; but that the gentiles are brought near, showing that that is what God has in His mind. In Romans He has come out to where we were; in Ephesians He has come out that we might go in.
{137}
H.D'A.C. It could only be in Christ Jesus. The blood would remove all distinctions, would it not? Then, allied with that, there is "in Christ Jesus".
J.T. Yes. "In Christ Jesus" is the thought of the status in which we are set up before God. The blood is that which meets His rights.
R.A. You were referring to associations, had you in mind that our associations can hinder our enjoyment of these things?
J.T. What has come about today is that christians have set up barriers between themselves and God, whereas His thought was that they are to be brought near. They have reverted to the old barriers which God has done away with. God has done away through the rent veil with these barriers that stood between Him and men. God began by bringing the gentiles nigh, and that not only objectively, as we say, in Christ and by the blood of Christ, but He gave the Spirit that we might have access to Him.
H.H. Is not the activity of divine love set forth in the blood of Christ, all the value of the One whose blood is poured out? I was thinking of what the apostle says in @Acts 20:28, "shepherd the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own". Does it not show what lay behind the blood?
J.T. Quite so; the Holy Spirit is the witness in our hearts to that love.
W.D.G. Do you think the silver cup would give a link between these chapters? Was it not Joseph's mind that they should drink with him?
J.T. The cup is no doubt the link; it was *his* cup. I am thinking particularly of @Ephesians 2, how it brings out what was in the heart of God. He has wrought to bring us nigh, we who once were afar off.
S.L. Is not relationship with Christ a most powerful thing to attract our souls?
J.T. It is indeed. Ephesians shows, not simply
{138}
that God has come out in Christ to where we were, as in the case of the man who fell among thieves, but that He has wrought to bring us nigh; and so that we might draw nigh He has given us the Spirit. We are told that the Lord coming "preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and ... to those who were nigh" (@Ephesians 2:17); and then it is said that by one Spirit we both have access *to the Father* through Him.
S.L. So that nearness is secured by the blood of Christ, and that is entered upon as the Spirit forms us.
J.T. Quite so. It is by the Spirit we draw near, according to Ephesians. It is presented as if God brought about these conditions; now, can we take them up? The gentiles have reverted to the old state of things, of distance between God and themselves. The whole system of so-called worship abroad in christendom implies distance between God and His people; it is a denial of the dispensation. And what God is doing now is to bring about nearness to Himself in His children, to bring us nigh in a *practical* way.
W.D.G. Is it priestly?
J.T. It is. You find all depends on the skill of Joseph in this section of Genesis. Everything hinged on Joseph's skill in dealing with his brethren. What is before us is the Lord in His apocalyptic character. He has to be apprehended, since the great falling away, in His apocalyptic character. The addresses to the churches in the book of Revelation imply distance, but distance with a view to a state of things being brought about in which the Lord can manifest what He is to His own. He brings about a state of love amongst the saints, and thus He can show what He is to the assembly, and what the assembly is to Him.
Ques. Does not @Genesis 44:14 correspond with what you are suggesting from Revelation? In
{139}
Revelation John falls on his face; here the brethren fall down.
J.T. That is good, it shows they are being led on. The Lord works at a distance under such circumstances. He cannot assume to be near to us if we are in a bad state, He has to maintain distance.
W.D.G. The rough speaking (@Genesis 42) then has to do with the fact that He would have us near Him.
J.T. The whole process is in order that we should be near. Love abhors distance, and what impresses you is the skill of Joseph in bringing about the nearness.
Ques. Is that in any way seen in the woman who touched the hem of His garment?
J.T. There it is a question of *touch*, that is, contact for healing power. You see in these chapters in Genesis how the ten brethren must come up with Benjamin. It is Benjamin that is the link, they came up with Benjamin. Then the *house* comes into view; thus they are drawing near to the time of disclosure. In this we learn how the Lord can make known what He is to the brethren, what He is to the assembly, and what the assembly is to Him. If He can find a few answering to it, He has opportunity of disclosing what He is to the whole assembly. We must apprehend Him as to what He is to it.
R.McB. Would you speak of the kingdom in connection with Benjamin?
J.T. I think Joseph is in that position -- the *lord* of all Egypt. But in the presence of Benjamin the house comes into view and the ruler of it, who is in the secret of things.
J.H. It is a time of activity on the part of Joseph. He is not yet ready to ungird himself.
J.T. While christendom remained as it was through all the centuries, there was no thought of the Lord ungirding Himself and sitting down, so to speak, in the evening. The Lord's supper is the evening
{140}
meal, that is to say, it suggests freedom from ordinary activities; whereas what you get here is a *noonday* meal -- it was the time of day *when things were being done*. Although they had the repast and rejoiced, it was not the Supper, it was not the evening meal. The evening meal is the Lord's supper; He introduced it then. Of course He does not eat it -- I speak of it as the occasion in which, love existing in those partaking of it, the Lord is free to be with them.
L.D.B. Why have you alluded to the house frequently in this connection?
J.T. I think it indicates that that is what the Lord has before Him in all these dealings; He has nothing less than Ephesians before Him, He has the very best before Him; the full thought of the house is in Ephesians.
E.P. Is Ephesians priestly nearness, or family nearness?
J.T. I should say both.
E.P. Would you say a word as to the distinction?
J.T. Priesthood is based on the family relationship. "Through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father" is family, insomuch as it is the *Father* that is approached; but it is also priestly, for we must approach in holy intelligence as well as in family affection.
Rem. No one could be a priest unless he were a son of Aaron.
J.T. No. In @Leviticus 8:13 the word is, "Moses brought Aaron's sons near". The gathering of the congregation was to be at the door of the tabernacle, and they were brought near; so that they were in full view of all that in which their service was to be carried on. Then they are clothed with their high caps and vestments, so as to be qualified to have part in that service according to God.
E.P. Is the nearness in @Hebrews 10 equal to this nearness in Ephesians?
{141}
J.T. I do not think it is quite on this level. Hebrews is elementary; we draw near there by the blood; the access is by the blood. "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus ... let us draw near", (chapter 10:19 - 22). Of course there can be no approach to God without what is presented here, but it is not the same level as Ephesians. In Hebrews you need the *high* priest. Ephesians does not say that; it says, "through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father".
F.W.W. Would this nearness involve not only moral suitability, but frame of mind and movement of affection? It is not mere material closeness.
J.T. It is a question of what goes on in your soul. You see how God has wrought to bring you -- through the blood; and then by the Spirit *you* may draw near through Christ.
Rem. It says that on the mount of transfiguration "they saw no man, save Jesus only" (@Matthew 17:8); and here Joseph says, "Cause every man to go out", as much as to indicate that the blotting out of every other thing from one's heart induces what the Lord is wanting -- nearness.
J.T. Joseph ordered everybody to go out; that is to say, the time had come for him to make disclosures; whereas in @John 20 the saints are concerned that there should be no foreign element there -- the doors were shut.
Ques. Would the family features you are suggesting be seen in Benjamin, he had the same mother as Joseph?
J.T. That is what comes out. The link was between Joseph and Benjamin. The recovery implies that the saints are not only brought back to the same father -- that is, God is our Father -- but to the same mother, the saints are brought back to the assembly -- that is the work of the Spirit. We are brought to
{142}
Galatians -- Jerusalem above is our mother. These men were sons of one father, that was their boast; they could not say they were sons of one mother, because they were not. Most of the saints of today hardly dare say they are sons of one mother for they are in different systems. God is aiming to bring us to that; but as long as I am allied to a human organisation, that is my mother, and I am taking character from it, whereas Benjamin had the same mother as Joseph.
Ques. You referred to Benjamin as a type of the overcomer; would that be the state which would be produced suitable for this?
J.T. I think so -- the saints brought to the apprehension of the church in some sense; as soon as Benjamin comes into view, the house is referred to. Now you have got the conditions, the father and the mother, and the house comes into view. The house of God is not composed of people who have different mothers.
S.L. The soul, being conscious of relationship, reaches up to the house.
J.T. Benjamin is fit for the house; in the mind of Joseph the house was essential to that one. As soon as he saw Benjamin he was moved, he was stirred in his inner affections; and you can understand how, applying that to Christ, in the overcomer you have one who recognises only one mother, that is, the assembly; there is the abandonment of human organisation for what is of God.
H.H. Many souls speak of God as their Father and seem to be sensible of the relationship, yet fall short of what you are speaking of.
J.T. They do. The house conditions are not really depicted in chapter 43, Joseph (that is, Christ, typically) eating by himself, and the Egyptians eating by themselves, and the Hebrews eating by themselves;
{143}
that is not suggestive of house *conditions*, nevertheless the house was there.
Rem. He would seek house conditions with them before he could ungird himself.
J.T. Yes; so chapter 44, as has been suggested, brings in the cup.
Ques. Would the cup suggest what is introductory to the house of God?
J.T. Yes. It was the cup in which Joseph divined. Joseph would retain Benjamin through the cup, the cup was the link. It was a humiliating process so far as Benjamin was concerned, but it was very effective. You want what is effective, however painful. Joseph was operating in all this to bring about, not only the house, but house conditions.
Ques. Is that @1 Corinthians 10?
J.T. Quite so. In Corinthians you get the cup mentioned first -- it is a cup of blessing -- but then you get the bread. What you want is a complete idea in divine things, not a partial thing. Some of us were remarking the other day about the woman of Sarepta, who was a widow. The prophet said, "Fetch me ... a little water in a vessel", then, as she went for that, he said, "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand" (@1 Kings 17:10,11); there is not a whole idea in it -- it doubtless alluded to her state; she was not governed by a complete idea, neither are any christians in the 'systems', they are partial. Then he says, "make me ... a little cake first" -- not a little morsel, but a little *cake* -- that is a *complete* thought. That is what God is working for, to bring about a complete thought -- that is Christ. A cake is a complete thing in itself and that is the Lord's supper, it is bread, not a *piece* of bread. What is right is a cake or loaf; there is thus before us a complete thought of Christ and of the assembly also, and that is what the Supper conveys to you. "The bread which we break,
{144}
is it not the communion of the body of the Christ? Because we, being many, are one loaf, one body" (@1 Corinthians 10:16); that is a complete thought and it brings about unity.
J.P.G. So the Lord reproved Sardis, He had not found their works complete before His God; (@Revelation 3:2).
J.T. Exactly. They were wanting in completeness. All that which man builds up is wanting in completeness, but in Christ you have a complete thought, and that is presented in the Lord's supper. Rightly apprehended, it works out in completeness in every way.
H.H. Would the woman of Sarepta typify people who are exercised about individual things and with no spirit of adjustment as to what is connected with the assembly, resulting in saints being held up in regard to entering on privilege and unable to touch the Ephesian side of things, because, although there is a certain amount of exercise, things are not in suitable adjustment?
J.T. Quite so. @Ephesians 4:13 is, "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ".
J.B. Have we a similar thought in @Ephesians 1:23, "his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all"? It is complete.
J.T. Yes. God graciously takes account of us; if we are thinking of a morsel, He is able in grace to bring the whole together in our souls. The prophet conveyed to the woman of Sarepta the idea, a little cake; but he says, Make for *me* first.
H.B. Really the thought of a sect is a broken part.
J.T. That is it, exactly. They can have their piece of bread, but those who are intelligent about Christ want the whole loaf. You are formed on those lines, and thus you become a member of Christ.
{145}
S.L. Even in Romans and Corinthians and Galatians, the Spirit of God had the very highest thought before Him.
J.T. Yes, God has never anything less than that, so the house comes into view in @Genesis 43 that house conditions might come about.
S.L. Nothing could possibly satisfy the heart of God for His people but to bring them up to the affections and love of the bride.
P.J.G. Would you say that the introduction of anything of man is productive of distance, such as organisations and rules of etiquette, or anything official?
J.T. You see, what the religious world would say is that a part will do for Christ; they acknowledge the divisions as if they were good enough for Christ. But they are *not* good enough for Christ, He wants the whole church, and He would bring that about, in principle at least, by introducing the bread. "The bread which *we* break" (@1 Corinthians 10:16) signifies one whole.
D.McI. Being in the good of that, you would be a help to others.
J.T. Joseph insists that they must bring Benjamin, because I think Benjamin represents what is in his mind, he had the same father and the same mother as Joseph. This thought is reached in @Exodus 6:20, where those who lead in the testimony, Moses and Aaron, have the same parents.
Rem. Benjamin represented the true family of God.
J.T. Yes; Joseph had that in his mind, and the basis of it was that he and Benjamin had the same father and the same mother. The others had to come to that, but that was the line on which God was working. You cannot leave Benjamin out if you are to reach the whole idea, you must bring him in, otherwise you have fragments. Fragmentary things will never do for God or Christ. Paul says, "I have not
{146}
shunned to declare unto you *all* the counsel of God", (@Acts 20:27).
H.L. In that connection, would you say a word about the twelve shewbread loaves?
J.T. They represent a whole *administrative* idea. Twelve is also suggestive of what is capable of divine manipulation, it being so *very divisible*.
Ques. What would be the aim of that manipulation?
J.T. To get the greatest possible service. We do not need to be together, as we are now, for instance, for that. You may be sent in one direction in the world, and I in another. We are subject to divine manipulation, so that the greatest possible results may accrue. But although we may be working severally and at distances from each other, as under the Lord, we are in unity and co-operating to the same end.
Ques. How does Joseph's cup test us today?
J.T. It enters into the Lord's supper, I think, in the way in which it is presented to us in @1 Corinthians 10, the bearing of it in our everyday life.
Ques. Does the death of Christ come in, in that regard, as serving us?
J.T. I think it does. You see *Benjamin* had the cup. It seemed a calamity that he had it, at first, but the calamity is changed, it was for his advantage that he had it; he is brought back to Joseph through it. The process was humbling, but it was effective. We are brought back to God in connection with a *high* order of things, not mere discipline; there is this, but you are brought back with very high things -- the cup that Joseph used, for divining was no small matter. It refers to a very high level; we want to be brought back on the level God has designed for us. You remember it is said of Paul that he reached Ephesus through the *upper* districts; (@Acts 19:1). There was not full recovery at the Reformation, the
{147}
church was not reached at all, things were on a low line, whereas the recovery of the last century was on a high level, it is in connection with that which is most valuable; in the type the very cup with which Joseph divined. Luther and others of his time were raised up and used of God, and so we owe them much under Him, but the church and the purpose of God generally were not reached; room was not made for the Holy Spirit. By way of contrast, we see how wonderfully honoured the saints are in these days, brought back to God on the very highest level.
Rem. You want to be recovered *to* something.
J.T. That is the very thing. Then we see the state of Judah, who represents the ten. He is concerned about their father, an old man (he had right feelings), and his youngest son, whom he loved. "His brother is dead". *His* brother, note, not '*our* brother'. Judah's remarks lead up to the line Joseph was on. "We have an aged father, and a child born to him in his old age, yet young; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him". Such a group of circumstances arouses the most tender *family feelings*. These are in keeping with the cup.
Ques. What answers to the cup today?
J.T. It says, the cup in which indeed he divines. Think of being brought back in connection with that by which the Lord divines! "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth", (@2 Chronicles 16:9). And in @Revelation 3:1 we read of the "seven Spirits of God". It is in that connection we are brought back in connection with the Spirit of God. It is said that "the spiritual discerns all things", (@1 Corinthians 2:15).
Ques. Do you think that God is exercising us to bring about family affections for the comfort of His own heart?
J.T. He is. The Reformation did not reach the
{148}
church level. Someone was saying the other day that it is very doubtful whether Luther reached the first verse of @Romans 5; he spoke much of being justified by faith (and of course we thank God for this and the great stand he made), but was there peace *with God*, access into favour, and rejoicing in *hope of the glory of God*? That is the line. The Lord has nothing less for us today than Ephesians.
Ques. Is it not by means of the truth that we are recovered? "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free", (@John 8:32).
J.T. Yes; but justification by faith was truth, but not the whole truth. The 'cup', so to speak, was not there at the Reformation. Whereas what we are considering here shows in type that recovery is on the highest line; we are brought into the family consciously, and all that is contrary is put out.
Ques. Did the Lord approach the woman in @John 4 on that line?
J.T. On the line of worship of the *Father*. Joseph put all out here. Chapter 43 contemplates *operations* -- Joseph comes in at noon from his business -- but that is not chapter 45, there all are put out and no one is there but Joseph and his brethren; it is the time of disclosure, of manifestations, wherein he shows what he is to his brethren. In chapter 44:14 we read that Joseph "was still there" -- in the house -- when his brethren returned, as if waiting and not occupied with other things. So that what follows occurred in the house.
Ques. Do you connect this cup with the cup of the new covenant?
J.T. Well, no doubt it is connected, but it is really on a higher line -- it is what *Joseph* uses, by which he drinks and divines. Today nothing will answer the Lord's heart but the very best He can give for His brethren; you can see that now we are to be brought into the *secrets* of the Lord, what He is
{149}
doing. Having that cup looked like a calamity, but it was not; in result it meant that they were brought into his presence as brethren and he was revealed to them. Then, secrets were revealed to them as to what was going to happen. The idea of divining is, the Lord discerning and taking account of things. We have the mind of Christ, the means of thinking as He thinks.
L.D.B. In that way there is nothing much more testing than the love of God.
J.T. Oh, it tests you, surely! but do you not think that the Lord in all these centuries has had His own mind about things? The book of Revelation shows that everything is known to Him. Having His Spirit we come into the understanding of all, and we are brought consciously into the family. So we are lifted out of the whole realm of current religion into an order of things in which Christ is operating -- that is the line of recovery.
Rem. John is marked out as the one who leaned on Jesus¬ breast.
J.T. Yes; he was like the Urim and the Thummim, through him the mind of the Lord was obtained.
Ques. Is it like, "I call you not servants ... but ... *friends*", (@John 15:15)?
J.T. Quite. You are brought into a realm where you get to see how Christ has been viewing things all through the centuries.
Ques. Would it suggest that Joseph saw something in Benjamin to which he could commit himself?
J.T. I think it does. Benjamin had the same father and the same mother as Joseph.
Rem. In many minds, the cup is buried in the food sack, they view it as a means of grace.
J.T. Quite.
Ques. Is there any difference between that and @Luke 15?
J.T. I was thinking at the beginning that it
{150}
corresponds with Ephesians; the prodigal is the gentile brought near and made suitable for the divine presence. What you get in Genesis, is, I think, the family of God, as we may say, in parts. Benjamin represents the real thing; he had no part in the wickedness, and he had the same mother as Joseph; and so Joseph's requirement was that they must bring Benjamin. As soon as he sees Benjamin the house is in view, and he is moved. He comes in at noon; he has not reached the end yet, but he is nearing it. "Set on bread" -- it is a question now of the administration of the goodness of God; it is carried on in the way of distance -- "for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians ... by themselves" -- that is how the matter stood. And then the cup comes in because he would bring Benjamin near; Benjamin must be the link, and he has to be brought back, and when they returned Joseph was still there, as if waiting for them. Then comes Judah's speech, and the Egyptians are put out, and he makes himself known.
Rem. It is not only the cup "in which my lord ... divineth", but the cup in which he "*drinketh*".
J.T. Yes; you can see therefore what a high level we are on. You get into the way of divine enjoyment.
Ques. You spoke of Benjamin having to go through apparent calamity, what would answer to that?
J.T. Well, you have to go through things with your brethren, even though you may have no part in the guilt. You cannot escape the ordinary discipline, but the Lord has His eye on you specially. In chapter 44 we are introduced into an order of things where we learn the divine way of viewing things, and doing things. That is, to my mind, very wonderful, and indicates the peculiar character of the present time. The great revival is in relation to the very highest things.
{151}
Rem. With Israel the revival comes in through Benjamin, "Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself", (@Psalm 80:17).
Ques. Do you think that the features of Benjamin are brought about through exercise? I was thinking of the death of Rachel.
J.T. Yes. Judah conveys what they had reached, in telling what he was to his father.
Rem. Benjamin would be far removed from any party spirit.
J.T. That is what I thought. He recognises the assembly, in principle. Brought to this, you disallow all partisanship, you come into the good of the house. But then the others are to be brought into it as well. The Lord, if He is operating with an overcomer, has the *whole* idea before Him, He would bring all into what the overcomer has. In the meantime Benjamin has to suffer with the others, but he is already reminded of the place he has, in the *five* portions, he has already a testimony to the place he has with Joseph. Later he gets the *kisses*.
Rem. Coming into the light of these things involves a good deal of suffering.
J.T. However spiritual you are, you go through with the brethren whatever may come upon them through the governmental dealings of God.
Rem. He was the only one who wept on Joseph's neck.
J.T. Yes; he responded *fully* to Joseph's affections.
H.D'A.C. The picture is not complete without Judah coming forward and taking a large share of the blame. That spirit is important, is it not? He was not the guilty one, but he faced the situation, and it was through his admissions and confession that Joseph saw the time had come to make himself known to his brethren.
{152}
J.T. Judah therefore represents what was becoming in the ten; he did not speak for Benjamin. Judah in his exercises represents the ten -- *all* as responsible. The Lord has nothing less than that before His mind; therefore, as Judah speaks, Joseph says, "Cause every man to go out from me". It is a question of showing, typically, what Christ is to the brethren as a whole.
R.McB. Is that so that He could seek all his brethren?
J.T. Quite so. Every man is put out. It is not now a question of doing outwardly great things, but of being engaged with his brethren. "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me", (@John 14:20). The Lord's prayer in @John 17 shows what they were to Him, they were enough to engage His affections.
Here it is disclosure of His relation to us -- under these circumstances He makes us know that we are His brethren. This is marked by great *feeling* -- Joseph "wept aloud" as he "made himself known unto his brethren".
Then he said, "Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near". Then follows the expression of mutual affection. All this shows in the most striking and affecting way how the Lord has wrought at the present time to bring His own back to Himself in the apprehensions and realisation of the most exalted family relationship.
{153}
NEARNESS TO CHRIST AND PUBLIC SERVICE (2)
@Luke 8:1 - 21
J.T. Here the Lord is seen going through the country, city by city, and village by village, preaching and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, after certain events -- "afterwards", it says. The mind is directed to what preceded, especially in chapter 7, in which we have attention called to a state of things governed by grace. The presence of the Lord here, from Luke's point of view, involves the spreading abroad of the principle of grace -- the influence of it. So that chapter 7 calls attention to the incident of the centurion and other occurrences, showing that the principle of grace had spread abroad and was being effective; the knowledge that the centurion had of the Lord, and his own relation with the Jews; then the dealing with death, and John the baptist's ministry. Chapter 7 thus shows the bearing and effect of the grace of the Lord's ministry and the exposure of what was contrary to it. The Old Testament -- what came down through John -- was merged in what the Lord was doing, so that there is adjustment. The Pharisees and the lawyers are exposed, and all the people and the publicans are said to have justified God, being baptised by John. There is thus adjustment, and the full result of grace is seen evidently in the woman who anointed the Lord.
So that we have a state of things showing the success of the ministry that was proceeding. With a product like the woman in the Pharisee's house before us, it is well worth combing the cities and villages to find such. "Afterwards ... he went through the country city by city, and village by village, preaching
{154}
and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God". Nothing is said as to how the woman in Simon's house learned of the Lord, whether she had ever come in contact with Him before, but the principle of grace was ruling to such an extent that she sought Him out. She represents the full result of His ministry in that way, and in this chapter (coming in after that), He is seeking out, we may say, all such.
Ques. In view of material in each locality, would you say?
J.T. That is what I think we may see. In the second half of this chapter the sowing comes in as necessary. I think we shall see, as we proceed, that the object in view is to bring about local conditions answering to the assembly. But every city and every village has to be searched out. That is the principle, that whatever there is of God has to be searched out, so that it is *every* city and village.
Ques. How would you apply that to a country like this today?
J.T. Well, you get the principle. When we get the principle rightly in our minds, the application becomes easy. Principles are so important; here the principle of finding what there is of God. You omit no city or village. This may easily be applied in any country. You see what the principle involves; you have got two things here, preaching and announcing.
Ques. What is the difference?
J.T. I think preaching is authoritative. The Lord was anointed and sent to preach; it is representative. Announcing here may also be rendered "bringing", as in chapter 2:10. The thing is set out in such form as to make it intelligible.
Ques. Would the preaching of the glad tidings of the kingdom of God bring to light that of which you have been speaking?
J.T. Yes; it brings to light an order of things in which God intervened for the deliverance of man; it
{155}
is the "glad tidings of the kingdom of God" here. It is an order of things marked by divine power wielded in grace, so that it is the kingdom of *God*. Luke emphasises that it is *God*: "The Spirit of the Lord [Jehovah] is upon me", (@Luke 4:18). So that in Luke the Lord, as He challenges them as to who He was, is confessed as the Christ of *God*. You have God, but then God in His kingdom, in an order of things through which believers are delivered from the power of Satan.
Rem. He is anointed by "the Spirit of the Lord", and then by the woman.
J.T. She anoints Him on the *feet*; evidently she discerns that to bring grace to her He had to travel; and *was* travelling. The service is not an easy matter, it is not for those who sit in their houses and think that God will do the work. It is a question of travelling, and hence here, one city after another, and one village after another is visited. Later (chapter 10) we have the Samaritan *journeying*.
Rem. With regard to the preaching and announcing, both these words seem to be used in connection with John the baptist's ministry at the beginning of this gospel: "*preaching* the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins" (chapter 3:3); and then (verse 18), "exhorting ... he *announced* his glad tidings to the people"; the Spirit of God uses both these words.
J.T. Yes. I think 'announcing' has the force of showing that the glad tidings exist. The thing is opened up -- made intelligible. But 'preaching' is generally more authoritative.
Rem. And would it not suggest that in preaching there is a herald. Paul was a herald.
J.T. Yes. Preaching seems to have authority; it is one who is anointed that preaches.
Ques. Do you suggest that the Lord is seen here as an example?
{156}
J.T. Well, I think He is. He sets out that we are here in relation to a system; not only now one preaching on his own account as gifted, but preaching in relation to the system. Hence you get here the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, and *the twelve were with Him*, and certain women, too. I am sure you see what I mean -- in your service you recognise a system of things, you are taken up in connection with that. God has set up a system of things. That is where His power lies.
Ques. Does that mean that you announce what exists already, you have not to produce it?
J.T. That is right. Of course you preach Christ, but then you preach the kingdom of God. It is the glad tidings of the kingdom of God.
Ques. Why are the feet said to be anointed with myrrh, rather than oil?
J.T. I think it refers to a suffering path; it is a thorny way.
Ques. Does love play a great part in this system? The centurion "loves our nation", they say; (chapter 7:5). Then the woman's son is restored to her, so as to satisfy her affection.
J.T. Quite so; you see how grace is operating in relation to what is of God here. "He loves our nation", well, God still owned that; "and himself has built the synagogue for us". God still owned that. And then the widowed mother is taken account of in a compassionate way by the Lord. Grace in service takes account of what God owns here. Then you have John -- his ministry taken account of. He himself shows that he is waning, but this wonderful service of grace brings to light all the good things about John and his ministry. Those who heard justified God, and those who did not rejected the counsel of God; they rendered null the counsel of God as to themselves. It was their own doing. That is how grace takes account of things. Then here is this
{157}
woman who loves much: "Wisdom is justified of all her children". The thing is working out in this way. That is chapter 7. All this is included in the position in the opening of chapter 8.
Rem. She "stood at his feet *behind* him"; that would be as much as to say, He is going before.
J.T. A very fitting position for a believer. She recognises His lead, and in the leading He is a sufferer; she anoints His feet.
Ques. Does the action suggest intelligence on her part?
J.T. It does. She knew, she stood behind him weeping; there is the expression of *feelings*; it is a sure evidence of the work of God. Then she washes His feet with her tears and wipes them with the hairs of her head, and anoints them with myrrh. It is a beautiful service, done so well in such an *adverse* atmosphere. Many of us do things well under good circumstances, but she did it well in very adverse ones.
Ques. Would that be ministering to Him of her substance?
J.T. That is the point; she was doing that. He said in spirit (@Proverbs 8) that those who love Him would have their treasuries filled, she would be enriched through Him. But she did the thing well and deliberately. She was proving her love. She really condemned the coldness and indifference around her. She was doing what Simon should have done.
Ques. In regard to the preaching being in relation to a system, would the twelve being with Him be more the public side?
J.T. The twelve allude to the administrative system, a system capable of His manipulation; the twelve are in His hands, so to say. We shall see later how He uses them, but for the moment they are there. We have to wait to see the development of the system.
Ques. Would you enlarge a little on the thought
{158}
of the glad tidings of the kingdom of God -- the characteristics of it?
J.T. Well, I think it is, as we were saying, a system of things in which God is known in power; it is grace acting in power. The point is grace. Grace is dominant in chapter 7; but the Pharisees and lawyers are exposed -- in spite of the presence of grace they are exposed -- in that they did not submit themselves to the baptism of John. The Lord makes it plain that John's was a powerful ministry; opening up in grace the way of escape. Its rejection sealed the fate of those Pharisees and lawyers.
Ques. What is the counsel of God?
J.T. It would be all that God had in mind for Israel. It was all there, and He was ready to make it good, but they rendered it null.
Rem. It was presented in John the baptist.
J.T. It was presented in Christ, to whom John witnessed (see @John 1). In rejecting his ministry they rejected all that God had in His mind for them in Christ. Seeing Jerusalem, as entering it finally, He wept over it, knowing that He would be rejected.
Rem. So that the preaching of the kingdom is the setting forth of the way God has revealed Himself.
J.T. "If I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you", (@Luke 11:20). That is to say, it is a question of power -- grace acting in power for man's deliverance, a power great enough to overthrow every enemy. The "strong man" kept his palace, but a *stronger* than he bound him; here the Lord is really spoiling his goods; grace is acting.
Rem. Verse 2 shows that those who appreciated that power were in sympathy with Him.
J.T. The twelve were with Him. The twelve showed that they were qualified, in that they were *with Him*; not now that He is with them (chapter 6:17), but they are with Him. That is to say, they
{159}
are moving, *their* position is determined by *His*. We shall see later how He uses them. "The twelve" signifies material which can be divinely manipulated for service.
Ques. It says of the women who went with Him that they had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities. Would they be an evidence of the kingdom?
J.T. Exactly. There was one, Mary Magdalene, for instance, from whom seven demons had gone out. It was not simply that there was power, but *they had gone out*. There was a vessel -- the work of God became such in her that they went out, they could not stay there.
Ques. Was it the operation of grace?
J.T. Well, yes. But it is a great tribute to what had taken place in Mary Magdalene.
Rem. They were not *cast* out.
J.T. Elsewhere they are said to have been cast out, but it is as if they had to go; there was no more room for them. As with Judas, he *went* out; (@John 13).
Ques. Who took their place?
J.T. The power of the kingdom. *Now* it would be the Holy Spirit. Christ would occupy her affections, if Mary Magdalene be the woman of chapter 7, for it is a continuation morally; there was no room except for Christ.
Rem. So that we arrive at the power of the kingdom by our need.
J.T. I think it is a very fine thing when we see evil going out, it shows a certain change in the conditions. Here there were seven of them -- complete power, but they went out.
Ques. Are you connecting the completeness of the work with the preaching and announcing?
J.T. Well, that is what He was doing, but, you see, He had by Him twelve. These twelve men had a formative history -- thus they were with Him, it is
{160}
put that way. He has by Him a number of persons, material that can be used as He pleases, so that the greatest good may result. Peter may be taken to represent the work of God in them all. "First Peter", that is the way @Matthew 10:2 presents it. Luke gives us his history in this way; the Lord entered into his house and healed his mother-in-law. He had an exhibition in his house of the Lord's power, He stood over the woman and the fever left her; but, apparently Simon did not get the thing then, but the testimony was before his eyes -- in his house. Then, in the next chapter, the Lord is in his boat; we are reminded, as it were, that if He cannot secure us in our houses He touches us in our businesses. And in the boat the Lord secures him, He secures him on the principle of subjection. The Lord says, "Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught"; it was a direct word to him. He first begs him for his boat, but in the second instance He *directs* him. And Peter says, "at thy word I will let down the net", (@Luke 5:5). That is to say, his natural experience would have suggested to him that the letting down of the net was useless, but there is obedience to the Lord's word, "at *thy* word". Thus we have a man subject to the Lord, and now he learnt that grace was there and he fell down at the Lord's knees. The next chapter shows what the knees mean; the twelve are selected after a *night's* prayer, and thus they are here with the Lord. You can see, therefore, that He has those by Him that are under His hand; He uses them so that the greatest result accrues. But then these women are also with Him, evidences of the subjective results of grace -- there is *no room* for demon power in that environment. The twelve would represent intelligence and authority.
Ques. Why are their names given?
J.T. No doubt to indicate the features of the work of God. They had become distinguished among
{161}
the saints, for this account was written long after the occurrence. They are an evidence of the work of God. The wife of Herod's steward is there, "and many others, who ministered to him of their substance".
Rem. So that the work of God subjectively would always be distinctive.
J.T. I think so. It is diversified; the distinctions are marked off by the names.
Ques. Referring again to the announcing -- would it be consequent upon being with Him, and the preaching the outcome of being sent?
J.T. Yes; the preaching is authoritative. But we bring or announce glad tidings. For this we are to learn how to speak. Moses had to come to the point where he said he could not speak, and God accepted that, for not one of us can speak according to God unless we have discovered that naturally we have no ability. You might speak with the tongues of angels and not have love (see @1 Corinthians 13), that would not be the thing. God says to Moses, Aaron "shall be to thee instead of a mouth", (@Exodus 4:16). But He says, "I will be with *thy* mouth and with his mouth", (verse 15). We need that as well, not only the announcing, but God with the mouth, so that the words convey the thing according to God. Much is made of Paul's speaking. For instance, in @Acts 14:1 he and Barnabas entered together into the synagogue; "together" -- that is a nice touch. But then it says, they "*so spake*" that a great number believed. We are told that Paul was the chief speaker (verse 12); others had said his speech was contemptible, but the Holy Spirit says he was the chief speaker. Then the lame man heard Paul *speak* -- not preach, but speak, and Paul looked on him and saw that he had faith to be healed, and he cried with a loud voice. It is a question of speaking.
Rem. In @Galatians 1 the word 'announced' is
{162}
used five or six times. I was wondering whether it referred to the defective way in which the Galatians had taken in the gospel; they had not understood what was in the mind of Paul.
J.T. It does not seem that they had. The thought of speaking is important, because it has to do with the testimony presented; you want to present it rightly. He "so spake", it says.
Ques. Does grace carry the thought of teaching? not only power and authority, but is there also teaching?
J.T. Yes, you are thinking of Titus: "the grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men hath appeared, *teaching* us", (@Titus 2:11).
Ques. In @1 Corinthians 15 the apostle says, "I make known to you" (verse 1), "I announced to you" (verse 1), and "I delivered to you" (verse 3); what are the differences in these expressions?
J.T. In writing he wished to make clear what he had announced when with them. Then *delivering* would be, so to speak, conveying the impression -- the thing was passed over to them.
Now the Lord here speaks this parable, "a great crowd coming together, and those who were coming to him out of each city, he spoke by parable". Speaking by parable means, I think, that in the general interest the natural mind is apt to intrude, but speaking by parable excludes it; only those who have ears to hear can follow. Christianity is to be set up on that principle. The natural mind has to be shut out. That is not 'announcing' and 'shewing'. Parabolic ministry is to shut out the natural mind, however clever.
Rem. It brings to light the state of those addressed; there would be those who heard the parable, and did not come in to ask the meaning.
Ques. How does the parable take shape with us?
J.T. I think you have to be exercised that in
{163}
ministry you do not appeal to the natural mind. The Lord spoke by parable, He shut out the natural mind. Christianity was not set up in the recognition of the natural mind at all. And it is the natural mind in a religious way that He is dealing with. Parables were judicial; the Jews were rejecting the testimony of Christ, and so henceforth it was for those who had "ears to hear".
Rem. He did not begin with parables; there was a special time when He began.
J.T. Now that He has a system of His own He does. The natural mind is shut out altogether. In the previous chapter they rendered null the counsel of God, now they are being shut out effectively by parabolic ministry.
Rem. So that the kingdom of God comes not by observation.
J.T. It does not. Every other kingdom of the world has come by observation, their leaders make everything of show. But He says, "the kingdom of God is in the midst of you"; it was there in a moral way, but in power; (chapter 17:21).
Ques. Does that apply today?
J.T. Surely. If you get the principle, I think you can see the application of it. We must move on these lines. Where there is a general rejection of the truth we have to count on God to give ears to hear, and not seek to gain the public ear by appealing to the natural minds of men.
Rem. We might not have ears to hear the ministry of today.
J.T. Well, the appeal is, "He that has an ear, let him hear", (@Revelation 3).
Rem. It deals with the capacity to receive ministry.
J.T. Yes. When you are called upon to have ears to hear, it shows that God is working, and those who serve must count on this.
{164}
Ques. What is the meaning here of the seed that is sown?
J.T. The Lord says that the seed is the word of God; it brings in God as He is in Christ.
Rem. It is not fruitful in the souls of men apart from repentance.
J.T. It is that God is working. In Mark the Lord says it brings forth fruit and you do not know how; (@Mark 4:27).
Rem. There is no repentance with the first class therefore.
J.T. The fourth class only bears fruit according to God.
Ques. Would Simon (@Acts 8) illustrate that? He was not "good ground".
J.T. He did not represent the good ground. As our brother has been remarking, the word received had not been accompanied by repentance. Where the word of God is received honestly, as on the day of Pentecost, it is accompanied by repentance. Not that they said they were repentant, but the principle is there. Peter said, "Repent, and be baptised every one of you", (@Acts 2:38). The word of God coming in in Luke would, I think, be an expression of *God revealed in grace*. He is not imputing trespasses, so that my heart is subdued and assured, and what can I do in the presence of a God like that but humble myself? How can I retain my will in the presence of such grace? "To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses", (@2 Corinthians 5:19). That is the kind of thing.
Rem. So that the goodness of God, where it is known in the soul, leads to repentance.
J.T. Yes; the word would convey that to you.
Ques. What is the meaning of the 'anointing', speaking of the Lord's words, "he hath *anointed* me to preach the gospel to the poor"? (chapter 4:18).
{165}
Could it be said of the twelve afterwards that they were anointed?
J.T. They were. "The Spirit of the Lord", that is, the Spirit of Jehovah, "is upon me". That would convey at that time what God was in grace. He quotes from Isaiah. I think Isaiah is the most evangelical of the prophets, a man who learnt how to judge himself. He saw the Lord, he says, in the year that king Uzziah died, "sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory", (@Isaiah 6:1 - 3). And then he says, "Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts". Now the seraph comes in with the tongs. He did not touch the live coal -- it is *another* that bears the judgment of the fire. But he takes the coal with the tongs from off the altar, and touches Isaiah's lips. It is a question of what his lips were -- what He was saying. I suppose that is what we should all have to admit, that what we are comes out in what we say. He is now cleansed, and then he is ready to be sent. So that Isaiah is aptly quoted by the Lord in chapter 4 as representative of the evangelical spirit of Scripture, and Jehovah presented there would be God as then known in grace. That was the Spirit that was upon the Lord.
Ques. In the latter part of @Isaiah 6 it says, "Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not" (verse 9). Is that at all analogous with what you have been saying about the parable?
J.T. It is; it fits in here. He is one who has
{166}
judged himself in that sense. The idea of the tongue, or mouth, is taken into account. The Holy Spirit as coming on Christ took a bodily form. That is to say,*all* that God is, but in the character of a dove. The speaking would develop that -- the way that God has come in, in Luke -- in this holy Vessel. His speaking brings that out.
But at Pentecost the Spirit comes in in the character of cloven tongues as of fire, and they sat upon each, meaning that it is a question of speaking, and speaking by *many*. But the fire is to deal with what would be corrupting in our tongues, the speaking is to be pure: the Holy Spirit attends to all that in us.
Ques. What do you connect with the word 'cloven'?
J.T. It is 'parted'; I suppose the speaking would be universal: "we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God", (@Acts 2:11). The divine thought was that in the coming in of the Spirit the thoughts of God should not be limited to any one tongue.
Rem. Showing that the gospel is universal.
J.T. That is the thought. There was no need of that under the old economy, because it was one nation, now it is all. You remember the word in @Luke 24:47 is "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name", not to all *men*, but "to all the *nations*". The divisions under the government of God are overcome.
Ques. The twelve being *with* Him, does it suggest that in the preaching and announcing it is necessary to have sympathy?
J.T. The point is that He had those by Him whom He could use. 'Twelve' implies spiritually that I am not thinking about myself, I am simply at the will of the Lord, so that I can be used according to His wisdom. Isaiah says, "Here am I"; he was a true servant in that sense.
{167}
Ques. Would you say how the Lord manipulates today?
J.T. The principle of service is that I am available to the Lord *in relation to others*, for He has others as well. That is, He had twelve apostles, and each one was to be available to Him in relation to the others; He had work for each one of them. Hence Paul was the apostle to the gentiles, and Peter to the circumcision; there was no interference with each other's ministry. Those serving are not envious of each other; they are working under the Lord, and so they are not at cross purposes. Love for one another must underlie service. The intensification of the principle is seen in the heavenly city in the measurements, governed as they are by twelve. Nowhere is it so intensified as there, showing how perfectly the city is formed in the divine nature.
Ques. Do we have to get at the root of things in self-judgment to be effective as with Peter and Isaiah?
J.T. That is a feature which must mark those who serve. You see in the history of Peter how the Lord brings about the twelve. They must go to the root of things. Peter says, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord"; but he fell down at His knees, that is the thing.
Rem. That would have to be maintained.
J.T. Indeed! See how Barnabas and Saul worked together beautifully, and yet in Barnabas¬ strongest point he broke down in the end. The strongest point was, I think, that he unjealously brought Saul to Antioch, yet that is the point where he broke down, for he afterwards departed with Mark, allowing natural feeling to influence him.
Ques. Would the ministering to Him of their substance imply support of the testimony?
J.T. Quite so. You see in the early part of the Acts how each held what he had as not his own. And it comes to light that Barnabas had lands, which
{168}
he sold, and laid the money at the apostles¬ feet; and then at Antioch you get those who were "well off", (@Acts 11:29) determined to send to the poor saints, which also they did. That is the way of ministering to the Lord of our substance.
Ques. Has the sowing something in view for God?
J.T. It has. What comes out here is more the result for Him. Bringing forth fruit with patience marks the good ground. It is noticeable that in both Matthew and Mark you have a graded result, here you have a hundredfold, that is, the full result. But when you come to the explanation of the parable He does not say a 'hundredfold', but "with patience". Patience is one great feature with God, and Luke would bring us to it; you are bearing fruit with patience. I think God would bring us into accord with His thought -- the patience of God -- how He has borne with men all these centuries. Then what follows on that is light; and then what follows on that is that I *have* things "whosoever has, to him shall be given". That is what I think is going on *now*, those who have are getting more, and those who have not, what they seem to have is being taken from them. Light comes in after the bearing of fruit with patience. Verse 14 says that some seed fell among thorns; "these are they who having heard go away and are choked under cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection". No doubt such have a place for a time, but they bring no fruit to perfection. Those that fall on good ground are those that hear the word and keep it, and bring forth fruit to perfection -- with patience. And then, what is consequent upon that is light. It says, "No one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch, but sets it on a lampstand, that they who enter in may see the light". That is an additional thought -- one bearing fruit has light, and you want to see to it that
{169}
every one who enters in sees that light. You are looking for people to enter in.
Ques. Is that the Philippian position, "among whom ye appear as lights in the world"? (chapter 2:15).
J.T. Here it is a question of *entering in*; if God is working, people will be entering in. For those who seek to be in fellowship with God's people your desire is that they should see the light. You are not covering it. The point is that it should be seen by those who enter in.
Rem. The product of the sowing.
J.T. There is such a thing as entering in, and in entering in they see the light. But the word here is to see to it that it is not hidden. The fact that we *have* the light is not everything, you want the people who are entering in to *see* it. Why should they enter in? There is something there they do not find anywhere else; but the word here is to see to it that it is not hidden.
Rem. "Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it", (@Colossians 4:17).
Ques. What exactly is the entering in?
J.T. Well, there is something to enter into. You see, if you take the earlier verses -- the Lord, and the twelve, and those holy women -- there is something there to enter into, a wonderful circle indeed. What interests were there! But the Lord emphasises here that in coming in they should see the light; it should not be obscured by any selfish consideration. The lighted lamp should be set on a lampstand, not covered by a vessel or put under a bed.
Rem. So that the bringing forth of fruit with patience is the maintenance of the light.
J.T. But there might be neglect, such as being too much engrossed in business and household affairs, and the light thus become obscured.
Ques. Would the fruit be for God?
{170}
J.T. Quite so; but the light is the other side, it is for men.
Ques. Is it entering into the kingdom of God?
J.T. No doubt. You get in the beginning of the chapter Christ, and the twelve, and those women -- what an order of things that was!
Rem. A circle of blessed interests, as you said.
J.T. Yes, indeed! We see these women ministering to the Lord in unselfishness. Mary Magdalene -- think of what she would be to Christ! And what an influence in the circle! Then Peter and John, how they would get on together! Well, that indicates what there is in the fellowship of God's Son. We want to be sure that we are not obscuring the light.
Rem. There is fruit in perfection inside.
J.T. Yes. So that, if people come in, they come in to this. It is not only a place of light, but there are things going on there that reflect what is in heaven. If one entered into heaven, what would he see? Not only light, but persons; he would see them in their blessed relations to one another. Normally there is a representation of this in the assembly.
Then we have here, "there is nothing hid which shall not become manifest, nor secret which shall not be known". That is another thing that is very important -- hidden things come to light. Where the Holy Spirit is operating everything comes to light; the patient man knows that and he waits on God. He says, "there is nothing hid which shall not become manifest". That is very sweeping and necessary in our fellowship. This is going on -- the exposure of every dark thing, every secret thing.
Rem. The heavenly city is marked by transparency.
{171}
NEARNESS TO CHRIST AND PUBLIC SERVICE (3)
@Luke 8:22 - 56
J.T. It is proposed to read the chapters beginning with this one and ending with part of chapter 11 at these meetings, so that we may see how -- the new order of things being introduced, seen in the beginning of this chapter -- the assembly in its local setting is reached. We noticed this morning that the Lord went through the country city by city and village by village preaching and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; that having taken place, it says 'afterward', referring to what had gone before, particularly chapter 7. The Lord is no longer ministering in an individual way. The twelve are said to be with Him and certain women who ministered to Him of their substance; the woman in chapter 7, who is said to have loved much, representing the desired result in the preaching and announcing. But for this there must be sowing, and so the Lord introduced the parable of the sower. We noticed that the fruit on good ground is borne with *patience*; consequent on that we have a lamp which is to be set so as to give light to all that come in. It is assumed that some would come in. Following all this, in verses 19 - 21 we have the brethren, those whom the Lord regards as in relationship with Him, as His mother and His brethren; those who "hear the word of God and do it".
H.H. That would be a new generation.
J.T. Quite so. You have more now than one lover of Christ. The woman loved much because she was forgiven much, but now you have a generation in relation to Christ marked off as hearing the word of God and doing it, a generation that would be morally
{172}
after God. I think these early verses, therefore, introduce a set of principles which, taken together, may enter into the ship in which He crosses the sea with them.
Ques. Would these be the product of the seed sown in the good ground?
J.T. Yes; they hear the word of God and do it.
J.B. You say these principles enter into the idea of the ship; what is the idea of it?
J.T. I think the principles that *go through*, taken together -- what the Lord had set out. "He entered", it says, "into a ship, himself and his disciples; and he said to them, Let us pass over to the other side of the lake; and they set off from shore". The initiative was His; His disciples were with Him in it.
J.B. That is helpful, but could you open it out a little more?
J.T. I think the test was as to whether the ship was staunch enough to go through. The Lord falls asleep; it says, "as *they* sailed, he fell asleep" -- *they* were doing the thing now. He had entered into the ship with them and given direction to move; then, as they sailed, He fell asleep. Therefore they are tested, not only as to whether He could save them even if the ship were sunk, but whether He would have entered into a ship unable to go through.
Ques. Do you mean that the thought of the ship embodies the principles that you have spoken of, so that the disciples, if they maintained these principles, would go through?
J.T. That is it. If they had understood the principles they would have had no anxiety even if He went to sleep, for if He went to sleep He assumed that all was well, He had no uncertainty as to what would happen. He knew the ship would go through.
Ques. Would the ship be something akin to the fellowship of God's Son, which He inaugurated?
J.T. Quite so, the principles hold. In chapter 6
{173}
you have the bottles -- the wine in good vessels. There are principles laid down in chapter 6, I think, but here you have the ship -- another idea. There it is a question of the preservation of the wine -- the Spirit of God; here it is a question of going through, whether you can go through to the other side of the lake.
Rem. To go through, we need to be sure that we are standing by divine principles.
J.T. If the Lord entered into a ship, it was His own choice; He did not ask the disciples to provide it. Earlier He had asked Peter for the loan of his ship, but here He entered into a ship Himself. They sailed under His direction, but *they* do it, and now He sleeps, that was the test -- it was to bring out what He could be for them in such circumstances. He entered into the ship knowingly.
Rem. It looks as though they were not in the good of the kingdom; they were not prepared for a sudden squall.
Rem. Divine principles are calculated to take them through.
J.T. Especially as the Lord is in them. It does not say here that the ship belonged to anyone; in chapter 5 it does; but He entered into it. They might be sure He foresaw all the contingencies of such a voyage. He was not ignorant of the conditions on this lake.
Ques. Would "the other side" be till the time of testing is over?
J.T. I think so. "The other side of the *lake*" -- the whole thing is taken into account. He knew the lake well.
H.H. Do you think this would have particular reference to Paul's teaching? Would Luke have that in mind in setting things out in this way? So that the new order of things that Paul ministered would be in regard to that which is imperishable.
{174}
J.T. I think what was introduced at Pentecost proved itself quite staunch; it was quite capable of meeting a storm. But no doubt Luke has Paul in view.
Ques. Do we get the principles that carry us through in 2 Timothy -- righteousness, faith, love, peace?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Why do you emphasise "the lake"?
J.T. "The other side of the lake", the Lord says; it is an area well known, and exposed to such things as this -- these sudden attacks. The Lord knew that; we must not assume for a moment that He did not know; the disciples assumed that He may not have known or thought of the matter.
Ques. Could the ship go down?
J.T. I should think not if the Lord were in it! He entered into it with His disciples, and directed them to pass over.
H.D'A.C. They had not taken the initiative, or they might have blamed themselves; *He* did it.
Ques. The ship is still sailing, is it not?
J.T. That is another matter. We are here at the initial thought of the thing. There is no break-up of the ship yet; in Paul's day there was a break-up of the ship; that supposes unfaithfulness in those responsible -- another side of the truth. Here we are dealing with the ship into which the Lord entered, and in which He directed the disciples to pass over to the other side of the lake. From this point of view there can be no disaster.
Rem. As holding by the principles, the Lord is there, and we get through.
J.T. That is right. They sailed, and if they sail, that means there were equipments. They were not rowing, they sail -- the equipments were there.
H.D'A.C. I suppose it was an attempt of Satan to drown the Lord.
{175}
J.T. It was; but such an attempt as the Lord would expect. It was no surprise to Him; we can never assume any surprises in regard to the Lord. The enemy would come in, but He is aware of that beforehand.
Rem. The enemy can never destroy or alter divine principles.
J.T. No; they are indestructible.
H.H. He would always make an attack on new features.
J.T. Yes; but what is of God cannot be overthrown.
H.H. I wondered whether it would illustrate how we often feel that though our principles are all right, we get into a great deal of distress through not counting on the Lord; for principles in themselves would not suffice without Him.
J.T. No. "As they sailed" -- the ship was in motion, it was going, and then He went to sleep. As holding to the principles only, we shall not be with Him. But we shall be tested as to whether we can rely on Him.
Ques. Is the "squall of wind" a sudden attack of the enemy on some principle?
J.T. It was the whole position here, as in @Acts 5:3, "why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit?" That was an effort of Satan to upset the whole testimony. It was a question of the presence of the Spirit. Whatever God is putting forward is what Satan will attack.
Ques. Why does it say "*they* were filled with water", not 'the ship'?
J.T. It was in their minds, I suppose -- they were filled with it. Literally, it reads, "they were filled".
Ques. Have we anything to correspond with that in the present day?
J.T. Satan is always attacking. The thing is to hold to the principles, and to see that the Lord has
{176}
committed Himself to them; they are His own and He has committed Himself to them. We must never assume that anything is lacking. Moses said to God, "Have I conceived all this people ... that thou sayest to me, Carry them?" It was as much as to say that God had not foreseen all the contingencies. Well, God tells him to select seventy others, and He says, "I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them", (@Numbers 11:12,16,17). There is no extra power provided, but there is instrumentality. So when we pray, it is not for increased power, but that what we have should be effective: "according to the power that *worketh in us*", (@Ephesians 3:20).
Ques. Was it not faith that was lacking?
J.T. Yes, faith in what existed; faith in what was actually here. The principles in themselves have no power in them; it is the principles laid hold of in the hearts of the saints; that is what really matters. Of course, the power really lies in the presence of the Spirit in us.
H.D'A.C. How gracious of the Lord to say to His disciples, "Let *us*" bringing them into a bond with Himself in that way. That 'us' could not be drowned. Do we not often find in our localities that we have these principles all right, but the difficulty comes in with the sailing, with the use we make of them and how we handle them, and things are often hindered by a sudden squall?
Ques. Does it depend on faith in the presence of the Lord?
J.T. Exactly. He had been working with them, it was for them now to put into action what they had learned, but He takes the initiative and sets them going. It was well that it could be said of them, "they sailed" -- they sailed and He fell asleep.
But now they get to the land, and you have Satan in another form, not as acting on the winds or the
{177}
sea, but a man out of the city, possessed with demons, met the Lord. I think that this section of the chapter introduces you to potential material for the assembly, that is to say, the man, and the woman and the child. If we keep these in view, I think we shall see how the minister will be put to the test. The principles the Lord brought in are put to the test in the storm, and they come through; He is better known consequently. But now you see what the minister has to contend with. A man meets the Lord out of the city; the service of the gospel has to do with concentrated evil. We have to do with concentrated evil, and this is represented in the man who comes out of the city. It is said of him that he "had demons a long time, and put on no clothes, and did not abide in a house, but in the tombs".
Ques. What difference would there be between this man and the woman in chapter 7, for she is spoken of as "a woman in the city", here it is "a ... man out of the city"?
J.T. I think she was delivered where the sin was -- completely delivered where it was. She was a woman of the city, she would be well known, and known as a sinner -- that was her reputation; but a change had come about, she loved Christ. This man is "out of" the city; he is a product of it; he represents the power of wickedness in the cities, extending beyond their limits -- a very solemn thing. For we have to make up our minds, if we are to serve in the gospel, that these are the things to be contended with; concentrated evil, but evil that extends -- the man came "out of the city". But as delivered from the power of Satan he becomes material for the assembly. That is the idea, the composition of the assembly. It is the male side -- he is sitting, clothed and in his *right mind* at the feet of the Lord. That is the element the Lord would use in the way of intelligence and order. Then you have the woman. The child is
{178}
mentioned first, but she comes in last rightly. The woman is the second component part of the assembly, then there is the child, not a babe, but a child of twelve years old. These are what I should regard as the component parts of an assembly. But we must have them as passed through the hands of Christ; there is a complete change in every one of them as passing through His hands.
Ques. Why do you make a distinction between a child and a girl of twelve?
J.T. I think this chapter contemplates the family order. She is not called 'damsel', but 'child'. The man is the intelligence; the woman is an inner state of *transparency* (she tells *all the truth*), and the child is young, fresh life. If you have these features, you have the assembly.
You have intelligence, you have restfulness. There had been secretiveness with the woman, her trouble was a long one, it had lasted all the life of Jairus¬ daughter; it was a secret matter, and she would have it healed secretly; but things must be open in the assembly of God, they must be transparent. The man would speak of a sound mind, a balanced mind. This is just one side of the assembly; there is intelligence, order, stability and restfulness -- that, I think, is represented in the man.
H.D'A.C. And there would be learning from Jesus, sitting at His feet.
J.T. Quite so. Instead of learning the defiling sophistication of the city, you have him sitting at the Lord's feet.
F.W.W. There should be the freshness of a child in the man and the woman.
J.T. Yes. I understand that the three represent three *features that should mark us all*.
Rem. A balanced mind is of very great value in the things of God.
H.H. I thought what you said about the woman
{179}
seeking to be healed secretly is an exercise we sometimes have to face in our local meetings. Things have got to come out, they cannot be dealt with secretly.
J.T. It is so, indeed. Not that you would cast any aspersion on the sisters, but the woman's side is taken up, I think, to represent secretiveness, the disposition to hide. (See @Genesis 31:34; @Matthew 13:33.) In our chapter the woman would have the healing done secretly, but the Lord would not have it that way. He says, "Some one has touched me"; it was the touch of faith, true enough, but it was a *secret* touch, and the Lord would have things open. So that "she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately"; she told Him all the truth.
Rem. The Lord wanted His portion from her heart.
J.T. And He was thinking of her gain, too. She would be a very different sister afterwards. If God is working with us, we need not fear having the whole thing out.
F.W.W. The man was sent back for testimony.
J.T. He wished to be with Him, but the Lord says, "Return to thine house and relate how great things God has done for thee". He represents the element in the assembly that can be trusted.
S.L. Right-minded brothers conferring would lead to all speaking the same thing.
J.T. That shows the wisdom in having meetings for brethren to come together in a local way and take counsel, for in them you arrive at a right mind, the mind of the Lord; you are able to look at things from every point of view.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the clothing?
J.T. It would allude to dignity, and also decency. "Let all things be done decently and in order". A
{180}
man clothed, who had been accustomed to nakedness, would show that he had come to a right sense of things, and he would exhibit it in himself; all his demeanour and circumstances would indicate that he had a right sense of things.
Ques. You do not suggest that the man in the assembly is to have alone the prerogative of a sound mind?
J.T. We are speaking of *features* of the assembly; it is no question of individuals, but of all. The first is intelligence and balance and decency, comeliness and public order -- such an one is trustworthy. This man wanted to be with the Lord, but He says, "Return to thine house". That is necessary, or you could not have the public features; there would not be trustworthiness. Then the next thing is the feature of transparency, the opposite of secretiveness. The man, we are told, was possessed of demons "a long time"; but we are given the number of years in which the woman suffered; it was a known period to herself. I suppose the woman's case is alluded to in @Romans 7 -- what do you say?
H.D'A.C. Very good.
Rem. It would appear, from what you are saying, that these three principles must be existent in connection with the local company before there can be building up, for it is not till these are settled that the food question comes into view.
J.T. It is in the child that you have the idea of food presented, because that is what is to be sustained, things are to be sustained in freshness. I believe the teaching connected with her carries the other two with it.
H.D'A.C. In the power of Christ to heal them you would have the teaching of @Romans 8.
J.T. The 'virtue' here would be the Spirit, as seen in @Romans 8.
Ques. With regard to the woman in chapter 7,
{181}
her faith is in connection with salvation, but in this chapter the woman's faith is in regard to healing, is it not?
J.T. Yes, it was a question of bodily condition.
Ques. Does everything being exposed call attention to Christ personally, as the woman said in @John 4, "a man, which told me all things that ever I did"?
J.T. Quite so, she had everything exposed to herself; the exposure is to herself, "Come, see a man, which told *me*". That is an important thing, to have the thing brought home to oneself. But this woman did not need that, the thing had been brought home to her for twelve years -- her actual state. But she was not going to let it be known that she was healed by touching the hem of His garment. The Lord would not have that. If she had kept that secret, she would also want to keep other things secret that should be made known. Thus she would begin her spiritual history with a serious defect.
Rem. It is very detrimental to the assembly that things should be kept secret.
J.T. If you have things concealed, you will not be fit for standing on the sea of *glass*. It is not that *everything* must be told, for there are things that are rightly concealed. "A prudent man concealeth knowledge", (@Proverbs 12:23).
Rem. Things will come out, anyway.
J.T. Yes. How much better to let them come out at once. Then He owns her as *daughter*; there is a family touch, she is a daughter. Henceforth she will not be marked by a dark part.
Ques. Would this include the confessing of our faults one to another?
J.T. I think it would. It is a great matter to have things dealt with -- brought into the light. There are things that need not be made public, but the principle of transparency is very important.
Ques. Is not this rather more than the confession
{182}
of her faults? It is the confession of the thing, and how she got healed of it, and to whom she owed the healing.
J.T. That is it. "All denying, Peter and those with him said, Master, the crowds close thee in and press upon thee, and sayest thou, Who has touched me? And Jesus said, Someone has touched me, for I have known that power has gone out from me". That was an extraordinary situation! The Lord knew that power had gone out, yet the disciples were questioning Him. You see the position the Lord is placed in through this. We do not want to place the Lord in a false position. To clear up the position everything hinged on this woman's confession. You often see a situation like that arise, where everything hinges on one person making a statement or a confession. Here the Lord was under a cloud even with His disciples, and so the matter had to be cleared up; the Lord insists that it should, and the matter was cleared up by the woman's confession. It says, "the woman, seeing that she was not hid" -- she was made to feel that the thing must come out.
Ques. Do you not think that Paul was in the spirit of the woman when he made confession that he was "a blasphemer and persecutor, and an insolent overbearing man", (@1 Timothy 1:13)? Does he not make a confession that is good for thousands?
J.T. Covering what is before us, @Romans 7 is his confession. Very few of us are prepared to confess the terrible things that go on within us.
Ques. Why is there this tendency to keep things secret?
Rem. "The fear of man bringeth a snare", (@Proverbs 29:25).
J.T. Quite so, we are afraid. The woman was afraid. It is innate in us, from this point of view, to conceal a thing.
{183}
Rem. Courage comes with knowing what was done in her.
J.T. @Romans 7:24,25 is the statement of a man who is out of the experience depicted. I believe a multitude of christians are afraid to confess their inward difficulties, for the reason that they have not seen the way out. "Who shall deliver me? ... I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord"; you are brought into touch with a Person who becomes your Deliverer. This chapter speaks of touching the hem of *His garment*, but the Lord says, "Who touched *me*?" For deliverance the believer comes into contact with Himself.
Rem. So in @Romans 7 it is a question not only of deliverance, but of the Deliverer.
J.T. You come to know the Lord. "There is then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus ... God, having sent his own Son", (@Romans 8:1,3). There the heart is taken up with Christ; it is not simply God sending His Son, but His *own* Son; the heart is thus appealed to. God sending Him "in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh", (verse 3). As you are able to say that, you are not afraid to disclose what you have experienced.
Ques. Would there not be a link formed with the company now?
J.T. Yes; so she is now a daughter. "Be of good courage, daughter; thy faith has healed thee; go in peace". Now you are ennobled; instead of losing ground you have gained ground in being open about it. Think of the One who called her 'daughter', for it is not here a daughter of Abraham, as in chapter 13:16, but the *Lord* calls her 'daughter'. Think what a sister this woman would be in after years!
Rem. The Lord doubtless knew, but it was to bring the thing out in her.
{184}
Rem. We suffer largely from not being ennobled in this manner.
J.T. I think we do, for the saints are brought together on the ground of ennoblement; we are not gathered on the ground of the littleness of the flesh, but as having received the Spirit of God. Romans prepares for Corinthians.
Rem. It is the Lord's own word here.
J.T. Yes. If the Lord calls this woman 'daughter', why need she mind if others call her anything else? Then He says, "Go in peace"; that is another word to be noticed. When the Lord says, 'Go', I think it means He has confidence in her, she is to be trusted.
Ques. Does the Lord in that way bring her into the circle He speaks of as "my mother and my brethren"?
J.T. I think so; only 'daughter' is a distinct family touch.
Ques. What do you understand by the Lord realising that power had gone out from Him?
J.T. I think it shows how conscious He is of what goes on spiritually. Every bit of power that goes out to you and to me, the Lord is quite cognisant of it, and He would have it disclosed, He would have it public.
Rem. The great difficulty in a local assembly is often the lack of transparency which would bring about healing.
Ques. Are you speaking of this question of transparency individually or collectively, or both?
J.T. It is a feature of the company; but of course the company is formed of individuals.
Rem. So that, until everything is out, there can be no healing amongst the brethren.
J.T. Now what you see here is that "while he was yet speaking" there came some one from the
{185}
ruler of the synagogue's house, saying, "Thy daughter is dead; do not trouble the teacher". Now we are linked on with the following case.
Rem. So, while the question of freshness is raised first, it is solved after the inward question as seen in the woman has been solved.
J.T. You can understand that. The source of freshness is introduced in @Romans 5 -- the love of God shed abroad in the heart -- but the state ensuring the continuance of it is not seen till chapter 8.
H.H. It is rather remarkable that, in connection with Marah, the word was, "I am Jehovah who healeth thee", (@Exodus 15:26). Does not that fit in with this?
J.T. Yes. In the gift of the Spirit. God has freshness in view, but before that freshness can be maintained permanently, the sin question has to be dealt with -- not sins, but sin -- the thing working within us. @Romans 7 is the process; chapter 8 the result.
Rem. And it is only solved by virtue from Him.
J.T. That means the Spirit. But now, the little girl becomes extremely interesting, because it is a question of young, fresh life. He said, "Do not weep, for she has not died, but sleeps. And they derided him". He entered into the house, it says, with Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child. When we come to this case, it is not only a question of the Spirit, but of what is *spiritual*. I think the case of the woman involves the Spirit, the virtue involves the Spirit coming into the believer from Christ; but the girl's case is not only that but what is spiritual. I refer to those whom the Lord would have in the house, having put others out. The Corinthians were not spiritual; they had the Spirit, but they were not spiritual. The Galatians, too, had the Spirit, but they were not spiritual. "Ye which are spiritual", the apostle says; (@Galatians 6:1).
{186}
It is not simply that virtue has come out to us for our relief, but that we are to become spiritual. So He puts everybody out, and suffers no one to go in save Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child. Those put out were persons who would act on the flesh. Colossians warns against those who would introduce philosophy and vain deceit and ceremonialism. All that has to be put out, it is a question of those who are living spiritually. The child is raised up into a spiritual environment. The Lord was there, and Peter and John and James, and the father of the child and the mother. She was raised up into *that* environment.
Ques. What does 'spiritual' mean?
J.T. It is not only that I have the Spirit, but my mind and affections are brought under the influence of the Spirit.
Rem. These features would mark the child.
J.T. Yes; it is the spiritual state in the saints that is to be nourished. Paul deplored that he could not minister to the Corinthians as spiritual, but he did to the Ephesians; it is the spiritual side that is introduced at Ephesus.
Ques. How could anyone become spiritual?
J.T. I think you begin by recognising the Spirit, on the ground of His having come to us by the death of Christ, and you carry that out in everyday life; having the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, and so you live. That is the negative side; He also acts on our minds and hearts, forming after Christ in intelligence, affection, etc.
Ques. Does transparency come in there?
J.T. Quite so. The virtue that has come out of Christ becomes power in the soul, and by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body and live. This lays the basis for the ministry in Colossians and Ephesians.
{187}
Ques. Does not receiving the Spirit from Christ put us immediately on the line of the Spirit's energy?
J.T. Yes; and it could be only through His death.
H.D'A.C. There must be no carnality; so the apostle in opening up the truth of the Spirit says, "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit", (@Galatians 5:25). If we walk in the Spirit we shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh. So the great thing is, if anything happens to cause the conscience to act, you judge it, it is the flesh, but then you get back immediately to the Spirit; you cannot be right except in the Spirit.
J.T. "For we, by the Spirit, on the principle of faith, await the hope of righteousness" (verse 5). Everything in a practical sense is by the Spirit.
G.S.G. The apostle says in @1 Corinthians 2:4 that his speech was "not with enticing words of man's wisdom", but he brought before them Christ, and Him crucified, so that they might have experience of the demonstration of the Spirit. Would not our being occupied with Christ personally produce a state that is favourable to the Spirit working in us?
J.T. Yes; but you must have clearly in your soul the judicial basis of all, and that is, that "God having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh", (@Romans 8:3).
Rem. The woman touched Him, and then the issue was staunched.
J.T. Yes. Then as to Jairus¬ daughter, the Lord clears the ground of all that is unspiritual. People were there playing the flute, and making a tumult and weeping, all to stultify the sense of death. There must be the clearance of all fleshly elements; we are entitled to put them all out, for God has put them out judicially in the death of Christ, He has shown His abhorrence of them there
{188}
and we are entitled to condemn them. But you retain the spiritual elements -- Peter and John and James, and the father and the mother of the child. The father and mother refer to responsibility -- what I am responsibly. Then the Lord addresses the child: "he, having turned them all out, and taking hold of her hand, cried saying, Child, arise". Now you have her formally named by the Lord; she is brought into life with that designation. The woman is called, 'daughter'; she is called 'child', that is to say, it is a spiritual element that is under designation -- youthfulness. He is identified with her (He takes her hand), and He *cries* -- it is very urgent.
Ques. Would that verse, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death" (@Romans 8:2), apply here?
J.T. Yes. So it is not that she was raised up, but "her spirit *returned*", and then *she* rose up. The son of the woman of Zarephath (@1 Kings 17) had a severe illness, that is to say, it produced feelings and patience; it was a severe illness, so that his life gradually ebbed out of him -- the prophet correspondingly went through a severe exercise, and through this the boy's soul came back again. So here, the Lord asserted that she had not died but fallen asleep. It is resuscitation rather than resurrection.
Ques. Is that viewing it in its setting, because of what had occurred in regard to the woman? She was free through the Lord's death; but He could say of this child, "she is not dead, but sleepeth".
J.T. That is right, it is another side of the truth being developed -- that you are brought to life in a spiritual sense, as it says in @Romans 8:10, "the Spirit is life", and "the mind of the Spirit life and peace", (8:6). It is not here a question of resurrection exactly, but of the spirit coming again. It is more @Romans 8 than Colossians. So it says, "her spirit returned, and
{189}
immediately she rose up"; there was power in herself, *she* rose up; and then it says, "he commanded something to eat to be given to her"; *that* life is to be sustained.
Rem. In the one case the woman touches the Lord Jesus, and in the other the Lord Jesus takes the child by the hand.
J.T. Yes, that is right; showing, in the latter case, that He links on with you now.
H.D'A.C. Not only did He say, "Child, arise", but He called; there was a voice, the voice that wakes the dead. We have all heard His voice. It was a distinct voice, which reached the dead.
F.S. Why were they to tell no one what had happened?
J.T. This is not for publication. "Our life is hid with Christ in God"; it is what is private in family relations. There is that which is hidden. It leads on to "the mystery ... in which are *hid* all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge", (@Colossians 2:3).
Rem. The injunction not to tell was only for the time being, for the time came when Luke wrote about it.
J.T. It represents a principle. What is spiritual is not to be brought down to the range of the natural mind of man. By it the Lord was *derided*.
{190}
"THE LORD'S COMMANDMENT"
@Matthew 28:1 - 10, 20 (first clause); @1 Timothy 6:13 - 16
I have in mind, in reading these scriptures, to dwell upon the idea of *commandment*. As you will observe, in the last scripture read, the injunction is in regard to "the commandment". The commandment has peculiar application now, especially as the keeping of it evidences love for Christ. However much we may speak of our love for Christ, we can only show it by keeping His commandments. A non-lover of Christ, I need not say, is unthinkable in the assembly, viewed in its proper relations and material. The apostle says, "If any one love not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha", (@1 Corinthians 16:22). He makes much of this feature in writing to the Corinthians, that is, of love to Christ; he says that a spiritual man or a prophet would prove himself by recognising the things that he wrote as the Lord's commandment (chapter 14:37) that is to say, he emphasises the idea of divine commandment coming *by am accredited representative*. The apostle asserts that he was accredited, no one can represent God save as accredited in some way, so he says, "The signs indeed of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance, signs, and wonders, and works of power", (@2 Corinthians 12:12).
In this first scripture the angel says to the women, "I have told you". There is a good deal of latitudinarianism abroad among the people of God; that is to say, your view is as good as mine, and mine is as good as yours; this principle sets aside the idea of accredited representation. God has never left Himself without this, so that we may be sure (and we shall be sure, if spiritual) as to the Lord's commandment. The angel, here in Matthew, represents accredited
{191}
divine representation. He says, The Lord is *not here*. We need divinely accredited representation if the Lord be not here. Thus the angel speaks as such; he says, "Behold, *I* have told you". As we look at the description given we cannot doubt his authority.
This scripture, as we should expect, is in full accord with this gospel, for it is the gospel that presents to us the Son of David. You will all remember the opening verse, "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David". It is therefore the gospel in which you may look for divine authority. How much this element is needed among the saints of God! And so, as the genealogy is pursued by the Spirit, as David is reached, it is the king -- "Jesse begat David *the king*". He was pre-eminently the king, and "the word of a king is power", (@Ecclesiastes 8:4). It is also said, "A king sitting on the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes", (@Proverbs 20:8). So that we may look in this gospel for authority, but authority first of all in One who, as Son of David, has *moral power* as well as power by divine right; these two things must go together. There is the doctrine of the divine right of kings, but then that right can only be taken up by one who is morally fitted for it, and that One is the Son of David.
Moral power is of immense importance. Solomon, who typifies Christ, is presented to us in the divine narrative as a man of great wisdom and intelligence, and withal of compassion; a man who could bring to light, in his wisdom, the mother of the child (@1 Kings 3). And yet he was then but a young man; this may remind young brothers and sisters that moral power is not to be regarded as the peculiar possession of older ones. It is within the reach of the youngest, for David says of Solomon that, as coming to the throne, he was "young and tender" (@1 Chronicles 29:1), but nevertheless he had such wisdom as to bring to light which of the two claimants was
{192}
the mother of the child. Such discernment, in a spiritual sense, is an important element in the house of God. It is required if we are to discern the maternal instincts that are proper to the assembly.
But then his knowledge was universal; we are told that he "spoke of the trees, from the cedar-tree that is on Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of cattle, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fishes", (@1 Kings 4:33). Besides that, he was well versed in moral things. The book of Ecclesiastes shows the depth of his penetration into moral things, good and bad. There is nothing left behind by him in that field, in human conditions "under the sun" he has left nothing to be told. "What can the man do", he says, "that cometh after the king?" (@Ecclesiastes 2:12).
And then as to *marital* affairs, we see in Solomon a man capable of a most remarkable composition, showing that there was there an understanding of holy love. His song, which is called, "The song of songs, which is Solomon's", treats of holy love; no one can read it aright or profitably, save as he reads it from that point of view. He had also great discernment as to *family* affairs. The book of Proverbs is from the son of David. Every young man and young woman should read that book from the standpoint that the writer knew parental love. Proverbs speaks of parental affection and the due response in children; you have in it the wisdom of the son of David, as entering into all family relationships -- and how entangled they are! The family idea is becoming lost in this world. In the East, indeed, it hardly ever had a footing; in the Western world it had a certain place, and hence, as I apprehend, this section of the world was selected in the wisdom of God for the development of the assembly. East of Palestine the gospel and the mystery made little or no headway. In regard to marriage, the Lord goes back to the
{193}
*beginning*; (@Matthew 19:8). Genesis is quoted in @Ephesians 5:31 in the same connection. The saints need to be reminded of that wisdom that preserves intact family relationships. We cannot be in the assembly according to God, save as our houses are ordered according to Him. But I speak particularly of the spiritual family, and Proverbs is intended to maintain us in that relation. It is intended to maintain the links between us and the Father and the Son, and with each other as brethren.
Thus, dear brethren, you can see from these three books, and what I have cited from 1 Kings, how morally qualified the son of David was to rule. And hence the setting of Matthew's gospel, and especially this chapter. It is to enforce the idea of rule and of commandment coming to us through accredited representatives; so that we may have no question in our minds as to its being of God. "Let him recognise", says the apostle, "the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", (@1 Corinthians 14:37). And when we come to commandment thus given we are on the surest footing. Acting on it we are perfectly certain of our position. As one said, 'Here I stand, I can do no other'. It is a fine moment in the history of a young christian when he reaches the sure footing of "the Lord's commandment". It sets aside man's will, what *he* would have -- it is the *Lord's* commandment.
Now these women, Mary Magdalene and the other, came to see the sepulchre. They needed adjustment. There was not so much in coming to see the *sepulchre*, and yet others had not come. There was no rush that morning, and yet it was the most glorious of mornings. Never a morning like it in the history of time! There was no stir, but these two women came. How devoted and privileged they were! "Mary Magdalene and the other Mary". They came to see the sepulchre, we are told, and then we have the description
{194}
of the accredited representative -- the angel. Is there anyone here unbelieving enough to assume that God has left Himself without an accredited witness in this world? He has not. There is such a thing in this world as accredited witness, and that is the point here. "An angel of the Lord", we are told, had descended from heaven. He descended from *heaven*. You see, Matthew always sets heaven over against Jerusalem. For him heaven had superseded Jerusalem, and heaven was asserting itself in the most positive and unmistakable manner; as later, on the day of Pentecost, there was heard "a sound from heaven" (@Acts 2:2) as of a rushing mighty wind. There also heaven was asserting itself. And so here, an angel had descended from heaven, and there had been a great earthquake; the angel had rolled away the stone and sat upon it, and his countenance was like lightning and the keepers were like dead men for fear. Can there be any question as to this angel being accredited?
And so he says to the women, "Fear not *ye*". There is nothing to fear from an accredited witness from heaven, if we love the Lord. The Corinthians were losing sight of Paul; they were discrediting him indeed. A sorrowful situation, but he says, "examine your own selves if ye be in the faith", (@2 Corinthians 13:5). They were an evidence of his apostleship. We very readily slip into discrediting what God accredits. It is a most serious matter to be at issue with God in this way. That is what the Corinthians were doing, and yet they were christians. But the angel says to the women, "Fear not ye" -- they loved the Lord. The lovers of Christ have no fear in regard to divine representation, even in the sense in which it appears in a king, or a president, or a policeman; but I am now dwelling on one qualified to represent God directly -- an angel come down from heaven -- the lovers of Christ have nothing to fear from him. We
{195}
have nothing to fear from anything that God establishes or supports -- it is all for us. As regards angels, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" (@Hebrews 1:14). The angel says, "Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one".
And then he says, "He is not here". And I say to you tonight, in the same sense, The Lord is not here. The position is that the Lord is not here, He is in heaven; He is risen and gone into heaven. He is here in the sense of representation, and woe be to him who sets that aside, that is, the principle that the Lord is here in a representative way. The point is, "He is not here"; but the angel was there, and he was there armed with divine credentials. Who could deny it? If you had asked those keepers, could they deny it? They could only do so by *lying*, which they did. There are those who lie to set aside this great principle of the resurrection, and accredited representation. The angel further says, "Come, see the place where the Lord lay" -- they are invited to do that. It was "the *Lord*", not 'Jesus' there. Then he says, "go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him"; it is a question of commandment, he says, "*I* have told you". Can anyone here say that such a word has not come to him? "Behold, I have told you", he says.
Now I want you to see the effect of this. They were "not disobedient to the heavenly vision", as Paul says of himself later; (@Acts 26:19). They ran, it says, to tell His disciples with "fear and great joy". Not that there was really occasion for fear, he told them there was not; but in view of what we are it is a very wholesome combination. Where were they going? They were running to the disciples to tell them. Happy is he today who is in such an employ! There are many who are fitted for it, thank
{196}
God, under commandment! The idea of being a free-lance is foreign to Scripture. There are many such. "I go a-fishing", says Peter (@John 21:3); he is doing what *he* wishes to do. Poor man! How many there are like him! The apostle Paul, on the contrary, says, "What shall I do, Lord?" (@Acts 22:10.) It is a great thing to be consciously under command, and no christian is right till he learns that. Thus we are available to God in His service.
In the case of the woman of Zarephath, God says to the prophet, "I have *commanded* a widow woman there to sustain thee", (@1 Kings 17:9). The whole creation is under that principle; man has veered from it, carrying all under with him; but the whole physical system obeys divine commandment. What about us? I appeal to young people here, Have you the sense of being under command? You may say, You want to make us legal. Not at all! for "his commandments are not grievous", (@1 John 5:3). I have often thought of regulations that are in wisdom imposed upon us, even in a meeting like this; but there should never be rules formulated or imposed upon the people of God that do not bear the character of the *perfect law of liberty*; (@James 1:25). That belongs to the people of God, it is their heritage, the royal law (chapter 2:8), the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob; (@Deuteronomy 33). And so the commandment is not grievous; every lover of Christ finds pleasure in the commandment, and what you find is that there is always an advantage in it, as we see in what follows.
The women ran to tell His disciples, and the Lord met them. Is that not worthwhile? It is not now an accredited representative -- it is *Himself*. As they ran to bring His disciples word, Jesus met them, and, as it were, saluted them, saying "Hail!" What an honour! Is that far away from us? Not at all. John tells us that the lover of Christ who keeps His
{197}
commandment should be loved of His Father and of Him, and that He would manifest Himself to him. You see, it is the keeping of the commandment. I would urge on young christians the importance, as loving Christ, of being under command and doing it -- keeping it. You will find a manifestation of Christ in it. "Jesus met them, saying, Hail!" How delighted He was as He saw those quickened steps hastening in the fulfilment of a command; a commandment not directly from Himself, but from an angel, an accredited representative. He says, "Hail!" now they are in direct touch with Him. You see how the commandment brings you into touch with Christ. Those who disregard the commandment do not come in touch with Christ, nor do they show their love for Christ; He manifests Himself to those who keep the commandment. And now they hold Him by the feet, and they worship Him.
But the commandment is not everything. The Lord says to them, "go, bring *word* to my brethren"; there is also the *word*; they are linked together in @John 14. The 'word' is an additional thought; it is adjusting -- the *mind* of the Lord. One said to Him, "how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?" He said, "If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him" (verses 22,23). That is a further thought. These dear women needed that, no doubt. This was no time to hold Him by the feet, for He was in movement, He had others to see, doubtless, that day. But they worshipped Him, they had the manifestation, and would be prepared for the word. Now, they bring the disciples word; but the Lord does not here call them disciples, He calls them "*my brethren*". The angel sent them to the disciples; the Lord sent them to the brethren. You see how beautiful that is, to be sent to the brethren by the Lord. 'Brethren'
{198}
is a family term. He says, "go, bring word to my brethren", and they go and tell the brethren that they should see Him in Galilee.
Over against their action we see -- and it is a very solemn thing -- that the *enemy* acts. In their keeping the commandment of the Lord, there is a lying movement to discredit it at the same time. As they went to tell the brethren there was a movement on the part of the enemy to deny the resurrection of Christ. I do not dwell on that, but it shows what we have to contend with in keeping the commandments of Christ. And the word to the apostles is, "teaching them to observe ... *whatsoever I have commanded you*". They were to see Him in Galilee, and He met them there. The Lord came to them in the mountain, and said, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations".
What a word to those who are in the position of teaching! Can we *make* disciples? You see what a test that is to all of us who are seeking to serve the Lord. How can I make a disciple until I am a disciple myself, having learnt from the Master? A disciple has learnt from the Master. It is a question of *moral power* in those who are sent. True disciples can be *made* in no other way. "Baptising them", He says, "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit"; this introduces those baptised into the full light of God revealed in Christ. And then, "teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you".
Of course this is apostolic, but it bears on us in principle. I am speaking particularly of what the Lord commanded. Let us not let slip one iota of this. There can be no compromise whatever on this line, no meeting in the plain of Ono, as of old; (@Nehemiah 6:2). How much compromise there has been in the so-called evangelisation of the world! Kings have been baptised and *remained kings and sinners*,
{199}
and other lawless men accepted as well! That is not discipleship, that is not "teaching them to observe ... whatsoever I have commanded you". Nothing must be let slip of what is commanded or Satan will have an advantage. Then He says, as if to assure them that all that He said could be done, "lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world".
There is just another word, and that is in Timothy, and it is a very solemn one. It is one of the most solemn charges, if not the most solemn charge, that you can find. He is enjoined before God, and before Christ Jesus, to keep the commandment "without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ". It is urgent at the present time. We cannot say we have not got the commandment; we have, and it is to be kept. We are enjoined in the presence of God and in the presence of Christ Jesus, to keep it without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. The commandment takes the place of Himself. "He is not here", says the angel, but there was one there accredited to convey His mind -- His will, and the women carried it out. They stand before us as models of obedience, and of the gain of it, for the Lord met them.
And so it is until the Lord comes, until His appearing, that the commandment is to be kept without spot. Then we shall have the display of personal authority, for that is what it is; authority is not vested in a council, it is vested in a Person -- that is the divine thought. The divine thought is the endowment of one Person with divine authority, so that when He appears He shall show in His time who is "the blessed and only Potentate" -- the blessed One, and the only One, who is "King of kings, and Lord of lords"; that is to say, all divine authority is vested in Christ, "who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no
{200}
man has seen, nor is able to see". What a prospect, as we suffer under the irregularities of the government of this world! It is not that one says a word against them (we recognise rulers as of God), but we see the irregularities and the powerlessness of legislation.
What a prospect to see it in its infinite perfection in one Person, the King of kings, and Lord of lords! What an incentive there is in all this to love His appearing and look for it! Every one who loves His appearing, we are told, will have a crown of righteousness; (@2 Timothy 4:8). Why have I a crown? Because I am righteous now, I love righteousness if I love His appearing. As the hymn puts it: <blockquote>'We look for Thine appearing, Thy presence here to bless; We greet the day that's nearing, When all this woe shall cease'. (`200:4)</blockquote>
That is what we look for; but what is our employ in the meantime? Keeping His commandment. Be assured of it, the commandment takes the place of Christ in this sense; it is here in His stead. The Holy Spirit enables us to carry it out. It stands for Christ. The angel said, "He is not here", but instead there is accredited witness in the power of the Spirit; so that the lover of Christ has no question as to the commandment, that it is the commandment of the Lord.
Accredited representation of Christ here lies in the Holy Spirit, but He uses believers in this service. The 'seal' (@2 Timothy 2) implies this representation in a moral way. It has on the one side, as it were, "The Lord knows those that are his", and on the other, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". Where these things are maintained, there is divine representation in a moral way. The Holy Spirit supports it and makes it effective, without pretension to be official. May we all have part in it!
{201}
NEARNESS TO CHRIST AND PUBLIC SERVICE (4)
@Luke 9:1 - 36
J.T. This chapter is especially for those who serve. The Lord had wrought from chapter 4 to chapter 7 alone, as it were. The apostles were not much in evidence. In chapter 8 they are with Him, and crossing in the boat with Him, but now they are sent out to serve by themselves; He sends them out. I think that we may be helped as we view this chapter from the standpoint of those who serve. What is to be noted is that the Lord calls the twelve *together*, a word that has its place, I think, among those who serve, that they should be together through the Lord's call. There is a general unity, which, of course, involves the assembly; but then there is a unity that should especially mark those who serve, I think. Do you not think so?
H.D'A.C. Yes, indeed.
Ques. A unity that marks those who serve, did you say?
J.T. Well, a unity that belongs to those who serve.
H.D'A.C. Later on, when they went out in their service at Pentecost, there was no divergence, there was no difference of thought.
J.T. In the main the apostles were held together; the Lord, indeed, had prayed for that, that they should be one; (@John 17). There should be that sort of thing in relation to the testimony. We see how it was worked out in connection with Paul and those labouring with him; how the unity was maintained with Jerusalem. So that, not only are the saints as a whole bound up in unity, the unity of the Spirit, but those who serve are specially to be united in the
{202}
service, that there should not be any independency. The unity of the Spirit enters into the whole position. The unity of the faith enters into it, too, but it lies largely with those who serve; that the service bears in one direction, that is the unity of the faith: "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith", (@Ephesians 4:13).
Ques. Do you say that this is more connected with the unity of the faith?
J.T. Well, I thought so; the gifts in @Ephesians 4 are to that end, "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith". That is to say, that there should be no divergence in the teaching.
Ques. Would you open that out a little more?
J.T. Well, it is just that one sees in this chapter that the Lord has the twelve in His mind, and in sending them out He calls them together; the teaching, the ministry, should not be on independent lines; it is really based as much on unity as the church is. Indeed, if the ministry be not that, there will be cleavage and partisan feeling among the saints.
Rem. So that there is no divergence, they are all on the same lines.
J.T. That is right. You see how it worked out at Corinth; one said, "I am of Paul", and another, "I of Apollos". There was no divergence between these ministers; Paul and Apollos were on the same line, but the apostle is not really referring to himself and Apollos, but to local persons -- persons at Corinth; there were different schools there. He had transferred the thing to himself and Apollos for their sakes.
Ques. And even there, would you say, the planter and the waterer are one -- is this the unity to which you referred?
J.T. Yes, that is right; it emphasises what I was remarking, Paul plants and Apollos waters, but God gives the increase; (@1 Corinthians 3:7,8).
{203}
Rem. It would be wrong for us to think, like Martha, that we are left to serve alone.
J.T. We are not left to serve alone -- there are many serving, and the Lord would call them together.
Rem. @Psalm 133 would indicate the unity of the Spirit -- the brethren dwelling together in unity; and then, in the next psalm we have, "all ye servants of Jehovah"; there is unity connected with the thought of service, dependent on Christ having His right place as in @Psalm 132.
J.T. Just so. And then you will find that in @Psalm 135 the house of Levi is called in -- there is the principle of service. In @Psalm 134 it says, "Behold, bless Jehovah, all ye servants of Jehovah"; and then in the next psalm, "house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah; house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah". The varied branches of the service are called upon to the same employ, showing that all are called into the unity expressed in praise.
Ques. Is it illustrated in the history of so-called 'brethren' -- Satan divided them? He knew what power there would be if they remained united.
J.T. Yes. You see in the public history of the church how it was broken up into the Eastern and Western branches, besides minor sections in Asia and Africa; and then in our own times into numberless branches.
Ques. Is the thought in "One is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren" (@Matthew 23:8) and "See that ye fall not out by the way"?
J.T. Quite so; and the Lord's service in the last supper has that in view, that we should serve one another in love -- the servants particularly are in view. It is not for nothing that the Spirit tells us here that the Lord calls them together. They had been with Him, and in the boat with Him, now He calls them together; they are sent out together, as immediately under His call and influence.
{204}
Ques. Would the table of shewbread illustrate it at all -- the twelve loaves on the table?
J.T. I think so. As we were remarking yesterday, 'the twelve' suggests material for the Lord's use, that He can manipulate to the best advantage. In order to be thus available to Christ, love must underlie our relations with one another; we must have no personal motives or ambitions, but be just at the Lord's bidding.
Ques. I suppose @Psalm 133 would bring that out beautifully?
J.T. Yes; brethren dwelling together.
Rem. If one may refer to what we had elsewhere with regard to Aaron going to find Moses -- both sides are necessary. That is, the levite is connected with the sanctuary and all the service of God. And then, there is Moses, a man who has been under discipline in the wilderness; these two working together are able to gather the saints together, and convey the mind of God to them; as at Antioch, Saul and Barnabas go together. The christian takes character from the ministry he receives.
Ques. Did the twelve go out together, and return together?
J.T. We know that elsewhere it says that He sent them out "by two and two". They might go anywhere, as the Lord directed, but they would be in accord with one another.
Ques. A spiritual combination in relation to divine things -- was that the Lord's thought?
J.T. Yes. There is a needs-be for being called together. In the beginning of Numbers the heads of the tribes were such as were summoned on all occasions. Moses would always summon them when necessary, and they were supposed to be available, so that their names are given. The princes of the congregation are called in due course, for the altar is to be dedicated; their offerings indicate perfect
{205}
unity, they are perfectly united in their minds and affections; each one offered as the others. And then, all the offerings combined are there -- a standing witness to the unity of the leaders. It was a *real* unity; (@Numbers 7).
Ques. Does that verse in @Philippians 2:4 apply, "Look not every man on his own things, but every-man also on the things of others"?
J.T. Yes; "If there be therefore any consolation in Christ ... if any fellowship of the Spirit", (verse 1), then they are to think the *same* thing -- "thinking one thing". The Lord is graciously providing ministers to serve the saints -- we ought to be most thankful for it; for the variety of ministry and energy that there is -- but it is important that it should be borne in mind that the ministry is under the Lord; *He* called them together, and then gave them power and authority -- it was all at one time. And the furnishings imply "authority over *all* demons"; whatever variety of demons there might be, they had authority over them; "and to heal diseases", another thing that is important; and "to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick". We see, therefore, that the Lord intends those who minister to be marked by power and authority. Of course, this is apostolic, but notwithstanding these days of brokenness, the principle holds good that the ministry should be marked by "power and authority". And there is power and authority over *all* demons; whatever form evil may take, the ministers do not run away from it. You may say, It is not my affair; but then you do not run away from it. Wherever evil lifts up its head, there ought to be ability to deal with it.
Ques. Why do demons come first?
J.T. I think you can see that Satan has his emissaries, and the servants have to contend with them; they are sure to have to contend with them. Demons are emissaries of Satan. As the Lord has His representatives,
{206}
so Satan has his. You see in the earlier chapters how seven of them had gone out of Mary Magdalene, and the legion out of the man. We see how things happened, and it is very solemn in the case of the latter that the Lord acceded to the wish of the demons to go into the swine. That is to say, we have to reckon on divine *allowances* of evil. It is not that He sent them, He *allowed* them. It is humbling, for there is some cause for it underneath.
Then, the next thing is whether the power given is effective, whether there is the ability to deal with evil in *every* form of it -- *all* demons. It says "all demons" here, not simply 'demons'; there is no form of evil that may arise that cannot be met, as the ministers are subject to Christ.
Ques. Is not that one of the features of the kingdom?
J.T. Just so, only that here it is a question not of that, but of the ministers -- their power. What can you do with all demons when you see them working? And then *diseases*? We have to distinguish between these and 'the sick'. A disease is a thing that may be *prevalent*.
Ques. An exercise, for instance, that spreads out for a long time?
J.T. Yes; involving many -- all affected by the same thing. Whereas 'the sick' may have diverse ailments.
Rem. The sick are marked as being without strength.
J.T. Yes; whatever disease they suffer from, they are sick; whereas disease is something that affects many, the same thing.
Ques. It was physical then, was it not?
J.T. Oh, yes! Now it is spiritual diseases.
Ques. There are those who claim that they have power to heal; why is it that you view it spiritually,
{207}
in that way; is it because the dispensation is in faith?
J.T. Because it is a time of *soul* salvation -- not body salvation. Body salvation implies the resurrection. If what they hold is true, we could not die. The time of body salvation is future -- not that the Lord does not help our bodies, I am sure He does, for they are the temple of the Spirit. But then, to make the body the prominent thing instead of the soul is quite wrong. It is the salvation of our souls -- the spiritual side -- now.
Ques. Is the dealing with the demons actual now -- there is authority over them?
J.T. Yes, because they affect us spiritually.
Rem. Saints are often given back through our prayers when things are hopeless.
Ques. "If I with the finger of God cast out devils" (@Luke 11:20) -- is that the line?
J.T. Yes; things are done by the Spirit. I am saved in my soul, it is a time of soul salvation; God is dealing with our souls. He cares for the body, of course.
Ques. The Lord gives them authority, why is that?
J.T. That is the point -- authority, as it says, to heal diseases, and to heal the sick. It is much more important that any spiritual disease that may prevail should be dealt with. It is not, as I said, that God does not help the saints physically, He provides food for our bodies, and all that.
Rem. What is needed in these cases is correct diagnosis.
J.T. I think so. The ministers should not assume that the sick should be left to the local people; it comes within the range of all serving. But great wisdom has to be used by anyone who would help in a locality not his own. On the other hand, to refuse help because the person is not of the locality is pure independency.
{208}
Ques. Do you suggest that ministers should have power to meet disease in a locality?
J.T. Yes; not *interfering*, but they certainly should not turn their backs on the trouble. They ought to have ability to meet it. They have wide experience -- they ought to have wide experience. Gift is general, not local. They have great experience, and any local disease, surely, should be a matter for them to think over, whether they can help it. It is remarkable how these things do spread in localities and in districts -- certain spiritual diseases. And, besides that, there are individuals who are 'sick', this may be from other causes.
Ques. Is power and authority given to the company, although it comes out in individuals in connection with unity?
J.T. Here it is the ministers who are in view; we shall see elsewhere how authority is given to the church, but I think here it is simply the ministers. Of course, it is apostolic, we have to bear that in mind.
Rem. The apostle says to the Corinthians, "many are weak and sickly among you", (@1 Corinthians 11:30). He had their spiritual interests at heart.
J.T. He had diagnosed the case -- it was that they were behaving badly in regard to the Lord's supper.
Ques. Is it the thought of the Lord that there should be a healing ministry amongst us today? Would healing be characteristic of the ministry today?
J.T. Quite so; "let it rather be healed", (@Hebrews 12:13). But you want to get at the root of the thing. The apostle got at the root of the thing at Corinth, they were behaving badly in regard to the Lord's supper, and other things, and sickness followed.
Ques. Does healing involve a process?
J.T. I suppose it would -- a true physician would
{209}
know. The thing is to get at the root of it, and what it is that would meet it.
In the midst of all this they were to proclaim the kingdom of God -- the preaching was to go on. Then He says to them, "Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip ... neither have two coats apiece. And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart". You see how the servants are sent out in dependence upon God -- a very important side of the position. "Neither staves ... neither have two coats apiece"; this has to be read, of course, in the spirit of it, but it is to produce dependence on God, and not on the brethren. Although the brethren are obligated in regard to the bodily needs of the servants, they are dependent on Him.
Ques. Would the healing power that the servants have show to the people the benefit that is to be obtained from the kingdom of God that they preached?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. What is involved in the preaching of the kingdom? It is not the "glad tidings" here.
J.T. It is the power; it is called the "glad tidings of the kingdom" elsewhere, but here it is the thing itself. It is not called the glad tidings, it is more the thing itself that has to be preached. That is what they were to attend to particularly -- the kingdom. The thought of power in an organised way involves the Spirit being here; that is to be preached.
Ques. Is it the kingdom of God, set over against the kingdom of Satan, in that way?
J.T. No doubt. The kingdom of God is God acting in grace, but acting in power, so that according to what is said here power marks the apostles throughout.
Ques. Do you think the ministry of the twelve would bring in healing, and also bring in the light of God against the darkness of Satan?
J.T. Yes; they proclaimed the kingdom. That
{210}
was not simply the power that was in *them*, for the kingdom was to remain when they left any district; the kingdom remains, it is not dependent upon them. You preach something that remains and holds good for faith at all times. That is a most important thing, that the ministers pass on, but if the kingdom is preached it remains, so that the believer gets the good of it at all times. The minister may go away, but the kingdom remains. Today it lies in the Holy Spirit.
Ques. Would you link it in any way with the world to come?
J.T. Exactly. The apostle speaks of that as marking the present time -- the powers of the world to come are already active here. If a Paul came to a town he would heal diseases, but the kingdom which he preached would not pass away. That is what the believer is in; it is a faith system. It holds good, so that it is always present. It is set up in Christ in heaven, and made good in the Spirit here. It is available at all times.
Ques. Would you say what the kingdom is?
J.T. In Luke it is the kingdom of God, that is to say, it is what God is morally operating here in grace; but there is power in it, so that it is connected with the Spirit. The kingdom of *heaven* is connected with Christ in heaven, but the kingdom of God is connected with the Spirit here; it is God here, really. So that He says, "if by the finger of God I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you", (chapter 11:20). That is what Luke presents to us. It is always available to the believer. The servant passes on, but he announces what exists, what remains. Of course, the power exercised by the apostles was that of the kingdom, but the kingdom of God is set up in Christ in heaven and the Spirit down here. Mark speaks of the kingdom of God come in *power*.
Ques. Are we not fortified in going out by the
{211}
fact that we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved? (@Hebrews 12:28). The apostle would have that sense.
,J.T. Quite so; you are conscious of that. So that he says in @Romans 14:17, "The kingdom of God is ... righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit". That remains to us.
The next thing is that they are withdrawn. "The apostles having returned related to him whatever they had done"; and then it says, "he took them ... apart into a desert place of a city called Bethsaida". Now we are tested in another way, we are withdrawn from the actual field of service. It is one thing to be active in service, conscious of divine power, but it is another thing to be withdrawn from it in the Lord's company. In relating to Him what you have done, you get to see that it is not perhaps as great as you thought it was, because the power is not now operating in your soul. You are now on your own ground, according to your spiritual stature. When you are on the platform preaching, you may rely on the power of the Spirit; that is one thing, but when that is over, to be in the Lord's presence relating to Him what He knows well, is another matter. That has to be gone through, for really what I am with Him in the wilderness is not a question of my ability to preach or to minister, but of what my spiritual stature is. What can I be in the presence of Christ, save as what He has made me?
Rem. They do not tell other people; they tell *Him*.
J.T. And in telling Him they would be made conscious of the true proportion of things; He would give them to understand the true bearing of things. Then it says, "the crowds ... followed him; and he received them". That is, the apostles are now in a new position. Here are five thousand people, and the Lord can receive them -- He *received* them;
{212}
we are now leading on to the idea of reception. We shall see something about His being received Himself, and how He is received, but here He received five thousand people, showing something of His large-heartedness.
Ques. Would so many coming be consequent on the service of the twelve?
J.T. I think so; it fits in here in that way in the order of events. The service is becoming general now, and results are accruing, but can the *twelve* receive them? You may get converts in number, but how about the reception of them? because here it is a question of reception. As it says of Paul, "he ... received all who came to him", (@Acts 28:30). He made no difference, he received *all*. The Lord here received them. Thus it is more important, in a way, to learn how to receive than to make converts. The principle of reception is a very important one.
Rem. The brethren were very slow to receive Paul at first.
J.T. Yes. It says here, "he received them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and cured those that had need of healing". Now the apostles would get a new view of things. He received them, and "cured those that had need of healing"; they did not all need healing, but He healed those that did. Then it says, "But the day began to decline, and the twelve came and said to him, Send away the crowd". Now, you see, He had received them and things were going well, but in the *decline of the day* we lose energy. Send them away! -- thus said the twelve, that is to say, *ourselves* in service. How quickly we tire of the results of the service! That is not the kingdom of God, that is not the dispensation; it is a time of reception, not of sending away.
Rem. That is not on the line of healing.
J.T. No; nor on the line of feeding, nor of the dispensation at all. They say, "Send away the
{213}
crowd that they may go into the villages around, and into the fields, and lodge and find victuals, for here we are in a desert place". But He says, "Give *ye* them to eat". Now, you see, the servants are in another position; it is a question now, not of healing diseases, nor of proclaiming the kingdom, but of *feeding*, and feeding a large number.
Ques. With regard to the receiving and healing, how would that apply now?
J.T. Well, that is what should go on amongst us -- receiving. The Lord is working, and souls are moving towards the light; they must not find darkness, but light. Here it is a question of healing, and then feeding them. It raises the question as to what kind of 'readings' we are having. What food have you got for them? What kind of meetings do you have here? Is there food available for those coming in?
Ques. Was Paul in that spirit when he said, "Receive ye one another, according as the Christ also has received you to the glory of God"? (@Romans 15:7).
J.T. Yes. We are tested as to what we are doing with people. After all, how much better off are they than where they were? Are they healed? Is there plenty of food? Or are they just coming into a *better order* of meetings?
Rem. We are not able to feed people if we are not fed ourselves; in Mark's gospel they had not time to eat.
J.T. You must have the food, that is the point now. The Lord had done the receiving, and He says, "Give ye them to eat"; that is the challenge now. They say, "We have not more than five loaves and two fishes, unless *we* should go and buy food for all this people; for they were about five thousand men". You see, they are not governed by spiritual thoughts. They reckon what they had, and then talk about buying; they are not spiritual. The Lord is brief in
{214}
His remarks, He says, "Make them sit down in companies by fifties". That is how Luke puts it, as if the Lord would remind you that you can feed them more easily if you have small meetings. There will be more developed and the readings will be better; there will be more mutual contributions; the meetings will be richer and fresher if you have small rather than large ones.
Rem. It is quite easy to understand that.
J.T. You get acquainted with the brethren as they come in, you get to know them personally. It is thus much easier to feed them.
Rem. The women and children are not mentioned -- only the men.
J.T. @Matthew 14:21 says, "besides women and children"; they were fed, too; it was a very large number. In mentioning the *men* only, Luke, no doubt, has assembly order in view.
Ques. How would you apply the thought that we should go and buy?
J.T. Well, where are you going to buy? Our brother was remarking in his prayer about our coming to the Lord and buying, but that is not in view here. It is a question of what *we have*.
Rem. Going to buy would be like "another man's line of things made ready to our hand", (@2 Corinthians 10:16).
J.T. What is in view here is what faith lays hold of. The Lord says, "Make them sit down in companies by fifties"; that is the first thing to do. What about the size of the meeting? And then, what if you have a very large meeting, and one or two brothers are taking charge? The Lord would break that up; He would have every one in each company responsible.
Ques. Is the thought of *fifty* to bring in dependence on the Lord?
J.T. Quite so; it is perhaps weakness in responsibility -- five times ten.
{215}
Rem. In @Acts 2 it says that they broke bread from house to house.
J.T. Just so. It should read, broke, bread "in the *house*", not in the temple. But the practice would imply small companies.
Then it goes on, "They ... made them all sit down. And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven he blessed them, and broke and gave to the disciples to set before the crowd. And they all ate and were filled; and there was taken up of what had remained over and above to them in fragments twelve hand-baskets".
Another thing comes out in verse 18: the Lord introduces the question of His Person -- as to what knowledge there was of His Person; what could they say about Him? It is connected with prayer; as it says, "he was praying alone, his disciples were with him, and he asked them saying, Who do the crowds say that I am? But they answering said, John the baptist; but others, Elias; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen again. And he said to them, But ye, who do ye say that I am?"
Ques. Is that connected with feeding?
J.T. The feeding of the multitude would call attention to the Person who was there. Now what are we *saying* about the Lord's Person? Surely it is a matter of interest as to who He is. Zacchaeus, later, is said to have wished to see Him, "*who he was*". The Lord here challenges us as to what we say about Him.
Rem. It would determine the kind of ministry.
J.T. It would. You are challenged, in preaching Christ, as to who He is. Are you able to speak of Him -- as to His Person -- *who* He is?
Rem. It indicates whether we are babes, young men, or fathers.
J.T. Everyone ought to be able to say something about the Person of Christ.
{216}
Ques. Why is the challenge in regard to the crowds first?
J.T. Well, the Lord would, I think, put it upon us that we should not be ignorant as to what is current, what is being said about Christ. Not that you take up what they say as right, but it is well to be conversant with what is said about Christ. He is everything to you, and you want to know what people are saying about Him.
The bride in the Song of Songs could give you an account of Christ -- "What is thy beloved?" they say to her. It is a poor thing if I cannot give an account of Christ. It is not here what I *think* about Him, but what I *say*. Of course, what I think about Him will come out in what I say.
Ques. You would say it is something different from 'buying', as in the previous part; @Psalm 45 tells what you "*have made*".
J.T. You speak of the things you "have made touching the king" -- very beautiful!
Ques. Is it not important that, in going out to preach, you preach Christ as the One who is able to fill all things, and will fill every circle?
J.T. Yes. Herod in his circle thought that he could give an account of Christ. As you get it here: "Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things which were done by him, and was in perplexity, because it was said by some that John was risen from among the dead, and by some that Elias had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again. And Herod said, John I have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things?" Elsewhere he says that it *was* John, as if he could give an account of it. But that is Herod's circle; it is a vicious circle. What you get here is that He asks, "Who do *the crowds* say that I am?" that is to say, men in general, or, as *we* might say, 'the profession around', for the crowds were interested enough to
{217}
talk about Him. And surely we cannot but be thankful that there are people who will talk about Him. But the point is, What are they saying about Him? And then, Is there anyone who says the right thing about Christ, as to His Person? I may preach redemption, but what can I say as to who He is? It is a very delicate subject, but it is an important one -- what we say about His Person. They were interested in Him; He had received them, and they have different views about Him. And then He says, "who do ye say that I am?" and Peter says, "The Christ of God".
Ques. Do you think it is the same crowd that He received?
J.T. This is more general; it is "the crowds" here.
Rem. In Luke's gospel, in regard to the reply of Peter, the Spirit of God does not say he gets it by revelation of the Father.
J.T. I think it is more here the outcome of what he had observed; he had gained a knowledge of Christ.
Ques. Does he recognise Him as the Anointed?
J.T. Yes; it is not 'the Christ' as in Mark, it is "the Christ *of God*" -- the One anointed to bring God in.
Ques. Do you think that this is a private transaction between the disciples and the Lord -- they were not to tell this to the people? You were speaking of the servants just now, I was wondering if it would be necessary for the servants to have this apprehension of Christ in the soul.
J.T. It looks so; "He enjoined them to say this to no man". And then the mount of transfiguration is on the same principle -- it is a secret. But Peter says, "we have not followed cunningly devised fables" (@2 Peter 1:16); it acted powerfully in them in their testimony.
{218}
Ques. As to bringing God in, it says in @Luke 4:18, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me". Is that what you thought?
J.T. That is right. "The Christ of God" is to bring God in, that God had visited His people.
Rem. He is the vessel of the grace of God.
J.T. Yes. Then the next thing is the mount of transfiguration. The Lord is now finishing the education of the disciples, they are to be allowed into the secret of His Person, into the knowledge of His Person, and of the place He has on high -- what heaven thinks about Him. So that you get a view of Christ in these two sections that is of all moment to those who serve. There is great power in the soul in the knowledge of His Person.
Ques. In verse 21 it says, "And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing" -- what is the thought? Why does He charge them not to make this known?
J.T. He is "the Christ of God"; they were not to make that known, it was to be a secret. That was because the Jews had rejected Him; He was not going to adorn an apostate state of things with such precious thoughts. These precious things are to be kept for the saints. You do not want to adorn an apostate christendom with the precious things of Christ. God is judging that system, He is not whitewashing it.
Ques. Preaching the kingdom of God -- is that not universal?
J.T. Quite so. We have already had it before us -- the idea of parabolic teaching; if you are preaching the gospel, you do not whitewash christendom. Then it says, "I say unto you of a truth, There are some of those standing here who shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God". That is to say, now they are to see it in its reality, on high; what it is. And then it says, "And it came to pass
{219}
after these words, about eight days, that taking Peter and John and James, he went up into a mountain to pray". He did not take them *all* up -- showing that it is on the principle of sovereign selection, doubtless alluding to their spirituality; they were equal to such a thing. How many of us are equal to that?
Ques. Would it be an answer to losing one's life here?
J.T. Well, no doubt. I think Peter and James and John would represent the spiritual element; they were equal to it. It would, of course, affect the whole company in them. The selection is the Lord's own sovereign right, but then He selects those fitted for His purpose. He knows well enough the state of each one of us -- our stature.
Rem. Here it is a question of God's sovereign selection, but there may be exercise on our side.
J.T. When the Lord says, "There are some ... standing here" -- well, that challenges every one standing around. They would say, Am I to be amongst these?
{220}
NEARNESS TO CHRIST AND PUBLIC SERVICE (5)
@Luke 10:1 - 24, 38 - 42
J.T. This morning we were occupied with chapter 9, mainly with a view to seeing the instruction in it for those who are specially serving the Lord's people. It is said that the Lord called the twelve to Him, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal disease and sickness, and to proclaim the kingdom of God. We saw how, when they returned and told the Lord what they had done, He took them apart to a desert place, and the crowd came, and He proposed to feed them, putting the responsibility on the twelve to feed the multitude, which they were not able to do. That is to say, whilst power is committed to those who serve, they are also tested as to whether the results of their service can be cared for. The Lord said, Feed the multitude, and the disciples were not able to feed them.
Then we saw that the Lord was praying in a certain place, and He questioned the disciples as to what the crowd said about Him, who He was; then He challenged them as to who *they* said He was -- "who do ye say that I am?" They were able to answer that, they were able to give an account of Christ personally, in Peter saying, "The Christ of God".
And then He said, "of a truth, there are some of those standing here who shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God", so He takes Peter and John and James up to the mountain -- we got to that point. Whilst yesterday we had the composition of the assembly, in the man, and the woman, and the child in chapter 8, I thought that in chapter 9 those who serve are specially in view, the import of the instruction in the chapter leading up to
{221}
the change -- as praying -- in regard to the Lord's appearance. He is praying as He introduces the subject of His Person, then He is seen praying on the mount; as if these two features are more spiritual -- the question of His Person, and of the transfiguration. He became 'different', it says.
If the Lord prays, there is something urgent; the truth of His Person is an urgent matter; what the saints say about Him. Then as to the transfiguration, I think it points to the necessity in servants (in all of us, indeed) of taking on change. It says that "as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different and his raiment white and effulgent". The place prayer has in these two settings is to be noticed. First, as to the knowledge of Christ, what we can say about Christ personally, who He is; and then how heaven regards Him, as seen on the mount; and the change -- as in Him, true in us.
Ques. What is your thought about becoming different? Does that apply to the servants?
J.T. I think so. As you progress spiritually, you would become different. We have reached here special spiritual settings, I think. We have two prayers here; first, the Lord praying alone, and the introduction there of the question of His Person; and then He is praying on the mount, and His countenance becomes different and His raiment white and effulgent. One is changed in appearance and circumstances as one prays.
H.H. Would @2 Corinthians 3 touch on that in regard to the servants or saints?
J.T. I think so. We are changed into the same image, and it is by beholding the glory -- "By the Lord the Spirit".
H.H. Would you say that as we advance on spiritual lines it is so?
J.T. That is the setting of the truth here; first a
{222}
knowledge of His Person, who He is; and then what He is on high -- changed.
H.H. We ought not to be the same as we were a few years ago.
J.T. That is what I thought. "The fashion of his countenance", it says -- this is a pattern for us -- "and his raiment white and effulgent". "Glory" is also there.
J.B. What distinct glory would it be?
J.T. It belongs to the heavenly. "As is the heavenly" -- seen in Him, what He is now -- "such are they also that are heavenly". Then in the next chapter, the one we had read to us, our names are there, meaning that we have a heavenly status -- we are known there.
J.McM. Is the change directly connected with prayer? -- "as he prayed"; and in Corinthians, as we *behold*; is the change in us also connected with prayer?
J.T. I think that is the point. As He prayed, in chapter 3, the Holy Spirit came down, and a voice out of heaven said, "Thou art my beloved Son". Then in chapter 5 He prays, and the power of the Lord is there; it says, "The Lord's power was there to heal them"; it was a question of prayer. Then in chapter 6 He prays all night, and the apostles are brought in and He names them.
J.McM. Does this change then take place in a praying, dependent man?
J.T. That is the idea; not only on earth, but above, so that the idea goes right into heaven; the point is that God owns it, for it is as He prayed that He was changed.
Ques. You said that, as the anointed Man, He would bring God in. As we pray, are we changed, so that God is reflected in us?
J.T. In prayer He was on our side; prayer is
{223}
man as before God in dependence. The change is in those who are dependent, in those who pray. It brings in the power of God; God is pleased with those who pray; the gospel of Luke specially emphasises the delight of heaven in those who pray. We see it, as I said, in chapter 3 -- as He is baptised He is praying, and the Holy Spirit comes down upon Him in a bodily form as a dove -- meaning that the Holy Spirit is there in its entirety, and there in an undisturbed way; the spirit of prayer affords restfulness for God -- He rests there. The Holy Spirit came down in a bodily form as a dove and abode upon Him, and there was a voice from heaven, "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", (chapter 3:22). Then in chapter 5 He is praying, and all sorts of people are there, and it says, "The power of the Lord was present to heal them", (verse 17). Later, in regard to the appointment of the apostles, He prayed all night. I think that Peter understood it instinctively when he fell at His *knees*; he understood that that was the idea, that the power of intercession in a man was there.
Then we see the servants, the most spiritual of them, in this place of exaltation, in presence of the change, in presence of the glory -- it is all for them. And yet, alas! the next paragraph tells us that a man brought his boy to the disciples, and they could not do anything for him. All this instruction, whilst it is to encourage those who serve specially, is also to keep us humble as to our capabilities. In spite of such a favour, granted to the disciples, here is a man in the greatest distress, and they are not able to help him. He says to the Lord (chapter 9:40), "I besought thy disciples that they might cast him out, and they could not".
Ques. How does that stand in relation to "power and authority over all demons" (chapter 9:1)?
J.T. Well, they are not using the power and authority they had. Evidently there is some want
{224}
there; the power is not effective. Why is the power not effective?
J.B. The education was as to prayer.
J.T. That is the point. As the Lord says elsewhere, "This kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting", (@Matthew 17:21). So that, whilst we may have gift and power, if they are to be effective, it must be in dependence on God and self-denial.
J.McM. Is that "the kingdom of God" -- a dependent Man, pleasing to heaven, praying, and power coming down?
J.T. That is the idea. They are to see the kingdom -- the kingdom *of God*, in Luke. That is what they see on the mount, a dependent Man; that is where power lies; hence the great value of prayer in the service of God.
S.L. Is not the scripture you quoted -- "This kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting" -- a very powerful feature in christianity, in our moral life?
J.T. It is indeed. The kingdom is seen in those marked by these things.
H.H. I suppose nothing tests us more than prayer -- as to how far we can intelligently take up divine interests together, or individually. Is that in your mind? Monday night meeting for prayer is often more testing than the reading.
J.T. You wonder how many there are who "by night stand in the house of the Lord". This comes in after the great principle of unity in the Psalms. Those who stand by night in the house of the Lord are His servants; they lift their hands in the sanctuary and bless Jehovah; (@Psalm 134).
They *stand* means that there is energy in the service. The Lord shows us the way in Luke; He prayed all night. What is so interesting here is that the kingdom is seen -- "I say unto you of a truth, There are some of those standing here who shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of
{225}
God". Elsewhere it is "the kingdom of God come in power" (@Mark 9:1); but the point is to see the kingdom of God, to see the thing itself, and that it centres in a Man praying. We speak of the kingdom and what it is, but that is the secret of it, it centres in a Man praying.
Ques. Would you say that assimilation is in relation to this?
J.T. Yes. As you pray there is a change: "The fashion of his countenance became different and his raiment white and effulgent" -- it is the change. Applying this to ourselves, as you come down, there is a difference -- you are not what you were before.
Ques. Do you think we should pray till we feel the change? We may leave off too early.
J.T. No doubt. As you enter in prayer consciously into the presence of God, you become changed. You have often begun, I am sure, in prayer, and ended with a very different feeling from that with which you began. God makes you conscious that He hears, and not only that, but that He is pleased with your attitude; all that enters into "the kingdom"; here it is a question of *seeing* the kingdom of God.
S.L. So that the sense of having had an audience is a very great thing.
J.T. It is indeed. You have a sense, not only that you are heard, but that you have pleased God.
J.McM. You come away with the sense, "If we know that he hear us ... we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him", (@1 John 5:15).
H.B. What would be the subject of the prayer; would it be in relation to the Lord's interests?
J.T. Oh, surely, and His *general* interests; for, having access to God, we know that He is not local. "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him", (@2 Chronicles 16:9). He is the heart-knowing God; He is occupied
{226}
in a universal way, and the nearer you get to Him, the less local you are, and the more available you are. I believe that one great defect in these days is that we are too local, not general enough.
J.McM. Would not the sense of being in the presence of God annihilate distance?
J.T. That is right. You feel you are in touch with the whole field of His operations.
Ques. Does it necessitate going in and *sitting* before the Lord? This is not the work of a moment?
J.T. Exactly. Sometimes we purpose things, but we have not waited on God about them. David purposed in his heart, and Nathan said, "Do all that is in thine heart; for the Lord is with thee". But the Lord said to Nathan that night, You have spoken too quickly; (@2 Samuel 7:3,4). David had not as yet gone in and *sat* before the Lord. The Lord told Nathan to go and say certain things to David His servant, and one of the things he was to tell him was that Solomon would build the house, not David. That is, he was too quick in making the resolution. But David then goes in and sits before the Lord, and he does not say one word about building the house; he had found out that the mind of the Lord was different from his mind. Often it happens in that way, that what you begin with you do not finish with -- the mind of the Lord may be different. Here is a blessed Man praying on high. We are not told what He prayed about, but He prayed, and as He prayed, the fashion of His countenance became different.
Ques. Is it individual in @Philippians 4:6, "In everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God"?
J.T. It is general there.
Ques. Would it not have the same effect as beholding the glory of the Lord?
J.T. It has, for you get into the presence of God. The question is often raised, What is the "holiest"?
{227}
but people would arrive at the truth of it much more quickly if they said, What is my closet? The Lord says, "Enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly", (@Matthew 6:6). You will soon find out the holiest if you practise that, it becomes a very simple matter. The Lord does not occupy young believers with the holiest; He occupies them with *their Father*, and going in to Him. You know something about your closet; go there and shut the door -- meaning that you are alone with God; and the Lord says your Father will reward you openly. If you have gone there several times, you know something about the holiest. The point in @Hebrews 10 is to draw near *to God*.
S.L. I think you said some years ago that that might be when you awakened in the night.
J.T. Quite so; the point is, to draw near to God.
J.McM. Is that seen in Asaph? When he went into the sanctuary he understood things; (@Psalm 73:17).
J.T. The sanctuary really is the presence of God.
H.D'A.C. I think a great many get into the holiest without being able to describe it in that language. They have really changed their man, they have gone in through the veil, and they know they are with God, and in His holy presence with infinite delight, though they could not describe it.
Rem. It is not so much a question of what we pray for or about, but the drawing near to God in the secret of His presence.
J.T. Quite so. It is right to have needs, but the thing is to get to God.
Rem. In the chapter we were reading this morning it says He was alone praying, and others were with Him. How do you understand that?
J.T. The Lord is never seen praying *with* others. Here He is praying alone, and on the mount He is
{228}
praying, but in chapter 11:1 He is praying in a *certain place*; that is a locality. There one says, "Teach us to pray". They want to pray, too, that is what the Lord is leading up to. If He is praying in a certain place, we may be sure that He has that place in mind; something is needed specially in that place. I have no doubt it arose from what He had found in Martha's house; things were not right there.
Ques. Do you think that this change is in order that the persons should be taken account of? @2 Corinthians 3 has been referred to, but is not that connected with being epistles of Christ?
J.T. Quite so; but others see the effect of our beholding the glory of the Lord.
Rem. What happened here is seen by those present.
J.T. And it would be reflected as they came down.
S.L. You spoke of the raiment in regard to circumstances; would you say a little about that?
J.T. It is one's very immediate circumstances. His raiment became white and effulgent.
H.D'A.C. The Greek word is 'lightning' -- it would have a very striking effect. I think the most remarkable thing in the millennial day will be His relationship with God; that the Ruler is the One who is so near to God, and loves to go in to God, sitting as Priest on His throne. It comes out in His very robe.
H.H. Would it involve holy conditions on our side?
J.T. Surely. The raiment is white and effulgent; whiteness would be purity, and the effulgence would be the effect, I suppose, of the glory.
Then chapter 10 would develop the question of *reception* We had this morning the idea of reception; the Lord, it says, received the crowd; and then, in chapter 9:48 He says, "Whosoever shall
{229}
receive this little child in my name receives me, and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me". He is developing this question of reception, among other things, how He receives a large number at once. All that would help us, I think, on the line of hospitality, and also as to how the result of the work of God is received amongst us. Now, "a little child" is, I suppose, to test us as to whether we are discriminating in favour of certain distinguished persons, whether human distinctions influence us in our manner of reception. He takes the little child; there is nothing there in the way of human distinction or attainment. He, "having taken a little child set it by him, and said to them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receives me". It is to test us as to whether we can act apart from the recognition of human attainment or distinction, in our reception. He set a little child, it says, by Him, as if that is His ideal; that the one who is the subject of the work of God is divested of all that is merely of man in the way of attainment or sophistication. He is set there by the Lord, and then the Lord challenges us as to whether we can receive such an one as that; in doing it we receive Him; and in receiving Him, we receive Him that sent Him. So we have the principle of reception placed on a most simple basis, and yet in a most practical and extensive way; it implies the reception of God Himself.
Ques. Are you applying this in connection with the receiving to the breaking of bread, as we say?
J.T. Well, it is general, I think. The reception of a number, as in chapter 9, refers to what may be done by a company in a locality; when you come to "a little child", you have the *kind* of persons that are to be received.
Rem. To receive a distinguished person might distinguish me, but to receive a little child would not do so.
{230}
J.T. No. Characteristically there is nothing added to the child. It has not been educated or sophisticated in regard to this world, it has not attained anything -- it is the Lord's ideal here.
J.McM. Are we in danger, in this connection, from the "man with a gold ring"?
J.T. Yes; a poor man comes into your synagogue, @James 2:2 says, and a man comes with a gold ring, and you make a great distinction. That is quite in keeping with this.
Rem. When the city was in trouble, it was not the great man who delivered it, but the "poor wise man", (@Ecclesiastes 9:15).
L.D.B. Would you say of the little child, it is the Lord's ideal?
J.T. Yes. You can make something out of a little child; you bring him up in the way he should go. The Lord knows what He is going to make out of us, and the more sophisticated we are, the more difficult it is for Him. "Except ye be converted, and become as little children", He says, "ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven", (@Matthew 18:3). Here He sets a little child *by Him*, and says, as it were, That is My ideal.
F.S. So He says, "*he* is great", (@Luke 9:48).
J.T. Quite so, and here it is a question of representation; the principle of reception involves representation. In receiving a little child, you receive the Lord, and in receiving the Lord, you receive Him that sent Him.
Ques. Just previous to that they had spoken of "the glorious greatness of God" (verse 43); would the possibilities be set forth in the child?
J.T. In the child there is something potentially for God. "Little children" are the material God is working with. It is a question of the work of God. In @John 6:9 you have "a little boy"; he is more than a little child, the little boy *had* something. The
{231}
"little child" is purely and simply the work of God unaffected by human culture. It represents the saints as the work of God.
F.W.W. So the Lord put the little child by Him, receiving him in that way.
J.T. Yes. Elsewhere He put him "in the midst", but here He *identifies Himself with him*. Hence, in our reception, it is a question of the work of God. Can I take account of the person as the subject of the work of God, and care nothing for his natural or worldly distinctions?
F.W.W. Is not that the principle underlying all service, to take account of the work of God?
J.T. Yes. Will you destroy the weak brother for whom Christ died? (@Romans 14:15.) Something you are doing may destroy the work of God -- that is, the "little child".
Ques. Is there any danger that, in refusing to receive one, we may refuse to receive Christ?
J.T. That is how the Lord puts it. If we do not accept the product of the work of God, we are not accepting Christ.
J.McM. Are we still considering the fruit of the sowing?
J.T. Well, the sowing underlies all this, but I think it is more now that the apostles had been at work. The apostles were remiss in this matter, for they were occupied with who should be the greatest; that is not the spirit of the little child.
Rem. Moses prayed, "Let thy work appear unto thy servants", (@Psalm 90:16).
J.T. Just so. You would see it in a little child, and hence you could receive him.
J.B. Do you think this would induce tender consideration for the little ones in the assembly?
J.T. Just so; the test is whether we can take account of them purely as the work of God. A man, it may be, has been a clergyman. Well, that makes
{232}
him a subject of special interest to you, but if his profession adds to him in your eyes, it will only be a hindrance to him. You receive him simply as a subject of the work of God. Paul came in, not as a Pharisee of the Pharisees, but as a little child -- led by the hand.
Now, the time of the Lord's receiving up had come (verse 51), that is what He is leading up to; He was to be received up into heaven, and He wishes, in the meantime, that there should be receiving places on earth; so I think we are introduced now to the assembly, not only as the place in which the little child is received, but where Christ is received, where conditions exist suitable for Him. He set His face stedfastly to go to Jerusalem; He did not expect to be received there, He was going to *die* there, but "he sent messengers before his face. And having gone they entered into a village of the Samaritans that they might make ready for him. And they did not receive him, because his face was turned as going to Jerusalem". There was one village that did not receive Him; that village was not in accord with heaven. The days of His receiving up into heaven were fulfilled, and in the meantime He would be received on earth, but this village did not receive Him.
That is how, I think, chapter 10 stands. He sends out the seventy to every city and place where He Himself was about to come. He sends them two by two now. I suppose that the testimony of two would be conclusive as to what was suitable to Christ. They knew what was suitable to Christ.
F.W.W. What do you understand by that in its application?
J.T. I think it is that in local conditions you want an adequate testimony as to what is suitable to Christ, that is the primary thing in the local company. We have been speaking of the little child
{233}
as the work of God, but it is a question now of Christ Himself being received.
F.W.W. Suitable conditions in localities where the Lord will come.
J.T. That is the idea; two sent by the Lord would convey what conditions are needed.
F.I. Is it that those localities will be prepared by the servants for the reception of Christ; not exactly the companies themselves, but the servants?
J.T. Yes, the two. It would be their obligation to see that conditions obtained suitable to Christ; so that the first thing they look for is a son of peace -- "If a son of peace be there". You cannot have conditions suitable to Christ if there is not a son of peace. He cannot rest where there is trouble -- we must see to that.
Ques. Why is it a son of peace? Is it someone local?
J.T. The Lord implies that there would be many places to which He will come, and there is to be *a* son of peace at least in each; it is a question whether I am a son of peace, wherever I am locally, because if I am not, I cannot suitably receive Christ. He may be received into my house, He might come in as He came into Martha's house -- she received Him, true enough, into her house, but then, was she "a son of peace"?
H.D'A.C. Rather the opposite, I should think.
J.T. "Dost thou not care?" She made the Lord an offender as well as her sister. There is not much in receiving the Lord under those conditions. The days of the Lord's receiving up were fulfilled. That last chapter of the gospel tells us *how* He was received up into heaven; He was *carried* up; Luke thus shows the interest of heaven in Him. But in the meantime He is to have places to come to, and so He sent out these seventy.
F.W.W. In the sending out of the twelve, and of
{234}
the seventy, they seem to operate from houses in both cases, what do you think of that?
J.T. Well, I think that is how the work of God is carried on now. An excellent illustration of it is in Philippi; the assembly there was formed in this connection. The Lord opened the heart of Lydia to attend to the things spoken by Paul and she opened her house; that is to say, she is "a son of peace". The Philippian assembly is marked by that. The apostle went back to her house after he was released from prison, before he left the city.
W.C.G. She formed her household after the mind of Christ, whereas Martha formed hers after her own ideas.
J.T. The Lord opened her heart "to attend to the things spoken by Paul".
Rem. Paul was like one of these messengers.
J.T. Quite so. The great thing is to attend to the things said by them. Lydia was baptised and all her house, and she put it to them, "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there", (@Acts 16:15).
S.L. If there is no peace, there will be no food for those who come amongst us.
J.T. "If a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it" -- that would bring in *their* peace, what they had in relation to Christ. It is not now so much what they would say, as their *peace* coming and remaining upon a son of peace.
Ques. Do you think the apostles found those conditions, in principle, with those praying women at Philippi in @Acts 16?
J.T. That is what I thought; it was like the tree planted by the river; the Philippian assembly is introduced in connection with prayer. There was a place there "where prayer was wont to be made"; it was planted in that connection, and Lydia is "the son of peace" in the place.
{235}
Ques. Would the principle of "the son of peace" be that such an one is contributing to that which is acceptable to heaven?
J.T. I think so. The son of peace is not a trouble-maker, anyway.
Ques. Would what is said of Chloe show the importance of a household in a locality, in regard to conditions that are suitable to God?
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. We are told to "seek peace and pursue it", (@1 Peter 3:11).
J.T. It would be a son of peace who would do that. I think Martha's case is brought in here to show that, whilst the Lord was received -- "A certain woman ... received him into her house" -- yet conditions were not suitable; so we may have the readiness to receive the Lord, and yet conditions may not be suitable.
F.I. Would you say that before there are the proper assembly conditions in a locality to receive the Lord, there must be proper conditions in regard to the household?
J.T. That is the setting of it, I think; the work of God operates in a household, and the household contributes to the assembly.
F.I. So you would expect to find households established before the principles of the assembly could be set up.
J.T. The work of God, I believe, as we see at Philippi, proceeds in relation to households, and they contribute to the assembly; hence you have Lydia's house, and the jailer's house.
J.McM. Would the way they went, as lambs in the midst of wolves, have to do with their reception?
J.T. Quite so. Then they were not to go from house to house; you do not make much of the social side with the local brethren, that is not what you want; you are thinking of a place for the Lord, as
{236}
David said, "Until I find out a place for the Lord"; you are thinking of conditions locally, not of your own comfort. Whatever house you go to, you stay there. You are not thinking of yourself in the matter, or any special preferences, you are there to see to it that there is a place for the Lord -- *He* is coming. It is your responsibility to see that there is an adequate testimony rendered, as to what is suitable to Christ.
J.McM. They were sent forth as *lambs*.
J.T. There is nothing offensive about you. Often people say, The ministry is very acceptable, but the person's conduct is not quite acceptable; the person and his ministry are to be in agreement.
F.W.W. Would you say a word as to the Lord's reception of the seventy on their return?
J.T. We see there the final touch as regards the servants, that we are not to live in our service, or in the success of it.
H.H. Why were there seventy?
J.T. I think it points to abundance, and then there is the thought of responsibility plus the Spirit -- ten times seven. They represent the resources that the Lord has. He is never limited to any servant, He has got others -- we have to remember that. He could send out seventy; then He asked *them* to pray that the Lord of the harvest might send out other workmen; (@Matthew 9:38).
Rem. It says that John rebuked one who was casting out demons, who followed not with them; evidently John was shut up to the twelve, but the Lord had seventy.
J.T. Yes; he was restricting the Lord to themselves -- a very common thing with official servants. He said, "We saw some one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbad him, because he follows not with us" -- he was casting out demons nevertheless --
{237}
John should have been thankful for that. Note, he says, "Follows not with *us*".
It is in these seventy that the very highest thought of the levitical position comes in. The Lord says, "Yet in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens"; that is to say, He now connects the servants with the tribe of Levi. The levites were all first-born ones, and that is what gives the servant his dignity, the place that he has in the family of the first-born; so the Lord says, "Your names are written in the heavens" -- corresponding with "the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven",(@Hebrews 12:23). That is what I am to rejoice in, not in the success of my service.
F.W.W. Thus the dignity of their service would be enhanced.
H.D'A.C. The Lord saw Satan as lightning fall from heaven, and He saw just as clearly in heaven the names of these dear servants.
J.T. It is very different from current clerical dignity. "Your names are written in *heaven*". It lifts us out of all the littleness of mere official service; we are not to live in that, but in the fact that we are heavenly. The thought of this moves the Lord to joy and praise; it says, "He rejoiced in spirit". We are being led here into the most blessed thoughts in relation to service; the Lord's *feelings* are disclosed. He says, "I praise thee, Father ... that thou hast hid these things from wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight". The whole passage (verses 17 - 24) is full of the most blessed thoughts concerning us -- our heavenly position, the place accorded us in the Father's mind and heart. Wonderful indeed!
I thought, in closing, we might see that the local furnishings are given in the opening verses of chapter
{238}
11. They were *not* found in Martha's house; He found a complaining spirit there. And then it says, He was praying "in a *certain place*", as if He would have that place properly furnished, and one of His disciples says to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray". He did not say, 'Teach *me* to pray', he felt the need of *all* being taught, for our ignorance is rarely individual only, it is usually general. If one feels a need, he is pretty certain that others need the same thing. If the Lord is pressing anything, you may be sure it is because there is a general necessity. So the disciple rightly says to the Lord, "Teach *us* to pray".
Ques. What do you say the need was?
J.T. The local furnishings; the furnishings that are requisite for a visitation of Christ. He did not find the furnishings in Martha's house, He found her complaining, He found one sister complaining against another, and in doing that, really complaining against Him. So we can understand the Lord feeling that this would not do, heaven has to interfere here; it is a question of prayer, of bringing God into this, so that the conditions should be altered. So He is praying in a certain place.
And the passage goes on to tell us that a certain man was on a journey, that is to say, we are in a period of journeying. Chapter 10 shows us how the Samaritan was journeying. It is not a time of rest, it is a time of toil; brethren who move about know what this means, it is a time of journeying. The Lord Himself is seen in chapter 8 journeying. Here is a man journeying, and he arrived at a certain place at midnight -- that is an unselfish man, and he ought to be cared for. Local furnishings have to do with those who are journeying; that you care for them. "A friend of mine" -- the basis is friendship, too -- "in his journey", says the man, "is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him". How will he get the furnishings? He will get them by *asking*, by
{239}
*persistent* asking. The furnishings are there, hence there must be the asking to get them. You can have them, but ask for them. The man who has the means is *taking care of his family*; "My children are with me in bed", he says.
F.W.W. So the local assembly should always have something with which to further the testimony.
J.T. That is it, especially people who are journeying; they are friends of yours. When he comes, you do not look at the servant as unrelated to you; he is a *friend* of yours.
Ques. In the third epistle of John we get them, do we not?
J.T. Quite so, they are friends there.
F.W.W. The same occupation often forms friendships.
J.T. Hence, as one is truly serving the Lord, others who are doing so are regarded as friends.
Ques. So that you would wait upon God that such might be received according to Him?
J.T. Yes. He asked for a certain number of loaves, "Let me have three loaves", that is, he knows what is necessary. And then the Lord goes on to develop the subject, and He points out that if a child asks for a fish, a father will not give him a serpent. "But of whom of you that is a father shall a son ask bread, and the father shall give him a stone? or also a fish, and instead of a fish shall give him a serpent? or if also he shall ask an egg, shall give him a scorpion?" He is working up to the great fact that the Holy Spirit is available through our asking the Father for Him; that is the secret of local furnishings, for these we must make room for the Spirit of God.
Ques. You have referred to Philippians several times; does this connect itself with the end of that epistle? There is the prayer to God making known your requests; the result of that is, the peace of God
{240}
shall keep your heart; the next thing is, "The God of peace shall be with you"; and at the end of the chapter, "My God shall supply all your need", (@Philippians 4:9,19). One is thus a son of peace.
J.T. Yes. We need the Spirit of God for the local furnishings; room must be made for Him. They had the Spirit at Corinth, but they were not giving Him His place. Here the Lord says, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" Whatever we may have in the way of material things, education and knowledge, in our meetings -- whatever we may have in that connection -- we need the Spirit of God.
Rem. And He would set us free from being local, so that we are ready to receive those who are on a journey.
J.T. We must not rest without being *conscious* in our localities that we have the Spirit of God; the Father gives the Spirit to those who ask. It is "the Father who is *of heaven*" here, the Holy Spirit as of heaven. The required conditions are heavenly. By the presence and action of the Spirit, the local conditions reflect what is in heaven.
Rem. So the local assembly should be characterised by the Spirit pervading the whole meeting.
J.T. That is the thought; and the Lord's teaching here is to show, I think, that that is available through prayer.
Ques. Do we not sometimes take it for granted that the Spirit of God is there?
J.T. No doubt we do, but we want to be *sure* that He is there, and that nothing else than the presence of the Holy Spirit and what He effects is furnishing suitable to Christ.
H.B. Would you say a word about the dumb spirit (verse 14)?
J.T. Well, that is over against the Spirit of God. One sometimes feels that there is a dumb spirit in
{241}
the meeting. You hear of Quakers¬ meetings, where they do not speak at all, sometimes; that is not the way of the Spirit of God.
H.D'A.C. What is the way to help brethren who, year in and year out, never pray? Brothers growing old will sometimes even talk in a meeting, but they will not, or do not, pray. How is that to be met?
J.T. The Lord here, it says, was casting out a demon and it was dumb, but the demon having gone out, the dumb man spoke.
H.D'A.C. One would not like to think of a demon in one of those brothers.
J.T. Not at all, but that is the setting of it here. Why should I be dumb?
H.D'A.C. I would try to create exercise with him, as to why he was so dumb.
J.T. You would ask him, Who made your mouth? and what did He make it for?
Rem. The young man who was raised up in chapter 7 "began to speak".
J.T. That is the thing; only the speaking must be according to the Spirit of God.
F.W.W. You cannot rightly speak to men unless you can speak to God, can you?
J.T. I think that is the order; speak to God, and then you can speak to men -- you thus have power with God and with men.
F.W.W. When the Lord asked, "Whom say ye that I am?" the answer immediately came, "The Christ of God".
J.T. One wonders whether people who are dumb in the meetings speak to God in secret, whether they enter their closet and pray to their Father in secret; for the idea of the holiest is that you *learn* there how to be with God; and it is in the power of that education that you take part in the public assembly. You know how we speak to God -- five words with the understanding; (@1 Corinthians 14:19).
{242}
Rem. You acquire power with God by prayer.
J.T. Yes. "A *man*" wrestled with Jacob; there was sympathy and encouragement, so that Jacob said, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless me", (@Genesis 32:26). He got power with God -- that is, in the closet. He was left alone, and as left alone, a man wrestled with him and Jacob prevailed with him. So, I think, that if young people enter into their closet, and shut their door and pray, "thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly" -- they will be honoured in the public assembly, and they will know how to speak to God there. Hence it says, "I will ... that the men pray in every place, lifting up pious hands, without wrath or reasoning", (@1 Timothy 2:8). They are to do it intelligently, as priests to God.
W.C.G. Is not Jacob a remarkable instance of a man being changed by prayer? Before he had put himself behind all the others; after that he went first, and met all that was coming. He was changed.
J.T. Yes; and another thing that comes out with Jacob is that he puts Joseph before his mother; that was contrary to nature. You get intelligence as you wrestle with God; that is to say, you get a view of Christ, that He must have the pre-eminence.
{243}
NEARNESS TO CHRIST AND PUBLIC SERVICE (6)
@John 12:1 - 3; @Matthew 26:6 - 13
J.T. These passages, set side by side, present, I think, on the one hand, the inner dignity of the saints in their local relations -- what we are inwardly, as in @John 12; then, the outward reproach involved in the term 'leper'; we have in Matthew "the house of Simon the leper".
W.W. In @John 12 they make Him a supper, and it is in Bethany -- the house of bread.
J.T. Bethany, I think, represents the place of the remnant. On the one hand you have the dignity of those who are there -- you get the names in @John 12. In Matthew you get Simon's name, but he is called "the leper".
Ques. Would you say that in the former chapter it was the affections?
J.T. The inward dignity -- what they are before the Lord's mind. In @John 12 He came to Bethany, the date of His coming is given -- "six days before the passover". He came "where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him". You get their names, indicating known distinctions, whereas Matthew says, "Being in Bethany"; we are not told the reason, but He is there, and He accepts whatever there is. Whatever public character may mark the saints, He is there. It does not say He *came*, but being in the place, He takes up what is there, and accepts the reproach attached to it. We have to view a local company, I think, thus: what each one is in his dignity as risen with Christ, as in
{244}
Colossians; then what he is locally, whatever his public history may be.
Rem. "Which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead", would draw attention to the process by which they had arrived at their ennoblement. Have we to arrive at that in our history?
J.T. Yes; chapter 11 is the basis of chapter 12. Much is said of *Bethany*, as if it were the point of view. It says, "There was a certain man sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister". The place is marked off, as in the mind of the Spirit, to bring in all these things -- to bring out what the locality was because of the saints in it, from the standpoint of their ennoblement -- what the Lord has made us, as before God; and then, what we are in spite of what our public history may be.
H.D'A.C. He knows the various places according to what saints are there. He views a town like Bethany as the place where Mary and Martha are. He knows where the dear saints are, and that place is characterised by the presence of the saints. Is that your thought?
J.T. Quite so. On the other hand, He may be in a place without saying He has come because of them, for He has large affairs; but He is there, and He accepts what is there. In the house of Simon the *leper* there was no great distinction. It is really what attaches to each one of us, if we own it -- we were lepers.
H.B. No doubt his leprosy had been healed, but I suppose this was the public character that attached to him.
J.T. The leprosy would not be active, or the Lord would not be there.
S.L. The first thing is to own what we were.
J.T. Yes; you do not deny what your public history has been. You have been saved notwithstanding, and God is glorified in this.
{245}
Ques. Does the acceptance of the outside view depend on the appreciation of the ennoblement -- the inside?
J.T. Yes, we accept it. Whatever your reputation may be, you are worse even than that.
Rem. "Of whom I am chief", (@1 Timothy 1:15).
J.T. Nobody, perhaps, would have said that of Paul, save himself.
Ques. Is that the Ephesian position? "Who were dead in trespasses and sins ... Wherefore remember", (@Ephesians 2:1,11). As we sing, 'Once far from Thee and dead in sin.'.
J.T. There might be a disposition to hide that, to think it is swallowed up by later circumstances, but what we were under God's eye, when met by grace, remains.
Rem. The saints are the only ones who accept the truth as to their natural state.
J.T. They know what is inside. There are thirteen things (@Mark 7) that proceed out of the heart of man; it is not simply that they are there, but they *proceed* out of it, showing that he does not control them. The gospel enables us to discern these things and to control them by the Spirit, but the natural man cannot control them.
S.L. Reference has been made to the continually repenting one.
J.T. Yes, the more these thirteen vicious inmates make themselves felt in your heart, the more you judge yourself.
S.L. The *continuance* of it is most important.
J.T. Yes, I think the more we are with God, the more we discern the vicious character of those things that proceed out of the heart of man.
Rem. Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit.
J.T. It is. The believer has the means in him for controlling them, for putting them to death, indeed.
L.D.B. How far does what Saul was told to do -- "Arise, and be baptised, and wash away thy sins,
{246}
calling on the name of the Lord" (@Acts 22:16) -- go, in relation to this in Matthew?
J.T. I think we have to take up a *public* attitude as to our sins and associations. He fell to the ground and was led into the city, but he did not yet take up a public attitude in regard to his course, although he may have judged it inwardly. You are never clear of guilt before men till you take up a public attitude in regard to it, and that is in baptism. "He that believeth and *is* baptised shall be saved".
L.D.B. Still, do you not have to recognise that sin once marked you, as in Simon the leper here?
J.T. You never forget that while down here. Paul tells us what he was, but the Lord had mercy on him though he was "an insolent, overbearing man", (@1 Timothy 1:13). He never forgot that he was the chief of sinners, and it would bear upon him in his relations with the brethren. He was "not meet to be called an apostle", he says (@1 Corinthians 15:9).
H.D'A.C. He does not say, 'I was', but "I am", the chief of sinners;(@1 Timothy 1:13 - 15).
Rem. He spoke of himself as "less than the least of all saints", (@Ephesians 3:8).
J.T. The fact that you are a leper remains, but the Lord does not think less of you for that; as in the case of the woman in @Luke 7, He knows that as forgiven much we love much, and so He is willing to be in our houses, in spite of our public history.
E.P. Would the consequence of all these disabilities you have been speaking of enhance in our eyes the blessedness of the One who loves us?
J.T. Yes; the more spiritual you are, the more sense you have of your sinful past and the dreadful things that are within, for "with me evil is there" (@Romans 7:21); and all this remains whilst we are down here. It is only as we walk in the Spirit that we do not fulfil the lust of the flesh. "Walk in the
{247}
Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh" (@Galatians 5:16); it is *always there*.
W.C.G. Paul also says, "In me ... good does not dwell" (@Romans 7:18). Would the consciousness of that give us very great patience in our dealings with each other?
J.T. To judge yourself in that way is a great preservative; it tends to keep you lowly and on the alert. "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit", (@Galatians 5:25). It is in *walking* in the Spirit that you overcome.
J.T. You see now the situation at Bethany -- according to John -- is that they are not only ennobled in the Lord's mind, but they are equal to the position, they *make Him* a supper. It does not specify who 'they' includes, for it refers to the *conditions* at Bethany, not simply to Lazarus or Mary. Earlier Martha received Him into her house, that was *her* opportunity; but when *they* made Him a supper -- that characterises the place -- it was made *there*.
S.L. So the consciousness of our disability should be always present, but there is a state that the Lord would lead us into, where we are at home with Himself, and conscious of our suitability to Him.
Ques. These evil features are still in us, and liable to act if we yield to them, which we sometimes do; is that sin?
J.T. If we yield to them it is. "Sin that dwelleth in me"; as the thing works, it is sin for which you are responsible; but you can, by the Spirit, control "your members". Hence the writer says, "So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God" (@Romans 7:25) -- he controls his mind; "I myself". He did not identify himself with the sin that worked in him, but he controlled his mind to serve the law of God.
In @John 12 the Lord's death is in view: "Six days before the Passover" referred to a date of very great
{248}
importance. Before it He "came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus".
H.D'A.C. He who had *died*; that was what characterised him.
J.T. Yes; he was no longer living in Bethany, as a politician or a social man, he was no longer alive in relation to *this* world.
H.D'A.C. He was raised from the dead.
J.T. Yes; as in @Colossians 3:1 - 3, I suppose: "If then ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above ... for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God". Dead as regards this world, but alive to God.
W.C.G. The Son of God is glorified in our eyes as we apprehend chapter 11.
J.T. Yes, that chapter is the basis of this, Bethany being in view at the outset -- "Lazarus of Bethany", he was *of the place*; so it is to bring out what was in that place. These people are in it in the light of the glory of God, and the glory of the Son of God. That is how we are to be in a locality, that is the setting; the Lord knew what was there and came in connection with it. Lazarus does not represent an unbeliever brought into life. The man in @Luke 7 was raised, but he is not called by name; he was given back to his mother. It is not that he was raised up in a locality, that is not the point; the point is, he was *given to his mother*. As to Lazarus, the word is, "Loose him, and let him go" -- he is dependable. Where was he going? Sometimes young souls go to places that would hurt them, Lazarus would not go to such places -- he can be trusted, hence he is at Bethany when the Lord comes there.
Ques. Would giving the young man back to his mother suggest the assembly?
J.T. It suggests that he needed care, but Lazarus is trustworthy.
{249}
W.C.G. The apostle's conflict was to bring saints to this maturity; it fits in with Colossians.
J.T. Yes; maturity is the thing. The Lord knew Lazarus was there -- "Where Lazarus was" -- He came there in that connection.
W.C.G. So, "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God" (@1 John 5:5) -- would not that be parallel with this?
J.T. It would. Lazarus was like that. It is said of the Lord, in the previous chapter (chapter 11:54), that He went down to Ephraim, city near the desert. That is in keeping with the glory that shone; the Lord goes near the desert with His disciples, and sojourns with them, instead of moving openly amongst the Jews -- to a *city* called Ephraim.
Ques. Is it the normal end with all believers, to entertain the Lord? At the Lord's supper, does He entertain us, or do we entertain Him?
J.T. The assembly is His place. He comes in, that is the idea. It is, "my assembly"; He does not ask for the loan of anything there, it is His own. But here *they* made Him a supper; it was what they were doing; but He came in relation to Lazarus; it says, "Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him".
Rem. Zacchaeus began to entertain the Lord, did he not?
H.D'A.C. Yes. Lazarus was not at the table in his grave-clothes! Would you say that a sight of the glory would give us to understand what is suitable to the Lord?
J.T. Yes. The Lord comes in relation to saints in a place; but, on the other hand, if He is in a place He accepts what is there -- being "in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper" -- it is another side of the position. Lazarus, as you say, was not there in grave-clothes. They, including the napkin that was about his face, were taken off; the face of the risen
{250}
man was unveiled by the saints, by those that were present.
H.D'A.C. It is good to look at the saints in that light. It is just Christ that you find. The thought that covers the meeting is, a risen company. There is no death; death had been there, but it is there no longer.
Ques. Is it necessary to know Him as the resurrection and the life in order to make Him a supper?
J.T. I think all the light of chapter 11 enters into this service, but Lazarus represents the *dignity* of the company. We are risen "through *faith* of the working of God who raised him from among the dead", (@Colossians 2:12).
Rem. There is no entertaining in Matthew; only the anointing.
J.T. No, it is just what *the woman* did; and her name is not even given to us, that is to say, it is not a question of the inward dignity of the saints, but of the *thing* that happened there, what she did.
But in @John 12 what is in view is the dignity of the persons, what they can do. So that, from one point of view, you look at the assembly in a certain place, and you think of this brother and that brother, this sister and that sister -- that is quite right, their *names* involve what they are. But then, on the other hand, you lose sight of the persons, and think of the whole place and *what is done* in it. Matthew presents that side; not so much the persons -- it is what is done in the place. We are all responsible, as placed locally, so whoever does it, you want the suitable thing to be done.
H.D'A.C. What she did characterised the occasion.
J.T. That is what I thought. That is what He honoured, what was done in the place by *some* woman.
Rem. The saints are interested in the gospel, they are interested in men.
J.T. That is right. Paul and Barnabas preached
{251}
the gospel in certain places, and afterwards went back and ordained elders in every assembly. Doubtless they found happy Christians -- but what were they doing? They needed to be instructed as to what should be done. Elders are persons who know what should be done. Therefore, wheresoever the gospel is preached, what "this woman hath *done*" should be told; in principle it should be done in every assembly. That is, the Lord's dignity and rights should be recognised.
S.L. It was very exercising, what you said about the 'fifty' that we should have something in each of our localities to *give*.
J.T. The question is, how we treat the Lord in our localities. The woman here anointed His head; He said she anointed His *body*; she had a conception of the whole Christ, so to speak.
Rem. She came to Him.
Rem. So you see the inner condition of things in Lazarus and Martha and Mary, and the outward condition in Matthew.
J.T. Yes. The Lord links the woman's act with the gospel. I think it is intended to condemn the spirit of the hierarchical system, in connection with the preaching of the gospel; what this woman did would stand over against that. She would not have any other person anointed but Christ.
H.D'A.C. And we are told what was the effect of Mary's anointing -- "the house was filled with the odour of the ointment". A little different from "the house of Simon the leper".
Rem. I suppose that being occupied with such a Person would tend to produce in you that characteristic. Is that your thought?
J.T. That is what is in my mind. The evangelist might be asked by his converts, What shall we do? Well, he would tell them what this woman did -- that is what the Lord meant, I think. "Wheresoever this
{252}
gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her". It is not that *she* is preached; we do not preach any one but Christ, but we *speak* of her. If that was what she did, and the Lord thought so much about it, we must not have anything different from that.
H.D'A.C. He would have every convert as devoted to Him as Mary was.
J.T. @John 12 is hardly the assembly, but the principle of it is there. It is the remnant. The Lord had taken the disciples to a city near the desert, and He abode there. I suppose Ephraim may be taken to mean 'fruitfulness' -- "From me is thy fruit found", (@Hosea 14:8). The Lord would begin again outside places of reputation; God will begin over again with the remnant of Israel, and fill the world with fruit.
E.P. I suppose, in regard to @John 12, the thought would be to get all to honour the Son as they honour the Father. Is not that the point in the Supper?
J.T. It is the point in John. "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby". "I am the resurrection, and the life ... And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?" Martha said, "Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world". That was something. Then she goes to her sister -- she is set in movement in *that* light. But then at the grave the Lord speaks to His Father and says, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And _I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it" -- showing that God was brought in by the Son. The Son honours the Father -- He would bring in the work of God. It was the glory of the Son that
{253}
what He was doing was in respect of God; the glory of the Son is in that relation, I think.
H.D'A.C. It is beautiful how He calls attention to the One that sent Him continually!
J.T. Throughout John's gospel that is very prominent.
Rem. Is it not significant here that the house was not filled with the odour of the ointment until it was put on Christ? Many a thing is concealed in the heart of a brother, but it is not effective till he puts it on the Lord, then the house is filled with it.
J.T. Yes; it is a very fine suggestion -- the filling of the house; showing what comes from one who has a true appreciation of Christ.
Rem. And that one might be an obscure person.
J.T. Quite; but one obviously intelligent, because she *kept* the ointment, as if she had anticipated instinctively some opportunity like this. It was a *measured* thing, too; one of the most important things in the assembly of God is measurement. It is so in everything -- in the whole universe measurement must apply; but when you come to that which is so intrinsically pleasurable to God, you can see how essential measurement is. It is a *pound* here.
H.D'A.C. You are not to go beyond, or keep back what you have. She could not have known beforehand what the *effect* of that would be. She thought of Christ, and, to her astonishment no doubt, the whole house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
J.T. That is important, for young persons have little or no thought of what they say, as to what its effect may be in the assembly.
H.D'A.C. The utterance of a young brother filled with Christ may flood the whole meeting.
Ques. Is that the thought in the "unlearned" saying "Amen at thy giving of thanks", (@1 Corinthians 14:16)? He appreciates the import of what is said.
J.T. Quite so. When it is a question of participation
{254}
in the assembly in @1 Corinthians 14 you have measure -- "Let the prophets speak two or three". Then, "If anything be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace". The time has come for the first to sit down; he does not go beyond that, if something is revealed to another sitting by; for there is hidden principle at work which is to regulate all that happens, and you want to be very *sensitive* about that.
Ques. Do you not think we suffer often by comparison? Because I cannot give out what another can, I am silent.
J.T. I am sure we should be simple; and we need a sense of the inner working that controls. If something is given to another sitting by, the first should be silent. There is in the assembly the spirit of revelation, and that is what we should be on the alert about.
H.D'A.C. There might be a spirit of 'manifestation' that is by no means of God. There are from time to time movements which make much of spiritual manifestations, and later it is found that Satan is in them.
J.T. Quite so. You cannot think of unseemly occurrences where there is the Spirit of God. When the apostle refers to persons speaking with tongues, and no one understands, some thinking they are mad -- that is not the idea of measurement. In @1 Corinthians 14:30, where a brother is contemplated as speaking and something is revealed to another sitting there, the first is to be silent.
F.S. Would that suggest that if you were speaking, and you had no more support, you would sit down?
J.T. You are sensitive enough to feel that another has something. It suggests how much consideration we should have for others when ministering; we make room for such as God may use if they are present.
H.D'A.C. It cannot be the divine thought, in a
{255}
meeting of brothers, that only one brother should speak and bless God. If we occupy all the time in a lengthy prayer or address, we hinder the simple outflow of the Spirit. Perhaps the beginning of the prayer was in great power, but was it continued in the same power? Very often a good prayer or giving of thanks is spoiled because of its extension.
Ques. What do you think of Nicodemus and his "hundred pound weight" in @John 19?
J.T. It was more a question there of the quantity than the quality, I think. That was a public thing, and valuable as needed for the Lord's body.
Ques. Would the pound weight of ointment represent the measure of appreciation of Christ which had been built up in the soul?
J.T. That is what I thought. It was a *matured* thing -- she *kept* it, the Lord said.
Rem. There are not 'tears' here, as in @Luke 7.
J.T. No; it is a resurrection scene.
Ques. As regards the revealing, should we come together expecting something to be revealed to us, or should we come together to give what we have?
J.T. Both are true. The apostle says, "When ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm", (@1 Corinthians 14:26) etc. That is what you have got, that is the 'capital', so to say; but then there may be additions to that, so it goes on to say, "Let the prophets speak two or three ... And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches [assemblies] of the saints", (verses 29,32,33). I think that is to show that the assembly is an organised thing in which there is spiritual sensitiveness, and in which God is, and in which He operates by His Spirit.
Ques. What meeting does that refer to?
J.T. A meeting for ministry. When the saints come together, they make room for the gifts; and then the gifts make room for one another, and are so
{256}
sensitive as to recognise the leading of the Spirit.
Rem. I suppose that in those days they had the ministry by revelation -- they had not the New Testament.
J.T. Quite so, but I think the *principle* holds good.
Ques. Would you say a little about there being a revelation to another sitting there, and the first being silent; would that mean that you would not be in a hurry to come forward? or how would it work out practically?
J.T. What is contemplated is that the saints are together in subjection, but there is the recognition of the gifts; it is assumed that each has something. And then the prophets are to be governed in their numbers -- "two or three" -- which I think is a merciful regulation, so that we should not be too long. Then something is revealed to another, and the one speaking is sensitive enough to discern that, and he holds his peace to make room for the *fresh* movement of the Spirit.
H.D'A.C. The Spirit would not reveal anything to one sitting by, and at the same moment support the other in going on.
J.T. No; He would not. God is not the God of confusion. They would speak "one by one".
S.L. The third should be very sure; for, as you say, the Lord has considered for us, and the perfection of Scripture is wonderful.
G.R.G. Do you not think that we have largely overlooked such meetings as @1 Corinthians 14 contemplates?
J.T. I think so. Perhaps because of a fear of fleshly activity; but I am sure faith in the saints would overcome that, for it is a divinely-prescribed way of ministry.
Ques. When we come together on Lord's day morning, these restrictions are not upon us, are they?
{257}
The "pound of ointment" here might be the silent act of a sister.
J.T. Yes; of course at the meeting for the breaking of bread you are at liberty -- the rule of two or three is not imposed there, any number may give thanks to God briefly; but the rule applies if there be the ministry of the word.
H.D'A.C. There is so much in that expression, 'bless with the spirit'. The more there is of blessing God when we come together to break bread, I think, the more the edification. There is rather too much sometimes of speaking a word, but what we say to God in the way of blessing Him is, I believe, what He looks for.
G.R.G. Is not that contemplated too in the open meeting -- singing with the spirit, praying with the spirit, blessing with the spirit -- as well as ministry?
H.D'A.C. It might be more preferable than listening to a good many addresses. When the district comes together, it is wonderful to hear the brethren blessing God. We have not the opportunity, it may be, of going to their meetings -- they come to us -- and one after another in a few words blesses God. I believe, if we had more of that, it would be exceedingly edifying.
G.R.G. Singing, praising, and blessing, are for God; ministry is for us. There is ministry for God, and ministry for men.
S.L. "Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God" (@Ecclesiastes 5:1) -- that is a very sobering passage.
Ques. Why is the ointment said to be "very costly" here?
J.T. It alludes, spiritually, I suppose, to what it costs you to reach this.
Ques. Then in Matthew, it is said to be "very precious"; what is the difference?
J.T. In the one case, what it cost you is emphasized.
{258}
In the other case, whatever it may have cost you, it is *precious*. In Matthew the ointment was in an "alabaster flask"; we are assured that it was kept free from taint. This assurance may be assumed in Mary's case; what is noted in her is measurement -- intelligence as to how much was suitable -- and that it was costly.
{259}
NEARNESS TO CHRIST AND PUBLIC SERVICE (7)
@John 13:1 - 30
J.T. Chapter 12 deals with the Lord's service in relation to the remnant of Israel, in the light of the glory of God and the glory of the Son of God; applied to the church, it indicates the ennoblement of the saints in their local setting. It is a chapter full of suggestions of glory. All was in vain as regards Israel, so that Isaiah, who was a witness of the glory, is brought in to convey the divine mind in the governmental dealings of God with those who shut their eyes to the shining of the glory. "These things said Esaias", it says, "when he saw his glory and spake of him",. (verse 41).
Chapter 13 begins the instruction that views the same people, only in a church view. Earlier the Lord is seen serving His own; corresponding, I suppose, with the teaching regarding the servant in Isaiah, chapter 42. He was God's servant, but He is the servant of the saints as well. So that this chapter is introductory to the assembly; we learn assembly ways in the Lord -- the assembly viewed in its members, in family relationship. It is still before the feast of the passover, coming in closely on the scene at Bethany. The Lord, in the full consciousness of His own dignity and testimony, whence He came and whither He was going, lays aside His garments. It says, "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end. And during supper, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon, Iscariote, that he should deliver him up, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given him all things into his
{260}
hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God, rises from supper and lays aside his garments, and having taken a linen towel he girded himself: then he pours water into the washhand basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the linen towel with which he was girded". A marvellous statement!
H.D'A.C. Very full!
J.T. In His own consciousness of His personal dignity, whence He had come and whither He was going, and that all things were in His hands -- alongside that, the action of the devil in putting it into the heart of Judas to betray Him -- He laid aside His garments.
H.D'A.C. He was not going to God in the same way as He had come from God, exactly. He had now got His loved ones, He was not going alone.
J.T. He was "bringing his sheaves with him". (@Psalm 126:6).
E.P. What is the idea in laying aside His garments?
J.T. I suppose His garments denoted His dignity; they would be what became Him as the head of the house, so to speak. Now He disrobes, I suppose, as an object-lesson for us. In order to serve, one has to lay aside what may distinguish one. Whatever may distinguish you or dignify you, you lay that aside, you take up the attitude of a servant. The girding with a *linen* towel would assure those that are to be served of the utmost consideration. It was the best kind of a towel for the intended service.
H.D'A.C. No roughness about it.
J.T. No; and great absorbent qualities; removing the effects of the washing with the least possible discomfort. We are reminded of that. Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, I think, answered to it. He was conscious of his dignity and authority, but he associated with himself Sosthenes the brother;
{261}
that would assure the saints of the utmost consideration.
Ques. You mean in laying aside the official garments?
J.T. Well, "the *brother*" intimates that they will have the utmost consideration. The apostle showed, in writing to the Corinthians, that he had all the dignity of the apostle, but he assured them of the utmost consideration -- he associated with himself Sosthenes the brother; and moreover he sent Timotheus to them before he went himself, that they might learn his ways "as they are in Christ", (@1 Corinthians 4:17). That there should be nothing vindictive about him, he would use the utmost consideration. Whilst dealing firmly with the evil, there would be the utmost consideration for them. The first letter to the Corinthians, I think, involved the presence of the towel on his loins, he was girded with it; but the second, I believe, is the towel in its *application*, that is to say, he speaks of himself as having been down to the brink of death in chapter 1, that he might be armed with comfort to comfort others with the comfort he had himself of God -- that others might get that. Then he brings in what God is as seen in the covenant and in the ministry of reconciliation.
Rem. He speaks of being helpful to their joy, and not having dominion over their faith.
J.T. Yes; I thought of that, a fellow-helper of their joy. What impresses one here is the dignity of the Person, and that entering into what He is doing; nothing in the least degree detracted from His greatness, for He could never be less than He was; yet all that enters into His service.
Rem. It really only enhances His greatness.
J.T. In a moral sense. And then it is a "washhand basin", evidently a small vessel.
Ques. Would it be in contrast to the laver, to
{262}
which you had to be brought? This had to be carried.
J.T. Yes; it would be a portable vessel, I judge, and the washing is done by another. With the laver, I suppose, you do it yourself. That is to say, the laver is for the priests to look after themselves -- that is another side -- each one has to see to it that he is clean. Here it is the Lord doing it; there is no aid in the thing, no auxiliary service, He does it all Himself. He is not, like Martha, looking for someone to help Him in it.
Ques. What is the nature of this service?
J.T. I think, first of all, you are impressed with the fact that feet-washing is a *menial* kind of service. It is very essential to those who have to do with this world, but it is a menial kind of service. The Lord knew the part of the body that needed to be washed. It was no mere pretence of love, it was the most menial kind of service -- to wash the feet. It has the effect of detaching the person from the effects of his contact with the world.
H.D'A.C. I suppose water was poured from the washhand basin on the feet, according to the ordinary Eastern custom.
J.T. "He pours water into the washhand basin" -- it would be, I suppose, literally carried around; they were not even required to come to where it was. It says, He "began to wash the feet of the disciples ... He comes therefore to Simon Peter". They are not obliged to leave their position -- showing how intensely menial the service was. He would, I suppose, go round.
H.D'A.C. I had that service done to me in Nazareth; as soon as we entered the house, we were all treated like that. It was a simple act, but it brought home to one the lowliness of Him who was in the bosom of the Father, by whom all things were
{263}
created. Think of His doing it! The glory of the Person can never be forgotten.
J.T. The glory of the Person is all there, and really enters into it; it is *that* Person doing it, for it is specially mentioned that He knew "that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God". And now He has the feet of His own in His hands and this for an example, that whatever distinction we may have, all that is laid aside (not ceasing, of course, it is always there, but you are not displaying it), and one is able to serve.
H.D'A.C. There was great refreshment in it, was there not? Do you think it might have come into the Lord's mind, how He had His feet washed by the woman in @Luke 7?
J.T. No doubt He would be reminded of that little act of love; not that He learned anything from anybody. If He washed feet, you may be sure that no one ever did it like Him, not even that one, for His skill would enter into it.
H.D'A.C. It is one thing to have our feet washed, but how wonderful that that woman was allowed to wash the undefiled feet of Jesus! Think where our feet have run! His feet never ran where our feet have run. Wonderful to think of His stooping and taking our feet in His hands!
J.T. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings", (@Isaiah 52:7).
Ques. Would it be a service that would result in our being risen together with Him, as we were looking at it this morning?
J.T. Well, it would enable us to enter into that. This service brings out the false humility that we are very often conscious of. It says, "He comes therefore to Simon Peter", who says, "Thou shalt never wash my feet". In these cases the most serious side is that you place the Lord in a false position; you imply
{264}
that He is not doing what is right, just as Martha implied that the Lord was blameworthy, on account of Mary. You often notice that; the assumption is that we know better than the Lord. A false humility or piety is most objectionable. The Lord does not spare Peter. He says, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me" -- a very serious matter.
E.P. Is this the "washing of water by the word", (@Ephesians 5:26)?
J.T. I think it is; only the lesson here, would you not think, is the length to which love will go in service? "The word", of course, is a very great thing, which the Lord can employ at a distance or mediately. Here He is just with us, Himself, to impress us with the extent to which love would go.
H.D'A.C. "I am among you as he that serveth". We see the greatest of all servants in this chapter.
J.T. Yes; He impresses us with the fact that He is great; there is no question about that. "Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord, and ye say well, for I am so. If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet". I have no doubt the example is the most important feature of it.
Rem. He had to get very *near* them to do this.
Ques. Then how do we do it, what is the import of it?
J.T. The import, I think, is that one does not assume any official dignity among the saints. Of course there is that dignity which God puts on each of those who serve, but in serving the saints that is not in evidence; we see the skill with which love hides, so that the service should not be hindered, and that the served should understand that they are not less than the servant -- surely they are not less than the servant! Hence, Paul says to the Corinthians, in the first epistle, that all the servants were theirs (chapter 3:22), but in the second epistle he says,
{265}
"ourselves your servants for Jesus¬ sake", (chapter 4:5).
H.D'A.C. There was not much clericalism in that.
J.T. No, indeed; and I have no doubt the Lord saw the necessity there was that the apostle should go through bitter experience in the interval between the two letters, so that he might the more fully represent the Spirit of Christ in his service.
E.P. Do you think Stephanas is an example of this in his household? "They have *addicted* themselves to the ministry of the saints", (@1 Corinthians 16:15).
J.T. I am sure of that. One of the best services we can render to the Lord's people is, if we have got a house, to hold it for Him. "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord", (@Joshua 24:15). "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house", (@Acts 16:15).
Ques. Would you say that the Lord was not deterred by the antagonism of Satan in Judas, or the false humility of Peter?
J.T. That is a point in the chapter. Satan had already, as it says, entered into the heart of Judas to betray Him.
J.M. It was during supper, have you any thought as to that?
J.T. I think the Lord's position at the table would involve His dignity. He did not wait till supper was finished, showing the urgency of love that would even forgo the enjoyment of the supper to serve. It is very legitimate, of course, to sit at the table, but love forgoes that. You get a remarkable illustration of it, I think, in the book of Numbers. The ark had a most dignified place in the ordering of the tabernacle; it had to be carried carefully in the midst by the Kohathites; but when the necessity arose, that was given up. It was the right of the ark to have that dignity, but when they began to move from the mount of the Lord, the ark went before them to seek out a resting-place for them. There is
{266}
nothing in the instructions earlier in regard to this, showing that love goes beyond even its own ordering.
H.D'A.C. Even the finest feast, the Passover, could be for the moment forgotten in order to serve the saints with this higher thought of part with Christ.
J.T. It is very wonderful to see what love will do -- it *never* fails. Moses said to Hobab, "Come thou with us" (no doubt the natural relationship had something to do with that), "and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes" (@Numbers 10:29 - 32); but Hobab was not for that, he was a child of the wilderness, and would remain in the wilderness. And the ark steps out, so to speak; it went three days¬ journey to find a resting-place for the people -- that is love's service.
W.W. Is that why they had the cup at the Passover? There was no instruction for that. I was wondering whether in bringing in the cup love went beyond the instructions.
J.T. Well, I think the Lord took up the custom that had intervened. It was customary, I believe, in His time, to have a cup, and He just accepted it. I suppose the passover made room for whatever love had been developed in Israel. There never had been such a passover as the last one of which the Lord partook. In that there were two cups really; the cup of the passover, of which the Lord said He would never again drink in that way; then there was the cup He gave the disciples, a new cup; that was love's cup. It is the one we have got, "the cup of blessing". But the book of Numbers is extremely interesting and touching, as bearing on what we have here, that love in Christ goes beyond anything that is prescribed -- it is immeasurable; there is nothing to stand in its way, nothing that cannot be met by love, it never fails.
H.B. Is that why it was "*three days¬* journey"?
J.T. Yes; I think it is really death and resurrection. When the ark moved, Moses said, "Rise up,
{267}
Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee"; and when the ark rested he said, "Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel", (@Numbers 10:35,36). Love, going out, scattered the enemies, that is to say, doing all the pioneering work, all the rough work; then it returned to satisfy itself so to say, amid the thousands of Israel.
H.D'A.C. Is that what you meant by referring to death and resurrection? The ark going before and meeting all the power of the enemy, then returning to rest.
J.T. That is what I thought. You see it in @John 18; the Lord said, "If ... ye seek me, let these go their way" -- the Lord went out and met the enemy. Then in chapter 20 He returns, so to say, to the thousands of Israel. Moses ever conveys to us, in these cases, the mind of God; but it is put poetically, and when you have a thing put poetically, you have, I think, *feelings*.
Ques. Would "part with me" include the teaching of Numbers?
J.T. Well, quite so; the Lord would have us with Him. It is not simply now that He would have part with us, but love wishes us to have all it has. What is He going to have? He is going to have all the best, and love would have us share everything, all He has. You do not want to miss that, it is a wonderful thought -- "part with me".
H.D'A.C. You cannot limit that then?
J.T. No, I think not. Love would share, as we sing, 'all it possesses with its loved co-heirs', (`249:2). He would have us there without anything to interfere with the enjoyment.
R.W.G. What a marvellous scope of blessing that is!
J.T. Yes, indeed; and so it is worth while to let
{268}
the Lord have His way. We can do no better than let love have its way; love will do its best for us.
Ques. Is love the moving spring in connection with everything?
J.T. Oh, it is! it is what God is. As you see what God is, your wisdom is to let Him have His way. Love has taken form in Christ; that is to say, all that God is has come into outwardly small circumstances. The ark was a very small vessel, relatively, was it not?
H.D'A.C. Yes; but it had eyes. The ark went before to find a resting-place; it was better than Hobab.
J.T. Yes. It brings out, I think, how love can adapt itself to us, that it comes in in such a small way that it is within the range of everybody, however small he may be -- I think that is the suggestion in it. Whichever way you look at it, there is more, there is always a half -- two and a half by one and a half by one and a half -- it is marked by broken measurement, meaning that, however you look at Christ, as here in the flesh, He is *always greater* than He appears to be, there is always something greater.
Ques. How do you mean He is always greater than He appears to be?
J.T. John presents Him as coming here, the Word become flesh; he tells us how great He is. Every believer today should study John, for the enemy's constant effort is to belittle the Person of Christ; hence John begins, "In the beginning *was* the Word" -- that is His eternal personality. "And the Word was with God, and the Word was God", showing His personal distinctness and glory. "The same was in the beginning with God" -- so as to strengthen what is stated. Further, "All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men". Then it goes on, later, "The Word became
{269}
flesh, and dwelt among us ... full of grace and truth"; that is, that great Person became flesh and dwelt among men, so that He could be contemplated by them. But whatever He seems to be outwardly, you never forget the statement of the first verse that He was in the beginning with God and was God. I think chapter 4 brings it out: He sat as He was on the well. What was He? He was weary with His journey; that is to say, there was the appearance of a Man, and the woman did not see anything beyond that. He sat just *as He was*, it says. He did not in any way seek to disguise His weariness, which shows the reality of His humanity, but He says to her, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water". (@John 4:6,10). We have thus the idea, I think, of the 'half'.
Rem. There is no limit to the extension.
H.D'A.C. There is always something more.
E.P. In connection with our washing one another's feet -- sometimes we are told that this is unconsciously done. The Lord says, "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them", as if it was to be calculated and deliberate; is that so?
J.T. I am sure it is so. The thought here is to impress on us the menial character of the service, but that love goes that length, so that He *comes* to Simon Peter, showing that the movement is on the part of the one who serves.
H.D'A.C. It is a service open to us more than we may think. Do you not think many a sister has washed the saints¬ feet?
J.T. It is said of one eligible for the list, "If she have washed the saints¬ feet", (@1 Timothy 5:10).
The references to Judas are very solemn: "During supper, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon, Iscariote, that he should
{270}
deliver him up"; and later we read, "Having said these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Verily, verily, I say to you that one of you shall deliver me up". He was conscious of the presence of Judas -- of that spirit -- Satan having put it into his heart to betray Him. It says in verse 27 that the Lord having given him the morsel, "Satan entered into him".
Ques. Do you gather from that, that Satan was present?
J.T. I think that he had made inroads, in that he had put the thing into Judas¬ heart; but I do not think he was there till the Lord gave Judas the sop, and then, it says, Satan entered into him.
H.D'A.C. He ought not to have taken that sop.
J.T. No. On the Lord's part His attitude towards Judas was unchanged, but Judas¬ determination to betray his Master was nevertheless unchanged, and so Satan entered into him.
Rem. I suppose the Lord allowed it.
J.T. It could not, of course, have happened otherwise. As we were saying yesterday, one of the most solemn things is that the demons besought the Lord to allow them to enter into the swine, and He allowed it -- the state warranting it was there; for the service represented the Jews; and I suppose it was the same here, the state was suitable for it, so the Lord allowed it.
H.D'A.C. The sop was given to the principal guest, was it not? and that act of wonderful kindness on the part of the Lord ought to have broken Judas down on the spot. If he had said, Lord, I am all wrong, that would have saved him at the last moment, Satan would not have entered into him then.
J.T. The element of repentance would have shut out Satan.
{271}
H.D'A.C. But the Lord was "troubled in spirit"; He was never troubled in heart, never frightened, but His spirit was troubled. Would not the presence of anyone like Judas now trouble the spirits of saints near to God, and come into exposure in the end? Such an one would have to go out.
J.T. Yes; the light was so great, he went out, and it was night. Another feature is the position of the loved one, that, whilst there is one into whom Satan can enter, there is one whom Jesus loves, He loved them all, "Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end"; but then we read that Simon Peter makes a sign to the one leaning on Jesus¬ bosom, to ask who it might be of whom He spoke; there is one who is in the bosom, and who can lean on the breast.
Ques. What is the difference between those two thoughts?
J.T. I think the word 'bosom' suggests an inlet, something that receives. The loved one found that out, that there was great receptiveness there -- he was in it; it does not say he was leaning there, but he was *in* it. And then he leaned on the *breast*, which would point to solidity and reliability.
Rem. It never says, the disciple who loved Jesus, but the one "whom Jesus loved".
J.T. Yes. Whilst He loves us all, whatever may mark us, yet He reserves the right to love certain ones *specially*, that is to say, there is something peculiarly lovable there. We cannot deny divine Persons a right to appreciate what is lovable.
H.D'A.C. That has to do with the way we reply to it; John is the proper reply.
J.T. He must have been, in the eyes of the Lord, very lovable, which is calculated to show that divine Persons love what is lovable. Divine Persons love all, but then they have also the right of loving what
{272}
is specially lovable, hence it is a question of whether I am that.
Rem. We have no word of its being John; he never says so.
J.T. I suppose it was understood by the early christians that it was John, and the spirit of the book would indicate that he is the one.
R.W.G. It speaks of Daniel as being "greatly beloved".
J.T. That is a very similar passage, and it only brings out what we are saying, that he was lovable; in Daniel we have the features of lovableness.
Ques. What would you say about the one whom Jesus beholding loved? (@Mark 10:21).
J.T. He was just a type of what there was in God's creation, in spite of the effect of sin, that was pleasing. There was nothing lovable there, in the sense in which we are speaking of it.
H.D'A.C. That is quite different from what we have here.
J.T. Quite. Here it is one who is in the bosom. The idea of the bosom, as already said, is that it is receptive.
Ques. Is that where John learned, and we may learn, to wash the saints¬ feet?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Does leaning on the breast correspond in any way with the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate? John got the knowledge as leaning on the breast.
J.T. I think that is the very thing; he got the mind of the Lord. The light is there in Christ, and the one that is in the bosom got it. But he leaned on the breast -- he relied on the love of Christ, and so may you. If you come to a meeting with the desire to serve the saints, you can rely on the love of Christ.
{273}
Lean hard on it; He will give you something to say.
H.D'A.C. And He certainly relied on the love of Christ when he wrote that book; no one who was not leaning on the breast of Jesus could ever have written that wonderful book -- the gospel of John.
J.T. No. In your ministry, if the brethren ask you anything, lean hard on the love of Christ, He will stand by you, He will never fail you.
{274}
NEARNESS TO CHRIST AND PUBLIC SERVICE (8)
@John 13:21 - 38
J.T. I have been thinking of the part Satan has in the circumstances depicted here, and how solemn and searching it is that one so near the Lord outwardly should become the agent of such treachery. The part Satan has in the scene is due to the inlet he had through the avaricious state of one; it was not hatred of Christ or opposition to Him, but covetousness. There is no doubt a prophetic allusion to the history of the assembly in the case of Judas; the treachery that has marked her in that system which claims to represent her on earth. And then the denial of the Lord by Peter presents another feature of the history of the assembly -- both running on to the end. In the one, the treachery that would sell Him for worldly gain, in the other, *denial* through self-confidence.
Rem. And both these phases run on to the end.
J.T. Yes; and then alongside of that, the love of Christ runs on. The passage may be profitably compared with the addresses to the assemblies. Thyatira, I think, closes with a state of treachery and unfaithfulness; and Sardis is that in which the Lord is denied. Philadelphia had not denied. He said, Thou "hast not denied my name" (@Revelation 3:8); it stands over against the general features of Protestantism. So that the action of Satan is very solemn, the latitude he has for acting against Christ. But the love of Christ is concurrent with all this, and remains right through. He finds an outlet for it in Philadelphia, but to Laodicea He appeals to buy of Him, and, with all that, He is standing at the door and knocking -- His love remains to the end. The practical lesson is, I am sure, that there should be no inlet for Satan, in the company of
{275}
those who seek to keep the Lord's word and do not deny His name. The full guarantee against this is the presence of love, "love amongst yourselves", known in Christ, but a *known* thing, prevalent amongst us.
E.P. I suppose that is what the Lord liked so much in Philadelphia, not only appreciation of Himself, but of one another.
J.T. Those of the synagogue of Satan "who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie", of them He says, "Behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee", (@Revelation 3:9). There are "the depths of Satan", (@Revelation 2:24) and now "the synagogue of Satan". Brethren ought to be aware of the awful conditions existing, the footing that Satan has in the profession. The synagogue of Satan implies an acknowledged religious setting.
Ques. Do you mean the "depths of Satan" show the hold he has on it?
J.T. Yes; how deep-rooted the thing is. Then the organised religious thing, too, the synagogue, is not merely an ordinary one, it is Satan's.
Rem. That would be the system.
J.T. The religious system. Yet the Lord has got such power in His hand that He is going to make those who are of that to come and worship before the feet of the saints and to "know that I have loved thee". They say they are Jews, that is to say, those who claim to be the ancient people of God, but they are not, they lie; however cleverly they cover it up, they lie; they have no hereditary link with God whatever. He denies their claims.
Ques. You say Peter represents the assembly; do you mean the professing assembly?
J.T. Yes; the public body. Protestantism, as we speak of it, is marked by the denial of the Lord's name, and taking on other names; whereas Philadelphia did
{276}
not do that, "Thou ... hast not denied my name", "Thou hast kept the word of my patience", (verse 10).
Rem. Though, of course, Peter was a genuine soul.
J.T. Yes; but he is a *type*, I think, of the history of the assembly, the public body.
Ques. Is there any reason why it is said of Philadelphia in the negative, "Thou ... hast not denied my name"?
J.T. I think because of what we have remarked, that the others were doing that; Philadelphia was not like the mass. All around, His name is being denied, whereas those who love the Lord and know His love do not do that.
L.D.B. Is it not to be noted that, while there was one there who would deliver Him up -- and the Lord was troubled in spirit -- there was also one disciple whom He loved, who was in His bosom?
J.T. I think he corresponds with Philadelphia; would you not say so?
L.D.B. I was thinking that was, perhaps, how you would view it. So that the Lord has that which is particularly near Him -- in His bosom -- set over against "one of you shall deliver me up".
J.T. John forecasts those who seize the position love opens up to us; the Lord's supper, I think, is the door into that. He indicates an inlet to the place of love, because that is what the bosom suggests -- it is a receptive thought; there is an inlet for the saints, it is available to us, and John took advantage of it, others did not. It is available to all, as has often been remarked, but all do not take advantage of it.
Ques. Might you have your feet washed, and yet miss it?
J.T. Well, I think having your feet washed is that you have part with Christ, that is what He says. We must not assume that the actual feet-washing removes the distinction that there would be through
{277}
spiritual stature. We all may have our feet washed and have part according to our measure, but some may have taken hold of the opened door into the sphere of love. John did that; he was in the bosom; I think in a general way, as I said, he foreshadows Philadelphia. You see what is opened up in the Lord's supper; the truth of the assembly is entered into. Thus we are in the place of light, the place of apprehending the mind of the Lord; hence the overcomer is made a pillar in the *temple* of God. What is promised is in keeping with what we value now.
Ques. Is that why we have the breast mentioned in the second instance -- something to lean on?
J.T. Yes; the more you apprehend the bosom, I think, the more you lean on the breast, on the *reliability* of the love of Christ. What can we do now in the presence of the inroads of evil on every side, the efforts of Satan? His power is increasing, how can we hope to go on to the end, save as we learn the reliability of the love of Christ? He loves to the end, He never falters, He can be relied upon.
F.I. So that, with regard to John, the intelligence there was the outcome of affection.
J.T. That is how it stands.
F.I. So I suppose, with regard to ourselves, there is no true spiritual intelligence unless the affections are in movement in relation to Christ.
J.T. You are in the position of obtaining the mind of the Lord, the Urim and the Thummim, as was remarked last night; I suppose what God is as revealed in perfection in manhood. They have been interpreted as meaning light and perfection. God is light, but He is light in a perfect Man, and so, accessible. Paul, I think, emphasises the reliability of the love of Christ, He "loved me", he says, "and gave himself for me", (@Galatians 2:20). "The Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known", (@2 Timothy 4:17). That is, there is to be no giving in,
{278}
no surrender, the thing is to be presented fully; that is what is in the Lord's mind, so that there is no compromise, whatever it costs you. The Lord sees what you are aiming at. "The Lord stood with me, and strengthened me", he says, "that by me the preaching might be fully known". Not simply that the preaching might be fully known, but that it might be in the one the Lord deputed to make it known. There would be much rivalry; many would set Paul aside, but the Lord stood by him, that by *him* the preaching might be fully known.
L.D.B. Was it at the time of his defence?
J.T. I think so. "At my first answer no man stood with me", he says, "but all men forsook me", (@2 Timothy 4:16). He stood before the emperor in whose hands all the power of the world was, a lone man standing there. "At my first answer", he says, "all men forsook me"; he was left alone, he was brought into the position of Christ on the cross; He was left alone, "they all forsook him, and fled" (@Mark 14:50); but then Paul said, "the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me". Well, I think that is what the chapter would encourage us in, the reliability of Christ, that His power is available and His love never fails.
Rem. I suppose a sense of the reliability of the love of Christ enables us to stand against these principles. While we speak of them as 'outside', they might break out among us.
J.T. Yes. The practical thing is to see that in none of our companies is there any room for Satan. First, he put the thing into the heart of Judas, then he came himself into that heart.
Rem. You spoke of self-confidence.
J.T. That was the secret of Peter's denial; pride of heart, that he would do more than the others. "If all shall be offended in thee, *I* will never be offended", (@Matthew 26:33). These principles may break in, even although we are christians; that fact does
{279}
not save us. No one of us is any more a believer than Peter, yet he fell under the power of Satan.
F.I. Does it go to show that however near you may be to those who are near to Christ, yet unless you are near to Him yourself you will fail? For Peter was near to John, and got his information through John.
J.T. He got it second-hand, and that does not preserve us.
Ques Would it be in the bosom that we get the 'word'? "Thou .. hast kept my word". (@Revelation 3:8).
J.T. Yes; just so. The bosom is the place where you may enjoy the love. The apostle says, "to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge", (@Ephesians 3:19). If you know it, you will *rely* upon it, so that the one who is in the bosom leaned on the breast. He leaned on the breast to get the light, and the Lord did not fail him.
Rem. The word in @1 John 5:21 would be very wholesome in regard to all that, "Little children, keep yourselves from idols". I was thinking of what it says in @Colossians 3:5, "covetousness, which is idolatry".
J.T. If one has means, and borders on the world, as people do, it leads to idolatry. That gives place to the enemy.
Rem. John seems to have been occupied with the Lord's love to him. But the Lord says to Peter, "Art thou attached to me?" (@John 21:17) as if he was still self-confident; but John was confident of the Lord's love to him.
J.T. Yes; while John relied on the Lord's love, Peter relied on his own. These are very weighty facts for us in view of the activities of Satan now. We were noticing in @Luke 8 how the demons that were cast out of the man besought the Lord that He would allow them to enter into the swine. If they had asked the Lord to allow them to return to the man,
{280}
or to enter into a man like him, it would have been a different matter; but in asking to go into the swine, no doubt there is an allusion to an unclean state; it referred to the unrepentant Jews, no doubt, and it is, alas! applicable now to christendom. We read of the sow that was washed returning to her wallowing in the mire; (@2 Peter 2:22). Men have returned, although nominally christians, to what they were before christianity came in, and Satan is aware of that, and can enter into that state of things. And the solemn thing is, that the Lord *allowed* it; the demons entered into the swine, and then there was the rush into the lake. I believe that is the explanation of the rapidity with which things are moving now towards apostasy; the state of things is such that the Lord allows Satan scope. Later on a strong delusion will be sent.
God wants us to stand against all that as in the strength of the love of Christ. He loves us to the end, and He says, I will make them to know it, too; so that we want to know that love -- it is open to us. I believe the Lord's supper is revived for that very end, that the saints should know how to get into the love of Christ, and to rely on it.
Rem. John would help us in his letters.
J.T. Quite so. If the saints take up that place through the Lord's supper, I feel that, as we are proving, the love of Christ would provide what is necessary. He calls them 'children' here, meaning that there would be nothing lacking in a parental way.
R.W.G. The Lord in presenting His love like this well knows what the value of His love to us is, as reliable.
J.T. You get all that is essential to support you locally, and generally, as the saints take up the Lord's supper and all that it leads into. As we may "minister to the Lord" in connection with it, we shall find all needed supply. There will be a supply
{281}
of ministry and all furnishings, so that we may continue to the end.
Rem. It is very encouraging that the Lord says, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee", (@John 21:22).
J.T. Yes. There is doubtless the intimation that John, or rather what he represents, would continue to the end.
Ques. Is not that the way in which revival of affection to the Lord would be brought about, in appreciation of His supper?
J.T. Yes; I think John suggests to us the place we all *may* take. There is an inlet to the love of Christ; it is available, and in it there is light. Those that are there get light; they *know* things. It is in that connection that the truth develops and the light shines; and then ability to disseminate the truth is furnished. Love will fail in nothing. Here there was one in it. It does not say the Lord put him there; it was just that he *was* there, meaning that he took advantage of what was open to him.
Ques. Why is it that "love amongst yourselves" is connected with the thought of disciples rather than with brethren?
J.T. I suppose it is to be maintained *outwardly*; what we are as brethren is more private. Of course, we are called Brethren now as a designation, but it is really a family term. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves". That is how we are marked off, not by the fact that we have right order in our meetings, but that we have love in them -- love amongst ourselves.
Ques. What is the thought of the parental care of the Lord in relation to the children?
J.T. Well, the section, verses 33 - 35, begins "Children" -- it is a family thing. I think it is like a father leaving his children; indeed the Lord's supper is in that very same setting. The 'house-father'
{282}
was leaving His children, and they could not come with Him then, but their safeguard lay in that they had love. That is what we want, to have the thing as a *known quantity* amongst us.
Ques. Would @Acts 20 show how it worked out with Paul? It says they ardently kissed him, but he embraced them first.
J.T. I think so. I think that chapter shows the love in which the assembly was to be bathed, as it were. He begins by embracing them; it is a very impressive form of expressing affection. He enfolded Eutychus in his arms, too, and then the elders fell on his neck and kissed him, as he left them; and in this chapter we have the Lord's supper. The chapter stands out in that way. "And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread", (verse 7). It was not a local thing exactly; there were distinguished brethren there from many parts of the world, including Paul himself. Some of the names are given, but the 'we' covers them all, a very impressive way of expressing mutual feeling -- *we* came together to break bread. It is indeed a wonderful chapter; in it we get "all the counsel of God" (verse 27); also "the blood of his own" (verse 28), that is to say, God expressing at what a cost He has secured the assembly. So that the chapter, as it were, would bathe the saints in divine love; a known love, an expressed love.
Ques. Is that the very atmosphere for coming together for the Supper?
J.T. Exactly; and it is to be continued; the Supper supports it.
L.D.B. So that when the grievous wolves would threaten the saints, they could then lean on the Lord as having known "the bosom of Jesus". It is in that chapter he says that grievous wolves shall enter in, "not sparing the flock".
J.T. "Also of your own selves", he says, "shall men arise", (verses 29,30).
{283}
L.D.B. They would thus be called to lean hard on the Lord, as knowing His love.
J.T. I think that all fits in here, for we have the parental term, 'children', and the wisdom of it -- to learn how to love as He loved, for it is important to learn *how* to love.
Rem. "Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh", (@Song of Songs 4:6). It is suffering love. A company formed after this order would become very attractive to one seeking companionship.
J.T. There would be warmth in it. Mark teaches us how to do things in our levitical service after the model of Christ -- He did "all things well" (@Mark 7:37); but John teaches us how to love as Christ loved -- "as I have loved you".
Ques. Would you say a little more about the setting of the Supper in relation to the thought of the house-father?
J.T. Well, it grew out of the passover; it was a household matter, and He was the Head of the house, so all communications would be from that point of view. Notwithstanding the treachery of Judas, He goes on. He was troubled in spirit, He felt it deeply, but He went on caring for His own; His service includes what we have in this chapter and chapters 14 to 17. We have all that in spite of Judas¬ treachery and Peter's denial. The Lord was not deterred; He went on. His love would not be turned aside; He went on to furnish them. He was going away, and they could not come then, and He is laying down the principles by which they should be preserved and known as His disciples in this world.
J.M-n. It says in @Psalm 55:12,13, "For it is not an enemy that hath reproached me -- then could I have borne it ... but it was thou, a man mine equal" and in @Psalm 41:9 "mine own familiar friend, in
{284}
whom I confided ... hath lifted up his heel against me".
J.T. Very affecting! How the Lord felt it!
Rem. Judas was not present though in those chapters to which you refer.
J.T. No; he had gone out.
Ques. Does that mean he was not present at the Supper?
J.T. I do not think you could say he was not present, for @Luke 22:21 expressly says he was. "The hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table". That means, there was power there to do things against Him -- "the hand of him that betrayeth me"; the Lord knew that. But he went out, as it says here.
W.H. Does it suggest that, through the activity of love, that element would go out?
J.T. I think so. The light shone so resplendently that he went out. Think of what Judas carried out with him into the world! Not only was he going to turn Christ over to His enemies, but he was going to bring all the secrets of Christ and garnish the world with them. That is what enters into the position here. Later, John says, "Many false prophets are gone out into the world", (@1 John 4:1).
L.D.B. "Mine own familiar friend", as was said -- he went out.
J.T. Yes. The Romish system is embellished with some of the finest expressions you can get. Terms that properly belong to the true church are made to adorn the false one. It is all through treachery; these things should not have been disclosed to unconverted people.
R.W.G. It has been said that the most subtle form of evil is imitation of the truth.
J.T. Yes; and the solemn thing is that God *allows* the imitation of it. It becomes seemingly so
{285}
real that many are carried away by it. Imitation is dreadfully effective at the present time.
J.M-n. When the Lord said, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him", what was in His mind?
J.T. I think the work of the cross; the Lord was going to be glorified in a *moral* sense. In chapter 12:23 He says, "The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified"; that alluded, I think, to His place in relation to the whole of mankind. Here I think it is a different kind of glory; the moral glory that shone in the way He died, in the way He took the cup in perfect obedience from His Father's hand -- that the Son of man should express such holy obedience to the extent of dying. God is glorified in the obedience, in the wonderful expression of what man should be according to God, even to the extent of dying. Then He says, "If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself" -- not yet the public glory, but what He has in God. And it would be *immediate*; it should not be deferred, like the glory in chapter 12. It refers to the present time. I have no doubt that what has accrued to Christ at the present time is all bound up in what He would have 'immediately'.
Ques. Does that follow on "it was night"?
J.T. It was night into which Judas went. "This is your hour, and the power of darkness", (@Luke 22:53). It was not night inside.
Ques. Is there that in the saints that God can delight in?
J.T. Surely. "That ye love one another; as I have loved you" -- that is the idea, that you love *like Christ*. We have in @1 John 3:16, "Hereby we have known love, because he has laid down his life for us; and we ought for the brethren to lay down our lives". That is the way we show it, and the result is we lay down our lives for the brethren. You
{286}
not only love, but you love like Him. Then we have the quantity, the thing itself as known amongst us, that we have love *among ourselves*. But the Lord has to say, "The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice".
Ques. Is that the thought of a morning coming?
J.T. There may be an allusion to that. If it be an allusion to the dispensation, it would just refer to that. We get "Verily, verily" here. Certainty as to a most sorrowful occurrence. Elsewhere there is a reference to more than one crowing. @Luke 22:34 says, "The cock shall not crow today before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me". @Mark 14:30 says, "Today, in this night, before the cock shall crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me". It is, I think a dispensational thing. The first crowing would be past; the threefold denial would extend on to later, I suppose.
Ques. The second cock-crowing was the morning cock-crowing, was it not?
J.T. Yes; so the period is lengthened out in Mark. The three times is a complete thing. If we take it up in a dispensational way, it is the complete testimony to the denial, it covers the whole ground. Of course, the recovery of Peter is another matter, but the dispensational thing, I believe, means that the denial goes on to completion.
{287}
NEARNESS TO CHRIST AND PUBLIC SERVICE (9)
@John 14:15 - 31
J.T. As we have had Christ's love for us emphasised in chapter 13, so our love for Him is more evident in this chapter. Perhaps we might dwell on this side tonight. His love for us, and our love for one another, occupied us in chapter 13. There are two thoughts in the psalm we have already dwelt upon (@Psalm 133); one refers to what is personal, and the other is magnificence. The psalm says that unity is "like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard, that ran down to the hem of his garments". Then, "As the dew of Hermon that descendeth on the mountains of Zion". There is what is personal, tracing it in Christ; the oil on His head, coming down on the beard, then down to "the hem of his garments". On the other hand there is the largeness and grandness of it, as depicted in mount Hermon, and the mountains of Zion.
These things enter into these chapters. They refer to the Spirit come down to His own, from Him in heaven. The Spirit is given to us, is here with us, and affords a means for the Father and the Son to come to us. Whilst chapter 13 emphasises Christ's love to us and our love to one another, chapter 14 challenges us as to our love for Christ; so that it says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter". The Comforter is here, not coming as Christ came in, but in relation to a state formed -- "if ye love me".
Ques. So that the Holy Spirit is spoken of as the Comforter in relation to that state, you mean?
{288}
J.T. Yes; for aside from the state of love for Christ, the Comforter would hardly be welcomed, there would be no felt need of Him; it is the absence of Christ, the absence of One whom we love, that inspires the thought of the need of *another* Comforter.
Ques. While the commandment to love one another is in chapter 13, would it rise higher in chapter 14?
J.T. I think so. You have descending love in chapter 13, then horizontal love, that is, love to one another; then ascending love in chapter 14, that is, love for Christ.
G.R.G. I suppose that when the disciples were all gathered together, when the Holy Spirit came, they were there as in affection for Christ.
J.T. That was what marked them. They saw Him go up; that is not given prominence so much at the end of Luke, although there He is carried up into heaven. In the beginning of the Acts, they *saw* Him go up, and "a cloud received him out of their sight" (verse 9), that is, the *faith* era begins as He is taken out of their sight. Now it is a question of faith, which corresponds with the first part of this chapter. "Ye believe on God, believe also on me". (verse 1). Those that saw Him go up, it says, returned to the city, and were in the upper room, where were the apostles, and the mother of the Lord and other women -- every evidence of love for Christ. And, moreover, they were governed by His commandments (at least by the Scriptures) in the selection of an apostle. There was every care that all should be according to the mind of the Lord, that man's will should not rule in the selection of an apostle; he was to be one who had been with them during all the time that the Lord Jesus had gone in and out amongst them, from the baptism of John until the day that He was taken up -- meaning that they were jealous to have one who was conversant with the Lord, as to how He went in and out among them, from the beginning to the end of His ministry. And
{289}
they prayed, and cited the Scriptures, and placed the whole matter in the hands of the Lord -- the lot. Then it says, "they were all together in one place" -- they were *all* there, showing that there was no negligence or indifference about them.
G.R.G. His going in and out amongst them no doubt had touched their hearts -- the love for them He had manifested.
J.T. Yes; they had become accustomed to His ways, I suppose, and would imitate Him; that was the idea; they had learned how to move and act as He did.
Ques. Would that be the thought of the commandment, learning to move as He did?
J.T. Yes; I think so. All that He commanded and said was in keeping with what He was, altogether that which He said. Then it says they were *all* together in one place, reminding us of the importance of not absenting ourselves from such occasions, for if we do we may miss the greatest events, the greatest privileges. All the facts in @Acts 1 and 2 proved that they had answered to these instructions, they loved the Lord and kept His commandments, hence they "received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit", which He had shed forth, as Peter said.
Ques. Was the cloud removed in the stoning of Stephen? He sees "the glory of God, and Jesus" (@Acts 7:55) -- there is no cloud there.
J.T. The heavens are opened to him, you mean. That alludes, I think, to the faith period, in which things are *fully realised*. Up to that time the cloud remained, that is to say, the Jewish system was not yet set aside; whilst God bore with it patiently, the *full* light of the dispensation had not shone. "A cloud received him" -- the faith period thus began, but it is after the death of Stephen that the full light of the dispensation shines. Stephen seeing Him alludes to the power of the Spirit in us enabling us to
{290}
see Jesus in a spiritual way. Earlier He was hid, as we may say. Peter says, "Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things", (@Acts 3:21) but now "we see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour" (@Hebrews 2:9); like Stephen, we look at the glory of the Lord.
Rem. 'The Spirit's power has ope'd the heavenly door', as the hymn says (`74:5).
J.T. That is it, exactly. Whilst the old system remained, the cloud period remained; even while the Lord was on the mount of transfiguration, the cloud was there, only it was a *bright* one.
G.M. He speaks of the Spirit here as the Comforter; in the beginning of the chapter He says, "Let not your heart be troubled". What is the force of a Comforter?
J.T. I think it assumes that we love the Lord; it is "*another* Comforter"; they had already One whom they had learned to love. Think of all that shone in Christ during the time He came in and went out amongst them! What feelings would arise as it dawned upon them what love lay beneath all His movements!
Ques. Does it suggest that we should miss Him, and that the Spirit should take His place?
J.T. That is the idea. They had lost the One they had learnt to love, and He would be a Comforter in every way. The word signifies, as most of us know, that He should take care of our affairs; not one matter of mine is overlooked by the 'Paraclete'. Some of us move about amongst the saints and are occupied with a little ministry; but think of the greatness of the Spirit in occupying Himself with *all* the affairs of the saints! The Lord when here could even take up the matter of Martha and Mary, and many other such matters. A woman came to Him with two of her sons, and said, "Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the
{291}
other on the left, in thy kingdom". Well, the Lord did not put her aside as unworthy of attention. He opened up to her the facts of the case, and said, "Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of?" and they said, "We are able". Think of those two young men saying that! How much they undertook! And the mother standing by them! But the Lord does not ridicule them; He goes into the whole matter so as to adjust them. He was not arbitrary; He takes a very low place and says, It "is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father". Doubtless the matter was settled in their souls, so that they would never come with such a request again. Then the ten, having heard about this, were indignant with the two brothers; they acted as brothers in the flesh, which was a very insidious thing, and the ten were indignant; there was a party, ten on one side and two on the other -- and the Lord adjusted that, too; (@Matthew 20).
Ques. We should learn that in a company, I suppose?
J.T. Well, you come to see the Lord as He was here, how He took up matters with His people, leaving nothing unadjusted. Now He is going away, that is the basis of these chapters, He is leaving them, what are they going to do without Him? He encourages their hearts as to His love, that they could rely upon it, but they must have the same kind of love themselves. Then He says, "Let not your heart be troubled"; He prepares them for His absence. It was to be a faith period now -- "Ye believe on God, believe also on me". But then, although having faith, they would be very wanting without an actual Comforter, another One who would take up the service that the Lord had exercised; so that now He challenges their hearts as to their love for Him, evidenced by their keeping His commandments; and He would beg the Father, and He would give them
{292}
another Comforter. We learn here that the Holy Spirit is not given save as wished for or needed; there is a felt need before He is given.
Rem. What the Lord did when He was here, the Comforter would now do.
Rem. In the first part of the chapter we have the Lord comforting them -- what He proposes to do unconditionally; but what we are looking at now is dependent on an 'if', or what they should be as to their affections for Him.
J.T. Yes; the Holy Spirit comes in here in answer to a felt need, He does not come voluntarily, but as begged of the Father. We may treat Him lightly, but we must remember all this precedes the giving of the Spirit.
G.R.C. Do you mean that if we have a felt need in our souls the Holy Spirit responds to it?
J.T. That is, I think, what is to be learnt from this. You feel the need of a Comforter. You meet with brethren who when trouble arises amongst us never seem to get it settled. Well, if one goes to court without an advocate, one makes a very poor hand of it. The advocate knows what to do, and the reason of the long uncertainty in matters is that the Paraclete is not employed, so to speak -- you do not make room for Him.
J.M-n. Do you mean the Comforter might be with the brethren in regard to this adjustment?
J.T. Yes. Although He has not become incarnate, the Spirit acts in the church; hence He says, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul" (@Acts 13:2); we are not told *how* He said it to the brethren, but it must have been through some person He employed. "He abides with you" -- if we make room for Him, He adjusts matters for us, and we are certain as to the adjustment. Of course there are many other blessed services He renders, but this is specially important.
{293}
Rem. As you say, all the uncertainty is caused by the Spirit of God not having adjusted us.
J.T. That is what I thought, for it is from the standpoint here of a Paraclete, One who is personally here, and capable of taking up all our affairs.
W.H. Would that be seen in @Acts 15:28, where a question came up at Antioch, and they say, "It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us"?
J.T. That is a very good example of it; there was a wise adjustment there.
J.M-n. Does He do it in relation to the Head?
J.T. I am sure He does. As He hears, He speaks; so that there is perfect consonance between the Holy Spirit in His service here, and Christ. Hence, we have in the chapter, distinct parts, the first referring to what the Lord does; as going away, of Himself, He acts for us. All is to be, however, on the principle of faith -- "Ye believe on God, believe also on me". He sets out by assuring us that our hearts should not be troubled, that nothing would be left undone for us on high. He has gone up there; in His Father's house are many mansions, and He would have told us if it were not so, and He will come again to receive us to Himself. That is the first part. The second part is contingent on our love for Him.
Rem. In what a blessed way the Lord, in those first few verses, brings in the assurance of His love before He says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments".
J.T. How worthy He is of it! It was not only what they would be here, but what He would do for them there.
Rem. He does not exactly command us to love Him; there is no need for it.
J.T. No; the commandment is to love one another. Going away and being at a distance from those we love is a test; how easily things slip out of our minds! But with Christ, although going into
{294}
such glory and honour, and a scene of such interest, He never loses sight for a moment of His saints on earth.
Rem. What myriads Christ has had in His mind ever since! Would you say that the saints are His only interest on earth, at present?
J.T. Yes; I think that may be said. He has potentially, of course, immense interests, but He is not occupied with them actively, for the moment. Think of what He is up there! Think of the reception and honour -- heaven opened and He carried into it, angels and principalities and powers being made subject to Him! Yet there is not a bit of change, He is occupied with us, as ever. "Let not your heart be troubled" -- notice the word 'heart' is in the singular, for it contemplates practical unity amongst us, a collective thought.
Ques. Would this correspond in any way with Moses going up to the mount, and the way the people left below were tested by his absence?
J.T. Yes. They said, "As for this Moses ... we wot not what is become of him", (@Exodus 32:1); they did not "believe", and became idolatrous.
Rem. There was no other Comforter left behind.
J.T. There were Aaron and Hur, but they proved very poor. It is very humbling to think of Aaron -- remarkable man as he was. Moses left him and Hur in charge, and the people said, "Make us gods, which shall go before us"; and then Aaron made the calf. He was a poor representative of Moses. But how different with our Comforter, the One who takes the place of Christ with us! how true He is! That shows the difference of the dispensation in which we are. It is perfect, inasmuch as the One below is in accord with the One above, and the One above is in accord with the One below. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit act in infinite unity. These chapters bring this out in the most striking and assuring way.
{295}
Ques. Is that why He is called the Spirit of truth?
J.T. Yes; and hence the power of adjustment, He is the "Spirit of truth here", and "the truth" in John's epistle. He will not brook anything contrary to the truth.
Rem. But we have to make room for Him.
J.T. That is what the Lord contemplates; the keeping of the commandments makes room for the Spirit.
Ques. Are we to look to the Spirit at all? We look to the Lord.
J.T. He is the object of faith; but you recognise the Spirit, too, though not in the same sense, because He is here with us; He is not viewed so much objectively, as Christ is; but we read of the love of the Spirit and of the communion of the Spirit in the epistles; (@Romans 15:30; @2 Corinthians 13:14). He is here as sent by the Father and the Son, and acts in relation to them, but He operates as a divine Person.
F.W.W. You referred to what is in chapter 16:13, "For he shall not speak from himself" -- is it just as if Christ were here? I was thinking of the Lord Himself here, seeking the glory of Him that sent Him.
J.T. Yes. What the Spirit hears from the Father and the Son, He speaks. These chapters show that He is sent from the Father and the Son, so He acts here in relation to God; you have a perfect system. In no way can you see the perfection of the system more than in the perfect agreement between the Advocate above (it is the same word here as in John's epistle) and the Advocate below. Things are maintained in perfect agreement, and divine power is available in the service. These chapters are truly wonderful, as showing how the divine Persons are engaged in the maintenance of the saints and the testimony.
Ques. Do we find earlier in this gospel the Son
{296}
Himself in the same position with regard to the Father?
J.T. Exactly the same. He says He did nothing of Himself. Hence both the Son and the Spirit have taken the mediatorial position; the Father remains in the absoluteness of the Godhead, while they have taken up mediatorial service. The Lord says, "My Father is greater than I". That means that He has taken a mediatorial position. All such statements refer to Him as in this position. Hence we need to be very guarded as to applying titles or designations, which refer to Him as Mediator, to Him as in the form of God.
Rem. You said that the Spirit only comes to felt need.
J.T. Yes; His coming depends on a state of things here. Of course, it depends on the work and the ascension of Christ, for it says, "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified", (@John 7:39). But then this passage does not say anything about that, it is a question of the state of your heart and mine. Do we love Christ? It is futile to speak of the Holy Spirit being with us apart from love for Christ -- it is only a theory.
Rem. Love for Christ must give Christ the first place in my heart, and the Spirit will always support that.
J.T. Yes; and then the commandment makes room for His action -- "If ye love me, keep my commandments".
Rem. You feel the need of someone to sustain you in divine things, for you cannot sustain yourself.
J.T. No. Then He says, "I will beg the Father", showing that it was, so to speak, not easy. We must not think the coming in of the Spirit was costless. We see in the type of the gift of the Spirit (@Exodus 17) that the rock had to be smitten. It cost the Lord His death that the Spirit should come here. Peter says,
{297}
"Having ... been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 2:33); but here it says He "begs" for Him.
H.B. Does His saying, "I will come to *you*", refer to the company?
J.T. In verses 15 - 20 the allusion is, I think, to the early days when things were normal.
Ques. Is the reward (verses 21 - 23) greater for the individual?
J.T. Well, the passage shows we lose nothing in this respect, in a day of small things. We have what they had at the beginning. It is very precious that, under the conditions mentioned, the Father and the Son come to the believer.
Ques. The former passage is connected with early days, you say, but you would not confine it to early days?
J.T. Well, we have the *light* of it now; it bears on us, but I think the position now is set forth in verses 21 to 23 -- they govern *our* position now.
Ques. One would like to be clear as to that verse, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" -- does He not come to us?
J.T. The setting of it relates to the beginning of church history. Verse 21 covers our position, I think, and may be connected with @Matthew 18, where you find a like division. First, there is the *church*: "but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican"; and the Lord adds, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven". Then He says, "*Again* I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree". It seems to me that this passage helpfully compares with the chapter we are considering; the first part corresponding with the church as intact, the collective side; and the second relating to a broken state of things, when two are regarded as acting on church ground -- in @John 14
{298}
only one. So I think that Matthew and John may be compared and acted upon intelligently. "Two of *you*". To the one He manifests Himself, and the Father and the Son come; but in Matthew we have two agreeing on earth as to anything they should ask: "it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven"; and "where two or three", He says, "are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them". Here it is all to one person.
Ques. Is that why we get, "At that day", and then, in verse 21, His commandments; and then, in answer to Judas¬ question, the Lord says, "If a man love me, he will keep my words"?
J.T. Keeping His commandments makes room for the Spirit, in that it takes me out of evil associations, and keeps me out of them; but the keeping of the *word* makes room for the Spirit to open up the truth. The commandment takes me out of the evil, but the word is the mind of God.
Ques. Is that why Philadelphia comes in -- "Thou ... hast kept my word" (@Revelation 3:8)?
J.T. Quite so, the word implies tabernacle conditions. The mind of God is so opened up that there are tabernacle or dwelling conditions; the Father and the Son can make their abode with such an one. You may connect that helpfully with @Matthew 18; you may get two like this, or more, but you never assume church ground outwardly -- though you may do so in faith, as embracing the whole as before God, but you never do it *publicly*. If you are keeping His commandments, you cannot go on with evil. It is very important to recognise that the commandment makes room for the Spirit, but the word opens up the mind of God and makes room for the Father and the Son.
Ques. Would you say that is additional to the Spirit? What is formed in us would keep the commandment, and the word, too.
{299}
J.T. The word is most interesting, inasmuch as it makes room for the Father and the Son.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the Spirit? What is the distinction between His abiding with them, and being in them?
J.T. I suppose He was there in Christ, while Christ was there; but the new way He should be there would be *in* them. Both features of His presence are true now. He abides *with* us and *in* us.
Ques. Is the indwelling Spirit the present gain in christianity? In the Old Testament the Spirit came *upon* people; is the indwelling peculiar to christianity?
J.T. I think it is; I do not think they will have it in this way in the millennium. The prophet Joel announced that it should come upon them; (chapter 2:28). "In you" is peculiar, I think, to the church.
H.B-t. Is there no collective position which we could take up and claim that, "I will not leave you orphans"?
J.T. It is like any other truth; it is there as a *principle*, but it is not right to assume that it is so actually, as they could have done at the beginning, because of the breakdown. Verse 21 opens up things to you from the individual side; you get manifestations of Christ by keeping His commandments. In verse 23 you make tabernacle conditions by keeping the *word*, but then Matthew enables you to bring others into that, "two or three"; both these things hold good.
H.B-t. You do not get it by having a meeting in your locality in the 'list'!
J.T. No. The basis is, loving Christ and keeping His commandments -- that is the basis for the last days; any individual doing that would really be on church ground. Collective privilege, I am sure, is realised, and Matthew may be rightly connected with this, but we do not assume it publicly.
{300}
Rem. But, as in verse 18, what we look for when we are convened is the Lord's presence.
J.T. It is right to keep it before us, as a principle that the Lord graciously recognises, but I believe it applies primarily to normal conditions -- when things were right as a whole. I think the presence of the Spirit underlies the Lord's coming in either case. In Old Testament times, Jehovah came in through angelic means; in our times it is not that -- angels minister, of course, but they are not the vehicles of divine manifestation. It is the Spirit, no less a Person than the Spirit.
Ques. Do you not think we are often very unbelieving as to the presence of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. I am sure we are. He is a real Person here as much as Christ was; as the Lord goes on to say afterwards, "These things I have said to you, abiding with you; but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you". You see what a service there was in the presence of the Comforter whom the Father sent in His name; this latter fact shows how the Father honoured the Son in sending Him. First, the Son asked for Him, then the Father sent Him in His name. The Spirit would not leave a thought of Christ that He gave expression to in abeyance, He would bring all back to their remembrance, for they were like ourselves, and we know how we *forget* things. But the Holy Spirit does not forget things; He knows how to bring them to our remembrance.
Ques. What do you mean by not taking the position publicly?
J.T. Well, it would be out of keeping with the Lord's mind if we should assume to be the collective thing; it would not be according to the truth. We are on individual lines now, in the public aspect;
{301}
but after all, the principles hold -- they are always workable; and the "two or three" of Matthew answers to our position. But if we lose sight of the whole church, failing to own the dreadful breakdown, we shall be only a sect, and we shall not have the Lord.
Ques. You would not say there is no public testimony now?
J.T. Not at all, but we want to have things on the right ground, and to be humble and seemly about them.
Ques. Would this help you as to @2 Timothy 2?
J.T. Yes, I think this scripture and that synchronise; that is how you come to this. Paul says, "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity" (verse 19); that is keeping His commandment, as loving Christ.
Ques. Would these be moral conditions: "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them" -- then when we come together the Spirit would be free, in that sort of company, to bring these heavenly things to our remembrance?
J.T. Quite. As has been pointed out, 2 Timothy is the *direct* word for our days, and that is what the Lord alludes to here.
Ques. In connection with that, would you speak of "that day", in verse 20, as specially for the day of small things?
J.T. No; it refers to the day in which the Spirit would be here. It reads, "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". That is, it would be the day of the Spirit -- they would have intelligence, by the Spirit, of the place He had with the Father, and the place they had with Him in His affections, and that He was in their affections. It is like Colossians and Ephesians. Ephesians is that we are in Him, raised up and made to sit down together in Him; Colossians is that He is in us. These
{302}
are the two sides, I think, but all hinges on the Spirit; we know these things by the Spirit.
Ques. Would you say that that verse really refers to the time before the breakdown took place?
J.T. Yes; it refers to the day of the Spirit.
Ques. In verse 21 it says, "He that *has* my commandments and keeps them", does that contemplate a day when the commandments were lost?
J.T. Yes; verse 21 contemplates a day when the commandments were disregarded *generally*, and the one who has the commandments and keeps them loves the Lord, that is to say, one who moves in the light of 1 and 2 Corinthians, and 1 and 2 Timothy. He is not *saying* it merely, he *shows* he loves the Lord by keeping His commandments.
{303}
NEARNESS TO CHRIST AND PUBLIC SERVICE (10)
@John 16:1 - 15
Rem. Perhaps you would say a word about chapter 15 for those who were not present yesterday.
J.T. The Lord had said, in the end of chapter 14, "Arise, let us go hence", as if a new position were coming into view, namely, our *public* position, which is seen in chapters 15 and 16. Chapters 13 and 14 are more private. Chapter 15 is our public position in relation to Christ as the true Vine, having fruitfulness in view. Much was said yesterday in regard to fruit-bearing, and then the attitude of the world as in that public position. For in fruit-bearing there is the continuation of Christ here, and that is hated. Hence the Lord says, If they have hated Me they will also hate you. We are taken into the most honourable and privileged relation -- that of friends, in that He discloses His mind, He conceals nothing. To be in His secrets is wonderful. "Henceforth", He says, "I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends". "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you". He has laid down His life for us, as His friends.
Then the next thing in chapter 15 is witness. The Holy Spirit is sent out by the Lord Himself *as having been with the Father*, to bear witness to Him. But the apostles should also bear witness because they had been with Him from the beginning. Chapter 16 is the continuation of the public side, and the opening verse tells us that the Lord said the previous things that they should not be stumbled. To be forewarned is to be forearmed; these conditions arising, we are
{304}
prepared. I think we may be helped as to the place the Spirit has as the Comforter.
He is viewed in a different connection in each of these chapters. In chapter 14 it is what He is to us, as abiding with and in us, and bringing to remembrance what the Lord had said, and, as here, furnishing the Father and the Son a means of abiding with us. In chapter 15 He bears witness -- sent out by the Son as having been with the Father, to bear witness. And in chapter 16 He brings demonstration to the world of certain things. That is, He is here to vindicate Christ, and so to vindicate the saints as here on His account -- as having part with Him. It is important to bear in mind that there is a public corresponding position. They were to be put out of the synagogues, and He says, "The hour is coming that every one who kills you will think to render service to God". That is, the Jews professedly regarded God -- the issue was between them and Christ, and the presence of the Spirit justified Christ. The issue was decided in the presence of the Spirit, in the evidence -- the demonstration -- He brought in of righteousness, and sin, and judgment.
Ques. Would you say that we have to be fortified inside to meet with the opposition in the world?
J.T. I think that is the way it is presented.
Rem. Otherwise you could not cope with the difficulties, the testings.
J.T. You go out fortified. The Lord said, "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me" (@John 14:30); and then, "Arise, let us go hence", (verse 31) as it were, into the field of conflict. But how wonderfully furnished they were as having the Comforter with them, and in them, involving visitations of the Son and of the Father!
Ques. Does that suggest that there is no place on the earth that would be a compensation for the visitation of the Son and the Father?
{305}
J.T. Surely. It is what we have in a private way.
Ques. Could not that be known by an individual -- the visitations of the Father and the Son?
J.T. That is what is stated. The Lord says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to *him* and make our abode with *him*", (@John 14:23). This chapter contemplates their position still in the synagogue; they would be put out, and any one killing them would consider that he did God service.
Ques. Saul of Tarsus pursued that line, did he not?
J.T. Yes; he led in that. He was the chief agent of Satan in that very service. He did it thoroughly, too, not only ejecting from the synagogue, but entering into *houses*, he dragged men and women before tribunals; the persecution was very bitter.
Ques. It was literally true of the apostle that he was the chief of sinners?
J.T. Yes; he persecuted the church. As knowing the love of Christ and what the church was to Him, he felt *that* sin with terrible poignancy. I suppose no one had gone so far in sin, in direct opposition to Christ. His whole spirit was in it, "Breathing out", it says, "threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord", (@Acts 9:1). "Breathing out", that means that the inner man was in it thoroughly. And then the Lord says, "Why persecutest thou me?" The spirit of Jesus was evidenced in His disciples, they did not resist him; they were led as sheep to the slaughter, as the Lord had been. But he came to the same position himself, "For thy sake we are killed all the day long", (@Romans 8:36). "All the day long", shows how *enduring* he was. And so it is in this position in chapter 16, it is a military position; but, as the apostle says to Timothy, "Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ", (@2 Timothy 2:3). A feature of the conflict is suffering. He does not say there, Take thy share in *fighting*, but, "Take
{306}
thy share in *suffering*". It is the ability to suffer that marks off the disciple; it marked the Master. Peter was "a witness of the sufferings of Christ", (@1 Peter 5:1). The ability to suffer was there as nowhere else. The apostle Paul shared in that peculiarly, but the Lord called him for that very reason, to show how much he should suffer. He knew how to *inflict* suffering, but now he came to it himself, and he is concerned that the sufferings of Christ should not be behind: "Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake", (@Colossians 1:24). As if he were concerned that the assembly should not be behind, it should be in keeping with Christ, in the way of suffering.
Ques. What is the force of "that which is behind"?
J.T. I think that the saints were remiss; I understand that the quantity of suffering was not there that should be there. It is given to you on behalf of Christ, "not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also", (@Philippians 1:29). The book of Revelation brings before us the Lamb -- a title that points to the Sufferer, and the assembly is brought out at the end as the "Lamb's" wife, not 'Christ's' wife, or the 'Lord's' wife, but the *Lamb's* wife; and I apprehend that she bears evidence of correspondence with Him in suffering -- she is thus suitable to be His wife.
Ques. Do you mean that the force of the word 'behind' was that they had come behind in suffering?
J.T. The apostle spoke of the filling up of "that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ ... for his body's sake" -- the whole assembly is in view.
Rem. Some were reigning as kings, not suffering.
J.T. God set the apostles last, as appointed unto death. They were extraordinary in that way. God set them out as a spectacle to all men, so that up to *that hour*, Paul said he suffered reproach (@1 Corinthians 4:9);
{307}
it was the order of the day, in regard to him. And hence he enjoins Timothy to take his share in it. The thing is there; each one has got his share. The apostle, I think, took more than his share in filling up that which was behind. "Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ".
Ques. Do you think it would be well, that when souls desire to take their place of privilege, you present the suffering side to them?
J.T. I think they should be made aware "that through much tribulation" we must enter; not that we should be *brought in*, but that we should *enter*; (@Acts 14:22). It is by way of suffering. It is not kindness to hide from people the consequences of identification with the rejected Christ. Current religious organisations would assume that He is *not* rejected, that the position is not a suffering one, but it is. And it is not kindness to hide from believers the consequences of identification with a rejected Christ.
Rem. Otherwise they will be offended or stumbled afterwards.
J.T. That is what it means; it means that they turn away because the trial is so severe, as we know often happens.
Rem. I suppose the Lord did not want them to be taken by surprise.
J.T. Well, that is what I think. To be forewarned is to be forearmed; as He pointed out in the sowing of the seed, that persecution arises and they become offended. You do not want to have people come into the fellowship to become offended and turn away from it.
Rem. Suffering here seems to be of a religious character.
J.T. I think that is the bitterest of all. As we were saying, Saul thought he did God service; his
{308}
mandate was from the high priest, not from the governor.
Rem. It shows that we are really blind, naturally.
J.T. Yes; we want to be watchful about persons being offended -- to warn them. That is to say, to bring it before them, as the Lord enables you, that suffering goes with identification with the rejected Christ. Chapter 15 shows that the world essentially hates Christ, and it hates those who bear fruit as He did. The world hates that. They have "both seen and hated both me and my Father" (verse 24), and hence the disciples. And so He says, "These things I have spoken unto you that ye may not be offended". You are in honourable connections if you are suffering; you are on the side of the Father and the Son. "And these things", He says, "they will do because they have not known the Father nor me. But I have spoken these things to you, that when their hour shall have come, ye may remember them, that I have said them unto you". Notice, He reverts to that -- why He had spoken these things -- to forewarn us.
Ques. "These things" -- are they the things He speaks in these chapters, from the 13th?
J.T. Yes; particularly chapter 15, I think.
Rem. "When their hour shall have come", the time would come when these things would apply.
Ques. Does He suggest that His telling them these things should arouse exercise?
J.T. Yes. They are spoken of to forearm us, as well as to forewarn us. When the hour is come for persecution, you are not taken by surprise, nor turned away by it; you understand what it means.
Ques. What has He in His mind when He says, "None of you demands of me, Where goest thou?"
J.T. I think He touches their indifference to His interests. He said in chapter 14, "If ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father" (verse 28). They were thinking of their own side altogether. As we
{309}
know, it is innate in us to think of our own side, so here He felt it that they did not ask Him, "Where goest thou?" They were so preoccupied with their own side that they lost sight entirely of what He was going into. He was going into much that He valued.
Ques. "These things will they do because they have not known the Father nor me" -- does that refer to the visitations of the Father and the Son?
J.T. No; it refers, I think, to what came out here. He said, "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father". It refers to what God is as seen in Jesus. They hated both. Now they should see holy corresponding traits in His disciples, and they would persecute them accordingly. It was really because they did not know God.
Ques. Would you say that this spirit was in Diotrephes?
J.T. Just so; only that he wanted to have the "first place among them", (@3 John 9). It is the same kind of thing, only arising in the very bosom of the assembly -- where one wishes to be pre-eminent.
Ques. What is the difference in the thought expressed in chapter 1, where it says, "Where dwellest thou?" (verse 38) and here, "Where goest thou?"
J.T. I suppose chapter 1 referred to the retreat He had while here; it was in the Father's bosom as we often speak of it. That is, He would retire to be with the Father, He would have to say to the Father. As they said, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father". They saw *that*. He invited them to come and see, and they came and saw where He abode. In that abode they would see what He was to the Father. But here He is literally going to the Father; the Father had given all things into His hands, and He was going to the Father. He was going away to the Father. He alludes here to His literal going into heaven, as He says later, "I ascend unto my Father, and your
{310}
Father". That is literal, but whilst He was here upon earth it was more like what we have now, what we can retire into in a spiritual way. They were not interested in His side at all, and it comes home to you as to how much you are interested in the Lord's side of things.
And, hence, the coming of the Lord has been so much restricted to what we speak of as the catching up of the saints. The catching up of the saints is *our* side, whereas the coming of the Lord is what He comes into. The crown of righteousness belongs to those who love His *appearing*, because it is a question of what *He* comes into. He upbraids them here as to not asking. It is much greater to think of what He comes into, than to think of what we come into.
Rem. The bride (@Ephesians 5) is what He gets.
J.T. "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom", (@John 3:29); and besides, He comes into all His rights.
Rem. "Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing", (@Ephesians 5:25 - 27). That is what you called attention to; it is what He gets.
J.T. That is what He gets in the rapture -- He gets that, but then He also comes into wider glory -- *all* His rights, as I said. Thus, those who love His appearing think of what He comes into in taking up things on earth, His rights in Israel and the nations.
Rem. "Ye do show the Lord's death *till he come*", @1 Corinthians 11:26.
J.T. Yes; you are thinking of His coming -- the public thing.
Rem. So that compensation for the suffering is to be in unison with the heart of the Lord, as to what He is coming into.
J.T. Quite so. Here He says, "If ye loved me, ye
{311}
would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father for my Father is greater than I", (chapter 14:28). If they had been thinking of His side, that is how it would have been. How He would have loved to have opened up to them things about the Father, and the heavenly position. Not that everything is not opened up now, for the coming in of the Spirit opens it all up. They did not inquire about that; if they had inquired about it, doubtless He would have told them much more.
Ques. Would you say that if we stop short of His side we miss the compensation, and also we shall not have the suffering in the same way?
J.T. Yes; if you are concerned about His side, you will get something about it. Whatever feature of the truth you are exercised about, you will get light about it.
Ques. Should we not also escape a good deal of suffering if we were only concerned with our own side?
J.T. The Lord values greatly our thinking of His side. If you are interested in it, you will get light about it, I have never known that to fail. And hence, if they had been occupied with His side, doubtless He would have occupied them much with that; but the Holy Spirit would bring all that to them. This would include Paul's ministry.
He enlarges here on what the Holy Spirit would be, as coming out. He alone can witness to what is heavenly. The apostles could witness to what He was here, the Holy Spirit is a witness to what is there. And I think, therefore, that the witness of the Holy Spirit, being based on the fact that He was with the Father ("the Spirit of truth who goes forth from *with* the Father") would bring out what *the Father thought about Christ*. What the Father thinks about Him would be indicated in that; and what a place man has there in Christ, what a reception he has in heaven. It is the Holy Spirit that brings the tidings of all that
{312}
to us, and hence, I think, the ministry of Paul is specially in view.
Ques. Ought there to be a distinct exercise with us on the line you have indicated?
J.T. Certainly; the Lord would lay it upon us that He is coming into things: "None of you demands of me, Where goest thou?"He feels it now if we are not concerned about His side. What is the assembly coming into? That is a fine inquiry, but then, What is Christ coming into? The whole of @Revelation 21 is taken up with what He is coming into. First, the bride is *adorned*, she is *new*, and she is adorned as a bride for her husband. And then, in verse 9, it is "the bride, the Lamb's wife". That is to say, she is in keeping with Him as suffering. But in the first part it is "her husband", and there is full suitability to Him. She is "new", "holy", and "adorned".
Ques. Has the feet-washing that in view -- part with Him, that they might be interested in His side?
J.T. I think so; they should have part in all that He was going into. So that He says to Laodicea, "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking; if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me", (@Revelation 3:20). He leads us on to His own side, and that is really what the assembly has properly. He is Head over all things *to* the assembly, but then He is Head *over* all things.
Ques. Does chapter 16 suggest the saints coming out in testimony towards the world?
J.T. That is right. Our position here in testimony is in view in this chapter; it is testimony -- the suffering and conflict occasioned by it.
Rem. Then in chapter 15 it is more fruit-bearing -- what *God gets* in the saints.
J.T. That is right. Chapters 13 and 14 are the inner position -- what we have inside.
{313}
Now the Lord goes on, "I go to him that has sent me, and none of you demands of me, Where goest thou? But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. But I say the truth to you, It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you". He says, "I go to him that has sent me"; that would be His portion. They did not ask Him anything about that. But He says, "It is profitable for you"; that also comes in, it was *necessary* for them that He should go, so that the present dispensation is devised in wisdom. Christ is absent and the Spirit is here. The presence of the Spirit is more effective than if the Lord had remained here; more is secured for God by the presence of the Spirit than if the Lord had remained here as in the days of His flesh.
Ques. Why is that?
J.T. Well, it is seen in the Spirit coming in -- not in a bodily form, as the Lord necessarily had -- He is more universal. The power is more extended, and as He says, "Greater works ... shall he do; because I go unto my Father", (chapter 14:12). It is the whole power of God operative in a divine Person on earth, who is here in such wise as to be everywhere, as we may say. He is in all the saints; hence the power is more extended, and in that way more restful. Christ wrought by the Spirit as a testimony, but the full divine scheme depended on redemption, Christ in heaven and the Spirit here. The Spirit being here, the system devised in divine wisdom is in full universal operation.
Ques. Has the death of Christ, so to speak, cleared the ground for the Spirit's operations?
J.T. Well, it did; and there were vessels formed in order that He should come in and operate. There were "about an hundred and twenty" (@Acts 1:15); and He came in in the form of cloven tongues of fire, and sat
{314}
on each of them. Think of the influence that is involved in that! God is able to speak everywhere. As far as we know, the Lord did not go much beyond a very small area of the earth, whereas the Spirit of God is here in such wise as to be active everywhere.
Rem. So we are better off in a way than the disciples.
J.T. We are. This is the greatest day of all; it is the Spirit's day. The millennium will be marked by the Lord coming out personally. @Revelation 19 is the Lord's own part in the thing, coming out on a white horse, and the armies of heaven following Him, and His name is called The Word of God. He is King of kings, and Lord of lords. That is, He comes out in that way, and takes up His rights here; but in the meantime it is the Spirit, and it is more effective in bringing about results for God -- the assembly is formed.
Ques. And would you not say that it is greater, too, because the Spirit has brought the knowledge of the Father?
J.T. He has brought in the knowledge of all that is involved in Christ ascending into heaven. He has ascended up to His Father and our Father, His God and our God. The Holy Spirit has brought in tidings of what that means. It is a marvellous thing, He has brought in tidings and impressions that are in keeping with the order of things up there -- a Man gone up into heaven. "I ascend", He says, "to my Father and your Father" (@John 20:17); He has brought in here not only the light but the *feelings* and *affections* that exist up there, so that you have a reflex of heaven here, by the Spirit.
Rem. Verse 7 says, "It is profitable for you that I go".
J.T. That is what He has in mind, the testimony of what is there, so that it is heavenly things on earth.
{315}
Ques. Is that the answer to verse 12 -- they could not then bear things: "I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now"?
J.T. That is right. "When he is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth, for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming".
Rem. It is the atmosphere of heaven brought down.
J.T. Just so. The assembly is not far away from heaven; Jacob called the house of God "the gate of heaven", (@Genesis 28:17).
You see in Genesis how it is forecast in the dream of Jacob. He saw the Lord on the top of the ladder, and the angels ascending and descending upon himself. That is to say, there was constant communication between heaven and earth. Well, how much greater that is in the Spirit being here now. That is in @Genesis 28; but in chapter 35 God Himself *comes down* and stands by Jacob -- that is like the Spirit here. The full thought of the house is that God is here; God is here by the Spirit.
Rem. We should be getting to know the Spirit better every day.
J.T. Getting to know heaven, so that when we get there we shall not be strangers in it.
Ques. What is the thought in the "Comforter"?
J.T. The word is *paraclete*, as we have seen; One who takes up all your affairs. He omits nothing; that is the idea. As Christ in heaven omits nothing there, so the Holy Spirit omits nothing here. It is an immense thing to have such an One here.
The term is employed in each of the chapters, 14 to 16. In the epistle of John it is applied to Christ in heaven. The Spirit convicts the world of sin, righteousness and judgment; or, as it reads in the
{316}
New Translation, "Having come, he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe on me; of righteousness, because I go away to my Father, and ye behold me no longer; of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged". That is what the Holy Spirit does. Bringing in demonstration of these things is not simply speaking about them, but He shows them convictively.
Ques. Is this demonstration to the saints?
J.T. The saints are the only ones *capable* of seeing it, but it is there for all. The presence of the Spirit at Pentecost was a public evidence of sin in the world; the Jews did not believe on Jesus; now God gave the Spirit to His followers.
Rem. The Spirit came to the disciples, not to the Jews.
J.T. That is it; therefore Christ was vindicated -- God vindicated Him. The issue was in God's hands, and He justified Christ in giving the Spirit to His disciples. The Jews were convicted of sin, in that they did not believe on Him.
Rem. It is, "I will send him to *you*".
J.T. Yes, that is important. He is not sent into the world, as Jesus was, but sent to the disciples.
Ques. What about the judgment?
J.T. There is the demonstration of judgment, Satan is judged, the prince of this world is judged. I suppose it came out in a moral sense. The judicial punitive side is in Revelation. Now it is a moral issue which is known by the brethren; we understand it by the presence of the Spirit, we understand that the prince of this world is judged; *he* understands it, too. The judgment is arrived at; it awaits execution (see @Revelation 12 and 20).
Rem. All this would enable us to keep clear of the world-system.
{317}
J.T. Just so. And in regard to Babylon, "God has judged *your* judgment upon her", (@Revelation 18:20). That is to say, the saints have formed a judgment of her. There is also, by the Spirit, conviction of righteousness -- "Because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more". How infinitely *right* that *that* Man should go to the Father!
{318}
PUBLIC SERVICE
@Luke 13:1 - 17
I have been thinking of certain public features that mark the present time, the end, as I may say, of this wonderful dispensation; corresponding somewhat with the end of the previous one. Certain public features marked the end of the Jewish dispensation. There were also private features, that is to say, what transpired in the upper room at Jerusalem on the evening of the Lord's crucifixion, and other like occurrences. So there are private features today, features that are not taken account of currently in a public way; they influence what is public, but they remain mysterious and private, known to those who love the Lord. The public features may be known to others and may be written about by others, but the private features are known only to those who love the Lord.
We have here, alluded to by the Lord Himself, a certain action of Pilate, who was the governor of Judaea; and the fall of the tower of Siloam and the destruction of eighteen persons by it. Then we have alluded to, in a parabolic way, the whole Jewish system viewed, as you will observe, under the figure of the fig-tree. These are in the main public things. And then we have mentioned by the Spirit the service of the Lord Jesus; not His private service, but His public service; He was serving in the synagogue on the sabbath.
It is important that we should take account of these public matters. Some make much of them, however, and ignore the private side. We hear much of public occurrences in the East, pointing to the end of things, and these occurrences cannot but be of
{319}
interest, but they are not the *main* guide for the saints at the present time. The private features are the surer. I was seeking to illustrate this in speaking to a sister today (I had not thought of it before). If a man of importance, of dignity, is away from his house and his family, and his return is left uncertain -- *purposely* so -- we do not look for the farm-hands or servants generally to have the first tidings of his return, we rather seek to get near to those whom he loves and who love him. If things be in secret, and there are any inklings of information as to his return, we may be assured that those whom he loves, his wife and his family, will have the first.
So it is that the Lord has left, designedly, the time of His return in uncertainty, as regards ourselves; He has, however, assured us that He comes *quickly*. Others may assume that they can fix the date. The false wife in Proverbs (as an illustration) says, The husband is away from home, he has gone on a *long journey*, he has taken a bag of money with him; (@Proverbs 7:19,20). All that she says is to convey the impression that the period of his absence is to be extended and long. She says he will return at the time of the full moon; she puts it in the distance, not the *new* moon, but the full moon. Her great antitype, the Babylonish system, says, "I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow" (@Revelation 18:7) -- the husband is ignored by her. She is riding upon the beast, she is occupied guiltily with the kings of the earth; as for the coming of the Lord, it is left out. Another, a wicked servant, says, "My lord" (he acknowledges his lord) "delayeth his coming" -- he does not regret it -- and, in the meantime, he smites his fellow-servants; (@Matthew 24: 48,49).
So that you see how those who are non-lovers of Christ, guilty non-lovers of Christ, put His coming off, or ignore it altogether; whereas, "he which testifieth these things", in His very last words to us,
{320}
says, "Surely I come quickly", and the lovers say, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus", (@Revelation 22:20). These are the ones who get the inklings of it; whatever waves of His power are acting, they touch them first, it is quite obvious. So that the inward or private signs or intimations of the coming of the Lord are much surer than the external ones. The external ones, these international events, may confirm our spiritual impressions, but these latter afford the primary guidance. The lovers of God and the lovers of Christ are occupied with the works of God; they recognise the course of this world of course -- Scripture does, specially the book of Revelation -- but the positive thing is what we should look for and rely on; what the Holy Spirit is doing in consonance with Christ in heaven, how He is acting in the people of the Lord, the members of the assembly, the members of His body. The members of the body of Christ come *directly* under His influence. These outer things, international occurrences, do not come under His influence directly; they do not even come under the direct government of God, but only His indirect government. We look for what is going on within; as I said in my illustration, what the wife knows, what the children know, they may not be able to tell you in so many words, but they have got impressions, they have got inklings, and they are governed accordingly.
So we find the Lord saying in another parable -- the parable of the virgins -- that at midnight there was a cry, "Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him", (@Matthew 25:6). That was not an appeal to the nations, it was an appeal to the lovers of Christ. There were those who had that place -- five of them were foolish, and five of them were wise, but there was a movement, it was a spiritual movement, it was a movement in answer to a cry: "Behold, the bridegroom". You see, it was an appeal to affection, not
{321}
simply that He comes, but, "Behold, the bridegroom".
The Holy Spirit would occupy the hearts of the saints with *Christ*. There was a movement, and it took the form of preparation and going forth to meet a person. How real it was! It was not an event that was called attention to, but a person; and those in direct relationship with Christ come under the influence of it first; that is where you get the inkling. The wise virgins knew what was necessary and had oil in their lamps. The oil points to the presence in them of the Spirit of God. The foolish virgins were without it, their lamps went out; whereas the five wise virgins, that is to say, those who are real christians, and who really love Christ, those who have the Spirit of God -- they go to meet Him and go in to the wedding with Him. They are the ones to be noted; there is light in their movements. See what they are doing!
Now, certain came to the Lord and called His attention to what Pilate had done. It was an atrocious act, a cruel thing, to mix with the sacrifices the blood of certain Galileans. It does not appear that they were vicious people; they were Galileans. Our times have been marked by such public occurrences, and we may be as much misled in regard to them as these people were in regard to Pilate's atrocious act. The Lord neither condemns Pilate nor justifies his victims. It is a question of seeing how matters are at the present time; why in the government of God such awful calamities, as we may say, come over the world, over christendom. Perhaps we say, Certain nations are more wicked. Will the Lord listen to us? No; He will not listen to us. Let us not flatter ourselves that our immediate nation or nations are any better. The Lord would wish us to have a right understanding of things; He says, "I tell you ... except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish". Terrible prospect! It is well that the people of God should
{322}
have a right view of things; He says, "Ye shall all likewise perish".
And then there are great physical and other such catastrophes, the late war, earthquakes, fires and the like, causing immense damage -- such as the fall of the tower of Siloam; we are not to be deceived by such happenings. Unless they have a moral effect upon us, they are lost upon us; we may talk about them, write about them, and fix dates by them, and say, The end of things is at hand, but if there is no moral effect, these things are lost upon us. In the government of God He allows them to arouse repentance, so that at least *some* might be saved. Think of the awfulness -- as you look abroad today on this favoured part of the world, western Europe and its outgoings -- of what is going to happen to it! The Lord in one short sentence shows the present bearing of it -- "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish". What a serious matter this is! As we look at this nation and all the nations and their enterprises, what effect has what God allows in His government on them! There is utter indifference. But the word is, "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish".
Now He speaks a parable, "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none". Now we are in the presence of the patience of God. But in His patience He looks for fruit. If He has given His Son to die, and raised Him and set Him in heaven and sent down the Spirit, and the Spirit has remained here for all these centuries, God has something in view. As He had something in view in Israel, so He has something in view in christendom. He has spent much more on us than He spent on Israel. Think of the cost to Him that there should exist the present order of things. I mean, the sphere in which the Lord Jesus is owned, and in which God works specially; in which His love has been and is being
{323}
told out. He has an end in view. There is some fruit today, but in the public body, as *such*, none, and hence the imminent removal, as indicated here. The vine-dresser, however, says, "Let it alone for this year also". The man who planted it says, It cumbers the ground. That is how God looks at it, it is cumbering the ground, He has got something else to bring in, and He is about to bring it in. This thing has been a failure *publicly*. You say, Why does not God wipe it out? He is going to do that; but there is someone who intercedes for it -- a most touching thing! As you will see here, "He answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: and if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down".
Now you see there is an intercessor. Every one of us here as christians tonight is a testimony to this. It ought to appeal to us. The extension of time included us. I believe the Lord Jesus is urging the extension of the dispensation -- He is on man's behalf. Is it because He does not love the church and wish it to be with Him? Not at all. He loves the church and gave Himself for it, and He is about to present it to Himself a glorious church not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; (@Ephesians 5:27). He will have the church with Him, but He has *patience*, He has regard for men, and hence the continuance. Oh, the patience of Christ and the patience of God! I just dwell on that for a moment, so that there might be some little reflex of it with us. It is no question of getting out of these things, of desire to be with the Lord to get away from the sorrow, but of being in the patience of Christ; as John speaks of himself -- "Your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ", (@Revelation. 1:9).
That is the position for us, so that there is a continuance of the time, and hence the prolongation of the
{324}
gospel. You can see the magnitude, therefore, of the position of the people of God -- of our position -- as being in sympathy with God in the continuance of this period. We know well what is coming in, we know well that christendom, as it is publicly, is cumbering the ground, and that infidelity and blasphemy are extending and deepening, and that the time is well-nigh at hand when God will have to deal with it we know that well. Yet we are loth to give it up -- it is the kingdom and *patience* of Jesus Christ; it is not a forlorn hope, the kingdom is here as it ever was, but it is the kingdom and patience of Jesus, that is what pleases God. John in Patmos was a companion of the saints "in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ". As in this attitude the saints correspond with, and reflect, the continued attitude of God toward all men.
The prolongation of the period is to be characterised by instruction, so that the Lord is said to be *teaching*. If He wishes the period continued, He is active so that people might be taught, that the evil abroad might be combated, and the positive truth as it is in Jesus might be set out among the people of God; that we might know the truth, that "we may be no longer babes, tossed and carried about by every wind of that teaching which is in the sleight of men, in unprincipled cunning with a view to systematised error" (@Ephesians 4:14); that we should be "holding the truth in love", and not only holding it, but, having power, telling it abroad.
It says that "He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath". It looks as if they did not wish to have this woman in the synagogue; whereas obviously she was in the synagogue -- this crooked woman. That seems a point in the position -- that He was teaching in the synagogue, "And behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together". There
{325}
was no power in the synagogue, you see, to deal with her. The public thing has utterly failed in that sense, there is no power, but then the teaching is there, and the *Lord* is there. What a picture! There was a woman there, it says, with a *spirit* of infirmity; you see what we have to contend with at the present time, it is not only infirmity spiritually, but the *spirit* of the thing, she had the spirit of infirmity; and how long did she have it? Eighteen years; and she was bowed together. Now we are in the presence of past history; we are called upon to deal with the effects of Satan's work eighteen years back. What a state of things!
Whatever responsibility there may be on her side, there is a poor woman with a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she is bowed together -- she cannot even lift up her head; that is what is in the synagogue. Of what moral value is the synagogue then? There is no power there to deal with such a case; but the Lord was teaching -- it is the public side of things -- and He was teaching on the sabbath, and he *calls* her. He "called to her"; the point is that there is a call, it is service involving that. She is morally at a distance for the moment, and He calls to her. She could not but be at a distance; there could be no nearness in such a case. Something happened eighteen years ago; you know it, God knows it, others may not know it. Satan knows it, he was the instigator of it; it was his act, but you are the sufferer, and you have suffered all these eighteen years. You are not near, but you are within reach of the Lord's call, and He calls you. That is the position.
Today the voice of Christ, through a christian, may reach these dear people in a modern synagogue. He called to her, and then He said to her, "Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity". It was a word of authority. How one yearns for believers who
{326}
are thus bound spiritually by something that happened years back! You would fain forget it, you would fain let it drop into oblivion, but it does not, its effect remains with you, unless you have dealt with it as before God. The Lord calls, and He says, "Thou art loosed". Who could say it but He? And then He lays His hands upon her; the recovery in view involves contact. It says, "He laid his hands upon her; and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God".
Now you will see that I am dealing with the public thing. It is what is going on, and God would have us to go on in it, because these conditions exist, and God would meet them. The call is one thing; the laying on of hands is another, the laying on of hands implies fellowship -- applying the thing today. In the Lord's case, it implied complete identification with her; He was undoing the works of the devil. When one stands up to preach or to minister, it is really a question of the conflict of light with darkness -- such is the situation. If you preach the gospel, it is the direct conflict of light with darkness. The call is involved in the gospel -- He called her. Then the laying on of hands implies complete identification, in the Lord's case, with her in her infirmity; He took her infirmity, He alone could do it; He was undoing, as John tells us in his epistle, "the works of the devil". "To this end the Son of God has been manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil", (@1 John 3:8). In this case something had happened -- some action of Satan eighteen years before, and this woman was lost to God, practically, all these years.
How many there are amongst the people of God, known as the people of God, who have been lost to God and lost to His people for many years! Satan has done it, and they are unable to recover themselves. Thus a call from God is necessary. She was immediately made straight and glorified God -- that is the
{327}
end in view; the believer is made straight and God is glorified. "God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions", (@Ecclesiastes 7:29). And so it is that the people of God come under the influence of these things, and are made crooked. Something has happened -- in the house, or in the personal life, or in the business; and you are made crooked, you are not able to lift up your head; whereas the service of Christ is to make you straight.
Righteousness is a great thing for the moment, that is to say, to be made practically righteous, so that we become priests unto God. "Let thy priests", it says, "be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy", (@Psalm 132:9). You see, the priest's clothing must be righteousness. How can I lift up my face to God, and lift up my hands in the sanctuary, save as I am garbed with righteousness? So the Lord here makes this woman straight and she glorified God. She was one of the daughters of Abraham, a "seed of the righteous" (@Proverbs 11:21), and Satan knew it; in making her crooked he was depriving God of her, and this continued for eighteen years.
I think you will agree that these are important things to have in our minds -- and particularly in regard to this public service -- that we are able to call people; and then the identification, so that there is complete recovery, and the persons are made straight and glorify God. What follows this in the passage, you will observe, is the complaint of the ruler of the synagogue. These are the persons that Satan is using today, persons who have official religious status; he was the 'ruler' of the synagogue. They may not come out openly and deny the Person and work of the Lord Jesus; in many instances they dare not do it; that would mean open apostasy, and the relinquishment of their living; but if Christ is not a divine Person, what is there in christianity?
{328}
It is a myth! What is your clerical garb? It is a myth! Give the whole thing up! That is the logical result of open denial of the deity of Christ and the inspiration of Scripture.
Alas! some are bold enough to do all this now and retain their positions, but others do not wish to do it, it does not suit them. Their status is involved, the antiquity of their church is involved; all these things enter into it. So these people do not openly attack Christ; here the ruler of the synagogue attacked those who came to be healed. "There are six days in which people ought to work" -- what a wretched excuse! Is it not an exposure of what is current around? So the Lord exposes him; He calls him a hypocrite. Recently there has been a large commentary published by certain leading church dignitaries, in which the inspiration of most important scriptures is denied; and yet it is asserted that there is overwhelming evidence of the resurrection of Christ! That is to say, they make Christ a liar (for the books of Genesis and Jonah, from which the Lord quotes, are involved), and then they say that God raised Him! You see the utter inconsistency of the thing. They will not come out openly and renounce christianity; they retain enough to keep their system going -- the rest can go.
Here the ruler of the synagogue attacked the persons who came to be healed on the sabbath day; but he really aimed at Christ. The Lord calls him a hypocrite. The ruler's position was being undermined by the Lord's service. *He* could not heal the man, although he was a ruler of the synagogue; the Lord Jesus healed him. That is what we have to see; the work of God exposes the sham and hypocrisy of what is around us. So the Lord said, "Hypocrites does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the manger and leading it away, water it? And this woman, who is a daughter of Abraham,
{329}
whom Satan has bound, lo, these eighteen years, ought she not to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?"
The way for true christians today is to pursue the line of the work of God. Thus there will be *positive* results, and in the light of these positive results, the Lord exposes the hypocrites, and all honest people glorify God. Here they "rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him". There is a great field opened up to us in these last days -- in the presence of all these things -- there is this public service. May the Lord help us to continue in it!

THE DIVINE STANDARD OF SERVICE (1)
@2 Corinthians 1
J.T. It was intimated that these meetings had those more or less engaged in the Lord's service especially in view, and it was thought that this epistle might be considered profitably from the standpoint of service as having special relation to the gospel of Mark. What has especially to be borne in mind in regard of this epistle is the manner in which the servant's character, as formed after Christ, is interwoven with his ministry, so that the servant and his ministry are strikingly connected, and he is in keeping with what he ministers. So we may see how the great fundamental features of the truth enter into this letter, and the Lord may help us to see the bearing of each feature on the servant, and its bearing on his ministry as a consequence. It occurred to me that we might look at this chapter from the standpoint of *personality*, a feature which is much emphasised in Scripture in regard to the service of God. It was perfectly expressed in Christ, and those who serve in any measure must be so marked, hence the importance in service of a secret history, as we see in Aaron, who is introduced to us as "Aaron the Levite". He was known to God as Aaron the Levite, and being eighty-three years of age at the time, there must have been much in the way of secret history before. So with the Lord, His thirty years of privacy may be regarded in the same light; and so with each of us, for it is not the divine intent that we should take short cuts to service, but it is to be the outcome of secret history with God. Mark, therefore, introduces his gospel as the "Beginning of the glad tidings
{331}
of Jesus Christ, Son of God". He had already become known, but "Son of God" involved personality, So the apostle presses here that he had preached the Son of God, and he makes it reflect upon his own character -- that if the Son of God is true, and the promises of God are yea and amen in Christ, the apostle also is true.
Ques. By personality do you mean character formed in secret with God?
J.T. That is what I thought. Aaron had brotherly qualities known to God, and God makes these known to Moses, who proved them later.
Rem. So that the measure of the man would be that which he has been in secret with God.
J.T. That is it.
R.B. How do you connect that with gift?
J.T. I think that gift would have in view the vessel. It is according to one's "particular ability", (@Matthew 25:15). Hence Paul himself, who is, I suppose, the model for us under Christ, is spoken of by the Lord at the outset as an elect vessel unto Him. The vessel refers to the man -- the person. What may be placed in it is another matter; the vessel has reference to the kind of person. Gift is in relation to that.
Ques. Would not the gift be ineffective in its full measure without moral character?
J.T. I think gift is out of setting unless the character suited to it be there; the gift must necessarily be discredited and correspondingly rendered useless unless the vessel be in keeping. So that @Luke 4, occupies us with grace in introducing the Lord in His ministry. His movements, reading, and particularly the precious words coming out of His mouth, are noted.
Ques. Is that why we get the Servant at the outset of the gospel? "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", (@Mark 1:11).
J.T. Exactly. God makes known to the Lord
{332}
Himself His pleasure in Him. It is important in serving that one should be conscious of the Lord's approval, and, I suppose, of that of the brethren, too. Scripture records two things presented in the voice from heaven, "*Thou* art my beloved Son", and "*This* is my beloved Son: hear him", (@Matthew 17:5). Applied to us as servants, the former would be to impress us that God is pleased with us, and then in the latter He calls the attention of others to us. He gives us the sense that we please Him personally, and then He will call the attention of others to us.
H.F.N. Is that why Aaron is referred to in @Psalm 106:16 as "Aaron the saint of the Lord"?
J.T. Yes; and he is also referred to as "chosen", which, I suppose, would allude to God's pleasure in him on account of His knowledge of him. He is "the heart-knowing God", (@Acts 15:8) and He said to Moses about him, "When he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart", (@Exodus 4:14). The "saint of the Lord" refers, I suppose, to Aaron's service in the sanctuary.
H.F.N. Is that why the epistle opens with "Paul, apostle", and then he links himself up with Timothy the brother? Would that fit in with what you said with regard to Moses?
J.T. I think the two things are combined. Aaron kisses Moses, showing that he represents the *love* side -- that is the brother, and then they both go to the elders of Israel and gather them together; their combined ministry is effective. It was a combination of light and love, and those two things go together for effective service. Authority and brotherly love are seen here in Paul and Timothy as linked together in this way.
Ques. Referring to the question as to gift, is it not seen in practice sometimes that sovereign gift may be in a vessel that has become morally unfitted, and thereby mischief and trouble come in?
{333}
J.T. Undoubtedly. One may become official through his gift, and if he goes on, he will be sure to damage people. It is seen in a man like Aaron -- most excellent at the beginning, but he fell under the power of evil; (@Exodus 32). But it is helpful on this line to see what knowledge God had of Aaron so that he is *introduced* as actually in service. We get the genealogy of Jacob until we arrive at Levi, and the genealogy of Levi until we arrive at Phinehas, so that the priesthood was secured effectively on that line, whatever may have happened in the interim in Aaron. The service was secured perpetually in Phinehas, and then the Spirit of God adds, "This is that Aaron and Moses" (@Exodus 6:26), and again, "This is that Moses and Aaron" (@Exodus 6:27), showing that that is what is in view in Exodus. In Genesis we have personality in the patriarchs, but the *mother* side is wanting. In Jacob's house there were four mothers but in Exodus the line of service is from a man of Levi who married one of the daughters of Levi, and from that union we have Moses and Aaron and Miriam, that is to say, the service is linked up, not only with a right father, but with a right mother; one father and one mother.
J.McM. The apostle puts grace before apostleship in Romans. "By whom we have received grace and apostleship", (@Romans 1:5).
J.T. That would prove what we have said, that grace alluded to the vessel. There was much history in Paul before he was called formally by the Spirit. I think the allusion to the Spirit in @Acts 13 involves *intimate* first-hand knowledge. The Holy Spirit being here involves the most intimate knowledge of all of us. Not that God at a distance, as it were, does not know all, but He would give us to understand that He knows first-hand; He knows us well, as here in the Spirit; there is nothing omitted. He came down to see the tower of Babel; He came down
{334}
to see the cities of the plain to show that He would have first-hand knowledge; so the Holy Spirit in calling out Barnabas and Saul intimates a perfect and intimate knowledge of the persons before calling them out. We have considerable history of the two men, how they wrought together, and how they served the Lord in the assembly at Antioch, their service being effective. Then we have a list of the prophets and teachers in the assembly there, showing that the selection of those two brothers -- one is mentioned first and the other last -- by the Spirit did not weaken what was local. He knew what would suit for the work, but he would not weaken what was local. There was enough left to carry on and to minister to God at Antioch, which is an important matter. The Holy Spirit was intimately acquainted with what was there in each of them and there was enough to carry on. In ministry we must not overlook the needs of our own localities, for that is really the first incumbency.
Ques. What is the bearing in a practical way now of what you remarked as to a right father and a right mother?
J.T. That service in human organisations cannot be effective. I refer to the religious systems of christendom. You cannot have the service of God in any of these organisations. In this connection the idea of the mother is a system that gives character to one. It is only as brethren are brought into the light of Christ and the assembly that you can have the service of God properly. I have often thought many are like the man with the withered hand; they have only one effective hand, and so cannot act according to God. The idea of a vessel for God is that a man has two hands, and so in the gospels, particularly in Mark, the man's hand is restored before the Lord calls out the apostles. Of course, much may be done with one hand, but a one-handed man does not
{335}
convey the idea of a complete vessel. At best he can only present truth objectively.
H.E.S. Is that why particular attention is called to both the father and mother of John the baptist?
J.T. No doubt. Things were in order *outwardly*; Zacharias, serving in the order of his course, was at the altar of incense inside, and the people were praying outside, and yet there was a state of unbelief in Zacharias. So it is said that Gabriel was seen standing at the *right* side of the altar of incense, as if God would suggest that if He is to have service He will have the *best*. Zacharias has to come to that, and what he comes to is a recognition of heaven's thought in John. The friends and neighbours being governed by natural feeling would call him Zacharias; Elisabeth says his name is to be John, and Zacharias writes, "John is his name", (@Luke 1:60,63). So he came through discipline to the divine thought; John was the name given by Gabriel.
F.H.B. Your thought is that moral character would be formed by coming under the influence of the mother.
J.T. That is right. You cannot get the service of God in a scriptural sense in human organisations. It is only in those who hold Christ and the assembly. In @Exodus 2 we have Moses¬ parents given as a son and daughter of Levi, and in chapter 6 their *names* are given. The importance of the matter is thus seen.
Ques. Would you say a little more as to the application of service locally?
J.T. In @Acts 13 the allusion to Antioch shows that we begin locally. Each servant has his local setting, and his first obligation is there.
Ques. Supposing a servant has not a local setting, what then?
J.T. I should say he is remiss. Although Saul was of the city of Tarsus and was educated at Jerusalem,
{336}
yet the Holy Spirit gives him a local setting at Antioch. He was a whole year there before he was sent out.
A.H.W. Does the fact help that Paul returned to Antioch and reported the result of his mission to the brethren there?
J.T. Yes; and he stayed there a good while afterwards.
Rem. And he started each of his early journeys from Antioch.
J.T. What is striking is that after returning from the first he remained there a considerable time. "And they stayed no little time with the disciples", (@Acts 14:28). That the Spirit records this is noteworthy.
M.W.B. In connection with a servant having a local setting, is it not very desirable to keep in touch with local exercises, and not only go forth from the local gathering?
J.T. Yes, I agree with you. What is important is to get the scriptural principles governing anything, and I think in Paul's history we get the right levitical principles. He was a whole year at Antioch, and then the Spirit of God puts it on the brethren there to separate unto Him Barnabas and Saul, as if they had to be respected; then we read that they laid their hands on them and let them go; then their return was to Antioch "whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled", (@Acts 14:26). They had done something. In his service one is accountable to God, but fellowship implies that he is also accountable to the brethren. These two had fulfilled the work and they stayed there, as we read, "no little time". One can understand there would be a remarkable refitting and readjusting in them staying there some little time with the disciples, but not, of course, in any official
{337}
way; nor is it ever hinted that the assembly controls or commissions a servant.
Rem. The reference to letting them go would show they were valued.
J.T. That is so. They did not want to get rid of them; they valued them.
J.S. On returning they would not take the same place they had had and overshadow what was local.
J.T. What is recorded is that they were contending against the false teachers that came from Judaea. Peter and John, after their service in Jerusalem, went to their own company, and as they prayed the house was shaken, and then with great power the apostles witnessed; not only those two, but the *apostles*. The Lord keeps the balance amongst us. Christianity is not a one-man or two men affair; it is a question of mutual feeling and co-operation; there is thus room given for the Spirit to develop the mind of God. He is intimately acquainted with all of us, and He brings out in due course what God effects in one and another.
Rem. One sees the great importance of those who are gifts, that they should have this local experience and exercises. Paul, for instance, carried the cares of all the assemblies.
J.T. It is of immense importance. Lazarus was said to be *of* Bethany; that was his local setting. Much happened in connection with that locality, and all that was in view, so that later the Lord comes to Bethany in relation to him. If he were absent, you can understand how things would be. But he was not absent, he was there and in full accord with the Lord's mind; he was one of those who sat at table with Him.
E.M. Would not the truth of the body come into play in the way of adjustment as not giving to any one a distinguished place, whatever the gift might be?
J.T. I think that is right; "God has set certain
{338}
in the assembly", we read (@1 Corinthians 12:28). The truth of the body precedes that in 1 Corinthians, but it involves the assembly. The idea of gift is, "God has set certain in the assembly"; if a man is set thus as a gift in the assembly he belongs to the body as much as ever, and his spirituality would be seen in the manner in which he can retire into that. So in @Acts 20:7 the writer says, "And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread", the "we" meaning that all those distinguished brethren, including the apostle, were there together, as of the body, to break bread.
Rem. So there is no such idea as a free lance acting away from any base. In time past we have known something of that spirit and it has done much harm.
J.T. No. I think the balance is in the labourers on returning to their respective localities taking their places as of the body, and remaining "no little time with the disciples", (@Acts 14:28) with their brethren there. Indeed, the Lord's supper regulates us in this connection as in others.
Ques. Is the principle illustrated in the Old Testament in David, before going down to battle, leaving his sheep in the hands of a keeper?
J.T. That is an excellent illustration of a man having the sense of responsibility. He does not leave what is under his hand without seeing it is cared for, and I believe that is what the Holy Spirit means when He records that there were certain prophets and teachers at Antioch -- reliable men -- and that they ministered to the Lord and fasted; He selects the first and the last of them and sends them out.
Rem. The prophet's 'own country', where he is of least account, is a very valuable sphere of education.
J.T. That is a good suggestion. The Lord said that on starting out at Nazareth, and you find your measure when you are ministering among those who know you best. In using us the Lord is not thinking of you or me so much, but of His people, and He uses
{339}
what is available. In active service there is much more power than you have ordinarily, and if you go back to the locality where you are not so much honoured, perhaps, you have to settle down to your true measure. So the Lord said to the disciples, "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a little", (@Mark 6:31). There was no need to cast out demons or to preach *there* -- thus the power for that service would not be active in them.
Rem. So they would be humbled as adjusted there.
J.T. That is the thought; they would be there just in their ordinary spiritual measure. Paul says, "I am what I am", (@1 Corinthians 15:10). It was what he was by the grace of God.
Rem. Then there is another very interesting principle in @Mark 6:30 "They related to him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught". Should not all servants go back and review what there has been in the way of activity and teaching?
J.T. That would induce practical fellowship, as bringing the saints into what God is doing generally.
W.R.P. In @Acts 14 there is rehearsal with the brethren. Would not the two go together?
J.T. Quite; the brethren are brought into it. It is to be remembered in service that the edification of the assembly is what is in the mind of God, not to set up a clerical system. God never had that in mind; He had in mind in regard of gift that it was to be subservient to the assembly; hence in this epistle we get: "Ourselves your servants for Jesus¬ sake", (@2 Corinthians 4:5). The assembly is what is in the mind of God, and after all, the best gifts are but a scaffolding to the building. When the building is complete, they cease to exist as such; that gives the thing its right setting. It is thus greater to be in the body than to be set in the assembly as gifts; see @1 Corinthians 13:8.
F.S.M. So whatever a servant may be as to gift, he should be primarily a brother in his own locality.
{340}
J.T. Exactly; that is the idea. I am sure Paul and Barnabas would be that. They retained the full confidence of the saints on returning to Antioch. They arranged that "Paul and Barnabas ... should go up to Jerusalem", and they were set on their way by the assembly; (@Acts 15:2).
Ques. Is there not an excellent opportunity furnished at the time of meeting for prayer in your own local company to mention things which are of interest and which have engaged one, and thus the whole company is brought into the knowledge and sympathy of it?
Ques. How would it be if the servant in his locality is not received so well with his brethren there?
J.T. That is what happens sometimes, and the brethren may be at fault, and it certainly would cast one on the Lord. But there is no situation that can arise that the Lord cannot meet; Paul certainly was not in good favour at Corinth when he wrote his first letter. Influences were at work there to discredit him, and were successful. He alludes to this in his first letter, but now he is evidently in better favour; God had been working at Corinth through his letter; and I think God had been also working in the apostle himself. He refers here to certain experiences he had that were very severe, (see verses 8 - 10). He had been down very low and you may be sure a man with that added experience would be more commendable, and if we are not in favour in our locality and God helps us to go down, we shall become more acceptable. I have noticed in the case of Abigail, Nabal had incurred David's wrath and he was about to execute judgment, but it is said that she *came down* to meet him riding on the ass, and then he came down on the other side of the hill; (@1 Samuel 25:20). They were both going down, and that, I believe, is the secret of the solution of difficulties, that is, to get both sides to go down. David perhaps did not need to from his
{341}
point of view, but as a matter of fact, he was going down and she met him as she was coming down, and there was a very happy solution to that difficulty. I believe the secret is in going down. The arrival of Titus showed the apostle that the Corinthians were coming down.
Rem. If a servant has a secret history with God, and understands a little what it is to be a brother in his own locality, it leaves room for the Spirit to make His selection and the saints to be in harmony with that.
J.T. Quite. You have to spend a whole year with the brethren. That is what happened at Antioch, and then, when the apostles come back again, they did not go off immediately, but the Spirit of God says, "They stayed no little time with the disciples", (@Acts 14:28). On the other hand, brethren should be much concerned to be free from personal feeling, so as to lay their hands heartily on one whom the Lord may select from their midst.
J.S. If you go back amongst them and *always* figure as a gift, they may be rather willing to let you go.
D.L.H. But is it not sometimes the case that a man's gift may be very excellent and used of God as he goes here and there, but locally he may not exactly find a sphere for his peculiar gift, and he may begin to take up things that he is not qualified to deal with at all, and consequently difficulties arise?
J.T. What I think is important is the principle set out in Scripture at the beginning as governing any subject. That governing service is set out in its full bearing in @Acts 13 and 14. Later on we can see Paul is not connected with any locality, but we have the principle for every brother at the *outset*. As he moves on he is approved of God, and he is his Master's servant, and the brethren recognise that what he is doing is of God and there is no question about it. If
{342}
we have the principles right to start with, we shall know what to do throughout.
D.L.H. I think that is right.
Ques. If I understand the question aright, would it be that gift and administration are not necessarily linked up in the same person?
D.L.H. A man's gift may be greatly owned of God as he goes abroad and ministers, but when he comes back he may take up questions of administration that he may not be qualified to touch, though he may be eminently qualified to exercise his gift anywhere.
J.T. That is very important, for the local brethren who have no gift may be better qualified, through experience and continual knowledge of the things in question, to deal with assembly matters. At the same time, no brother, however much he may travel, should assume to be without local responsibility. It is his privilege to carry everything with his brethren as one of them.
J.H.T. Would you say the gifts are mentioned specifically in @1 Corinthians 12:28 and @Ephesians 4:11,12, in connection with the assembly, but the personality is seen in @Colossians 4:12 with Epaphras, "who is one of you"?
J.T. Exactly. Corinthians is the local setting; it is the epistle that governs us locally and also universally as regards church government, and so we have the gifts set "in the assembly". The Corinthians would therefore be given to understand that if those men they were gathering around and making into leaders were really gifts, they belonged to the whole assembly, God having set certain in the assembly. That does not mean the local assembly at Corinth, but the whole assembly. Gift, therefore, emerges from the local setting and belongs to the whole assembly. It is not given only to a local assembly. The person who has the gift is connected
{343}
with the locality, but as regards the exercise of his gift, it is universal, and the Corinthians were to know that. Now Ephesians introduces the gifts as from Christ. It is not how they are set, but that they are *given*; that is, the gifts in Ephesians are seen as the effect of love, the love of Christ for the assembly, and as given for the edifying of His body.
Rem. "But to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ", (@Ephesians 4:7).
J.T. That is every one of us, but then there are specific gifts mentioned. Every one has not got one of these. "Some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers", (@Ephesians 4:11). There were no evangelists mentioned at Corinth.
S.J.B.C. It has been said that gift is universal and office is local.
J.T. That is right.
S.J.B.C. What about his local responsibility?
J.T. His gift is universal and he is sent, but he himself has a local setting, and, as was said, shares local obligations as far as he can.
S.J.B.C. He is sometimes charged with neglecting his local responsibility.
J.T. Such charges are often very well founded. If one loves Christ, he will care for His interests under all circumstances.
F.H.B. Is not administration more connected with the assembly than with gift? "Tell it to the assembly" (@Matthew 18:17) is a matter of administration.
J.T. Exactly; but that would include him who has gift. The assembly includes all.
Ques. Would the exercise of gift be under the direction of the Lord, and if you leave room for that, the Lord may indicate a service in one's local setting?
J.T. I think He does. I think that is usually the way. You find how the Lord supports you, and the brethren soon come to recognise that.
{344}
Ques. What you said about a servant having the confidence of his local brethren is most important, but even the waiting for that would be very valuable, would it not?
J.T. Yes, and we should wait for it.
Rem. And we should be slow to do anything if we have not the confidence of our local brethren. While the specific gifts referred to follow, I suppose most of us here who serve would do so on the line of the measure of the gift of grace we have received of Christ rather than of specific gift.
A.S.L. Is it not important for gifts moving about in various places to be careful not to be inveigled into a settlement of difficulties in these localities? There is a tendency on the part of brethren to refer to such, which in a way is right, but brethren going around should be careful to leave local matters to the responsibility of brethren in the locality.
J.T. That is wise. But it has always to be borne in mind that whatever you are is available to the assembly -- your very best is available; so if you have experience that would help in a locality, you make use of the opportunity if the door is opened to you. If you have experience from God, and you are in France, why not let the brethren have the benefit of it in a *simple way*? for, after all, the body is universal.
A.S.L. If you have a word of counsel or wisdom in such case, you are happy to give it, but you would agree it is not for brethren constantly moving around to dabble in local matters. But, as you mentioned France, it was directly and deliberately the custom for years for certain leading brethren to come together in conference and settle all kinds of local matters and send out their dicta.
J.T. It should be kept in view that assembly economy is entered upon and worked out in localities, and the Lord has His place if we recognise that.
{345}
There was disregard of this entirely on the Continent. Seeking to help saints in local matters, as identified with them, is very different from directing them from a central position.
A.S.L. So what we are having is most valuable, for in those days it was absolutely unknown to the brethren in those parts, and so it was a regular practice for brothers at the work, as it was called, to take up and settle matters of all kinds.
Ques. Is it not important in moving about that one should studiously avoid any interference in local matters, but if asked as to any principle that would be general to the whole church of God, one would be thankful to say what one knew of general principles, avoiding any touching of local difficulties?
A.S.L. As a matter of fact, local matters can only be known to people in the locality, and can only be properly dealt with by the brethren in the locality.
J.T. Quite. The Lord would not pass them by unless there is some good reason for it. But there is the other side, which it is well to bear in mind, that whatever you are by the grace of God you belong to the assembly, and in humility you are to be available to the brethren; hence, if I were in a place where there was a care-meeting, I should feel it if I were asked not to be present. I should regard it as an evidence of want of understanding of the constitution of the assembly.
A.S.L. Of course it is perfectly legitimate for brethren to ask counsel of any brother present.
Ques. Are you making a distinction between gift and oversight?
J.T. Yes. Under the heading of gifts (@1 Corinthians 12:28) we have, "helps; governments". These should be available to the saints in a general way. All gifts are general in their bearing. The recognition of this and
{346}
of the truth of the body saves us from congregationalism, which is often apparent.
P.W. Why is such importance attached to prophecy?
J.T. "Touch not mine *anointed* ones, and do my *prophets* no harm", (@Psalm 105:15). Those two things go together. One is representation, the other prophecy, that God's mind may be known. God is pleased with one and anoints him, and so commits Himself to him, but then, the gift of prophecy is that His mind may be known. The anointing is one of the earliest things we get about the patriarchs in @Psalm 105. There were those, such as Abraham, personally pleasing to God, to whom He committed Himself. He "reproved kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm", showing how much importance He attaches to representation in the servant and that His mind might be known; the latter is what prophecy implies. It is not that you think one thing and I another; prophecy is a word from God; it is authoritative. That is what prophecy always implies; it is given so that God's mind might be known, and that is a great and important thing.
Ques. Does all this come out fully in Christ personally? Is that why He comes before us as the Servant Prophet?
J.T. Yes, I believe so. God is pleased with Him, and that is what I thought about personality. The Lord, I am sure, would help us as to this for we cannot but be conscious of how much the littleness of the flesh marks us, whereas moral dignity should be seen in those who serve God. As owned by heaven the Lord was praying, being baptised. He was fulfilling *all* righteousness. Hence, "Thou art my beloved Son" (@Luke 3:22) -- that is personality. As answering to this, God is pleased with you, and then the anointing is that He commits Himself to you, and you are qualified to represent Him. I do not think there should be
{347}
service without representation, and representation is that I am pleasing to God. Then, another thing, the Lord says, "The time is fulfilled", (@Mark 1:15). The prophet knows the time in which he is ministering and he knows what governs it.
Ques. What form does prophecy take today?
J.T. The communication of the mind of God. "Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge", (@1 Corinthians 14:29). That is what is contemplated in the anointed vessel in Corinthians. The prophets are regarded as so sensitive spiritually that if one is speaking and another has a revelation, the first one will sit down. It supposes that you are conscious of that, and indicates you are very sensitive. The assembly, being marked by subjection, is a place of great sensitiveness, hence there is room for the prophetic spirit. If another has something revealed to him, I sit down.
Ques. Is it in connection with teaching, or doctrine, or administration?
J.T. It is a question of *speaking*. "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God", (@1 Peter 4:11). "Let the prophets speak".
Eu.R. Have you in mind that there is a link with Mark's gospel, the apostle having preached the Son of God here?
J.T. I thought that, but we shall perhaps have to take it up later. It is an important part of the chapter because it shows the elevation on which levitical service is carried on.
A.H.W. Do we get the two features you have mentioned in Enoch, the sense of being pleasing to God and prophecy?
J.T. Yes. He had the testimony that he pleased God, and although the prophetic word in him was not spoken of in the Old Testament, yet it was there.
Rem. "Do my prophets no harm". I suppose you would have to go a little further back even than
{348}
Enoch, for Abel was a prophet, and the Lord so speaks of him. He brought the voice of God, and the first thing done to the first prophet was to do him harm.
J.T. I think, however, the anointing in view of prophetic ministry comes out in Abraham, that is, he was one to whom God could manifest Himself. "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham", (@Acts 7:1). That was the beginning of the service of God. It began with the God of glory and comes right down the line, and so God graciously regards him as His anointed.
M.W.B. Do you link the thought of representation with the anointing?
J.T. Yes. Before God anoints anyone he must be pleasing to Him, and that comes out supremely in the Lord. The Lord is the model for us "in whom I am well pleased".

THE DIVINE STANDARD OF SERVICE (2)
@2 Corinthians 2
J.T. Our remarks this morning were largely preliminary. No doubt the Lord will help us in looking into these two chapters, as having their own voice and bearing on the subject before us; first in the apostle's evident effort to inspire confidence in the Corinthians, linking himself up with their local affairs and exercises, telling them that his hope for them was sure, and then in carefully meeting the feeling amongst them that there was insincerity or even prevarication in his methods. This rendered his position in writing the letter extremely difficult, but we may learn from it how to deal with such circumstances in our service, for we may be sure that in serving Christ we cannot but meet them, the enemy being ever ready to instil insinuations and lack of confidence. So the apostle links them up with himself as far as possible in what he was going through, and he links himself up with what they were enduring, thus making assembly exercises, as we speak of them, universal in bearing, whether arising from certain local conditions or otherwise.
H.H. So both the epistles to the Corinthians are left on record to help us in such exercises right down to the very end.
J.T. That is quite evident. What is before us now especially is to see how one in the place of service is to act when evil or opposition arises in those whom he serves.
H.H. The apostle had been in the third heaven fourteen years before all this, but besides that he had been through much tribulation, despairing even of life, experiences which justified his taking up these exercises with the saints.
{350}
J.T. Yes; previous experience is made to tell in the letter in dealing with such conditions. The Lord enables His servants to use what resources they have, for every servant ought to have his *own* resources. Of course, our resources are in Christ, but there are resources arising from experience with Him peculiar to each of us.
Ques. Would the first epistle, portraying the desperate state into which things had fallen at Corinth, have a special bearing on our time, coming in on the corrective line, and the second epistle bringing in what is positive growing out of the first?
J.T. Yes, and I think it grows, too, out of the experience that intervened with the apostle himself, so that there is a certain analogy between this epistle and the *towel* used by our Lord in wiping the feet of the disciples after washing them. The first epistle bears strong relation to the *water* which was poured into a "washhand basin"; it was a portable vessel, and thus the Lord *came* to each; it says, "He comes therefore to Simon Peter" (@John 13:5,6), the service not requiring that they should go to Him. The apostle would readily have gone to Corinth, if by going he could have done as well or better than he could do by the letter. It was a question, as he tells us in this chapter, of love's calculation. Love's reckoning kept him away, not any want of self-sacrifice, so that the water reached them and did its work. Now he is approaching them, I apprehend, with the towel, which arises largely from the experience that intervened, on which he dwells at length in the opening part of the first chapter, an experience which brought God in perhaps in a way not otherwise known. God was brought in, and thus in being brought down and finding God in the circumstances one gains and becomes more effective in the service. So that we should notice the place that *God* has in these two chapters in relation to the apostle's experience.
{351}
D.L.H. There was a good remark once made by a well-known brother amongst us that the first epistle to the Corinthians suggests the use of golden snuffers, connected with the tabernacle system of things, and that this second epistle is rather the oil beaten for the light. The apostle seems to have gone through a good deal in that connection himself, so that he was able to minister the necessary oil to keep the light burning, as in this epistle.
J.T. Yes, that rather confirms it from another view.
F.H.B. We get more positive gospel ministry in this epistle.
J.T. We do, and these chapters emphasise the minister. All the chapters do, we may say, but the circumstances experienced between the two epistles gave remarkable occasion for God to come in, and it is "God who raises the dead", (chapter 1:9). The encouragement received thus by the apostle was for the gain of the Corinthians.
Ques. Is the idea to establish mutual confidence and feeling between the servant and those served?
J.T. I thought so. Paul seems to link up the Corinthians with those experiences: "Ye also labouring together by supplication for us that the gift towards us, through means of many persons, may be the subject of the thanksgiving of many for us" (chapter 1:11). Their supplication is recognised, and it is suggested that there should be thanksgiving.
A.S.L. As to the line of experience with God in view of the service, is it not necessary that all in some measure should go through the experience that Paul describes in the first chapter: "We ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead" (verse 9)? Have we not to learn in some little way what it is to come to the end of all resources, to be at our wit's end, and to cry unto the Lord? And
{352}
thus experience is gained with God, the "God who raises the dead". Is not that an essential part of the inward training we have to go through?
J.T. That is what I thought; the "sentence of death in ourselves" is a judgment formed definitely as to oneself, so that God is trusted.
A.S.L. Death morally and resurrection; death in the sense of being brought to the end of all resources, so that we are shut up to God.
J.T. Quite, that we may not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.
F.H.B. Do we not get a great deal of the apostle's discipline as well as his ministry in this epistle?
J.T. That is what he brings out here and he links on the Corinthians in the most skilful manner with his experiences, bringing in their supplications. It is the part the saints have in fellowship with those who serve them. The supplications are by many persons, and then the thanksgiving is by many. The work of God thus proceeds in the most mutual way, for, after all, there is a great interdependence between those who serve and those who are served. And then there is the plain assertion of his veracity in all he was doing.
A.S.L. He speaks of all he went through in the first chapter as being for the encouragement of others in any kind of distress. God allows us to be passed through all kinds of circumstances that we may learn to trust in Him, and then we can in a practical way be helpful to others.
J.T. It is thus that the towel feature appears, for you are concerned not to wound or cause discomfort. Plain things may be said, but said in such a wise and skilful way that there is the least wounding or discomfort possible, and that, I think, is what runs through this whole letter. It is said, "He ... began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the linen towel with which he was girded", (@John 13:5).
{353}
S.J.B.C. The last thing He took was the towel. He had that object in view.
J.T. He was girded with what would be most useful; there is the token of service, but of the most gracious and considerate kind. It is not a false clerical garb, for that is useless. There are those who put on outward garbs of humility that are of no use whatever, whereas the christian's garb of humility is useful. I think the towel represents that, so that in the attitude of the service, the very thing that symbolises your service is in itself most useful.
J.J. Would you say that Paul here is very much like the Lord in that chapter in John where He laid aside His garments before He took the towel?
J.T. Well, exactly. Paul is girded with the towel in the allusions to encouragement. He had acquired great ability in encouragement through the experience he had had, and he is, so to say, girded with that; he has that before him. Much has to be said, but that is what he has before him. He impresses the Corinthians at the outset with this sympathetic attitude.
M.W.B. Do you think experience enables us to deal in that gracious way?
J.T. I believe that is the end in view in the usually severe discipline through which servants are passed. You can see in Moses how he would have served without it. He had it in his heart to serve, and one day he looked on his brethren and would have helped them, but he was wanting in the skill of a servant. But after forty years of experience with God he is spoken of as His servant in @Psalm 105, "Moses, his servant"; God knew him thus. "He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen"; that is to say, Moses had established the fact that he was a servant. In returning he was greatly reduced by the discipline of God, but in all the reduction he had learned God, and at the end of the forty years it was
{354}
seen in the fact that God showed Himself to him in a way that in no way intimated human greatness. It was in a thorn-bush. That does not denote any greatness in this world. Well, Moses took account of that. He was accustomed to great things in Egypt, but he took account of an insignificant thing like a thorn-bush burning. It is said that he turned aside to see, that is, he showed he was interested, and then we read, "Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see", and He said, "Moses, Moses!" as much as to say, I am taking full account of you. God is taking him up now and He says, "Loose thy sandals from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground". (@Exodus 3:4,5).
S.J.B.C. He spoke about it as a "great sight". Learned in all the wisdom and skill of the Egyptians there was something in the burning bush that was wonderful in his eyes.
J.T. Well, it was most important that he should know God. That is the one great necessity, that we should know God, because one of the great features in service is representation, and representation lies in the knowledge of God. How can I represent one whom I do not know? In the knowledge of God I act like Him. So that God says to him later twice over that he would be as God, first to Aaron and then to Pharaoh. That is what was in God's mind, that he should be a complete representative of God to the king of Egypt.
M.W.B. Do we find the same thing in this epistle with regard to the apostle that he personally, in that way, was a representative of the Lord?
J.T. I think he was. That is the ground he takes, not only officially, but in character. The skill and grace of the apostle brings out the character of the man. Chapter 4 speaks of Christ as the image of God and in it the apostle shows how like his Master he was.
H.H. And he speaks later of the grace of our Lord
{355}
Jesus Christ, who being rich became poor. That was how Christ came down, and so we have it in the apostle as well, no doubt as an object lesson for the Corinthians.
J.T. Quite. God has a standard of service in Christ, presented in Mark's gospel, and He keeps to it. Paul is in accord with it here.
Ques. Are you suggesting that these exercises and experiences are to be mutual, both on the part of the servants and the people of God?
J.T. That is the way -- interdependence between the servant and those whom he serves. Now you get in @John 13 that the feet-washing was before the passover, that is, it is a new thing, a thing by itself. It is not anything arising out of the passover or anything that existed previously to it; it is of Himself. "Jesus, knowing ... that he came out from God and was going to God, rises from supper and lays aside his garments". His service is of Himself; it does not take on any current practice at all, no current religious custom or manner, and it is *before* the passover. The passover in John represented what was current religiously, but what He was doing was by itself, and so He was representative of God. He came from God and went to God, and so with Moses, he carried nothing at all into Egypt which was of Egypt. What he brought into Egypt was what he gathered up with God, and hence he was "God to Pharaoh", (@Exodus 7:1). He represented God, and that is the principle. One is not to be like the current religious servants, but to be different. This is sure to be resented, indeed, it will involve persecution, but it is a feature of the testimony.
W.C.G. Did his experience on that line begin with sitting down by the well? It was different from sitting by the great things of Egypt, and was not Paul, as it were, sitting down by the well when he enjoyed the consolations that were in Christ?
J.T. Just so. It is remarkable how much instruction
{356}
we get in connection with wells in the early scriptures.
W.R.P. Would not that give great distinctiveness to our service, so that we should not want to imitate one another, but have something distinct of ourselves?
J.T. That is the thought. It was before the passover in John. John emphasises throughout that what the Lord brought in was of Himself and was different and I think you get that here. The apostle really is coming from God in a new way; he had been down into death and despaired even of life and had the sentence of death in himself, but in that he found God in a special delivering way: "Who has delivered us from so great a death, and *does* deliver ... he will also yet deliver", (@2 Corinthians 1:10).
J.H.T. Does the contrast between the beginning and the end of Moses¬ service help at all? The beginning was characterised by a man slain, but the close of it was when he blessed the tribes, "a people saved by Jehovah", (@Deuteronomy 33:29).
J.T. Quite; it is the blessing of "Moses the man of God" (verse 1); it is the one who has had to do with God and now regarded as the man of God. He is so with God that he is able to see the saints now apart from the flesh, which is another important feature. He saw them as loved by God: "Yea, he loveth the peoples", he says, (verse 3).
H.E.S. Is that why emphasis is laid on the fact that it is "the assembly of God which is in Corinth" in both epistles?
J.T. Yes; and so you will notice here how much he makes of *God*, but then the Son of God was preached by him. He says, "For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity before God, (not in fleshly wisdom but in God's grace,) we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly towards you. For we
{357}
do not write other things to you, but what ye well know and recognise; and I hope that ye will recognise to the end, even as also ye have recognised us in part, that we are your boast, even as ye are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus", (@2 Corinthians 1:12 - 14). Then he goes on to say that he had a purpose to come to them; he was sincere and concerned with a definite purpose to come to Corinth and to give them a second benefit and to be put forward by them to the different parts which he wished to visit in his service; that is another thing to be noted; he had a definite purpose before him. In their view it was prevarication or lightness, but in truth it was the working of love. The servant learns how to reckon as to his movements in love; he is not moving haphazardly, but with calculation and purpose. And he goes on to point out that the Son of God was preached by him, and by Silvanus, and Timotheus. He is putting all on the level of what he preached -- the Son of God was not yea and nay.
Ques. Do you extend the thought of representation to the company, or limit it to the apostle or the individual, and was that the object of the enemy's attack to obliterate the thought that the company should represent God?
J.T. It is in the assembly, of course, but we are speaking now of service, and I thought those who enter into service should see to it that they are conscious of being pleasing to God, that is on the principle of "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight". The consciousness of being pleasing to God underlies the anointing. God anoints us as pleased with us, and then the idea of gift and being sent comes in, so that one is, so to say, personally great enough to represent God. God must be the judge of that, and He gives His servants to understand their place with Him. It involves our place with Christ as sons, for the Levites were all "firstborn ones". It also implies, as we have said,
{358}
what we are in our secret lives with God -- that He is pleased with us.
P.L. Do you get that in the prophet, "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth" (@Isaiah 42 1)?
J.T. That is the direct statement of it. God is pleased with you, and then, as going forth, you represent Him, which is really more important than what you do. I should prefer to make being the representative of God the first thing, and then what I may do is manifestly of God. So this epistle develops the idea of our being "God's fellow-workmen".
A.H.W. Is that why the apostle opens the epistle with the "God of all encouragement; who encourages us in all our tribulation"?
J.T. Quite. *God* is emphasised throughout, but then, the Son of God is, so to speak, God's best, to speak with the greatest reverence. It is what He had always in mind as representative of Him. Hence He had in mind in regard of Israel that the testimony that Moses should render was, "Israel is my son, my firstborn ... Let my son go, that he may serve me", (@Exodus 4:22,23). Now, that is taken up in the prophet and in @Matthew 2:15: "Out of Egypt have I called my son". He is, as I said, God's best. He is in that way the Son become Man; He has a mediatorial position, but as One who is personally great enough to represent God in all that He is.
M.W.B. Is that why he links his preaching with his actual movements in service here?
J.T. I think so. "The Son of God" -- that is how he brings it in; he lifts the subject out of the mere local circumstances to the full height of what God was doing. What was God doing? He was working in the Son, and the Son is His ideal. In Him He shines out, and in Him He sets out His purpose for men.
M.W.B. Do you suggest that that should have an answer in our own movements?
{359}
J.T. That is the thought. You are moving in relation to the Son of God. That is how God has come in, in the Son -- "only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him", (@John 1:18). You get an apprehension of that, and your movements are in that relation. So the apostle brings in what he preached among them -- the Son of God; he lifts the thing up to that level. It is not a mere question of your being led in what you are doing, it is what *God* is doing. What did he preach? What was the testimony rendered at Corinth? The Son of God. That is, God's best was presented, the One to whom God has committed Himself absolutely, and He was preached not only by Paul but by Silvanus and Timotheus; there was thus a threefold testimony. It was in Him every promise was yea and amen.
W.C.G. The apostle had nothing less in view than "until we all arrive at ... the knowledge of the Son of God", (@Ephesians 4:13).
J.T. That is what he had in view in his ministry, but he brings it in here to show the level of his own purposes and movements.
W.C.G. Is it that knowledge that affects us as pleasing God?
J.T. He brings it in here as the working out of the faithfulness of God which is another great element, see verses 18 and 19. The faithfulness of God is bound up in the Son.
J.J. In bringing it forward in this way, is he not like Moses in @Exodus 3:14, speaking of the name of God, "I AM THAT I AM"?
J.T. Moses goes personally much further than the types. "From eternity to eternity thou art God", (@Psalm 90:2). That is how he apprehended God as expressed in his prayer -- the "prayer of Moses, the man of God". You get the man himself. Moses could speak about the tabernacle, but he says, "*Thou* hast been our dwelling-place in all generations. Before
{360}
the mountains were brought forth, and thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from eternity to eternity thou art God", (verses 1,2). That is how he apprehended God, and so it was the Eternal who sent him -- the "I AM", hence, Moses comes into John's gospel perhaps more than we have noticed; it is the opening up really of @Exodus 3 that God had come within man's range. He came in in the most lowly circumstances and Moses turned aside to see the sight, and it is from that point his ministry begins, and that is what he alludes to in his prayer. It is what God was to him, and so it is, "I AM hath sent me unto you". Now the Lord says, "Before Abraham was, I am"; the connection between that wonderful statement and @Exodus 3 is clear.
J.R.S. Are you linking up the gospel of John with the thorn-bush?
J.T. Certainly, that is the point. "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us"; that is the thorn-bush; God come into those circumstances. Will any one turn aside to see? The great servants did. "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", (@John 1:14). That is what underlies service, and Paul alludes to it here -- what God was to him.
Ques. Does @2 Corinthians 4:6 show that representation is according to the knowledge of God? "God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".
J.T. Just so. As already remarked, earlier in that chapter it was said that Christ is the image of God, and now Paul represents God in his measure. It is the Son of God that is preached; that is, he is bringing before them what was preached by himself and Silvanus and Timotheus, so that whatever they might think of Paul, the Son of God was preached,
{361}
and that is the level on which God was moving. He is moving on the level of His Son. Paul was on this level also; not trifling miserably, as they thought, in making promises he did not mean to keep.
M.W.B. Why does he group the other two with him in his service?
J.T. I think to show the beautiful spirit that prevailed in the service at Corinth, and that there was a threefold cord in it which could not be broken. The Lord had said, "The scripture cannot be broken", (@John 10:35), "I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High", (@Psalm 82:6); that could not be altered. Well, those three brought the Son of God in in their preaching, and in connection with it Paul now brings out one great feature of Genesis, that is, the faithfulness of God.
S.J.B.C. Referring to the Son of God, would it be the Son as begotten in time, or would it suggest resurrection? He was "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" (@Romans 1:4), or would it be His eternal sonship?
J.T. I do not know that there is such a term in Scripture as eternal sonship. "Son of God" is a question of a Person. The Son of God is announced in Scripture after the Lord Jesus was here. In @Luke 1:35 it says, "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God". That is what Luke says, meaning that that should come out in Him in due course. Jesus asserts His relation as Son at the age of twelve in saying, "My Father's business", but the Father's voice announcing it is at His baptism.
S.J.B.C. You believe He was the Son in eternity?
J.T. What the Scriptures say is, "In the beginning was the Word". It does not say 'the Son'. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (@John 1:1), that is to say, His eternal personal existence is stated, He
{362}
was there personally in the beginning. To go so far as to give Him a personal name or designation then, is going beyond Scripture it seems to me, but that the *Person was there* is the great point. To give Him a name is another matter, but the Person was there. It is the foundation of Scripture that He was a divine Person and so was there in the beginning. Now Luke says that He "shall be called Son of God", and He says Himself at the age of twelve years, "Did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?" (@Luke 2:49) There is a plain intimation of His relation with God. There is the assertion of His relation with His Father as Son at the age of twelve years, and then God Himself calls Him Son as He was thirty years old: "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", (@Luke 3:22). That is what He was here. Luke presents Him in that way; and John speaks of His sonship only *after* He is said to have become flesh.
E.J.M. "God ... at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son", (@Hebrews 1:1).
J.T. Quite. It was a divine Person, and that Person was the Son, but in a mediatorial position; it is in that way He speaks. The speaking was by Him, as in manhood. I am sure we should be most careful as to applying to Christ as "in the form of God" designations given to Him as in Man's form.
G.J.E. When the Son of God is mentioned in Scripture it is not always in manhood?
J.T. I know of no other way in which He is so spoken of in Scripture than in manhood, but that in no way detracts from the fact that He was a divine Person and was there in the beginning. I believe many assume that the *revelation* of God and the *form* of God are equivalent, but this is to ignore that it is expressly stated that no one has seen God at any time, that He dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen, nor is able to see, This was
{363}
written *after* God is said to have been declared by the only-begotten Son.
Ques. Does the title "Son of God" stand in regard to God's faithfulness to His Old Testament promises?
J.T. It does. It has to be borne in mind that the divine personality of our Lord is properly based on the statement, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". He is a divine Person and that underlies the fact that He is capable of representing God. As Man the designation "Son" undoubtedly regards Him in this light, but to make it apply to Him as "in the form of God" is another thing entirely.
S.J.B.C. I thought that in incarnation He took up in new conditions a relationship that had ever existed in eternity and that as the Son of God it was the relationship in a new condition.
J.T. I think you are asserting too much in saying the relationship 'had ever existed'. It does speak of the glory He had with the Father, but to give the thing a name is, I believe, going beyond Scripture. That the *Person* was there and that He *was God* is the point. I believe many have in their minds a fixed conception of the *form* of God. That is, they think they can bring the infinite and unknowable within their finite comprehension. But we have the declaration of God, of His nature and attributes, and that is in "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father"; God is now working in that connection in His own Son. Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus preached Him among the Corinthians. While God is thus brought within our range in a Man, owned as Son of God -- the title showing *who* He is -- there is infinity in the Person -- what is beyond us. "No one knows the Son but the Father", (@Matthew 11:27).
M.W.B. Is your point that it had to wait for revelation before the title "Son" could be disclosed?
J.T. That is how Scripture presents it to us. He
{364}
is called Son in manhood. So Paul was not moving in Corinth on the low level of man's mind, but on the high level of what God was doing. God is operating in His Son, His *own* Son, and that is what was preached.
J.J. What a wonderful way to use the towel, by bringing in the unalterable system connected with the Son of God!
J.T. Quite, and that every thought now, everything that God had intimated, every promise given is yea and amen, "for glory to God by us". The whole system is brought in in that way. God is operating in the Son, but the thing is reflected in the servants.
J.J. Does he correct their idea of prevarication by bringing in such a positive range of glory connected with Christ?
J.T. And "for glory to God by us", (@2 Corinthians 1:20). There would be no glory to God by prevarication or lightness, but the glory of God as in the Son of God was reflected in Paul.
H.D'A.C. There was no yea and nay in the apostle; it was in the Corinthians. *They* had changed, they had allowed what was shameful, but the apostle had remained steadfast as the Son of God was steadfast.
J.T. So he brings in the striking expression of that: "I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth", (@2 Corinthians 1:23). He was with God in this matter; he was on the high level of God's operations in the Son, and so if he did not come to Corinth, it was because of the calculation of love.
P.W. "Love never fails" (@1 Corinthians 13:8); that is the Son of God, it is seen in the apostle here.
D.L.H. Do we not get a very remarkable statement of the truth of Christ's Person in @Hebrews 1 that God has spoken Sonwise, or "in Son". Well, that is God speaking in a divine Person, but then He
{365}
has inherited a name which is more excellent than that of angels, and then you get quoted certain statements from @Psalm 2:7 where the title Son of God comes in. "*Thou* art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee", and so on. I thought you got there first of all a statement of the glory of His Person, the brightness of God's glory and the express image of His being; and then that He has inherited a name as coming into manhood which is more excellent than that of angels.
J.T. The speaking was in a divine Person, of course, the title "Son" conveys that, but nevertheless, what is alluded to right through is mediatorial, God speaking as in Christ become Man. But God *Himself* was speaking -- not as in the prophets, mere creatures, but in One His equal -- "in Son", as you say.
Ques. So would you say that in @Hebrews 1 it is what He is in manhood that is spoken of in that unique way?
J.T. Yes. What He is personally is there. He is "the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power", (@Hebrews 1:3). Unquestionably the Person who is alluded to in @John 1 is before us; the title "Son", marking Him off from all creatures, however honoured some were, denotes this.
Rem. I was wondering if Scripture would bear out that He is the Son in Deity, and the same Person Son of God in time and humanity.
J.T. But you will run across difficulties if you begin to analyse things like that, because the Son, without any modification, is said *not* to know certain things; (@Mark 13:32). You have to bear in mind that Scripture is dealing with a mediatorial system of things. Christ has come within the range of men to speak to men, but to attempt to give Him a name before He became Man is going beyond Scripture, it seems to me. Because of His taking up a mediatorial
{366}
position as Son we can understand the references to subjection, obedience, etc.
W.R.P. You would not carry the title "Word" into what He was in Deity.
J.T. No. He had acquired that name among the saints. So in @Hebrews 1 you get a variety of the glories of Christ mentioned, but they are all taken from the statements of saints, that is, they are all taken from the Psalms, as if God loves to bring in the saints to establish the great truth of the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. But like "Son", "the Word" implies His deity, for only a divine Person could reveal -- it is a question of speaking the *mind* of God.
Eu.R. Is the great thought here to establish the heart of the servant in the stability of Christ as the Son?
J.T. That is what is in view, so you go back to Genesis, where you have the idea of the promises. The promises were made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and what you get in Genesis is the knowledge that Abraham is first brought into as to the faithfulness of God. As God blessed Abraham and he became great, the Philistine king began to take notice of him and came to him with his captain. Abraham gives him cattle and sets seven ewe lambs apart before he gave them to the king, implying that that is Abraham's spirit -- not an aggressive spirit, not a self-assertive spirit, but as blessed of God he has that spirit, the spirit of a ewe lamb, fruitful, but not combative. That is the attitude he takes up. The Philistine king is aggressive, he is sure to assert himself, but Abraham points out that is not his spirit at all. So he makes a covenant there, and Abraham reproves Abimelech on account of the well, that is, while Abraham has a peaceful disposition he asserted the rights of God in regard of the well, and there it is that the principle of Beer-sheba, the 'well
{367}
of the oath', comes in; it refers to God's engagements. Isaac comes back to it in a more striking manner. He also enters into a covenant with the Philistine at Beer-sheba; and now we have a *city* -- the city is called Beer-sheba. And then Jacob comes to it (@Genesis 46:1), and in leaving Canaan he offers sacrifices to the "God of his father Isaac", saying nothing about Abraham; that signifies that it is a question now of the servant apprehending Christ risen. Though there was nothing to show outwardly, Jacob was going out of the land under divine orders, and in the light of God's faithfulness. He offers sacrifices to the "God of his father *Isaac*". God appears to him as "the God of thy father" and assures him that every promise made would be fulfilled. All is secured in Isaac, that is, in Christ risen from the dead -- the Son of God.
M.W.B. Do you link those thoughts with the preaching of the Son of God here?
J.T. I do. It is a question of the promises, of the saints understanding the divine engagements and their fulfilment. That is the level on which God is moving now and every divine engagement is yea and amen in Christ.
Eu.R. We need that when the outlook publicly is not hopeful.
J.T. That is the point. You apprehend God in the Son of God and that nothing can fall to the ground. There is not only the yea, but the amen. It says in @Psalm 106:48, "Let all the people say, Amen!"
F.S.M. Does the preaching of the Son of God involve the presentation of a divine Person, the perfect representation of God as He is, and the establishment of all the promises?
J.T. That is what I thought. You apprehend God in a mediatorial way, but in One who is none less than God Himself that is, He is the Son, but the
{368}
Son come in in subjection. No evangelist is more pronounced on subjection than John, and it is set forth in One who was absolutely at the divine bidding.
M.W.B. There was been a difficulty in the minds of some as to the preaching of the Son of God, and yet the Son not being the subject of revelation. What would you say, bearing in mind @Matthew 11?
J.T. The Son as to His *Person* is known to the Father only; but as to what He is in *that* relation with God as Man, He is to be known by us, as taught in @Ephesians 4. He is the subject of declaration, and the preaching is based on this: He is declared -- marked out -- Son of God. There is no question about it. In this way the Son of God is known, and ministry is to this end. What He is in the relation of Son to God in manhood is known; thus the "full-grown man" is what we are to arrive at. "The measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ", (verse 13).
M.W.B. What do you understand by the expression in Matthew 11:27: "No one knows the Son but the Father"?
J.T. That is His Person as to His eternal relation; that is inscrutable.
M.W.B. That has not been revealed.
J.T. No. You cannot give names to, or define relations between, divine Persons before incarnation. You have to go by Scripture.
H.D'A.C. You do not deny the relationship, but Scripture speaks of it as it came out in Him when in the mediatorial position.
F.H.B. I remember F.E.R. saying that we have no testimony in Scripture of the relationship of divine Persons in the past eternity.
J.T. I think that is just. You are careful as to what you say, but the way in which Scripture presents the thing, as said already, is that the *Person* was there. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". I was
{369}
helped by remarks made by F.E.R. in America on this subject.
H.H. Do you not think it is suggestive in @John 9 that before the blind man came to know the Son of God, you have the spittle and the clay, the thought of being *sent*?
J.T. It is a most touching reference, because the spittle undoubtedly alludes to what the Lord was *essentially*, that is, all that He is personally has entered into His humanity. He is not less God; He is absolutely personally God, but I have no doubt the spittle is a touching way of reminding us that all He is essentially has come into manhood.
H.H. It is the way we are privileged to know the Son of God.
J.T. Think of the humiliation attaching to it! He "made mud of the spittle" (verse 6), it says. It is the humiliation of it, that love would go to that length in order to place Himself within man's range. If that is applied to the man, what will happen? It will make him worse, but the moral application is at once introduced: "Go, wash", and the man "went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing". That is the moral element; he obeyed.
A.H.W. Would you say a word on why it says, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before" (@John 6:62)? Why the Son of man in that connection?
J.T. That alludes to the grace of heaven taking that form and coming down -- all that heaven could devise, as one has said, taking that form. @John 6 is what He was as coming down to be within our range, but it is the same Person who goes up. The "*He*" is the Person. So in manhood He is the same Person, unchanged and unchangeable.
A.S.L. Manhood is the condition into which He has graciously descended.
J.T. That is right. And John emphasises that He
{370}
did it Himself. "The Word became flesh". That is like the spittle; all He was essentially as become Man.
J.J. Paul had that in mind in what he says; the unchangeability of what he preached, and he virtually says, 'I am not changed'.
J.T. Exactly. The Son is the object of God's love and delight, a divine Person in *that* relation here; and *He* is preached. How attractive He is! It is what He is declared to be, "Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness", (@Romans 1:4).
Rem. 'Word' implies declaration.
J.T. Yes; He speaks the mind of God.
A.S.L. How far does "for glory to God by us" go (@2 Corinthians 1:20)? Is that the apostle's service?
J.T. I think it is a general statement that may be carried through. It is worked out again later, where the messengers of the assemblies are said to be Christ's glory, and you have glory to God in the assembly in Christ Jesus throughout all generations.
Rem. That is @Ephesians 3. That would carry the thought further.
J.T. I thought so. It is the complete thought. Glory being in the assembly refers to the way we reflect God. We reflect God as He is in Christ, and so, "glory to God by us". It is as saints of God in service that we reflect what He is in Christ.
W.R.P. Do you not think that what is mediatorial will go beyond dispensation?
J.T. I think it does. We shall be dependent upon it in eternity.
Eu.R. The apostle himself says to the Corinthians, "He that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God", (chapter 1:21).
J.T. That is what God is doing. It is God who has anointed us. It says, "he that ... has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts".
P.W. Is not the Son of man really the Son of God
{371}
become Man, and because He has become Man He brings in all the blessing of the Son of man? Is it not all bound up with the fact that the Son of God was the One found here as Man -- in whom God *found* His delight?
J.T. The Son of God is what He is on God's side, and the Son of man what He is on our side.
Ques. Is it the Son of God in @Hebrews 1, that Person in manhood who is addressed as God Himself?
J.T. Yes. He is such in John. "Before Abraham was, I am", (@John 8:58). That is His Godhead. In @Psalm 102:27 He is addressed in manhood as "the Same", the existing One, who does not change.
D.L.H. In @Hebrews 1 the incarnation is supposed; it assumes the incarnation in a way.
J.T. It does. Just as the prophets were available to God to speak to man, so the Son has become available, but the speaking is by a divine Person, not by a creature.
D.L.H. I recollect how many times J.N.D. used to say that Scripture is wiser than we are, and he deprecated any kind of deduction from scriptural statements as likely to go beyond what Scripture actually says.
J.T. Then we see here (verse 22), how God, working on this high level of the Son, establishes us, and anoints us, and seals us, and gives us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts, that is, the Spirit of God is here operating to bring the saints on to this level, to lift us out of the level of man in the flesh, because anointing means that I am taken out of that altogether. Whatever dignity I may have had, it is worthless, but God has set me up in dignity by anointing me. Here it is in the plural, the saints are anointed. God does it; just as He anointed Christ and sealed Him, so He anoints us and gives us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts, so that we should not be on the level of this world. The earnest of the Spirit is a kind of
{372}
income whereby we are rendered independent of this world.
P.L. So one must be at the top on the high level of God's operations to come down in love.
J.T. Yes; and all is maintained in dignity.
Ques. Do we serve in the light of that dignity?
J.T. That is it. I am sure God would have us to get out of current religious ways, so as to reach the level of His operations.
H.E.S. Is your thought that God has before Him that all service is to be in the dignity of sonship?
J.T. That is exactly what God has before Him.
R.B. Are you connecting that with what you referred to as personality?
J.T. That is just what it is, and hence what underlies the levitical position is that each Levite is a *first-born* -- not only as a son but a first-born, as if to enhance his dignity. You cannot get anything greater in a family than that.
H.H. It is really Paul's first impression of Christ. He preached Christ as the Son of God at the outset.
J.T. He says: "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings", (@Galatians 1:16). So he is the first to announce Him as Son of God.
Ques. Is it not a remarkable statement in Romans that we are sons of the living God?
J.T. It is indeed; it is taken from Hosea.
A.S.L. It shows what a unique and incomparable thought the family of God is. You cannot conceive of a family made up of 'first-born ones'.
J.T. Not in ordinary affairs. Christ is first-born among many brethren, He is anointed with the oil of gladness above His companions. Although we are all first-born ones *as related to one another*, He is the only One, as in relation to us, who has that title.
Ques. Would you say a word as to John 17:24, "that they may behold my glory which
{373}
thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"?
J.T. There is the glory which He had with the Father before the world was (@John 17:5) -- He does not say the disciples were to see that. They were to see the *given* glory (verse 24); then He says, "For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". These statements lift us into the great thoughts of divine love. We shall see them fully as with Christ in heaven. What has come to one lately is the thought of God's best. We want to get into that -- God's best thoughts, and for that we have to see what His relations are with Christ, that He had a glory given Him of the Father and was loved by Him before the foundation of the world. It requires spirituality for that, but there it is. @John 17 is marvellous as taking us into the greatest, the best thoughts of divine love, we, with Christ, being the objects of it.
Ques. Scripture says, "We have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son as Saviour of the world", (@1 John 4:14). Was He the Son as He was sent, or did He become the Son?
J.T. It is the *Person*, I think, that is in view. "A body hast thou prepared me, ... Lo, I come to do thy will". It is the Person come into manhood. But I do not see that we should make 'sent' allude to His birth simply; morally it was there before and so entered into incarnation, but the bearing of it is toward His actual entrance into service. The Father had sanctified Him and sent Him into the world. I do not apprehend this to mean that He was sent before He became Man, but sent as in manhood. The same may be said of "Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent", (@John 17:3). He did not bear the name "Jesus Christ" before incarnation. Being sent into the world does not necessarily mean that it is from another place literally, but that the *Father* does it. Hence the Lord says, "As thou hast sent me into the
{374}
world, I also have sent them into the world". It is a question of being sent by a Person; the disciples as not of or in the world *morally*, were sent into it for testimony. We may thus see that while it is said the Father sent the Son, we cannot fairly deduce from this that He was actually in that relation with God as "in the form of God".
{375}
SPIRITUALITY AS IN JOHN'S GOSPEL
@John 4:28 - 30,39; @John 12:3; @John 20:1 - 3,11 - 18
I have been thinking of late of the women of whom we have records by the Holy Spirit in the different books of Scripture, particularly in the typical books of the Old Testament and in the gospel narratives. These women, if rightly considered in relation to one another, set out the result which the Spirit of God would work in His people in relation to the light presented in each book. I have selected John this evening, having spoken of other books elsewhere, particularly Luke.
Luke has in view *subjection* in the people of God, and so there we have emphasis laid on Mary the mother of our Lord. As having heard the communications of Gabriel, she says, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word", (chapter 1:38). She is subject. Many women might be noted throughout the book as bearing constructively on what is set out in Mary. At the end of Luke we have women who, as loving the Lord, were at the sepulchre and received word relative to Him from the two men whom they saw there, and it says they returned from the sepulchre and told all these things to the *eleven*; that is, these women recognised the authoritative representatives of Christ; that is the sure result of the gospel of Luke as rightly apprehended. As subject, we shall not fail to recognise what represents Him in any way authoritatively. It adds, "And to all the rest", (chapter 24:9) We shall, as subject to Christ, surely have some communications from Him, and we shall place those communications where they can be made best use of, where they can be best disposed of. They will not be trodden under the foot of man, for the communications that we receive from the Lord
{376}
are precious. They come from heaven; they are as fine gold and must not be cast to the swine, but be placed where they will be properly cared for and distributed, that is, by those who are in some way representative of Christ. And then "the rest", that is, all the saints will be taken account of.
And so later in the same chapter we have the two restored ones who, having come back from Emmaus, "found the eleven", (verse 33). As having wandered from Christ and divine principles, some have difficulty in finding those who seek to maintain the authority of Christ, not that they are hidden away exactly, but the difficulty arises because of our dark thoughts, the darkness that accrues from wandering. But the two found the eleven. It is important for anyone seeking light to find the eleven, that is, those who represent the Lord in some way, it may be in a broken way, for there are only eleven here, whereas there had been twelve; nevertheless there were the eleven who represented the Lord, "and those with them", and they were "gathered together". That is the sure result, as I said, of understanding Luke -- subjection, and the recognition of those who represent the Lord as seeking to maintain His authority.
Now in John we have another view, inclusive of Luke indeed, for there can be nothing for God without subjection, but John has in view what is *spiritual*, not only that we should be subject to Christ, as it is said, the assembly is subjected to Christ, and the Holy Spirit is operating to bring that about, but that we should enter into the greatest and best thoughts of God, for He withholds nothing now. It is a wonderful time; it is a time of unparalleled privilege; a time in which God is unfolding to us His very best. He has come out in His beloved Son, according to this evangelist, and so the great truth of the Person of the Son is immediately stated: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
{377}
Word was God", (@John 1:1). We are notified at once of the immense fact that the Word was in the beginning, that is, the One who unfolds the thoughts of God is not only from the beginning, but He was *in* it. "In the beginning *was* the Word". That One who has been talking to you, and telling you of God, was in the beginning. He was *in* it, and He was in it not in any inferior sense; He was *God*. In taking up things which relate to divine Persons we are slow to apprehend the magnitude of what we are dealing with. "No man hath seen God", says the evangelist, "at anytime; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath *declared* him", (verse 18). The *Word* conveys the thought of speaking. The glorious One presented in @John 1:1 has actually spoken to me! How affecting! If He has not spoken to you, well, you know very little -- you know nothing first-hand. John would have us get things first-hand, and he emphasises that the Person who brings things to us is the Word -- He is the One who *speaks*. What, you say, the One who has spoken to me? Yes; that very One. When He was here the speaking was general, for He says, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloke for their sin", (@John 15:22). You see the wonderful speaking; by it the sin of the Jews was exposed and could not be covered up.
And so we find the very One who has spoken to you speaking to this woman here. He was *in* the beginning, not *from* it; bear that in mind. He was *in* it, and in no inferior way. He was in it, and He was with God in it. And then to add to that, He *was* God (no less than that), and that is the One who has spoken to you and to me. See what that means, beloved, not only have I things first-hand, but I have them from such an One as that -- He who is called the Word. So abundant and universal has been His speaking, so unlimited have been His communications,
{378}
that He has acquired that name in all hearts who love Him -- the Word.
Immediately He is here as the Word become flesh, it is recorded: "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth", (verse 14). And then John the baptist, who is brought in by this evangelist as representing service according to God, bears witness, as if the picture must be complete, and what did he witness? "After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me", (verse 15). He is that -- the One who was in the beginning. Name any dignitary in the Old Testament, any angelic dignitary, and you will come to it that every one will have to say, "He was before me". Than John the baptist there was none greater born of woman, as the Lord says, and he says of the Lord, He "is preferred before me". Surely He is preferred! Preferred by whom? By God, and I hope by all of us. I hope Jesus is preferred by all of us to any other man or being in heaven or on earth, however great. This gospel delivers us from the influence of men in these our days, when they have such a place even with the saints of God. John says, He "is preferred before me". He does not say by whom, but presently two of his own disciples prefer Jesus to him. Not that they despised John, far from it; he was not to be despised; the Lord would not have that; no one knew his worth more than Jesus, and He spoke of it. But these two disciples heard John *speaking* -- that is John, as it were, exercising his powers; they heard John speaking about Christ and they left him; they preferred Jesus. That is a voice. I wonder if we have all preferred Him, preferred Him to all others?
Now in the light of that, we are told later that John the baptist says of Him that He comes *from heaven*; not only that He was in the beginning and was with God and was God, but He comes from
{379}
heaven. That is an additional glory of Christ. He comes from above, and John gives Him a place under that heading, and says, "He must increase, but I must decrease" (@John 3:30); we see thus one going out of view in full vigour in appreciation of Christ. In the light of these facts you can see that more than subjection is needed for this gospel. Without it, as I said, there is no hope at all, you can be of no use to God or to the saints; whatever you may think you have, however much information or light you may have, subjection is imperative. But there is more than subjection contemplated here, and I have selected these three women from among others in this gospel to illustrate what God has in view for us.
I take the Samaritan woman first (in her own order, indeed, in the book), and what I deduce from the instruction is that she represents the thought of a *vessel*. It is a very simple suggestion, and one that fits in peculiarly with this gospel, because the idea is prominently introduced in chapter 2 in connection with the marriage at Cana of Galilee. You will remember that there were six water-*vessels*, as they are called; they were stone "water-vessels". They were there, but they were empty, but vessels are not made to be empty; they are made to be used. In truth each one of us is a vessel, and is to possess it, according to another scripture, in sanctification and honour; (@1 Thessalonians 4:4). So we get this woman, an unlikely person to be a vessel from the point of view from which I am speaking, an unlikely person, I mean, to the natural mind, but what is unlikely to that mind is quite likely in God's mind, for He thinks not as man thinks; He looks at the heart. And moreover God looks at us potentially, that is to say, not only according to what we may be now, but what we shall be; He takes us up from that point of view. And so, as I said, there were those six stone water-vessels unfilled. They were for the moment
{380}
useless, that is, they were not being used. There may be some here like that, and the Lord would say to you that He has need of you. Indeed, the earliest instruction that we get in the epistle to the Romans implies this idea of a vessel; we have it presented in a most exalted way in that epistle, for we are said to be "vessels of mercy ... prepared *for glory*". What vessels!
Now to illustrate what I have in my mind briefly I would remark on the Lord's reference in Luke to Elijah. He says, that there were many widows in Israel in his days, but "to none of them was Elias sent but to Sarepta of Sidonia, to a woman that was a widow", (@Luke 4:26). He was sent to Zarephath, Jehovah saying to Elijah, "I have commanded a widow woman there to maintain thee", (@1 Kings 17:9). He had already commanded the ravens to *feed* him, but *maintaining* is a very different thing; it signifies that he was to be looked after *suitably*, and some of the most important things in a household in connection with the maintaining of a guest are vessels. I just touch on the woman of Zarephath as very striking and illustrative of what I have in my mind. She is gathering sticks outside the town as Elijah reaches it, and he calls to her and says, "Fetch me a little water *in a vessel*", (verse 10). You might say, Why mention the vessel? If she is to bring water, she cannot bring it in the palm of her hand. But the point is, the water is to be brought in a vessel. In replying, she tells Elijah about her poverty, but she had the idea of a vessel; she says, I have "but a handful of meal *in a barrel*" -- it was in a barrel, in a vessel, where it should be; "and a little oil in a *cruse*" (verse 12) -- where it should be. I mention that because if we are to be spiritual in regard of ourselves and our vessels, we must apprehend that the vessel is to be used by God; we are to be vessels unto honour, sanctified and meet for the Master's use. And so you find in the chapter referring to that widow that
{381}
the meal *in the barrel* remained -- it never failed, and the oil *in the cruse* never failed. Emphasis is laid on the thought of vessels throughout.
And so under Elisha's ministry (his being the counterpart of Elijah's) the widow of one of the sons of the prophets was in straits; the creditor was about to take her sons; she had not anything at all in the house but a little oil in a pot -- she too had it in a vessel; that was what she had in the house. Now the house is mentioned, that is to say, the believer's establishment, it is a question of what I am myself. The house refers to my own establishment, and it is how things are there. What have you got there? You say, I have got much in heaven. Thank God! Christ is in heaven. But what is down here? The Holy Spirit is down here. But where is the Holy Spirit? He is not in the air; He is not in the elements; where is He? He is in you, if you are a believer; He is in believers, He is in the house of God. On the day of Pentecost, it says, It "sat upon each of them" (@Acts 2:3) -- not elsewhere. The sound filled the house, and cloven tongues as of fire sat on each of them, and then the effect on them was that they spoke with other tongues. The Spirit had come and He was *in* them. "These are not drunken, as ye suppose", Peter said, (verse 15). They were filled with the Spirit; He was *in* them.
Now the prophet says to the widow, "Go, borrow thee vessels ... not a few. And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door ... and ... pour out into all those". It is a question of *vessels*, that is to say, room for the Spirit. She shut the door, the vessels were brought, and all were filled, and she says to her son, "*Bring* me yet a vessel"; but there was not one more, and the oil stayed. Every vessel was filled; the instruction is that we should make room for the Spirit; that is the mind of God. You will see thus how important these vessels were. When the vessels were filled the
{382}
oil stayed. Do you not see the importance of the vessels? Is it not a voice as to whether I am a vessel, and whether, as once empty, I am now full of the Spirit? I am enjoined to be *filled* with the Spirit. Think of the magnitude of being a vessel for the Spirit of God, as the apostle says, "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you", (@Romans 8:9). Mark you, that means that there are no rivals. If the Spirit is *dwelling*, there are no rivals to Him in the house. Think of the magnitude of this! I have dwelt upon it because it is so important for young people that there should be room for the Spirit. Think of the vastness of the thought, that the Spirit of God has come down from heaven and is here in vessels -- in one great vessel -- the assembly -- but also in us severally!
This woman of Samaria answered to all this. The Lord spoke to her about herself. It is a well-known scripture, and I need not enlarge on it. The Lord says of the water, it "shall be in him", (@John 4:14). The Spirit of God had already said that the Lord Jesus directed that the stone water-vessels should be filled to the *brim*; that is the mind of God. There is to be nothing else but the Spirit, as the apostle says to the Ephesians, "Be filled with the Spirit", (chapter 5:18). "Fill the waterpots with water", the Lord says, then, "Draw out now" -- as if there should be no drawing out until one is filled with the Spirit, otherwise there will be a mixture, partly Spirit and partly flesh. And so here the thought is carried forward; He says, "The water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life". That was what the Lord said. What a marvellous statement! And He also says, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water". That is the position. Now this woman listened to the
{383}
Lord saying these wonderful things to her, and the last thing He said to her was, "I that speak unto thee *am he*". Do you see what is meant? You will remember what I have been saying about the Word. The woman would, no doubt, later on trace that remark back to a past eternity. It was the same Person -- the Word. "I that speak unto thee am he". He was the Christ, but also the Son of God.
Well now, "upon this came his disciples", they came as the Lord made Himself known. Thank God they did not come earlier! Sometimes we interfere with the work of God in souls instead of helping it. The disciples came on that word, but the Lord had finished what He had to say. They began to speak to Him about food, and they wondered why He talked with the woman; they were unspiritual. We may be seeking to serve God and be unspiritual, we may interfere with the Lord's words, but this woman was not hindered or restrained. Natural curiosity would no doubt have detained her to hear what these disciples were saying, but she was not detained; she had got her word, "I that speak unto thee am he". What a word that was! He had already told her other things; He had reached her conscience; He had said enough, and instead of waiting to hear what the disciples were saying to Him, it says, she "left her waterpot". Indeed, what she left was in keeping with those disciples, for that was what they were occupied with -- material things, as if it was just in keeping with them. She left the material things represented in the waterpot and went her way into the city. She is spiritual now. What is the evidence? you inquire. She *left the waterpot*.
It is negative so far, but negatives are important, for you will never reach positive things apart from the negative. There must be the giving up of material things; I mean that we must learn to abandon the natural for the spiritual. She had what was
{384}
positive before she left. She left the waterpot; she abandoned the natural thought she had been occupied with and went her way into the city, as much as to say, I have the Lord's mind about myself -- I am a vessel. I am a vessel of living water, and so I am to be used for the help and refreshment of others.
May God grant that every one here, especially the young people, may get that thought clearly. How did the woman show that she was a vessel? She went her way into the city and said to the men, "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" She did not say He told her He was the Christ; she said something stronger, "He told me all that ever I did"; that is to say, He was a prophet; she had said that already. She spoke according to her apprehension of Christ; He "told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" That was living water, I mean in the principle of it. See the effect of it on the men of the city, those who knew her well. They went to see the Lord, and many believed on Him because of her word. What kind of a word was it? It says she "bore witness"; it was not a casual remark. The Lord would have us, as vessels of witness, to be definite.
I invite you to look at that word; she *witnessed* of Him, that is to say, she gave formal testimony as to Christ. Every true vessel will be definite in what he says. She bore witness concerning Him; and so, you will observe, many believed because of her word; she had said, "Come", for morally she was with the Lord; spiritually it means that I am with the Lord in my soul. I say, "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" Will not the witness she bore reach a conscience? It did with those men; they came to Him, and said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of thy saying": (it was not only her words, though they had
{385}
valued that), "for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world". You will see how as a vessel she witnessed of Christ, and her service was strikingly effective.
I come now to the two Marys. Lovelier characters you can hardly find outside the Lord Himself than these two women. They represent a constructive line of thought in this gospel. Mary of Bethany, I apprehend, also represents the idea of a vessel, only what is emphasised in her is the value of the things she has and it is a *measured* amount; she is one who, like God, has come to measure things. @Romans 12:3 contemplates believers learning to reckon according to "the measure of faith"; and @2 Corinthians 10:13, in keeping with that, brings in God as "the God of measure", and @1 Corinthians 14:19 contemplates the principle of measurement in the assembly -- "five words". In nothing is the idea of measurement so fully represented as in the assembly; it presents a cube, as many of you know -- a remarkable thing, an immense six-sided structure. It is immense, but yet compassable, or finite. That is one great feature in a vessel that it can be conveniently used.
Now, among other things, Mary of Bethany represents that side, the principle of measurement; she represents progress from the woman of Samaria; in her we have intelligence, measurement, and excellence of quality. She had, too, a local setting. The woman of Samaria is more general, although she goes into the city, she is called a "Samaritan woman"; but Mary with Martha had a local setting; Bethany is said to be *their* village -- "the village of Mary and Martha her sister". It was the Mary, as we are told, "who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick"; that was the one. But it was the town or village of Mary and Martha. What I want you to
{386}
notice is that it says the *sisters* sent to the Lord -- a word that we ought to note.
Sisters in a town are extremely interesting. Of course we know they were sisters in the flesh, but they were also sisters spiritually. There were sisters who in earlier days were not very congenial to one another; I refer to the two at Philippi who are enjoined to be of the same mind in the Lord (@Philippians 4:2); not one in regard of some social link or object, for it is remarkable how we are brought together by the most wretched things, so that, we are of one mind to *that* extent, but the point is to be of "the same mind *in the Lord*". So here it says, the sisters sent to the Lord; two sisters sending a message to Jesus is very beautiful, and the message was this, "he whom thou lovest is sick". Surely we can see the appropriateness of a message like that sent from many of our gatherings -- the needfulness of it, for many are spiritually sick.
That word reaches Jesus, for it says, "When Jesus heard that" (He heard it undoubtedly from the two sisters), He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby". A magnificent answer! "*This* sickness is not unto death". *Some* sicknesses are very solemn indeed; "There is a sin unto death", John says; (@1 John 5:16). You may be a sick person, and the sickness may mean that, but not so in the case of Lazarus. Such things in John's gospel are not governmental. The man in chapter 9 was not blind because he had sinned or his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. God is working from Himself, and if there be the sickness of a loved one, it is not unto death, it is for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.
Now the sisters are to wait for this result. It is a wholesome thing to wait on God. Sisters are not, perhaps, generally patient, but it is an excellent habit
{387}
to wait, I mean spiritually. From the very outset the people of God waited. Jacob says, "I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord", (@Genesis 49:18). That is the principle of faith. Here the Lord waited two days where He was. Then He said, 'Let us go to him'. Lazarus had died; it gave time not only that he should die, but to be buried and even to become corrupt. It seemed an unheard-of way, but it was love's way. "Dead four days", but the fourth day was necessary for the glory of God. Although corruption had set in, Lazarus would be raised -- the sisters should see the glory of God; whether it be four days, four years, or four millenniums, it is the same thing. The Lord Jesus takes the dead out of the graves, and that is the glory of God and the glory of the Son of God. Think of what these women had in store for them! and so it is with us, there is wonderful spiritual instruction in waiting on the Son of God. But let us wait for it; and so Mary sat still in the house -- a fine attitude.
Martha was active and she went to meet the Lord, an act in itself acceptable to Him. He had no complaint; He stays where she met Him, and He tells her wonderful things. He says, "I am the resurrection and the life: he that believes on me, though he have died, shall live; and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die". The Lord addresses these words to Martha, and says to her, "Believest thou this?" What a question that is! Do *we* believe it? He is the resurrection and the life, that as a believer, though you die you live, and if you live you never die. Marvellous! Do you believe it? He inquires from Martha, and she answers, "Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world". She is *learning*; and then she went off secretly and called her sister. She did not make any ostentatious show of the matter; she was becoming spiritual.
{388}
And then Mary moves; she is *more* spiritual, and so has more influence, for as she moves the Jews move with her. That is the effect of spiritual influence; they move with her, they follow her. She had affected them much more than Martha; but still, Martha met the Lord and He stayed where she met Him; they all had to come *there*. Thus the Lord honours one whom we may regard unspiritual. But the Jews follow Mary, and as Mary arrives she is weeping and the Jews following are weeping, and Jesus wept; He groaned in spirit. Marvellous thing! He was deeply moved, as if resentful of what the loved ones were suffering, and thus death had to go. "What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?" (@Psalm 114:5). It was the presence of the Lord -- the Son of God was there, and all this in the presence of these women. But I cannot enlarge on it, wonderful as it is.
God is glorified there. The Lord lifts up His eyes to heaven and speaks to the Father; it is the Son here in manhood speaking to God; doing always the things that pleased Him. He says, "I knew that thou always hearest me; but on account of the crowd who stand around I have said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me". He was here as the sent One, He was glorifying God, and He was being glorified in doing that; the Son was here in manhood carrying out the will of God, and God was glorified, and all that in the presence of these sisters. What a learning and growing time for them! And so we can understand how Mary had this ointment; she had her "pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly", and as the opportune moment arrived, she is there with it. Spiritually, the reference is to herself as a vessel and what she had; she is available for worship. The whole person is there, her spirit, her soul, and her body. All is in intelligent, spiritual control, and she ministers to Christ. See how she anoints the Lord's
{389}
feet and wipes them with her hair; and the ointment, being of such quality and on the Lord's Person, the house is filled with the odour of it. There is a full vessel for you! That is what I understand to be a worshipper according to John. She filled the house in worshipping, and yet it was measured, not like Nicodemus¬ hundred pounds weight, valuable as that was in its place. This was just one pound, but, oh, how precious! The odour filled the house.
But Mary Magdalene completes the picture of spirituality from this point of view. Chapter 20 introduces the first day of the week and Mary is in full view, as if that is the thing the mind of God is set upon for the coming eternity. The chapter begins thus: "The first day of the week ... *Mary*". There she is; and she moves in agility as did the Lord Himself; He was moving like 'the hind of the morning', as depicted in the psalm. She *runs* to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved. It says, too, that she remained without at the sepulchre, as they "went away again to their own home", and she looked into it and saw two angels sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain. The picture, as I understand it, is this -- these angels represented Old Testament administration, wonderful administration, but they are sitting now at the head and the feet of Jesus. That is where they were, as if all else was given up, and they were now taken up with the glorious Person who had come in. But He is not there. He *was* there, and these angels show what heaven thought of Him, and the woman is to understand it; she saw it. As she saw it, they spoke to her, and it says, "she turned backward". One of the greatest features of spirituality is instinct; so here it is as if instinctively she turned backward, for Jesus was not there. Angels were there; but it was to call attention to the dignity of the Person who had been there. She looked backward
{390}
and she saw Jesus, that is to say, *that* direction is to be given up. We are not to look in that direction again; we are to look in another direction. Spiritually it means that there is a complete turning round from what you have been occupied with; I do not care what it is, religiously, or whatever it may be, there is to be, from John's point of view, a complete turning-round. First she turns backward; then she sees Jesus, though she did not recognise Him. Presently He says, Mary; then she turned herself round. That is a *complete* change. Turning backward was more negative; turning round, as the Lord called her by name, is positive. Are we prepared for it? Spirituality, according to John, requires a complete change of outlook. Are not these angels worth looking at? Yes, beloved friends, they are wonderful beings, but they call attention to the termination of the old order of things. Their position in the tomb called attention to the dignity of Him who lay there; but He was not there, and they are not going to stay there; their business is Jesus. A multitude of them came down in a host when He was born; now two are present; a testimony to His Person and to what He had effected in His death. So Mary turns completely round, and she says to Him, "Rabboni, which means Teacher". She is spiritual now. She says, as it were, I understand now that I need to be taught. And we all do. We need to look at everything from an angle different from the ordinary. You may have been reading the Bible from an unspiritual point of view, reading commentaries, it may be, but that in itself will not make you spiritual; you have to learn everything from Christ, so Mary turns completely round and says, "Rabboni, which means Teacher".
Then the Lord says, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father". She is to be led into the greatest thoughts of God. Think of that! the
{391}
very greatest thoughts of God for us, and that is what she is to be led into. Are *we* prepared for it? The very best and greatest thoughts God has about us are available to us, and the state of soul to which they are disclosed is seen here in Mary Magdalene. But He would detach her completely from the earth and link her with heaven. He says in effect, Do not touch me until I am ascended. Contact -- links -- with Him are now to be in relation to heaven -- "I have not *yet* ascended". It is all a question of elevation, and personal dignity. "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God". Marvellous! That is *her* light. It is *the* light. It is no question of Israel's privileges now; it is what was before the world, as @Ephesians 1:3,4 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ". It is according to eternal purpose, "according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love". That is the thing, the very best thoughts that God has, the thoughts of His love about us.
Well, that is Mary Magdalene, and she stands out in the front of the picture in this chapter. The first day of the week -- Mary Magdalene. The first day of the week in the mind of God represents something *before* all that has been, and that is John's gospel. May God help us to enter into it!
{392}
THE DIVINE STANDARD OF SERVICE (3)
@2 Corinthians 3
Ques. Will you gather up in a few words the line upon which we have been, and connect it with what is before us this morning?
J.T. Our subject is really the relation of the ministry to the minister, and the relation of the minister to the ministry. This epistle interweaves those two thoughts in an exceptional way, that is, the personality or character of the minister as bearing on the ministry, and vice versa, the bearing of the ministry upon the minister himself; much was said, too, about personality hinging on sonship, whether in Christ or in us. We can understand that in coming in, God would come in relation to personality, that is in the Son, so that it is God who is brought to us, but in One great enough to represent Him. The evangelists introduce the Lord in that way, as greeted from heaven by the Father, "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", (@Mark 1:11, Luke 3:22) and also, "*This* is my beloved Son" (@Matthew 3:17), the one referring to His own consciousness of the Father's pleasure in Him and the other, the attention of others being called to Him by the Father. On the mount of transfiguration it is, "*This* is my beloved Son: hear him", (@Mark 9:7, Luke 9:35) The same principle runs down to all ministers; as sons there is that consciousness of our relation with God and His pleasure in us; and then in *some way* God calls attention to us, so that we may be listened to. Hence Paul is "an elect vessel to me", the Lord says, "to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel", (@Acts 9:15).
We noted how the work of God is carried on in a mediatorial way on the high level of sonship, whether in Christ or in us. God in His Son is within
{393}
our range, and He remains ever so; it is said, that having put down all rule and all authority He delivers up "the kingdom to him who is God and Father", and the Son shall be Himself subject eternally, "that God may be all in all", (@1 Corinthians 15:24,28). That is how the matter is left in Scripture, so that God is within the range of our intelligence and affection in One known to us in manhood. We have always to bear in mind that God is God, and man is man, only God has come into manhood in Christ, who ever remains Man. We are in danger of having a conception in our minds of God, bringing Him down to our own level, but then what is made -- the creation -- is not compassable by us, how much less God Himself. Hence we are warned against intruding into what is not revealed, or into what "the form of God" (@Philippians 2:6) is. Scripture says of Him, "dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see", (@1 Timothy 6:16).
A.S.L. Does that last scripture explain the word of the Lord, "No one knows the Son but the Father" (@Matthew 11:27)? He, being God and having come into manhood, must be beyond the scope and grasp of the creature.
J.T. Quite so. That scripture protects His Person. We know how the enemy has taken advantage of the lowly circumstances into which He came in love to attack Him.
Ques. What you have said is very helpful. Now, how do you link it up with what is immediately before us?
J.T. I was going to say we dwelt yesterday afternoon on the high plane of God's operations which the apostle brings forward in meeting the petty feelings at Corinth in regard of himself. He was not going to descend into those petty feelings; he would maintain things on the level that God had set them; that is, the Son of God and the Spirit of God. The Son of God was preached, and the Spirit of God
{394}
was here, so that we by Him might be anointed. God anoints us by Him, and seals us by Him, and gives us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts; that is, we are maintained at the height of what God is doing. Then having said all that, Paul calls God to witness on his soul that it was to spare them he had not come to Corinth; he would not rule over their faith, but be a fellow-workman of their joy. Then he goes on to speak about judging with himself as to what should be done; it was the calculation of love. "I have judged this with myself", showing how free and conscious he was of ability to judge in the light of what he had been saying; he would not come to them again in grief. "Not to come back to you in grief", he says (chapter 2:1). If he had grieved them, he would look to them to make him glad -- this would be so as his letter was fully effective. Then he brings out the two important thoughts -- that forgiveness was in the Person of Christ, and that he, whatever had happened, was a sweet savour to God "in the saved and in those that perish", (chapter 2:15). Things are thus kept on their proper level. If he had forgiven, it was for their sakes in "the Person of Christ".
H.H. How would you explain that scripture, that the savour of Christ is in "the saved and in those that perish"?
J.T. Well, I think the apostle is alluding to the sense of liberty he had as sustained of God in those very trying circumstances, and he was aiming at re-establishing the Corinthians in relation to himself. But there was a matter at Corinth that the enemy might use to widen the breach, that is, it might be said he forgave the man but they did not, or that they forgave him but he did not. He seeks to work with them and not independently of them, so that Satan should not get an advantage and widen the breach, which would be a great disadvantage to the testimony. So he brings in the Person of Christ, that
{395}
forgiveness was in Him. It was no matter of discussing with them about the man; he had his own mind about him, and forgave him in the Person of Christ.
F.H.B. In the Person of Christ -- does that mean he represented Christ?
J.T. He puts the thing on its proper level. The expression, "the Person of Christ", implies the adjustment of the thing. The important point is to see that things are maintained on the level on which God has placed them, so that we may not drop down to wrangling or empty discussion.
Ques. Will you now refer to our brother's question as to verse 15, "For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God in the saved and in those that perish"?
J.T. I was going to say that we ought to see the link between the Person of Christ and that; the apostle himself was on that level, and so in the sense of what God is, that whatever happened -- he alludes to his having left the work at Troas -- he could say, "Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place. For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish". You see how in keeping he was with the sense of what God is in Christ, according to what he had been saying. He was a sweet odour of Christ to God. The odour is what is so important. There is the light and the truth, but the odour is brought in -- what he was to God.
Ques. So that whatever the apparent effect of the preaching in our eyes as the witness to Christ, there goes up to God, in that way, a constant sweet savour that is never lost. Is that the idea?
J.T. It supposes that one is moving on this level, the level on which things are set here. The apostle was not coming down to their level to discuss things in detail; he maintained things in the Person of Christ.
J.J. Did it mean that it was a very serious thing
{396}
to come in touch with the apostle seeing he was on that high level? It was like coming in touch with Christ Himself.
J.T. Quite. He says, "If also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost", (chapter 4:3).
H.D'A.C. He could not have said to the Corinthians, Who always leads *you* in triumph, because of their moral state.
J.T. That helps. He is really speaking of himself, and doubtless of Silvanus and Timotheus.
H.E.S. Would you say that the only way in which maturity is really reached is when things are maintained on this divine level?
J.T. That is what I thought. Lest "Satan get an advantage against us", (chapter 2:11). If he can drag us down to the level of man's way of doing things, he will; but you decline. As you are maintaining things in the Person of Christ, you are a savour of Christ to God.
H.H. It is of vast importance in regard of the assembly that things should move on this plane amongst us as saints.
J.T. That is the thing; we learn from the passage to keep things on God's level.
Rem. In the world around us there is a great deal which is really degrading in connection with the name of Christ and the testimony of God, but this would safeguard us from lowering things to meet man's perverted level.
J.T. You see it in Nehemiah. The proposal of Sanballat was to drop down from the plane on which Nehemiah was operating. He was operating according to God, building and constructing the walls, but the proposal of Sanballat was that he should come down to the plain and take counsel with him and his associates. That would have been giving the enemy an advantage. God is operating on a certain line and we do not want to leave that line. That is what it is
{397}
here, and on that level we are in our measure a sweet odour of Christ to God.
Eu.R. Would the spirit of thanksgiving be maintained in that way?
J.T. Quite; God has His portion whatever happens. An offensive odour arises as you come down to the level of man's petty feelings and empty wrangling about matters, but if you take things up in the Person of Christ, they become solved and there is an odour there of Christ.
J.J. Is that seen in @Colossians 3:12,13? "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another". Is not the odour maintained there?
J.T. That is right. Corruption is soon apparent where we might drop down to man's way, and meet in the plain of Ono with such men as Sanballat, men with whom we cannot walk in righteousness. What can you expect but an odour that is *not* of Christ?
M.W.B. Would you make the principle of verses 15,16, as applicable to assembly dealings, the issue of any particular case?
J.T. It ought to apply in all service, in all that we are doing. We do not want to leave God out; we want to have something for God.
S.J.B.C. It is very comforting to the one who ministers, though he may not see any apparent results, to know that if Christ is ministered, there is a sweet savour that goes up to God.
J.T. "Thanks be to God", he says, "who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place". That is what God is doing; and then he adds, "For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish". The first is God is doing it; He "leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in
{398}
every place". Think of the range of things under that head -- *His knowledge*. And then the apostle says, "We are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish", but then God was making manifest the odour of His knowledge in every place. The fact was, wherever Paul went, the odour of His knowledge was there; God was making it manifest.
E.J.M. "His knowledge"; would that anticipate the millennial day?
J.T. Yes, the knowledge of God will cover the earth. When one contemplates the corruption there is and the odour of this world, what refreshing there is in the odour of His knowledge in every place. God is doing that in Paul, and then Paul adds that *he* was that to God. The odour of God's knowledge was not only for God Himself, it was for others. God made it manifest in every place, and Paul was an odour of Christ to God. The first is the knowledge of God in the apostle's ministry. God manifested an odour in every place through that, but the next statement is what the apostle was personally to God in his ministry: "We are a sweet odour". The first is the ministry. God made His knowledge manifest as a sweet odour in every place; that would be for any one who had that sense of smell; it would be a testimony. But then, what the apostle and his associates were to God is stated afterwards -- a sweet odour of Christ to God.
H.F.N. Is it the same thought as in @Psalm 45 in regard of the Lord? "All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia".
J.T. That is the idea, and no doubt the same smell could be found with Paul. We see what persons they were to be a sweet odour to God.
J.J. I suppose the odour manifested in every place remained in the various assemblies that were established.
J.T. The thing was to continue locally, I am sure,
{399}
and no doubt it did as the testimony was rightly received.
J.H.T. Is that seen at Philippi?
J.T. Very especially. Philippi would correspond in conserving what had been there in the apostle. Much stress is laid on the sufferings he and Silas endured in the prison. It was no small matter that such an odour of Christ was brought into Philippi. I have no doubt that Lydia would retain it. After the sufferings it is said that Paul, being released, went to *Lydia*; (@Acts 16:40). She had received him into her house earlier, as the Lord had opened her heart "to attend to the things spoken by Paul". She, as faithful to the Lord, had received him into her house, and now after the sufferings, he goes to her. It reminds us of the Lord who appeared to His own "after he had suffered"; the holy anointing oil, so to say, would be passed on to those to whom He appeared; and so I think Lydia would value and conserve the impression of sufferings which Paul would convey. He speaks much of suffering in his epistle to the saints there.
J.H.T. Did the apostle secure that collectively from the saints in the last chapter, "an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God" (@Philippians 4:18)?
J.T. The connection is in the "odour of sweet savour".
Rem. With regard to Mary of Bethany we get the same suggestion. The odour of the ointment filled the house. One has the sense that the odour is still in the *house*.
Ques. Do we get it again in @Mark 14:9 with the woman who anointed the Lord's head? "Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, what this woman has done shall be also spoken of for a memorial of her".
{400}
J.T. Quite. What she did alluded to the sufferings of Christ.
Rem. There were those who made a trade of the word of God.
J.T. That raises another question, whether we love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. There has to be freedom from corruption, and making a trade of the word of God would be an ill-savour certainly. "We do not, as the many, make a trade of the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, before God, we speak in Christ", (@2 Corinthians 2:17). What was in your mind about the trading?
Rem. Well, it struck me the expression, "the many", as connected with making a trade of the word of God, thus showing the tendency.
J.T. Men go in for theology as they do for law or medicine, as a mere lucrative profession. That is what has developed throughout the christian profession now. The word of God is thus discredited. Christendom has become a hireling institution, to say the least, in which the Lord has no place; the hireling fleeth when the wolf comes.
Rem. Making "my Father's house an house of merchandise". (@John 2:16).
J.T. Exactly. In service we need to keep near the Lord and to be in constant dependence on Him or we shall become mercenary.
W.L. Is that why in the gospel of *Mark*, to which you have referred, they left the *hired* servants as well as the father?
J.T. That is good. In Luke they left *all*; in Matthew they left their nets, the ship, and their father.
W.L. What is the thought of speaking "in Christ" (verse 17)?
J.T. It is in keeping with what we have been saying -- the elevation of God's operations. I think one speaking in Christ would have no reliance on fleshly
{401}
ability. I believe it refers to the sense the apostle had of the utter uselessness of natural ability and glory in the service of the Lord. The Corinthian leaders were relying on natural ability and education and human wisdom, whereas Paul's speaking was "in Christ". It corresponded with the Lord's speaking in the gospels.
W.L. Would it be in the power of the anointing? Is that the thought?
J.T. Exactly; and it is "in Christ", taking you out of the status of the flesh in any sense.
E.G. Is "in Christ" a sort of climax to that sentence, because you might be sincere and you might speak as of God and for God, yet if it is not in Christ, it is not enough?
J.T. That is the standard for God; Christ is the standard of everything. Paul's speaking was not in human wisdom but "in demonstration of the Spirit and of power", (@1 Corinthians 2:4).
H.D'A.C. If christian speaking and conduct were always in Christ, what a marvellous influence we should have.
J.T. It would have brought in here the kind of way that prevails in heaven, the character of speaking in heaven.
Rem. So there is set up here a spiritual gauge or standard by which we are capable of measuring everything among us.
H.H. Paul heard the language of another world in chapter 12, things not lawful for a man to utter.
J.T. Quite. One sometimes thinks if one were lifted up into heaven and heard what is said, and saw what is there, one would have the mind of God as to what pleases Him. As soon as Jesus is born, heaven comes down in *volume* to the shepherds, not only one angel, but "a multitude of the heavenly host". Note, a multitude was brought down and we are told what they were saying. They were
{402}
"praising God and *saying*, Glory to God", (@Luke 2:13,14) and the shepherds heard all that. They would get an inkling at the outset of what was in the mind of God. Gabriel came down -- a great dignitary -- and spoke to Zacharias and Mary, and an angel came to the shepherds and spoke to them and then a multitude of the heavenly host came down. It does not say these spoke *to* the shepherds; that is not the point. The point was that heaven was brought down for the shepherds to see and hear. They were "praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men". That was heaven brought down to them. Luke, who always confirms Paul, would emphasise what is in *heaven*, and that there should be a reflection of it here on earth.
Ques. Is that suggested in @Hebrews 13:2: "Some have unawares entertained angels".
J.T. Quite; angels bring in what is heavenly. Now chapter 3 brings in another thing of great importance, and that is what the Corinthians were as the fruit of Paul's ministry, that is, what they were as representative of Christ in this world, and what they were in his heart. What they were as a testimony and fruit of his ministry they were in his heart -- no more, no less.
C.E.B. I should like to ask one question on the close of chapter 2. It says there, "Who is sufficient for these things?" What is the force of that?
J.T. It is to remind you of the greatness of God and His work. You challenge your own heart as to this -- one challenges one's own heart. In chapter 3 it says, "Our competency is of God; who has also made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant". So it is clear that our sufficiency, whatever the measure must be of God.
H.E.S. Are you suggesting that what the Corinthians were to the heart of the servant is connected with what they were to the heart of Christ?
{403}
J.T. The apostle says, "Ye are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men, being manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but the Spirit of the living God; not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of the heart". First what they were in his heart; they did not have a mere passing place in his affection; they were *written* there and brought out wherever he went. Such a place had they that he brought them out as his letter. But then they were the epistle of Christ because of what the ministry had effected in *their* hearts.
W.R.P. Do you think he could have said that in the first epistle?
J.T. In view of the existing state I do not think he could; anyway he does not, although he alludes here to his ministry when among them.
W.R.P. The thought would take in the ministry of the first epistle as well.
J.T. No doubt, but I think he alludes to his ministry among them and how effective it was. He challenges them later (chapter 13) as to their very conversion, that it was through him.
Ques. In what measure could this be true now? Paul had an exclusive ministry in Corinth. How far is the spirit of the thing available in this day?
J.T. Well, it is the spirit of the thing that is available, because no one can assume now to have any definite ministry to the assembly. As a matter of fact what marks our day is each one doing the best he can under the Lord, and He helps wonderfully; it is "here a little, there a little", and the fruit of the whole is something for God. But in this instance we have "ministers of the new covenant". God had made them competent -- it was definite. The Lord had told Paul that He had much people in that city; the Lord knew well the limits of it, and who were there, and no one was to set upon him to hurt
{404}
him. Those people were to be impressed with Christ, and they were; there was a wonderful result. Paul stayed there eighteen months and they were affected, not only by the light, but by the "Spirit of the living God".
Ques. Were they in that way in the good of the anointing?
J.T. That would be included, but it is writing on the *heart* -- alluding to the tables. There would be something of Christ written. The writing is very interesting because it is there at all times.
F.H.B. The writing could not be effaced.
J.T. That is what I thought, nor could the tables of their hearts be broken like the first tables of the covenant. The first tables were, I am sure, wonderful workmanship; God Himself apparently made them, and yet they were destroyed. There is nothing like that suggested here; "Not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of the heart". The human heart as wrought upon by the Spirit of God is now the divine writing material.
Ques. What can we look for now that answers to the spirit of the thing?
J.T. I think the presentation of Christ in such wise that He is impressed on the hearts of those whom you serve. Each one should calculate how much Christ is presented. You bring the thing, not only the words, but the thing itself which you intend to be produced, that is, if I am not like Christ I cannot hope to produce Christ, not that God cannot work sovereignly, but the principle with Paul was to bring the thing he intended to produce. He was the representative of Christ in himself, and what he said was the mind of God, which would impress the Corinthians so that there was a writing.
J.J. Do you think the work of the apostle in Corinth was very much like the hewing out of the
{405}
second two tables, preparing material for the Spirit to write upon as set forth in himself?
J.T. Quite; but the Lord, of course, is the anti-type of Moses. What was done was done by the Lord; they were the epistle of Christ really. The Lord said, "I have much people in this city", and they were potentially the tables, so to speak. Paul was a competent minister; God had made him that, but Christ is the minister answering to Moses; the work is His; they were the "epistle of Christ".
E.R. Is that like saying, "Ye are unleavened", in the first epistle (@1 Corinthians 5:7)?
J.T. Exactly; he took them up abstractly, but there was a work by the Spirit of God, as he says, "Being manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but the Spirit of the living God". That gives you the position. The Lord had said He had much people in that city; He did not say so of Athens or others. He had much people in Corinth, and the epistle to be written there was to be Christ's, "ministered by us", but "manifested to be Christ's epistle", not Paul's, but Christ's.
Ques. Christ's epistle and Christ's glory; would one follow the other?
J.T. Just so. What a conception it is to have in Corinth, or any other place, the epistle of Christ, actually written by the Spirit of the living God!
J.J. Would the second two tables suggest the new covenant? The old ones are broken.
J.T. I think they do; Moses is more brought into the work. He has to hew them out himself and to make an ark of wood. The humanity of Christ is more emphasised, and it is expressly stated that no one was to be with him on going up the second time. It was intimated at the beginning that Joshua was with him. I suppose it alludes to Christ as having died; for that is really what came out in @Exodus 32. Moses could not make atonement, but that was the
{406}
principle of the thing, so in going up the second time it would be Christ going up into heaven. No one else went up; He went up alone, and there it is the glory shines. The covenant that is in the mind of God is now seen; and as in heaven He is "the Lord, the Spirit". This chapter brings out that whilst the epistle is Christ's, the minister is as of the *Lord*, as the Spirit of the covenant. "Now the Lord is the Spirit".
Ques. Would that be the line of @Exodus 34, where the covenant is brought up again?
J.T. It is a direct allusion to that. So Christ has gone up and He comes down here now in ministry, through such as Paul, and the veil is gone. "Not of letter, but of spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens ... Now the Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty". That is what marked Paul. There was authority, but it was the authority of love, and it was to introduce and enforce the most blessed thing -- the love of God.
F.H.B. Why does it say, "The Lord is the Spirit", and not Christ?
J.T. It is the Lord exercising His authority to enforce the love of God. You can hardly conceive of a more important service than this, and He resorts to His authority to make the love of God effective in our hearts. It is so important it should be, and He uses His authority to make it so. Liberty marked the service, for it was in the Spirit of the Lord.
F.H.B. Do you think it might be He represented the glory of Jehovah?
J.T. I have no doubt @Exodus 34 helps as to the kind of thing. The Lord Jehovah passed before him; Moses was to be impressed with God, with what Jehovah was in grace and mercy. Well, that is only a type of what is now in Christ. God Himself is there; all that God is, is in Christ, and all that God
{407}
is enters into this ministry. What God is in Christ must be brought into our hearts.
F.H.B. It is God represented in Christ.
J.T. That is right, and the authority is in the Lord, not Christ. "The Lord is the Spirit".
E.M. Is it that the essence and substance of it all is in Christ, but the administration of it is in the hands of the Lord?
J.T. Yes; and so it is Moses, not Aaron. Moses represented the authority of God, and how important it is that the authority of God is available in such a One as Christ, to make this knowledge of God effective in our hearts.
Ques. How beautifully touching in that connection is the Lord's supper; the cup is the "new covenant in my blood". What could affect us more than that? Would the glory of the Lord be at all analogous to that? "Ye do shew the Lord's death" (@1 Corinthians 11:25,26), that is, the new covenant is sealed in His blood.
J.T. Just so, and the Spirit of the Lord enters into the Supper. There is authority, but the sense, too, of holy liberty. @John 13 affords the atmosphere, so to speak, for the Lord's supper.
E.G. Does it say, "The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God"?
J.T. The *Lord* does that, "and into the patience of the Christ", (@2 Thessalonians 3:5).
J.J. What underlies the point about the letters of commendation here?
J.T. The place that the saints have in your heart; that is, if you carry a letter of commendation, if the saints commend you, do you commend them? That is the way it is. If they commend you, you should commend them. So, if you carry a letter of commendation from the saints, you are not likely to speak ill of them. Paul brought out on every occasion what the Corinthians were. The place the Corinthians had in his heart being made so public, would show
{408}
that he regarded the work of God there as of special importance. It was a leading event in the testimony.
C.B. Was the question of being Christ's epistle universal?
J.T. The effect of the ministry in Corinth was known far and wide. The way the work is referred to in Acts shows the great significance of it. The Lord announced that He had much people there and the apostle's service was unusually extended.
C.B. Is there any possible way in which it has an application today?
J.T. There surely is, only we take things up in the principle of them. You would be concerned about being an epistle of Christ in your city, and so should each of us, without *assuming* to be anything, for the bearing of it is toward the whole assembly in the locality or on the earth. That is in the mind of God, but surely the ministry of God today is to produce some reflection of Christ, something to remind people of Christ. Of what value are we in our localities unless we represent Christ, and there is something written that people can read, or that can be spoken of *generally* as an encouragement for the saints?
Rem. It gives a wonderfully exalted position, even if we think of the whole assembly in any place.
J.T. It does indeed, and your desire is to correspond with it as far as you can.
H.E.S. Does the thought in writing suggest subjective work in the saints?
J.T. It does. And it conveys what the Lord would present in this way -- writing.
H.W.S. Then what place does Paul's gift have in connection with the writing?
J.T. It entered into it. He was made a competent minister, he says, of the new covenant. Competency would include all he was as made of God.
Ques. Turning to such a thing as letters of commendation
{409}
do you not think the letters should be measured according to the stature and the confidence we have in those commended?
J.T. Quite. There should be an agreement between the person who bears the letter, and the persons who write it.
Rem. Quite; but often it is not the case.
J.T. If they commend him, he ought to commend them.
Rem. If every saint, however insignificant, can be a character in the letter -- that is to say, whatever we are, we ought to be legible -- there ought to be a little bit of Christ coming out in every believer. A letter is composed of characters, and each saint can be a character or letter in that wonderful epistle.
H.D'A.C. However deeply Christ was written in the hearts of the Corinthians, were they not also deeply written on the apostle's heart?
J.T. That is what I thought; there was a correspondence between them. They were his letter, but they were also Christ's letter. They would be Christ's letter at Corinth, but his letter wherever he was; he spoke of them.
W.C.G. Does verse 8 show that we come in the power of the Spirit to that which is called the ministration of the Spirit?
J.T. Quite. It is that which *subsists*; it is not to be done away.
P.W. What a wonderful vessel Paul was, for this was not the only church, and the care of all the churches came upon him!
C.B. Would the connection be seen between "mine anointed ones" and "my prophets"?
J.T. Exactly. Paul would answer to both.
C.B. Would you say again how the authority of the Lord is exercised in leading us into the good of the new covenant?
J.T. Well, the Lord exercises discipline in view of
{410}
this. He is in supreme control, and are we stronger than He? If we refuse to hearken, and pull away the shoulder from coming under the writing, He will not leave a stone unturned to bring us into subjection, hence the importance of hearkening to the Lord. He uses His authority in discipline, and otherwise, to bring this wonderful thing into our hearts and to write on us. That is the importance of recognising the Lord in this service.
W.R.P. Do you see lordship in that verse?
J.T. Yes.
W.R.P. I daresay you have noticed in the introduction to the New Translation J.N.D. seems to think it is Jehovah rather than lordship.
J.T. It must be all that passed before Moses in @Exodus 34. Jehovah passed before him in all His greatness and authority. Well, that is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, and so we behold the face of the Lord. It is what He is, but it is "the Lord" in the *beginning* of verse 17.
D.L.H. The article appears before "Lord" when it says, "The Lord is that Spirit", but when it says, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is", that is, Jehovah, there is no article.
J.T. "Now the Lord is the Spirit". I am sure that involves what we have been saying -- the authority of Christ.
Ques. You have referred to chapter 10 of the first epistle in connection with the authority of Christ. Will you say a word as to chapter 11, the Supper, where the new covenant and lordship seem rather connected with affection?
J.T. Well, I think it is all to bring in subjection. There can be no writing without subjection. The assembly is *subjected*, it says, to Christ, that is, it is the mind of God for her that she is to be subjected to Christ, and as such she is available for the purpose of
{411}
His love in testimony, and as we are subject, He writes.
J.S. Is it like Ezekiel, which answers to our day? "I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant", (@Ezekiel 20:37).
J.T. That is right. "Whom the Lord loves he chastens", (@Hebrews 12:6) that is, the chastening is all to this end. What He has in view is to bring the love of God into our hearts. Coming under the rod in Ezekiel indicates being taken account of or counted, but authority in discipline is also implied.
F.S.M. Does the apostle refer to that when he says, "But the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God", (@2 Thessalonians 3:5)?
J.T. That is the thought; He directs your heart into the love of God.
Ques. In @Exodus 34 when Moses came down from the mount, Aaron and the people of Israel were afraid, but then he calls to them and they turned to him, and then he talked with them. Does that speak of the Lord's activities but through the servants?
J.T. They *turned* to him and Moses *talked* with them; it is the suggestion of confidence and liberty. There was glory in it, too, but it is done away. It was no glory as compared with what was in Christ, and so the veil is gone. "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face". What marvellous liberty that one can look up into that face and be perfectly free in doing it. There is authority there, but it is the authority of love.
W.L. Does verse 18 suggest the way the vessel is formed, the personality you mentioned? "Changed ... from glory to glory".
J.T. It is a complete change.
W.L. Would that be the personality, the individual?
{412}
J.T. Just so.
W.C.G. Why is it called "the ministry of righteousness"?
J.T. It is what man needs, not what is *expected* of him; it is *ministered* to him. It thus "abounds in glory".
J.J. What a wonderful thing that Paul should liken himself to Moses coming down from heaven with no veil.
Eu.R. Would Joseph's administration be like it? He brought his brethren to the point where they could tell his father of all his glory.
J.T. Just so. They could represent him in that way.
W.C. What is the distinction between what is written and the transformation?
J.T. What is written is to convey the mind of the writer. You trace it out letter by letter, a very interesting testimony presented; but the change is the person himself. There is a complete change brought about in beholding the glory of the Lord. "We all"; we are all made alike, I apprehend, and that is like the Lord -- like Him. So there is no difference in the saints; we are made similar. It has a wonderful effect in producing similarity amongst us, but a similarity in *glory*.
M.W.B. Is there a suggestion that the Corinthians¬ minds and Paul's should be brought into unison in that way?
J.T. No doubt he had that in view. I think it brings in similarity among us, similarity in glory. We may be different in other respects, but there is a general similarity in the saints here, as we behold the glory of the Lord. "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit". The change is complete.
{413}
H.D'A.C. That is not a cursory look, but it involves penetrating into the glory of the Lord. There is a glory we may look right into; and so it gives great power and substance in its effect.
S.J.B.C. Is the veil on the face of the mediator or on the heart?
J.T. It is on the Jews¬ heart now. The apostle transfers it, and then it says, "When it shall turn to the Lord", referring to Moses going in to the Lord when he took the veil off. It is not on our hearts; that is the thing he is emphasising.
Rem. "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face" conveys that there is no veil on the face of Jesus.
J.T. Quite.
E.R. It is interesting to note that the word for 'changed' here is the same word used for transfiguration on the mount and for transformation in @Romans 12.
{414}
THE DIVINE STANDARD OF SERVICE (4)
@2 Corinthians 4; @2 Corinthians 5:1 - 9
J.T. We looked at chapters 2 and 3 this morning, the former bringing out the level on which the relation between the apostle and the Corinthians was maintained in the Person of Christ, not that to which the local leaders apparently would drag it down, but the Person of Christ. The enemy was set to take advantage of the breach that existed between the apostle and the Corinthians, not indeed because of anything in the apostle, but because of the conditions at Corinth. He was concerned, therefore, that anything he did in the way of forgiving should be according to their forgiveness; he forgave in the Person of Christ. We noted, too, the triumph in which he was led. Although disconcerted in not meeting Titus, he was led in triumph, God manifesting the savour of His knowledge through Paul in every place, and he was himself a sweet odour of Christ to God. Then in chapter 3 we had the ministry of the new covenant, looking at which we saw that the apostle had the Corinthians in his heart as his letter of commendation which he produced generally. He would speak well of them as they were the epistle of Christ ministered by him, written on fleshy tables of the heart by the Spirit of the living God. Then we also noted that *the Lord* was the Spirit of the new covenant, involving all that in figure passed before Moses on the mount, and which is now embodied in Christ. The Lord thus makes the love of God effective in our hearts by the Spirit; as it is said, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (@Romans 5:5); that is, under Christ, so that the spirit of liberty pervades the saints normally, and we all, looking at the glory of the Lord,
{415}
whose face is unveiled, are changed into the same image from glory to glory as by the Lord the Spirit. It is the Lord's doing. The Lord is the Spirit of the covenant. Moses in some little way reflected what the covenant was when his face shone, but it was a mere suggestion of the greatness of the thing as it is in Christ, of what God is in His love in Christ. The Lord is the Spirit of it all, making it effective through discipline and otherwise in our hearts.
H.H. Would you connect the personal love of Christ to the assembly with "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image"?
J.T. It works out in the assembly being made like Him. "We all", would mean that it is general. The change makes us similar. It is a complete change, a 'metamorphosis', which is the original word used.
H.H. Moses went up with a 'peradventure'. All Israel knew what was in the heart of Moses in relation to them.
J.T. Quite. He would do what he could, that is, he was so far like Christ. It was 'peradventure', but it was a wonderful thing that he could wish to be blotted out from God's book for the people, so there was a suggestion of Christ in it. But the Lord *could* take on the responsibility; He was made a curse for us.
H.H. Then how do you understand the change from glory to glory?
J.T. It is from one glory to another, so that it is endless, as you might say.
Rem. It is an ascending path.
J.T. Yes, "glory to glory" would be morally that. "From glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit", that is, it is His unceasing service until we are brought to it. "Beholding" is what we do; that is our part.
J.J. Is it like @John 1? There are various glories there.
{416}
J.T. Well, quite. It is "by the Lord", however. Beholding is our side, but then the work is really by the Lord. It is His work "By the Lord the Spirit", as it reads.
E.J.M. Is Stephen an example?
J.T. Exactly. He looked stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus. He was certainly like Him then.
W.C. Does it refer to full liberty so that the city has the glory of God as coming down? Is that the full result of "from glory to glory"?
J.T. It will culminate in that. The city is being invested now with the glory, and it is the Lord who is doing it. The holy city, coming down from God out of heaven, will have the glory of God.
Rem. So in a way it has been an accumulation from the beginning, glory being added to glory in view of the heavenly city.
J.T. The thing goes on -- "from glory to glory". It suggests continuance and the ceaseless activity of the Lord the Spirit. It is not the Holy Spirit; it is more the Lord as the Spirit of the thing. It is taken up from verse 6, "Not of letter, but of spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens ... Now the Lord is the Spirit".
R.B. Do you connect the change with what is wrought in discipline?
J.T. The Lord has recourse to all that may be necessary to bring us to it, and much is necessary with all of us to effect subjection.
As to the Lord being the Spirit of the covenant, no doubt most of us have realised what it is to be in a meeting where the Lord has His way and there is subjection. You feel it is the Lord. His influence in subduing is wonderful, but then, that influence is not binding, it is rather loosing; it does restrain our flesh, of course, but we feel at liberty. There is a spirit of liberty among us. It is the Lord. It is a
{417}
spirit accompanying the presence of the Lord, and it marks those present. That is how the thing works. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".
Rem. His impressions and characteristics seem to be upon all.
J.T. On the first day of the week, after the Lord rose, you can understand what activities there were. The angel had come down (@Matthew 28), and he was sitting on the stone rolled away from the Lord's tomb; he invited the women to "Come see the place where the Lord lay", and he sends them with a message to tell His disciples that they should see the Lord in Galilee. Then as they went it says, "Jesus met them, saying, Hail!" He would set them up in service as carrying the message; they would take it up in a different way after He met them. They were under orders of the angel before, but now He meets them as if to impart His Spirit to them in what they were doing; they would go with a different feeling to His "brethren", for He changes the term from disciples to brethren. The Spirit of the Lord, as active in the way in which He met and spoke to and dealt with the disciples, would have a liberating and changing effect.
E.R. Do you suggest that we behold in company?
J.T. I think we do, but it would not be limited to that. "We all"; it is to bring in similarity in all through the change.
Rem. Thinking of the two going to Emmaus, the Lord gives no explicit word to them, but they are under His Spirit, and they rise up the same hour and go back and join the company.
J.T. Just so; and the things they were saying as gathered show the transforming effect of the Lord's service.
C.G.R. Is this any peculiar glory or the whole scope of it?
J.T. I think it is the glory He has in administering
{418}
the covenant; it is a delightful service to Him. What is in His heart shines in His face. We see in Revelation and elsewhere how in judicial services His face will be different.
M.W.B. In what way do you distinguish between the glory of the Lord and the glory of Christ in verse 4 of the next chapter?
J.T. The glory of the Lord in chapter 3 is, as I was remarking, the service He renders. It is a delightful service to Him to administer the covenant and to make it effective. It is not a dead letter; it is a living thing, He being the Spirit of it, so that it is a delightful service which He carries on in coming in among the brethren. There is the sense of authority, but the authority all tends to bring in the love of God, to make the love of God effective. That is what He is engaged in doing, and I think that is the glory that shines. The glory of the Lord as seen here is apprehending Him in that light. As Moses came down, so He comes down; not personally, of course, as Moses did, but mediately, as through Paul and others. The Lord comes in by the Spirit to make the love of God effective. There is authority in it, but delightful liberty, because it is to bring in and to make the love of God effective among us.
Rem. I think you have suggested a beautiful thought. The Lord when He was here on earth could not go inside the holy place or the holiest; but all that is over now and He ministers as the "Minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man", (@Hebrews 8:2). It touches our hearts that the Lord should now have that pleasure.
J.T. We want to yield ourselves to Him, and the more we do, the more we realise the liberty, and that it becomes a liberty of love in our hearts -- a very tangible thing. The love in our hearts is placed there by Christ. It is by the Spirit, but still by Him.
{419}
H.E.S. Is your thought that all divine service is in liberty, and the character of it is seen in Christ?
J.T. Quite. It is not the priest here, but the Lord; it is Christ in that light, but embodying in Himself all He is ministering. It is the "love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord", (@Romans 8:39). It is all there, but not only is it there, but it is to be in *us*; and what He is aiming at is to bring it into our hearts.
Ques. Would @John 2:11 bear it out, where the Lord manifested His glory and the disciples believed on Him?
J.T. Just so; He "manifested forth his glory". They were affected by that.
H.F.N. Would this have a relation to what is your peculiar exercise in regard to service? Would the servant come out imbued with what is found as beholding the glory of the Lord?
J.T. I think so. I suppose the seventy (@Numbers 11), on whom the spirit of Moses was placed, would take on the character of Moses in their service. What the apostle is showing here is that he is representative of that himself. "Ministered by us", he says. But when you come to chapter 4 it is a question of endurance, having received such a ministry. The ministry is set out in its magnificence in chapter 3. It is the glory of the Lord who is the Spirit of the covenant. But He said in coming among the brethren, "A spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having"; it is not the idea of a spirit, but rather that He is tangibly the thing; one well known to them. "It is I myself", (@Luke 24:39). He is that One, so that it is known to us in the manner in which the Lord deals with us. Now the next thing is, "having this ministry, as we have had mercy shown us, we faint not". It is a question now of endurance, involving that such a ministry should be seen in persons in whom, though yet mortal, there is the power of endurance. That is what chapter 4 brings out.
{420}
J.J. Is that why Gideon is virtually brought into the chapter?
J.T. I think he is alluded to from the outset; "faint not" alludes to that, it seems.
J.J. He had power to endure.
J.T. Yes; he was faint in a way, but did not give up; he endured. One is struck with the wonderful power he had, after capturing the Midianites, to come back and execute judgment on those who refused to obey him.
Rem. The whole generation of faith is said to endure, so that Gideon is characteristic in that way.
J.T. Quite, and so Timothy is enjoined as a good soldier of Jesus Christ to take his share in sufferings, not to take his share in the conflict and fighting, but in *sufferings*. It is a question now of ability to suffer and endure.
J.K. Is that the way the apostle learned it himself on the road to Damascus? "I am Jesus" (@Acts 5:9), and the Lord told him how many things he should suffer for His name.
J.T. The Lord referred to how he persecuted Him, and spoke of how much he should suffer for Him. Paul was to be the example of suffering. "What persecutions I endured", he says (@2 Timothy 3:11).
F.H.B. Do you think all the apostle passed through in the way of suffering was necessary discipline, that his ministry might be effective in the Corinthians? He says, "Death works in us, but life in you".
J.T. That is, clearly, how it works out, and so he begins by announcing that "we faint not". He rests on the greatness of the ministry. He valued the ministry, and there must be no giving way, whatever the pressure. This was the attitude of his mind: "we faint not".
Rem. I suppose it is presented in a broader aspect in regard of the whole assembly when he says, "I fill
{421}
up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly", (@Colossians 1:24).
J.T. It is. There he is thinking of the assembly, filling up for it what is "behind", but here the point is the power of endurance, and that must begin with the attitude of one's mind, that you value the thing you have, "this treasure", as he says. There must not be any giving up; the thing is too precious.
J.R.S. Is the power for this endurance found in the previous chapter? Is that where the power is?
J.T. This chapter shows how "the excellency of the power" was of God. The first thing is the attitude of your mind, as to whether you value having this ministry, and having mercy shown you. There is no limit to the power available, and so there must be no surrender of the testimony.
J.H.T. Naboth (@1 Kings 21), valued the inheritance of his fathers and endured to death.
J.T. And so here it is a question of the value of "this ministry" -- *such* a ministry.
H.E.S. Is that seen in Christ in @Philippians 2, where we begin with the *mind* which was in Christ Jesus?
J.T. Just so. It was the attitude of His mind.
H.D'A.C. And mercy would consider all the difficulties of his service so as to enable him to move on and not to faint.
J.T. Yes; he had already tasted that. "Therefore, having this ministry, as we have had mercy shewn us, we faint not". This chapter opens up that he had it in a fragile vessel, the kind of vessel in which he had it, so that it is God who is doing it. The excellency of the power is of God and not of us, he says. How beautifully He brings in the thought of *God* in all this!
H.H. Moses learned mercy in a peculiar way. After the golden calf and the breakdown of the
{422}
people, he had the consciousness of how God would go on with His people.
J.T. It is excellent to look at him as he entered into the camp having the golden calf in it. He took his life in his hands. Think of what he had to face there! But then he knew what was at stake, and God carried him through in a most marvellous way. It is there really that Moses reaches the zenith of his glory, in the way he stands for God at all costs, and God carried him through. The instances in which God honoured Moses after this form a most interesting study, especially his talking with him.
Rem. Well, if a man has the spirit to die for his brethren as Moses had, he can walk thirty-eight years with them. He started with that, that he would be blotted out for them.
D.L.H. Is there not a point of great consequence for us in the word, "By manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God"? In ministry there should be the corresponding manifestation of what we are preaching or speaking about, that is, that the minister should correspond with what he is ministering, and thus he commends himself to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
J.T. You can have no power with men if you do not commend yourself to their consciences.
D.L.H. And every man refers to just what it says, everybody, so that the public testimony of the truth was exemplified in the conduct and way of the man who was ministering it.
J.T. And Paul never shrank from any danger involved in the testimony. At Ephesus he was ready to throw himself into the theatre. He was ready to go forward whatever the danger; he was ready to put himself in the front to defend what was of God.
H.F.N. Would you say a word in regard to the three expressions? The treasure is spoken of as
{423}
being in an earthen vessel; and then the life of Jesus is shining out in his body; and then we have the reference to the thought of his mortal flesh. What would be the feature of each of those?
J.T. The treasure is, of course, the ministry, and what follows shows his endurance. Whilst it was an earthen, that is, a *breakable* vessel God watched over it. We have to distinguish between his "body" and his "mortal flesh". The body is alluded to as the vessel, that is, it is a *complete* thought. Mortal flesh is the *condition*, which is not to continue. Inasmuch as it is mortal the condition ceases, but the body is a complete thought, and it will be raised.
H.H. Gideon's pitcher would typify the earthen vessel. The vessel was broken so that the light should shine out.
J.T. Quite. He says, "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us: every way afflicted, but not straitened; seeing no apparent issue but our way not entirely shut up; persecuted, but not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed". All this shows how God was looking after him. The pitcher, in principle, was being broken, that is to say, that which might mar or hinder the light was being done away with, but the vessel remains, showing how marvellously God watched over him. For instance, he is stoned and drawn out of the city as dead; @Acts 14. It looked as though that was the end of his service, but it was not. You see how great your exposure to man's violence is, like a worm on the street to be trampled under foot, and yet you are not. That is the marvellous thing. It is nearly so, but it is *not* so. That is what he makes out here. He is drawn out of the city as good as dead, but then the brethren surround him and he rises up and goes into the city. What a complete change! He is ready for the work, the vessel evidently unimpaired. He
{424}
entered into the city and went the next day with Barnabas to Derbe and preached and taught there. It was the power of God.
H.H. It shows the devotedness of the man, and how he was willing to lose his life here for the testimony.
J.T. It does; but then he brings out *what God is* to the servant. "As we have had mercy shewn us, we faint not". He had already proved that, and then he goes into detail as to having the treasure in this fragile vessel that Satan might do away with at any time as far as outward appearances went. How truly he had proved the Lord's word, "There shall not an hair of your head perish", (@Luke 21:18).
Ques. "We have this treasure in earthen vessels" -- is that apostolic, or do the Lord's servants prove it today?
J.T. It is true in measure in principle today in all who truly serve. It is the attitude to be taken up; you have something. He begins by saying, "We have this ministry", the ministry he had opened up in the previous chapter. No one had it as he, but then the thing remains and it must enter into all ministry according to God.
Rem. Might we not say that the testimony has been handed down for well-nigh two thousand years in fragile vessels, in bodies subjected to persecution and the like, but it comes down unimpaired; it has been preserved in earthen vessels.
J.T. That is what the Lord would bring us back to -- if we have not been brought to it -- that is, the agreement of the vessel with what it contains. That is this chapter, and so the apostle begins with, "having this ministry". Then he shows how the gospel he preached was such that if any one did not believe, if it was hidden from any one, he was lost -- so perfectly did the glad tidings come out in this wonderful vessel. Then he says that the god of this
{425}
world had blinded the eyes of unbelievers, showing both in chapters 2 and 4 the unceasing opposition of Satan to what is going on, whether to bring in cleavage in the local meeting as in chapter 2, or here to prevent the light shining into men's souls. In the latter case it is the god of this world and he has "blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine forth for them".
Ques. Where was it shining?
J.T. Well, in the face of Christ, but through Paul, so wonderfully transparent was he, renouncing the hidden things of shame, manifesting the truth to commend himself to the consciences of all men, that the radiancy of the glory of the glad tidings of the Christ, who is the image of God, should shine. It was a marvellous thing and it was coming out through him, so that we have the idea of representation in Christ who is the image of God.
Ques. Would you think this continual breaking up process is in line with the changing from glory to glory?
J.T. No doubt it is. I was thinking of the discipline one comes under. What a marvellous thing is opened up here as that in which we may have part in some little way! for God would bring us back in every way to what was at the beginning. So every servant is to have part in this, that he is here in relation to Christ who is the image of God; the full idea of representation is in Christ, and it is to work out in the servants, hence the correspondence with Christ in the apostle here.
J.J. Do you think the change-over from Moses to Gideon would bring the idea of the first days and the last days before us?
J.T. That is a good suggestion; *we* are in the book of Judges, as you might say.
{426}
J.J. "We faint not" -- would that come down to Philadelphia as having a little strength?
J.T. Just so. What I think we ought to see here in these chapters is the magnificence and greatness of the things we are dealing with, so as to maintain them on the level on which God has started; to get back to that, so that "the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ" might in some measure shine out. It was shining in Paul; "Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". And then he brings in the fragility of the vessel. He had already begun with the mind, that he was not fainting; he never gave up; it is a question of the attitude of the mind, and then God saw to it that he did not have to give up.
M.W.B. God can see if the mind is in that direction. It is almost a necessity that God should come in, otherwise it might be found in circumstances that lead the body to perish.
J.T. As regards one's limits, for we have to reckon aright and soberly, one often wonders whether we may not tempt the Lord in going beyond our limitations. But you begin with this, that there must be no fainting, no thought of giving up. The ministry is so valuable that the attitude of your mind is you are not going to give up, and God sees that you do not have to give up. You may be brought to great straits, but God sees that you do not have to surrender. Hence the servant's life is one of *constant* dependence on God. "Preserve me, O God"; in this attitude God will never forsake us.
W.L. Do you think the apostle travels to the very end in verse 14, not only in regard to himself, but also to other vessels? "Shall present us with you"; is that the final end?
J.T. Quite; but he would link himself with the
{427}
Corinthians in this. The body goes through. For the moment it is mortal, but "He who has raised the Lord Jesus shall raise us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you".
D.L.H. Is that the idea in "There shall not an hair of your head perish" (@1 Samuel 14:45)?
J.T. I thought so. Dependence on God is the great thing; momently dependence on God in regard of every part of one's make-up -- spirit, soul, and body.
Rem. One is impressed with the way in which the Spirit of God connects the beginning with the end: "God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine". There was a principle laid down which ever afterward became a governing principle for the people of God.
H.E.S. Is your thought that if these things are to be maintained on the divine level, God is the only One to bring them through?
J.T. Yes. That is the idea of the earthen vessel, and Paul virtually says he would not have it otherwise. His very bodily condition is the occasion of bringing God into evidence -- "that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us". In every moment of the day and night you are consciously dependent on God, because among other things you have such a fragile vessel.
M.W.B. Do you link up that with the idea of the thorn-bush?
J.T. Exactly. The bush burned, but it was *not* consumed. This was the "great sight" to Moses.
Rem. Timothy was a weak vessel.
J.T. I was thinking of that a moment ago, but through him Paul's ministry was to be maintained and passed on. "The things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also", Paul says, and then adds, "Take thy
{428}
share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ", (@2 Timothy 2:2,3). That is the thing. If the testimony is to go through, if I am to pass it on to another, I must endure. It is a question of passing the treasure on without adulterating it, and it has come down in that living way to us. Of course it is through the Spirit of God, but He works through persons.
Eu.R. He says Timothy had followed up his doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, and so on.
J.T. That is the same suggestion exactly, and so he reminds him of what persecutions he endured.
W.C.G. Would the quotation here, from @Psalm 116:10 support what you say? The writer further says in the psalm that he would return to his rest in God, and would walk before God in the land of the living. It is the spirit of both that the apostle refers to.
J.T. Quite so "by these things", as Hezekiah said, "men live", (@Isaiah 38:16). The whole of @Psalm 116 is in the spirit of our chapter.
Rem. I wonder how many of us have any sense that we are passing things on, or whether we live beyond the moment in which we are. We have all received, but there is the passing on.
J.T. And you pass on the thing unimpaired; here it says, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels" -- we need to be sure that we have the treasure. Then we get what the body, the vessel, has to go through: "Every way afflicted, but not straitened; seeing no apparent issue, but our way not entirely shut up; persecuted, but not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed" -- that is a remarkable set of circumstances. And then we get the attitude of Paul's mind again as to his body; he says, "Always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus".
F.H.B. He does not say the death of Jesus, but the "dying of Jesus"; it is a *continual* process.
{429}
J.J. Do you connect the "outward man" at the end of the chapter with the "earthen vessel"?
J.T. Well, the "outward man" is the condition more, but the vessel is really the *man himself*.
J.J. Would the "outward man" be the body?
J.T. The body goes through as a vessel. Its present condition is that it is mortal, but what is mortal will be swallowed up in life, and so it goes through. He is dealing here with the mortal, fragile condition, that is to say, you are so exposed to adverse, opposing elements that you seem to be gone, and yet you are not gone. That is what he brings out, but then the attitude of his mind was that he bore about in his body "the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body". God saw that, and rolled in circumstances, "For we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh", as if God would have it in both ways, in the vessel -- the body, and in the condition -- the condition in which I am.
H.H. @1 Corinthians 15 shows that the body goes through. I mean, God claims from the grave the vessel in which His work was accomplished here on earth.
J.T. That is what I was thinking.
P.L. Does the dying of Jesus suggest the Lord's purpose to die, and the element of endurance woven into the very being of the apostle?
J.T. That is how it worked out. The dying of Jesus involved He went the whole way. The Lord went the whole way to carry the testimony through.
Rem. "He stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem", (@Luke 9:51).
J.T. Quite.
H.F.N. Would @John 11 bring into peculiar evidence the thought of the dying of Jesus?
J.T. Yes. You can enlarge on that for us.
{430}
H.F.N. The thought of the dying of Jesus came into special view, so that Thomas could say, "Let us also go, that we may die with him" (verse 16). Was there not such a moment in the Lord's ministry when His dying came into peculiar evidence?
J.T. I think so. You see in chapter 10 it is said that the Jews *surrounded* Him, meaning that His way in Israel was shut up, and God no more intervened to open it for Him. The way was through death; there was no other, as He had undertaken the work of redemption. Chapter 11 brings out that He was going to die. The resurrection of Lazarus was on His way to death; the Lord's emotions showed that He was going to meet and deal with death. It was the only way out, if we were to be with Him, and He went out that way.
Rem. Mary understood that.
J.T. She did; she anointed Him before His burial. She knew He was going that way, and that is what the apostle had in mind in "the dying of Jesus"; it was a question of manifesting the life of Jesus in his mortal flesh.
J.H.T. Is it seen in Paul at Ephesus? It says, "God wrought no ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, so that even napkins or aprons were brought from his body and put upon the sick, and the diseases left them", (@Acts 19:11,12). I wondered whether the life you spoke of would have its fragrance and healing power towards men in the saints.
J.T. That is very good. The life evidenced in the healing, is there, you mean?
J.H.T. Yes; I was thinking of the body going through. I would like to ask, in connection with Epaphroditus, as to the meaning of the expression, "For the sake of the work he drew near even to death".
J.T. It is the same thing. It does not say that
{431}
he died, but he drew near to death, he had *that* experience.
J.H.T. Would for the work's sake be his impression of what he had received from Paul as to the greatness of it?
J.T. Well, quite. For the work's sake, as over against John Mark, who "went not with them to the work" (@Acts 15:38); he did not then go the whole way. He did afterwards, thank God.
Rem. In that same chapter in Philippians Paul was ready to be poured out; he was bearing the dying of Jesus there. Timothy was like-minded.
J.T. It was all in keeping with the mind of Christ, coming down and dying, which @Philippians 2 presents.
P.L. There was no other way of enhancing the ministry in himself, and in others, save in this spirit of sacrificing love.
H.D'A.C. So in resurrection you find the whole treasure is carried through.
J.T. That is right, so he says, "Having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, I have believed, therefore have I spoken; we also believe, therefore also we speak; knowing that he who has raised the Lord Jesus shall raise us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you". As already said, @Psalm 116 is beautifully linked up with this chapter.
D.L.H. Would you say a word showing the connection between the resurrection on the one hand, and the clothing with the house which is from heaven on the other hand?
J.T. Well, chapter 15 of the first epistle deals with the resurrection. It is a question of the identity of the persons coming out, so that the victory is here on earth. It is the power of God here on earth, bringing us out of our graves. Here he brings in the thing from *heaven*, "Our house which is from heaven". It is not that it comes down in any material or visible sense, but that it is from heaven in character.
{432}
As they come out of the grave it will be seen that their origin is heavenly. "As we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly one", (@1 Corinthians 15:49). The bodies, therefore, in which we shall come out of the graves are morally out of heaven; *we* come out. Already we are heavenly in the same sense as in new creation.
D.L.H. So there is no contradiction, but perfect adjustment between the resurrection of the dead and our being clothed with our house which is from heaven.
J.T. None whatever. There is perfect adjustment. It is a question of what God does. How can we explain? The fact is we come out with spiritual bodies: "It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body"; "It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power". But then this epistle would sum all that up in a house *from heaven*, so that we are fit for heaven. We are heavenly now, but as yet we have not got "our house which is from heaven". The identity remains, only the body will be made heavenly by the power of God, as we are already so as to our "inward" man.
M.W.B. In the reference in verse 14, "shall raise us also with Jesus", what is the distinctive meaning of "with Jesus"? Why is that name employed, which has reference to His personal path here?
J.T. I think the allusion is to His dying; what the Lord was in relation to this treasure, the testimony of God, and we go up with Him. There is a correspondence with @Romans 8:11, "If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you".
H.H. Would you say a word about the relation of the one to the other?
{433}
J.T. The dying of Jesus, as we have remarked, implies that His way was entirely shut up (the Jews surrounded Him), and God did not open it up for Him, although they did not take Him when they wanted to. So that the way out was death. As definitely rejected the Lord went to Jerusalem to die. It was anticipated by Mary when she anointed His feet. Of course He could return to heaven without dying by personal right, but He would carry out the will of God.
H.E.S. Is the idea in verse 5 of this chapter that God is going to show the whole thing carried through? "Now he that has wrought us for this very thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit".
J.T. That is the idea. He has wrought us for it already and given to us the earnest of the Spirit. What He has done in us already is to fit us for this wonderful house which is from heaven; our present house is not equal to what we are inwardly. What wonderful beings the saints of God will be! As the Lord says, "They who are counted worthy to have part in that world, and the resurrection from among the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage for neither can they die any more, for they are equal to angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection". The Lord intimates in this what great persons believers are.
H.H. It brings us *actually* up to the level you have spoken of.
J.T. Just so. As risen, we shall be as to our bodies what we are now in our inward man by the work of God, that is, spiritual and heavenly. We shall be raised in incorruption, glory and power; (@1 Corinthians 15:42 - 49).
Ques. Would it be right to say the house from heaven is that which God has a right to reserve to bring in?
{434}
J.T. Well, quite. Whatever He does, He has a right to do, and He has designed for us "our house which is from heaven". In the working of it out, this mortality (in those still living) shall be swallowed up of life, and if we are in graves, we shall be brought out as spiritual and heavenly, as already said.
Ques. Is the Spirit given to us as the pledge of it?
J.T. "The *earnest* of the Spirit"; exactly.
{435}
TRANSPARENCY
@Revelation 21:11,18,21; @Revelation 22:1; @Mark 2:3 - 5,11,12; @Luke 8:43 - 48
I have in mind to speak of *transparency*, a subject which is emphasised in the book of Revelation. You will have seen that in the four scriptures read in Revelation this idea is presented. The *shining* of the city is clear as crystal, like jasper stone; the *city itself* is pure gold like pure glass; the *street* of it is pure gold as transparent glass; the *river* that issues from the throne is bright as crystal. Transparency appears in each of these features, indicating to us what God is about to end up with, and how transparent everything will be in the coming world. But what is thus to shine is being formed now; each of us as believers is to have part in it. There will be no formation then, as far as I apprehend; all that is God's present work.
Now this is an important matter, and what suggests itself to my mind in the Old Testament is that which appeared to Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel as they ascended to the mount to meet God. A wonderful privilege was opened up to them; and, as ever, God gives abundant testimony as to what He would have us know. This incident proves it when there were seventy of the elders beside Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, called up. It says, "They saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire" (@Exodus 24:10), God thus indicating at that early date how things are to be transparent, and that that which was under His feet was thus marked. He had walked earlier, and He was about to walk again, as He says later, "in a tent and in a tabernacle" (@2 Samuel 7:6) with His people. He
{436}
required from them no such flooring as paved work of a sapphire stone, no walking-place like that. His love would lead Him to walk with them in the wilderness; indeed He had already been walking. He is the first to have walked, as Scripture presents things, here on earth; He walked in the garden, as you will remember. And Enoch walked with Him later for three hundred years; and in the most touching manner He, as walking in company, arrived at the tent door of Abraham, in whose family the whole thoughts of His love were to be developed. We are told that Abraham sat at the tent door and "behold, three men standing near him", (@Genesis 18:2). One of these men, marvellous to say, was Jehovah. As they stood near him, he discerned at once the Lord and the other heavenly visitors, discerning also that they were *passing* on. And so he says, after proposing to fetch a meal, "after that ye shall pass on"; he did not wish that *he* should be the terminus, but rather that he should minister to Jehovah and those with Him as in the divine way. And so Abraham prepares a meal, and Jehovah Himself, with the other two, awaits the preparation; marvellous condescension. But they were passing on. They partook of the refreshment and the two men passed on, but Abraham stood still before Jehovah and spoke to Him. Then ensued a wonderful conversation in which Jehovah intimated remarkable interest in the patriarch; it was *personal*. He said, "*I will certainly return to thee* ... and ... Sarah thy wife shall have a son", (verse 10). The conversation went on until completed, and when Jehovah had finished speaking with Abraham He departed; He "went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham", (verse 33), and Abraham returned to his place. God passed on but He had taken Abraham into His confidence. "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" (verse 17) and then He gives the reason, "for I know him that he will command his children and
{437}
his household after him", (verse 19). But God was on His way to the great result of which I read in Revelation. He "went his way".
And so, as Israel is to go out of Egypt into Canaan, He is to walk with them, but before He does this He calls up abundant witnesses who, as it says, "saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire", (@Exodus 24:10). These are the divine circumstances; we shall see in due course the answer to all this in the heavenly city. Already all these features are being worked out, for God is dwelling among His people and walking among them, so that we might learn something of Him, of His manner, of His ways, the manner of His dwelling, and the manner of His walking.
Now I want to show you from these passages in the gospels how this principle of transparency is worked out in each one of us. I say in each one, because that city is composed of the saints of this dispensation; myriads of the redeemed -- and not only redeemed, but each by himself the handiwork of God. And so the record in Mark as to this palsied man is intended to show how the believer *begins* with the principle of transparency. It is said that the man was "borne of four", meaning that his condition had elicited sympathy, and that the ability to sympathise had been extended. In the ministry of Christ the atmosphere became impregnated with the spirit of compassion. Mark presents to us such a personality in Christ ("Jesus Christ, Son of God") in the service, that the influence extended, and an evangelical spirit sprang up, so that the state of the man drew out the sympathy of four -- which suggests *general* sympathy. You do not get that in John. John contemplates a different state of things; he presents us with a man who for thirty-eight years lay by a pool, nobody undertaking to help him; whereas the wonderful servant that Mark presents,
{438}
the wonderful personality that was there, created an atmosphere of sympathy, an evangelical state of things, so that the man is borne of four and the roof is dug through. But what I want to point out particularly is that the *bed* on which he lay comes down. You say, 'The *man* came down', but the scripture says here, "the bed on which the sick of the palsy lay" came down.
Now this is a very elementary side, but most important. If we are to begin with transparency, the *whole position* has to be brought into view. It is not simply that the Lord is told about the man. It is not like the case of the centurion's servant, for the Lord never saw that servant as far as the scripture shows; it was a question of the power of His *word*. But here we have a different thing entirely, a matter which every believer, every exercised person before God, should take notice of, that all the circumstances in which the man rests are brought down. You can see the roof opening, you can see the light coming through, and here is this thing, this bed -- the *bed* whereon he lay. We are very likely to hide the beds; they are indeed private things generally: but if they represent my secret circumstances, if they represent my secret relations, my secret affiliations, it is of all importance that the bed of each of us should come into view. It came down before the Lord; did He not see it? Thus it is that all that man's circumstances came into the view of the Lord and of others too.
Blessing is present in Christ for him, but it says, "when Jesus saw their faith"; their faith lay in this, that they would get him into the presence of the Lord. But was it an accident that they could not bring him in through the door? Not at all; it was necessary that he should come in through the roof, that the whole circumstances should be seen -- that bed, the bed whereon he lay, he was on it, so that
{439}
the manner in which it supported him could be seen; and when the Lord saw their faith, He says, "Child, thy sins are forgiven thee". The whole truth is out. Many are suffering governmentally because the whole truth of their position is not out. There are secret relations and affiliations and practices which are not of God, and which they are leaning on and resting on because they cannot do without them. Their condition is such that they cannot do without them; it is a paralysed condition. There is no spiritual power, and the secret of it is the bed -- the couch -- the kind of thing you are resting in. But now it is all out, and the Lord owns the man as a child; he is recognised as a member of the family. The youngest in the family is as much of the family as the eldest; in fact, the babe and the invalid get most attention. So the Lord would indicate now that all that is in the house, all that belongs to the family, is available to you.
These four had done their work, but look at what is in Christ for the man! Those present insinuated that He spoke blasphemies; how could He forgive sins? But "the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins". He says, "Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?" and so He says to the man, "I say unto *thee*, Arise, and take up thy bed". To *thee* I say, Take up thy bed. He is occupied with that man, with the "child"; he is to be in the city by and by, he is to reflect Christ there. He is not to be an opaque element; his shining is to be clear as crystal, like a jasper, and this is where it begins. Is it not worth while to begin thus? Or will it pay to go on with these secret things, these secret worldly things that are eating the very vitals out of your soul? Bring them all out and let them be known, and the brethren will help you; the Lord will help you through them.
{440}
You need to be helped, you have no power in yourself, and so the Lord says, "To *thee* I say, Arise, take up thy couch and go to thine house". Now you are to go into your house carrying those circumstances, and if I can carry them, *I can lay them down*. Making your bed is another thing. AEneas had to do that, but that is not what I am speaking about; carrying my bed is that I have power, I am superior to the thing that once held me. The whole thing has come down and has been brought into view before the Lord, it is seen as it is, and He owns you as a "child". Is it not worth while to be recognised in that family? Is it not worth while to give up these things that you have been resting in in secret for the sake of coming into the family of God? All that belongs to the family is yours, the very best, hence He calls this man "Child".
I want to go on now to the woman in Luke. With her it was a question of concealing, not what was bad, but what was good, that is to say, virtue had gone out of Christ and she would keep this a secret. She had come up *behind* the Lord in her malady. According to Mark she had suffered much, under many physicians; according to Luke she could not be cured by any one; the most renowned specialist could not help her; though she had spent all her living on physicians, yet she "could not be cured by any one", it says. And so she comes behind the Lord and touches the hem of His garment. She had faith in what she was doing. But then whilst you may have faith for yourself, and act in your own faith, and whilst the Lord gives you credit for it, yet the result of faith is not to be kept secret.
Secreting things that are intended to be used in testimony will not do. John speaks of secret disciples; Joseph of Arimathaea was one. Secret discipleship may be of some value -- it *is* of value -- but it will never bring you into the assembly, and Luke has the
{441}
assembly before him, the component parts of it. In this chapter we have the man who had been possessed of demons "sitting ... clothed, and in his right mind" -- that is the *intelligent* side, which is most essential. And then we have the woman, and the result of the Lord's dealings with her is that she is *transparent*. Women are naturally secretive; and so the Holy Spirit takes up that feature to show the danger of it, as carried into the spiritual realm. Jesus said, "Some one has touched me". Now the Lord will not allow you to be a secret disciple; He has His eye on you. He says, "Some one has touched me".
The disciples say, "The crowds close thee in and press upon thee, and sayest thou, Who has touched me?" Yes, He says, "Some one has touched me, for I have known that power has gone out from me". It was *something gone out of Him*; it is a substance, so to say, gone out of Him -- "virtue", "power", as it is called, and it had gone into her, and she was made whole, and she knew it, she knew it in herself; but then why should not others know? The virtue that is gone out of Him is to shine here; it is in principle the assembly. We are to shine, but it is in the effect of the power that has come out of Christ; all this enters into the truth of the body of Christ. "The body is of Christ", (@Colossians 2:17).
There is nothing in the body that has not come out of Christ, and there is nothing in the heavenly city that does not come out of Christ; it all issues out of Him, but it begins thus, that healing virtue comes into my soul. It is not now a question of forgiveness, it is a question of power, the power of the Spirit of God, by which I am healed inwardly. This woman was conscious *in herself* that she was healed. And so the Lord said that some one had touched Him; He knows and He will bring it to light, and He knows how to do this; He insists upon it, whatever others may say, that some one had touched Him. Then the
{442}
woman, seeing that she could not be hid, falls down before them all, and tells all the truth.
Now let me appeal to you, dear brethren, in regard of this matter of having to do with the Lord and keeping the result secret. It belongs to the assembly really, for you are being formed for it. And so, as she declared the truth He called the woman "Daughter". She belongs to the family. He says, "Daughter; thy faith has healed thee; go in peace". It was *her* faith, but it was the power that went out of Him, and the power by which she had been healed inwardly that was to develop and give character to her, so that she should reflect Christ; that is the thought. She "declared before all the people"; you can see the importance therefore of being transparent with the brethren, of having things out, whether they be the bad things or the good things. The assembly is to be transparent, and we begin now to learn how to be transparent, and then we shall fill our places in that city whose shining will be "clear as crystal".
What comes out in this chapter in Revelation, among many other things, is the very best that God has in the way of material. I was speaking here last night of the best thoughts of God. The apostle John gives us these, and shows us at the end of his gospel how they are conveyed to a woman, to a sister. It is said, "The first day of the week ... Mary Magdalene" (@John 20:1); she stands out there in the forefront of that wonderful picture of what suggests eternity to us, what God has in view of it -- "the first day". It refers to what is before everything material -- to the thoughts of God "before the world was", (@John 17:5). Think, beloved, of being admitted into those thoughts! Who can admit us into such thoughts save the One who is conversant with them -- the One who was in the beginning *with God*, and who was God? He was in all the secret counsels; what was before the world He was perfectly
{443}
conversant with, and hence He is the Word. He has brought out all the best thoughts of God, and it is a question of who can receive them, and so John brings in a spiritual family.
From chapter 11 to 20 you have the forming of a spiritual family; Mary of Bethany represents that formation, one who, as we saw last night, learned to measure, and to have the best, so as to expend it on Christ. I cannot be in the heavenly city save as formed and instructed in this way, as understanding measure and what is most excellent in quality. The component parts of the city are spiritually intelligent beings, and Mary represents such. She understood measurement; she had a pound of ointment, and it was the best. That is what spirituality signifies; it goes in for the best there is; and she had that. It was not a question of the quantity. We are living in an age of quantity. It is wonderful the quantity there is of things, of money, commerce, religion, education. Today it is the vastness of the scale on which things are carried on. It is a question of volume, and men become inflated according to their volume, whereas with God it is a question, not of volume, but of quality.
If you look at the material universe, you get volume. Think of the volume that there is in the *worlds*! The Holy Spirit uses that word, not only world, not only the universe that we are accustomed to, but *worlds* -- think of the volume! It is beyond us. If it is a question of volume, why there it is; as God says, The cattle upon a thousand hills are Mine (@Psalm 50:10). But it is no question now of volume with God, but of *quality*, and that is spirituality. Mary understood that, and she kept a pound (a measured amount), and the odour of it, we are told, filled the house; and so, from that point in the gospel of John you have the bringing in and forming of a spiritual family, represented in Mary Magdalene.
{444}
She was a wonderful trophy of grace, no one like her in that respect. Mark tells us that the Lord had *cast* out of her seven demons; Luke tells us that seven demons *went* out of her. Mark attributes the thing to the Lord, Luke evidently attributes it to the untenableness of the position -- the position became untenable and the demons *went* out. Satan will never give up a position until it is untenable. They *went* out, for something had taken place in her that rendered their position untenable. But Mark says the Lord *cast* them out -- a wonderful change in her! It was not a mere malady that she had, but the possession of seven demons. Think of what grace is -- that she should be in the very picture that suggests to us the eternal thoughts of God! May we not say with the apostle, "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us"? "By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God". But He has "quickened us together with Christ ... and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus", (@Ephesians 2:4,5,8) That is what God has done, and here is Mary Magdalene in the very forefront of the picture in chapter 20.
"On the first day of the week ... Mary of Magdala", we read, came to the sepulchre, and then she went off and told Peter and John. Then she looked into the sepulchre and saw two angels in white sitting, the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain; and then she turned herself round and looked backwards. She is not now possessed of seven demons, they had been cast out of her; she is spiritual -- not yet intelligent, but spiritual. She has instincts, she looked round and saw the Lord. She did not know Him yet, but He knew her, He knew her well, and He had wonderful things in store for her. She is the very consummation of the subject, and yet she had been the abode of seven demons in
{445}
her day. Think of the marvellous grace of God! And of what the heavenly city is being composed!
She thought He was the gardener, but then He says, "Mary" -- a well-known voice -- He calls His own by name. How precious that is! Every name known to Him, every one of us, the myriads of the redeemed all known by name; how blessed! And then she turns herself completely round, the position is changed; she is now in the presence of the most wonderful things. The Lord says, as it were, I have got wonderful things for you, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father". Think of that! a divine Person who was with the Father before the worlds talking to a woman who had once been the abode of seven demons, telling her about His Father, and that He had not yet gone to Him! Think of that, beloved! Had He been talking to Gabriel we could have understood it, but here is a poor woman, once demon-possessed, whom He calls by name, "Mary", and talks to her as to a friend. He says, "I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". (@John 20:16,17). Think of her, Mary Magdalene, favoured woman -- blessed indeed! As the Lord Himself said, when some one spoke of His natural mother, "Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God, and keep it", (@Luke 11:28). Mary Magdalene is truly the blessed Mary.
And then it says she went and *told* the disciples. How beautiful! There was no ostentatious bearing, as if she were the great woman with the message. No, she went and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord; how simple! She *told* them; it was the simple word of a woman who had heard the Lord Jesus speak to her about His Father and about His brethren. She was qualified. Is she not fit, is she not worthy to be in that picture! Shall we not see her in the reality
{446}
of it in the coming day, and many like her? 'Nor what is next Thine heart', one says who understood it, 'shall we forget, Thy saints, O Lord, with Thee in glory met'. (`160:8) So the Lord would have the assembly on the first day of the week; that is the setting of the breaking of bread, for it leads to this; it belongs to the first day of the week. @John 20 sets forth what we may enter into. That is where the Lord has set us at the present time. We do not come in at the tail-end of anything, we have the best things that God has to give; we are "blessed ... with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies", (@Ephesians 1:3). Are we capable of receiving them? that is the point. Mary was; for she went simply and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had *spoken these things* unto her.
Now you can understand that we can have the very best things in Mary and in those whom she communicated to. They are the handiwork of Christ, the best that the earth ever had upon it, as the Lord said, "The saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent thou hast said in them is all my delight", (@Psalm 16:3). They were that; not now merely the excellent of the earth, may I not say, beloved, they were the excellent of *heaven*? That is indeed what we are, far beyond any thing on earth -- the excellent of heaven. Hence it says, "As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly", (@1 Corinthians 15:49); so that we, the excellent of heaven, await our house which is from heaven.
And so this wonderful chapter in Revelation is to bring out the excellence of the thing. We have to dismiss from our minds literality in speaking of the heavenly city. It really refers to persons, such persons as I have been depicting; persons who, in their heavenly dignity, will come down invested with the glory, every one of them transparent -- clear as crystal their shining will be. And then if you look
{447}
at them, and examine their texture, what you find is, the *city* is pure gold; the more you look into the thing itself the more the excellence of it will appear, it is all the handwork of God. And the street, that is to say, where we walk, is pure gold transparent as glass; there is not a shade, nothing hidden, all is open -- the transparency of love, of the divine nature, for she is invested with it; she has the glory of God.
Then the river flows out from "the throne of God and of the Lamb" -- government is there, the earth awaits it -- the government that God has set in the assembly, the throne of God and of the Lamb. Out of the throne issues a river of water of life "clear as crystal", that is to say, the influence (for that is largely the idea of a river), the mighty influence that issues forth universally from the throne is clear as crystal. There are no hidden motives, no politicians or Herods with their hidden selfish motives. The government is the government of love. Authority will be there, but in the Spirit of the Lord, and "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (@2 Corinthians 3:17), all is in the liberty and transparency of the love of God known in Christ. There is understanding of what God is doing; for the assembly has grown into a "holy temple in the Lord" (@Ephesians 2:21); the government is intelligible, and it is as clear as crystal. Authority is there -- in the throne -- but there are no dark selfish motives in those having part in the kingdom; all is the outcome of what God is, in whom is no darkness at all.
May the Lord help us in regard of transparency. Every one of us can begin, as I said, in a simple way, as illustrated in the palsied man, and thus qualified for the heavenly city.
{448}
THE DIVINE STANDARD OF SERVICE (5)
@2 Corinthians 5:10 - 21; @2 Corinthians 6:1 - 4
J.T. We dealt yesterday afternoon on the endurance that marked the apostle and the fragile nature of the vessel in which he had the treasure. It is to be noted that "we have this treasure in earthen vessels" (chapter 4:7) is the responsible person speaking. He would be in other circumstances later, but for the moment he had the treasure in an earthen vessel, one easily broken. But the very fragile nature of the vessel only cast him all the more on God, so that he went through with his ministry and did not faint, having obtained mercy. At times he came near to breaking point, but elsewhere we learn he went right through and finished his course. He said to Timothy that the time of his offering up was at hand, so that, although the vessel was so fragile and so exposed, the very weakness inspiring confidence and trust in God, yet he goes through until the time appointed, for he finished his course. "I am already being poured out", he said to Timothy, (@2 Timothy 4:6) as if the principle of the "dying of Jesus" (@2 Corinthians 4:10) marked him. He was being poured out before he died literally. God is pleased to take up in His service men in weak mortal bodies to show "that the surpassingness of the power" (verse 7) is of Him and not from us.
Then there was the outlook of the apostle at the end of chapter 4 (verse 18), "We look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen are for a time, but those that are not seen eternal". Looking at eternal things enabled him to speak of the light affliction which was but for a moment, working a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. This is an immense thing for the servant in his afflictions; it enables him to regard
{449}
them, however heavy, as light and only for a moment. If we are able to look into eternity, the present is but a very brief moment. The outward man was perishing and the inward man was being renewed. It was a daily thing and that which was to abide was being renewed. There was daily renewal.
H.D'A.C. The renewing of the inward man can only take place as we look at the things eternal and unseen.
J.T. I suppose you get a conception of what they are by looking, and the formation is in keeping with what you see. The things presented for faith are intended to produce a conception in us, so that the formation is according to that, would you say?
H.D'A.C. Yes; it works both ways. The more there is this renewing of the inward man, the more we look at the things unseen and eternal, and the more we look at those things, the more the work is unhindered and there is result in the inward man.
J.T. Just so. So that the formation is in relation to the conception one has. In being brought up in this world people have a conception of it; the thing they are aiming at is presented to them, and their education is to that end. So in regard of what we are being brought into, we look at the things, and understand what we are being formed for; we shall thus not be unaccustomed to or unfit for them, as it says, "Now he that has wrought us for this very thing is God", (verse 5).
C.G.R. Does not the outward man involve more than the body?
J.T. The mortal element enters into it, but the apostle alludes to himself, to the whole outward make-up, including his body; that was perishing.
H.E.S. Are there not two thoughts before the apostle, on the one hand, confidence in God that he would be carried right through, and on the other hand,
{450}
the exercise that he might be carried through suitably to the ministry he had received?
J.T. Indeed, so he says here, "zealous, whether present or absent, to be agreeable to him".
Eu.R. Now does the earnest of the Spirit come in in verse 5?
J.T. The apostle brings in in principle all that we shall come into literally. The 'earnest' would mean that we have the thing in principle, but there is the formation which has to be regarded as distinct from the earnest. The renewal of the inner man is in view and what we are coming into, so that we are fitted for it, and I believe it is included in the statement, "He that has wrought us for this very thing is God". Then He has given us the earnest of the Spirit. It is to keep us on the level of what we are coming into as to our enjoyment, while we are down here.
Eu.R. Does the earnest of the Spirit involve the relationship of sons?
J.T. No doubt, but he is occupied here with our house which is from heaven, so that the earnest would be that which you go on with at the present time. In chapter 1 the Spirit is alluded to as the earnest in our *hearts*; that is for enjoyment. But it is brought in here to show that we are not without income in relation to the great future that is before us. The earnest is an income whereby we are maintained now in proper spiritual dignity.
F.H.B. "He that has wrought us for this very thing is God" would indicate the whole work of God in us. It is with a view to that which is eternal.
W.C.G. Would it be right to suggest two lines? There is the line of the work of God, new creation, coming into view; and then there is the line of responsibility, ending with the judgment-seat.
J.T. Yes; those two things work together. The one has to do with us in responsibility here, the other is the sovereign work of God, so that if any one be
{451}
in Christ it is new creation, and new creation is God's work.
A.H.W. Will you say how we arrive at the conclusion of mind, so that we go on and nothing makes us give up?
J.T. "We faint not" (chapter 4:1); that is the attitude of your mind, the allusion being, as we remarked yesterday, to Gideon. There was no thought at all in him or his three hundred men of giving up. They felt their weakness, but in result they accomplished all they set out to do; they went through. It is the attitude of the mind, and God comes in in relation to that; the going through is a question of God supporting you, so that the excellency of the power is of Him.
A.H.W. How do we arrive at that attitude of mind?
J.T. You come to value the thing, the "treasure", as was remarked in prayer. "Having this ministry", that is, such a ministry as is communicated, it must not fall to the ground, it must go through. That is the attitude of your mind. How can you carry it through? You cannot by your own strength. Your very weakness is your strength, therefore, as you rely on God. The excellency of the power is of God, and that very experience in itself is formative. It is the knowledge of God in the way of daily support, and you are in continual dependence on God.
H.H. Do you think chapter 3, which treats of the new covenant, is connected with responsibility, whereas this chapter would come in on the line of sovereignty?
J.T. It does. It leads up to that. We pass the judgment-seat of Christ; that is before us, but we reach new creation here.
H.H. Do you connect "beholding ... the glory of the Lord" with new creation or sovereignty, or is it the writing on the heart now?
{452}
J.T. It is, I think, more for testimony that God may be known here. It is that kind of ministry, and you are in keeping with it. The new covenant has set you up in spiritual liberty, so that you are here representative of God. New creation is in view of eternity. They enter into each other because normally the work of God goes on from the time He takes you up; and all that goes on in your circumstances ministers to what God has taken you up for. He has taken you up for something, that is, for His eternal purpose, and what may come in now in the way of service and testimony is sure to contribute to what He has in His mind for you eternally. It cannot but be so, if you are going on with God. You are coming to know God now, and you are apprehending what is before Him, which is new creation, and you have part in that already.
H.H. God has lost man in his affections, but now He is writing Christ there.
J.T. Yes, it is a question of God gaining confidence in your heart. That is what the new covenant means. Through it we are free to look on the glory of the Lord with unveiled face.
Eu.R. In responsibility have we the Lord Jesus in that way kingdomwise, but holding our hearts in the blessed sunshine of God's love?
J.T. Exactly; all this arises from the truth of the "vessel", but it goes on to what is done in the body now. He comes to that in bringing in the judgment-seat of Christ. He alludes to the things done in the body whether good or bad. That becomes a solemn matter as to one's whole life, what one has done with one's body. We have bodies, and so it is a question of how we use them. Romans shows how unconverted men use their bodies, that in which we all have had our part; and the apostle shows how the body is secured for God, so as to be presented to God a living sacrifice.
{453}
F.H.B. "We must all"; who are the "all" there?
J.T. The apostle is dealing with christians particularly here, that is, those professedly christians, but it would have a special bearing on certain at Corinth who were evil workers. He was aiming at them, but then he could well afford to bring it in in regard to himself. It includes every one of us professing to be a. christian. @Romans 14 connects the judgment-seat with God, and thus it is that every knee shall bow and every tongue confess to God. All are to be placed according to @Romans 14 before the judgment-seat of God. But here it is christians who are manifested before the judgment-seat of Christ.
Then it goes on, "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men, but have been manifested to God". He brings God in, but it is the judgment-seat of *Christ*.
S.J.B.C. J.N.D. used to say that everything will come out at the judgment-seat of Christ, what we have done, even in our unconverted days, but that will enhance the grace of God in having saved such as we.
J.T. That is plain enough here: "That each may receive the things done in the body, according to those he has done, whether it be good or evil". It is not the things done in the body since he was converted, but "done in the body". It is a question of how one has used one's body and of one's responsibilities to God as in it.
Ques. What is the thought of receiving in that? How could a believer receive what he has done?
J.T. It will be a question of how he appears in the kingdom, what his reward may be. It will be according to what he has done in his body, that is, what he will be in the kingdom must be relative to what he has been here. He has been in the kingdom here in his body in a moral sense. Now, how do you use
{454}
your body? What use has one made of one's body? "Each"; we are singled out very distinctly.
J.J. Would you use Abimelech as an illustration? He follows Gideon in @Judges 9, and a kind of judgment-seat was made by Jotham.
J.T. Just so. I have no doubt he symbolises the kind of opposition that was current at Corinth when Paul wrote, that is, it was a question of being king. "Ye have reigned as kings without us", it says. Abimelech had that in his mind. The trees took counsel as to who should rule over them, and the poor Corinthians were little better than the trees when they made proposal to have someone to rule over them. Although well qualified to rule, Gideon had refused, saying, "I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Jehovah will rule over you", (@Judges 8:23). He established that principle, although he was well fitted, because his mother's sons were all of them like him, and "each one resembled the sons of a king". So Paul was well fitted to rule, but he declined and said, "I would that ye reigned, that *we* also might reign with you", (@1 Corinthians 4:8). That enters into the servant's exercise; he refuses to be made a king. It is one of the most insidious things to regard christianity as a one-man affair. It is not. It is absolutely that in regard to Christ, but not in regard of anyone here on earth. "The locusts have no king", it says (@Proverbs 30:27); they represent christians.
Ques. It says of the Lord that He hid Himself. Should that not be applicable to us as servants?
J.T. They would have made Him king, but He says, "My time is not yet come", (@John 7:6). He was born king, but it was not for "this world", and that is the principle: "The locust have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands". It is a greater thing to be governed by principles involving love for Christ than by external rule. The "bands" imply that we can come together in affection. Now, the poor
{455}
Corinthians were very like the trees of which Jotham speaks, that would have a king to rule over them. The fig-tree said, No, I will not leave my sweetness to rule over you; the vine said it would not leave its function to make glad the heart of God and man; and then the olive tree would not leave its fatness wherewith it honoured God and man. What precious ministries! This epistle corresponds; it is the honour the servant pays to God and to men. Well, am I going to leave that to become a king? No. These trees function profitably and consciously in regard of God and men, and they decline to rule over the trees.
J.H.B. Is that not summarised in the last verse of chapter 1 of this epistle? "Not that we rule over your faith, but are fellow-workmen of your joy: for by faith ye stand".
J.T. Exactly; that is an excellent illustration and confirmation of it. The thorn-bush is brought in. The thorn-bush in @Exodus 3 is symbolic of what is of little value in this world, *yet God came into it*. But as in Judges it has a sense it is of little value, so why not take the place that is offered? The true servant declines to take on kingship; he is too well off; he knows that he is serving God, which is greater than kingship as known in this world. So the only one that would accept the offer was the thorn-bush and that was Abimelech, and so fire came out of the thorn-bush. Abimelech also fell under the judgment of God. His course was especially wicked coming immediately after Gideon had set out the principle that although himself like a king, he had declined the position of one.
J.J. How do you view the Judges in the way of leadership?
J.T. It is a question of God calling a deliverer to meet the condition. The first judge was Othniel, the husband of Achsah, who had in her dowry springs of
{456}
water; that is to say, she was a woman of means spiritually and Othniel was of the same family, so that they were persons of means spiritually. He was the first judge and he had to contend with the king of Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia is the land of "two rivers", meaning worldly resources. Chushan-rishathaim thus was a man of worldly resources, and how is he to be met? By a man of *spiritual* resources, and that was Othniel. That is the principle of the Judges. The man is available personally, and God takes him up; the Spirit of God moves him and acts with him, and so it is all the way through the Judges. It is a question of God's love for His people.
Ques. Is Peter's exercise in @1 Peter 5:3 on this line? "Not as lording it over your possessions, but being models for the flock".
J.T. Exactly.
J.J.T. Does the thought of manifesting touch the question of motives?
J.T. Quite. We have to give an account of the deeds done in the body: "that each may receive the things done in the body, according to those he has done, whether it be good or evil". We are now in the presence of that anticipatively. Our very motives are all exposed and we have things out now. You may as well, because they will come out then, at the judgment-seat, hence one is always having to search oneself whether one is right as to one's motives, as to what is governing one in all one's doings.
Ques. Would you say the judgment-seat of Christ is anticipated by us in daily self-judgment?
J.T. Exactly. You are in the light of all being "manifested before the judgment-seat of the Christ".
H.E.S. Is the mutual side of things shown here, that not only they were manifested to God as the ministers, but they had an exercise that they should be manifested in the consciences of those whom they served?
{457}
J.T. It goes on, "We ... have been manifested to God"; he could thus call God to witness on his soul. That was an immense thing. Then the apostle says, "I hope also that we have been manifested in your consciences".
H.D'A.C. He anticipated the judgment-seat, for all had come out already.
J.T. Yes; and it affords a great moral weapon in the soul, if you are consciously before God, and you can call God to witness in that way. You know that He commends you; so here Paul can call God to witness on his soul, and he says, "We ... have been manifested to God, and I hope also that we have been manifested in your consciences". If it were not so, there was something wrong with their consciences.
Ques. Would the terror of the Lord bear on the things that do not come out now?
J.T. It would; and what is beautifully combined with that in the chapter is the love of Christ. He speaks about the terror of the Lord moving him to persuade men, but then he also says, "The love of the Christ constrains us"; the One who is to be on the judgment-seat is the One who loved Paul. He knew the terror of the Lord, but the love of Christ constrained him; he was under the direct influence of that love.
Rem. Having the judgment-seat of Christ before us would preserve us from going on with what is not in accord with the mind of the Spirit.
J.T. Yes. The two things run together -- the terror of the Lord against what is evil, whether it be in the believer or in others, so that you persuade men, and the love of Christ constraining you.
H.H. We all ought to take to heart seriously things that have never been cleared up here in regard of church difficulties and tests.
J.T. What a manifestation there will be of the
{458}
motives governing all those sorrowful conflicts that have happened amongst the people of God!
J.H.T. Would that combination be seen in @Ezekiel 11:13, where it speaks of one dying, and then immediately, "Ah, Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?" Would the combination you spoke of enter into our speaking and preaching?
J.T. Yes. It is greatly to be desired that we be constrained by the love of Christ.
The statements in the chapter, about being beside himself and the love of Christ, show how completely the apostle was clear in regard of the judgment-seat. There was not an atom of fear in his heart in regard of God. "Whether we are beside ourselves, it is to God", that is, there was the power of abstraction from seen things, from mortal conditions to be "to God".
W.C.G. Does not that result from every matter being cleared up?
J.T. I think so. Paul was so clear in regard of any matter, that he could at any time enter into the presence of God without a fear, as one has said, assured of meeting an 'unrebuking gaze' when he spoke of going to be with the Lord. That was Paul's state, that there would not be anything to rebuke even now. If I am beside myself, it is to God. At any time he could be with God in abstraction from seen things, showing how adjusted he was in his relations with God.
J.J. Do you think we see the way the judgment-seat of Christ operates in @John 21 in the way the Lord deals with Peter?
J.T. Exactly. The adjustment brings into view the love of Christ. It is His service to do it.
Rem. In the affairs of men certain things may be on the calendar, but if you inquire about them, you are told that all those things have been settled out of
{459}
court. We ought to bear in mind that there should be with us that concern with God that things may be settled now.
J.T. Quite so. One can be beside oneself to be to God, and God loves that in us, and then, as he says, "or are sober, it is for you. For the love of the Christ constrains us".
P.G. It says with regard to David that he danced with all his might "before Jehovah", and God gives His approval; but his wife despised him, and it is said that "Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death", (@2 Samuel 6:14,23). Would that be a similar case?
J.T. Yes. That generation comes to an end. God would never allow despisal of that which was manifested in David as he danced "before Jehovah". It was the spirit of worship.
D.L.H. Would you link the thought of "the terror of the Lord" with the word, "Our God is a consuming fire"?
J.T. I would. *Our* God is known in that way. It is a very solemn thing.
H.E.S. Is the idea that the apostle had confidence in regard of the future, but an intense exercise for the saints in regard of the present?
J.T. Yes; he was *sober* on their account; "the love of Christ" would keep him here for them, "for the love of the Christ constrains us". The Lord has that which is so precious to Him here, that the apostle is constrained in that connection. It is a sober calculation of things as they are, for "we thus judge", he says. A judgment formed under the influence of the love of Christ is a most interesting one, and you may be sure it is carried on free from partiality. "Having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died". That is a judgment arrived at. The judgment-seat of Christ would assume that, but the apostle had already come to it. He judged
{460}
under the influence of the love of Christ that if one died for all, then all have died.
J.K. The apostle was made perfect in love.
P.W. Was it the love of Christ constraining him that enabled him to say, "For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this but he that examines me is the Lord", (@1 Corinthians 4:4)? It is the same person who says that who speaks here of the love of Christ constraining him.
J.T. I believe that is correct; he knew of nothing in himself, but was not thereby justified. After all, you have to refer to the Lord as to *everything* for final adjustment.
P.W. Then he goes on, "Then shall each have his praise from God", (@1 Corinthians 4:5). I thought that was a very beautiful touch.
Ques. Is this matter of being justified before the judgment-seat of Christ different from having a good conscience?
J.T. You may have a good conscience and not pass the judgment-seat of Christ. One may say his conscience is good, but the question is what standard you go by. The judgment-seat is in keeping with the death of Christ.
Rem. Saul had a good conscience in opposing Christ, a "conscience void of offence", (@Acts 24:16).
J.T. Quite. But later being in the light of God he adjusted himself with God; with him then a good conscience was a very different matter. He exercised himself in order to maintain it, but he had a perfect standard before him. The death of Christ, revealing God's estimate of sin, was before him.
H.D'A.C. The judgment-seat of Christ is in many ways merciful and wise. The apostle Paul, for instance, lived and died a misunderstood man by many; the judgment-seat of Christ will remove all that from the saints. They misunderstood him, and so it will be with us all. We may be too highly praised
{461}
and valued -- the judgment-seat will adjust it all. We may have been greatly misunderstood -- the judgment-seat will remove it all. We shall begin eternity rightly adjusted with the whole company of saints.
J.T. Nothing will be left unsolved; everything will be seen as agreeing with the nature of God; nothing to dispute or interfere with God as known in Christ. This will mark eternity.
A.H.W. Would it be right to say the terror of the Lord had been demonstrated in the death of Christ?
J.T. Surely; that is where God's holy judgment against sin was seen fully.
J.J. So the judgment-seat of Christ is essential for the scene of reconciliation in the end of the chapter.
J.T. And particularly for all of us in active service, that we challenge ourselves as to our motives. But then, in coming into close contact with Christ, we find that in the adjusting process His love is only confirmed, because we can never come into touch with Christ without being impressed that His dealings with us are in love. So the apostle's sobriety and judgment came in under that head, "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised". That clears the scene -- that *all* have died. We judge the death of Christ as having this significance as under the influence of His love. What therefore are men after all? What are human distinctions? What is this reigning as kings? What are those aspirations as to places in this world? They all come down and disappear in the judgment formed as to the bearing of His death under the constraint of the love of Christ.
W.C.G. Would you say a word about the conclusion formed in verse 15, "That they who live
{462}
should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised"?
J.T. The apostle is reaching it on the line of Him who died and rose again; we are living to *Him*. Now the fleshly order is therefore gone for faith. Of course we are not ignoring the other side of the truth, that we have our responsibility here in regard of natural relationships, but it is a question of going on to the full thought of God and of learning His love in relation to Him who died and rose again; that is, He draws you in the power of His love, draws you out of this scene of fleshly responsibilities into a realm where there is just one Man out of death and you live to Him. But then you do not know anyone else; you do not know people now after the flesh, not even Christ, so if any man be in Christ, a new creation. That is the way it reads -- a new creation.
A.S.L. In that scene there is nothing after the flesh.
J.T. Not a trace of it; it is all gone.
A.S.L. When we actually get into that sphere, we shall be exactly like Him, so we shall see and judge of everything rightly according to God.
P.G. The terror of the Lord is rather a stumble to me. Would it be in connection with the refusal perhaps in a servant to deliver the message, like Moses, who said, "Ah Lord! send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. Then the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses", @Exodus 4:13,14. Would that not be the terror of the Lord?
J.T. Well, we have to do with God. "God is not mocked" (@Galatians 6:7), and it is *our* God who is a consuming fire, as was remarked, but that is relative to what is to be consumed. What you see in Revelation is a company of people standing upon a sea of glass mingled with fire. Everything is out; they are transparent. But then the fire was there; they had had to do with God.
{463}
H.H. "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men"; would that go further than those who profess?
J.T. No doubt; "men" includes all, but then, let us not drop down from new creation. In our scripture here we have come on to the very top.
W.L. Would this warning note prove that the testimony being carried on at the divine level, in spite of all the weakness that may come in here, is maintained and God justifies it?
J.T. Yes. You see the living conditions of the apostle; he judged all had died. Whatever your distinction in this world may be, it is nothing to him; all that has disappeared from his view. He will not be unseemly in his relations with you, but your graded distinction is nothing to him. That is the way it works out; he did not know anyone after the flesh; that is how he would live. If you had Paul in your house, he would convey to you that his living conditions were not even in legitimate things, but that they were in relation to Christ who died and rose again -- in relation to a man out of death. His desire was to attain to the resurrection from among the dead, to a state of things out of death. That is what he was aiming at, and so he would convey to you that those were his living conditions. He did not care for anything that men were going on with; they did not affect him. "I would to God", he said to king Agrippa, "both in little and in much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as I also am, except these bonds", (@Acts 26:29). It was the state of his soul, his living conditions.
P.L. You referred to the trees. It says in Psalm 104:16, "The trees of Jehovah are satisfied". Would he be such a tree?
J.T. Exactly.
H.E.S. Does the apostle in regard to the presentation
{464}
of ministry, on the one hand, maintain things on the level of all that God is towards men, and on the other hand, the delight and pleasure of God in a Man?
J.T. Yes, the gospel he preached includes both these features.
Ques. Is it in new creation we can say, "This God is our God for ever and ever", (@Psalm 48:14)?
J.T. Just so; there all is of God. The apostle is bringing before us his living conditions. He says, "So that we henceforth know no one according to flesh". It is the acme of the thing; it is what is reachable. He comes on to the full level of the mind of God. He is touching many things, but here are conditions of his living experience, that he knows no one after the flesh, he says, "if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer. So if any one be in Christ there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new: and all things are of the God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ". Thus the realm of God is reached.
Eu.R. Would it be right to say that while this has to be arrived at by each one individually, it involves our living conditions together?
J.T. No doubt. Paul is showing here from his own experience what is reachable by the believer, and this ought to enter into our service. Though it is much greater than anything I may have here in service, it is reachable. Paul can say it for himself, and it is for every one to say how far he has reached it.
Rem. He began by determining to know nothing among the Corinthians but Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.
J.T. That was to bring down their pride. It was in his public ministry, and not to go beyond that was a remarkable feat, because we are all so apt to bring
{465}
out everything we know, particularly the very best things, in order to make a good impression, but not so Paul. He had such power that (because of the state of the saints) he could limit himself to one part of the truth, and determine to know nothing beyond that. But what he is aiming at here is to show you there is a plane which is reachable now where all things are of God, where old things have passed away and where all things have become new, the great influencing power being the love of Christ who died and rose again. So in Philippians he aims not only to know it simply by faith, but to "arrive at the resurrection from among the dead" (chapter 3:11).
H.H. To bring a man to that high level would colour the gospel.
J.T. Quite. That is the great gain of formation. Paul reached the level God intended for us in Christ; he reached it in his soul. So we have the elevation of which we have spoken in his ministry, and of his relations with God; he had passed out of the world of seen things. Think of the effect of that on a man as he opened his mouth to preach the gospel! What an influence he would exert on his audience!
F.S.M. Is living to Him the greatest objective that could possibly colour our lives, the general governing principle of life, the love of Christ constraining us?
J.T. Exactly; it is living, not to ourselves, but unto Him who died for us and rose again.
W.C.G. Do you not think what is behind that is that Christ is before our souls?
J.T. Quite; it is the Person who died.
F.S.M. It is not a question of purely individual acts of service, but the Lord would influence us so by the power of His love that the whole life would be one of service.
J.T. Yes. And then, as we have said, there are living conditions for the servant. We need to learn to retire on to the plane that the mind of God indicates
{466}
for us, a plane in which there is no question of service, but of new creation; a realm where everything is new, where there is not a vestige of anything old, and all is of God.
A.S.L. "All things are of the God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ". Would you say a word about that?
J.T. Now we come back from the plane of the purpose of God -- new creation -- to reconciliation. Reconciliation brings out a wide subject, so that the apostle goes back in his mind to what Christ was here. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences". It was the wonderful platform on which God approached men so as to deliver and reconcile them.
Eu.R. Is it a little like Peter and John abiding in the upper room in @Acts 1 and the preaching going out in @Acts 2?
J.T. Well, there it is not so much *living* conditions, but that they were *staying* in the place, meaning that the assembly is in view in Acts from the outset, and what is mentioned is to develop the order belonging to it in localities -- in persons who stay in localities. It is not so much a question of living conditions, but of the fact that certain persons were staying there, and as representative of Christ's authority.
F.H.B. Would you say a word as to the relation of new creation with reconciliation? They are brought in together here.
J.T. Reconciliation is really the means to it in our souls. Only as reconciled can we come into new creation; but reconciliation has in view all my responsible history. "Not imputing their trespasses", it says. God remits His claim so that we might be detained, and that we might see what He has in His mind for us, that is, Christ. So it was, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men", (@Luke 2:14). That is what was in His mind, and God wants
{467}
to remove everything that would hinder men coming into that. Men are to come into that, to be for God's good pleasure, but how can they come into His good pleasure? We are reconciled to God by the death of His Son. The sins must be dealt with, but then He is not imputing them; He has been glorified in respect of them in the death of Christ. By the death of His Son He removes what is contrary to Him so that we may be for His pleasure.
A.S.L. In this reconciliation everything has been cleared away, everything of the flesh has been dealt with.
J.T. Quite; the whole responsible side has been disposed of to God's glory. What I have been here, my trespasses and the like, where I have been to God's displeasure, God has dealt with all that, and in faith I am brought on to the platform of His pleasure in Christ. It is "good pleasure in *men*" (@Luke 2:14), and faith brings me into that. God has disposed in the death of Christ of all that which would be to His displeasure in me. Reconciliation is thus a question of faith coming into the apprehension of Christ risen, as representing what is pleasing to God *in man*.
A.S.L. That is the reason it is "by the death of his Son" (@Romans 5:10) -- not the precious blood, but the *death*.
J.T. Quite; "the death of his Son" in Romans, and "in the body of his flesh through death" in Colossians (chapter 1:22). We see in these strong expressions the depth and thoroughness of the work needed for reconciliation.
Ques. What is the relation between new creation and eternal life?
J.T. That brings up another thought. Eternal life has in view the fact that death is upon us; that is the relation in which it stands. Reconciliation has in view that we displeased God, and so He has brought in His ideal in Christ, "Good pleasure in men". A Man has come in in whom God found His
{468}
delight, and He is going to bring men into that. That is what He will do, but it involved the death of His Son.
Ques. Does it reach on to the time when God will dwell with men?
J.T. It does. God has pleasure in us before He can dwell with us.
H.F.N. Would you say a word on the last verse and its bearing on what you have been speaking of?
J.T. It is the foundation of everything. "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that we might become God's righteousness in him". Not only to be righteous, but to *become God's righteousness* -- a marvellous statement -- a full answer to the death of Christ and what He was made. He was made sin for us, He who knew no sin. God did that; God made Him sin that we might be made His righteousness. This should appeal to our hearts!
R.B. Is the glorified body of the believer necessary for that?
J.T. I think so. It is what we shall be fully by and by -- the expression of God's righteousness.
Rem. So the world to come is the sphere in which that will be manifested.
J.T. Yes. It is not only that we are constituted righteous, we become *God's* righteousness in Christ.
{469}
THE DIVINE STANDARD OF SERVICE (6)
@2 Corinthians 12:1 - 10
J.T. I thought we might look at the intervening chapters -- first chapter 7, in which the apostle urges his reception among the Corinthians, advancing in a humble and touching manner the grounds for the resumption of happy relations between them and himself. His first letter had grieved them to repentance, and he would have them know that in writing he was thinking not so much of the injured or the one who injured, but that his diligent zeal for them might be manifest before God. He did also think of the incestuous person who had been dealt with by them at Corinth with a view to his spirit being saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. Now the apostle is concerned that he should be restored, in other words, concerned about the work of God. The man, on account of his history, was under great pressure, as we see in chapter 2; but then he was to be reinstated as available in the fellowship. The true servant thus shows his concern for the work of God; discipline had the man's salvation in view.
Then we have the subject of the collection, into which the apostle enters most heartily and lengthily, even taking part in the service to the extent of being a deacon, reminding us that the spirit of service renders us ready to take on any necessary work, any work that may tend to promote the interests of the Lord. Now he exalts the subject, as we might expect, to the level on which he was operating, viewing those who serve in it as Christ's glory. The assembly is brought into the service of giving in a striking manner, its messengers being the glory of Christ. We are reminded that what apparently would be material, and thus relatively insignificant,
{470}
is to be put on the exalted basis on which the service of God is. The collection is not beneath that; it is the bounty of the saints.
H.H. There has been a good bit of exercise about the collection. Some think the box ought not to be on the table.
J.T. The suggestion in that is that it is beneath the dignity of what is on the table; that is, the *love* behind the giving is overlooked, whereas it is spiritually pure gold.
Rem. I suppose it is entitled to a place as a sacrificial offering, an odour of a sweet-smelling savour.
J.T. It is brought on to that distinctive level here in its results -- at the end of chapter 9. "Now he that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating shall supply and make abundant your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: enriched in every way unto all free-hearted liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God. Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God; they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free-hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all; and in their supplication for you, full of ardent desire for you, on account of the exceeding grace of God which is upon you. Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift", (@2 Corinthians 9:10 - 15). There can be no doubt in the light of those words as to the spiritual significance of giving.
Rem. So you suggest that the collection reaches up to the level of what we have had before us here, and takes its place commensurately with it.
J.T. Yes. It is on that plane, and it ought to appeal to us that the messengers of the assembly to minister to the need in Jerusalem were Christ's
{471}
glory. It is within our reach as according to our ability financially thus to serve; it is not only meeting need that may be current, but in doing so there is a yield for God.
A.M. When David gave six hundred shekels of gold for the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, would that illustrate the high level of the service?
J.T. He bought the *place*, showing that he had in mind the thought of enlargement, and he would have a free hand in his operations. The amount given in @1 Chronicles 21:22 is much larger than in 2 Samuel. David, according to the former, gave "full money" and the area secured was evidently larger than the threshing-floor.
H.E.S. Does it stand connected with the spirit and manner of giving of the children of Israel in regard of the tabernacle?
J.T. It does. There was a very remarkable result in Exodus. The giving exceeded the need, and so in David's time the same thing happened -- a wonderful supply appeared in view of the building.
Ques. Do you not think in the early days the free-hearted liberality of the brethren amongst the nations to their brethren who were Jews had much to do with the breaking down of the middle wall of partition in a practical way, so that national and racial questions were melted down by it?
J.T. It is very remarkable as the testimony extended to Antioch that a prophetic ministry came down from Judaea -- as if that was Judaea's contribution (compare @Romans 15:27) at that moment -- announcing that there would be a great dearth, which took place under Claudius. That was God's governmental action in view of what was proceeding at Antioch. The dearth took place in the days of Claudius, and that brought into view the need in Judaea, which certain who were "well off" (@Acts 11:29) at Antioch were determined to meet; and it says they did it,
{472}
and sent it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. God acted governmentally in the dearth to bring out the bounty of the gentiles, and thus increase the links between the brethren in Judaea and those at Antioch -- a very remarkable illustration of what you say. The appeal there was to those who were "well off"; that has its own voice. Here it is not to such specially, but to the assembly, the saints as a whole; we should not therefore leave the thing to those who have means, for a man is accepted according to what he has, however little it may be or however much. It is in the acceptance that the gain is; it is in being accepted that one gains spiritually.
M.W.B. Is it not important to see that the collection is an assembly act? It is the act of the church as you have pointed out, sent through the messengers of the assemblies, and then in Philippians it says, "No assembly communicated anything to me in the way of giving and receiving, save ye alone". It is not merely an individual action, but the action of the assembly.
J.T. That is the point of view in these two epistles. In the first epistle the collection is brought in in relation to the first day of the week, which is very noteworthy. The breaking of bread is not even brought in in that connection in Corinthians. The Lord's supper is dwelt upon without any mention of the day on which it was celebrated. But the day is mentioned in regard of the collection, as if it were a tangible way of reminding them of spirituality; that they could show it in that, laying by at home on the first day of the week as God prospered them. The mention of the first day of the week would carry a certain spiritual sentiment with it, which undoubtedly they would be capable of appreciating, and that sentiment is connected with the collection and not with the Lord's supper in the first epistle.
{473}
The introduction of the Lord's supper had to do with order, to meet a certain disorder that existed amongst them.
Ques. Have we any warrant for a special collection?
J.T. I think we have. It is a special collection in this case, a collection for a specific purpose. The principle of a collection, as I understand it, is that it has to be *relative to the need*; the exercise must be the measure or extent of the need.
M.W.B. Would wisdom come in in that respect, as directing the quantity -- the heart being prepared to give, but wisdom directing the outlay?
J.T. Quite. You would consider everything. The saints are children of wisdom, and you would like to act on the principle of mutual expression of affection. So the collection should express that, hence it would not be the act of one rich person; he would act comelily in what he gives so as to be with the others in it; otherwise he is sure to exert undue influence.
A.S.L. Is it not true that christianity, as we speak, is a system characterised by giving?
J.T. Indeed. If it emanates from God, as it does, it must be that.
A.S.L. He is the great giver, and as His children we learn to give, and delight in giving, not necessarily money, but giving in some shape or form. Giving is the great characteristic.
J.T. You have it here at the end of chapter 9, "His unspeakable free gift".
A.S.L. "If thou knewest the gift of God", (@John 4:10).
H.E.S. Is your thought in regard of the Supper in 1 Corinthians that what is emphasised is the point of order, but in regard of giving the point of spirituality?
J.T. Exactly. It looks in the first epistle as if he could reach them on that point. I do not understand the introduction of the first day of the week in any
{474}
other sense than that. It carries with it all that entered into that day when the Lord Jesus rose from among the dead. Paul had just been dilating at great length on the resurrection in chapter 15, and now he brings in the first day of the week in relation to the collection in chapter 16.
A.S.L. "Not grievingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver". I venture to think there can be no spiritual enlargement or prosperity if there is not the spirit of giving in some shape or other. There is no such thing as hoarding things up, but it is our privilege, as we know the giving God, to communicate in some way or other.
J.T. Love always teaches us to think of others.
D.L.H. Could you give us a word as to the right connection between the box or the basket on the table, and the bread and the wine there in connection with the Supper? The difficulty has been raised (not very universally) as to the box or basket being on the table at all.
J.T. It seems to me, as has often been remarked, to fit in very well with the Lord's supper in that the latter is the love of Christ and the love of God. That is what the Lord's supper presents. The bread sets forth the love of Christ and the cup the love of God. Well, if that is effective, the box should certainly testify to what is in *our* hearts. It is not all, of course, because there is the answer spiritually in praise and worship, but these chapters in 2 Corinthians link up the giving with that very thing, thanksgiving to God. So it seems to me to be in its place on the table with the emblems of the Lord's supper. Do you think that?
D.L.H. Yes; it has been suggested that if the love of Christ is presented to us and the love of God, there is room for the response in the love of the saints.
J.T. That is clear enough; and another thing, as has been remarked, is that the giving should have in
{475}
view the extent of the need existing. Of course we may give, in view of potential need, but if need is known the *full* extent of it should be kept in view in the giving.
Rem. Christianity is really like water, it rises to its own level; the principle in chapter 8 is that there should be equality. It is stated there indeed as a principle, so that one can contemplate the christian company as having every proper need met, and met in that company.
W.W. Would it be possible to have the spirit of blessing apart from the love of Christ and the love of God?
J.T. It springs from these. The spirit of blessing would arise from God giving -- what God is to us; so that the cup, being the cup of *blessing*, should induce that spirit in us.
H.D'A.C. But there are many meetings where there is no need, and if your giving has to be gauged by the need, that would rather stop saints giving. There are thousands of saints who do not know of need.
J.T. But then the need is not simply in your own locality. The need would be general. If we love the Lord, we are interested in what is general in the assembly at large; so you would get to know the current needs everywhere, and would think in that connection. Do you not think so?
H.D'A.C. I understand that a hundred years ago, when the movement of recovery began, there was an immense amount of giving without knowing the need, but that led to abundance for those who were gifts, and great enlargement in the gospel.
J.T. But what I am alluding to in this is in most gatherings; as far as I know, there is no definite thought at all as to what is needed. If there is anything over, well and good, but if there is not, there is nothing to give. But that is not the way God gives. God measures the need, and He would have us to
{476}
measure the requirements. I think the principle brought out at Antioch was just that; there was need and it was brought to the attention of the brethren -- to those who were well off; and so, according to these epistles, a similar thing existed later, and the apostle is labouring to bring out as much as possible from the saints in view of it. When at Jerusalem the leading brethren urged him to remember the poor, "which same thing also", he says, "I was diligent to do", (@Galatians 2:10).
M.W.B. Would that not make us feel the necessity of bearing in mind the universal character of christian fellowship? It is not local.
J.T. It is general; and I believe that the existence of need in Judaea was in the government of God intended to establish this principle among the gentiles.
Rem. There are many gatherings where they have no local need and the temptation is to sink into isolation and to become self-centred; but if they have this point before them, it will be an object to make themselves acquainted with what is existent in the house of God, and be prepared for it.
J.T. And if taken up in that way, every need would be met. "On the principle of equality" (@2 Corinthians 8:14) there is plenty for all -- there should be no want.
D.L.H. Is it not interesting that it says of God that He has dispersed abroad? Does that not meet the whole point?
J.T. That is good. The other day a brother was remarking about a special collection that amounted to a considerable sum of money, that it was just the price of *one* motor car, and not a very expensive one at that! That puts the thing where it belongs. What are we giving for the interests of Christ, that is, in relation to what we have?
R.B. Then what is the thought of laying by at home?
{477}
J.T. It is "On the first of the week let each of you put by at home, laying up in whatever degree he may have prospered". It suggests that you get with your family in the matter. That is what I have thought about it.
R.B. Yes, I think that.
J.T. God takes account of our households. The apostle referred to that earlier, that they should eat at home: "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking?" (@1 Corinthians 11:22). You have to consider how you are eating at home, what kind of table you set, and you have to consider whether others are eating like that. That is the way the thing works; it is very practical.
W.L. What is the significance that this came under the attention of the saints through prophetic ministry?
J.T. It brought in Judaea and Jerusalem as still a great spiritual centre to which the gentiles were greatly indebted. God would remind us of that, and there is a principle in it that we can never ignore -- the locality in which God works in a *special* way. We are under obligation to it, for light radiates. It is alluded to formally in @Acts 11 and @Romans 15. Agabus came down and what he prophesied came to pass. It would be a temporal advantage at Antioch to know that the famine was coming and there would thus be additional indebtedness to Judaea.
M.W.B. In the laying by in store, do you also see the fact of an actual store put by in addition to acting householdwise?
J.T. There was a special need in view, but the principle is there, that you are acting householdly.
M.W.B. Is there an additional thought, not only acting householdly, but putting by a store, in the light of the assembly, on the first day of the week, in readiness in case of any need of a special kind?
J.T. Quite.
{478}
G.J.E. Is not the response of the box gauged by the last verse? "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift".
J.T. That is the point -- you are acting like God.
Ques. Is there any reason why the apostle should speak of the giving of the Macedonians and that which prompted them? He speaks of them giving themselves to the Lord and then to the saints, and also speaks of their begging and entreating Paul and others to give effect to the service which was to be rendered to the saints.
J.T. I think it was brought in to stimulate those at Corinth; that seems to be the way of it.
W.W. If there is one loaf and one cup, are all these needs met out of one box?
J.T. If there is *enough* in it.
W.W. What I have in mind is, if there is not enough in the box, it should be made a special collection brought into the one box.
J.T. The one box ought to include everything. Only there is the principle of a special collection when the need is special, and it is employed by the Spirit to stimulate giving. It is not as if one is getting it out of you. We do not want to do that, to be beggars; that is not the point. The thing is to elevate it to its proper level. It is a question of privilege and of being like God. That is the idea here; not that a few well-to-do individuals bear all the expenses of the brethren, but that the saints give in a mutual way in love. That is what God loves. "Every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle upon a thousand hills", He can say. "If I were hungry, I would not tell thee", (@Psalm 50:12). That is not what He wants. He wants to act upon our affections that we may give like Him, He creates the need to bring out our affections. "If I shall dole out *all* my goods in food ... but have not love, I profit nothing", (@1 Corinthians 13:3). The love which prompts the giving is what God values.
{479}
H.D'A.C. He does not suggest that people should make known their need, but rather that saints should be near enough to God to find there is need.
J.T. Just so; and that is what Paul is dwelling on. He was perfectly conversant with the need. And it is remarkable how Titus is brought into it, how thoroughly sympathetic he was and ready to take on a service like this, because it bore on the spiritual conditions of the Corinthians.
J.J. The apostle is seeking to secure their affections in this way; that the gentiles should collect for the Jews and the Jews receive from gentiles would be a proof of the working of the body.
J.T. That is what was remarked. God creates these conditions to promote general affection -- love for *all* the saints; (@Colossians 1:4). Another thing that enters into this is the need of ministry. Someone has alluded to the smaller gatherings that are rarely visited, but if we have an exercise like that, how are we meeting it? You say, God has not given gift, but then, supposing He does give the gift, the brothers who have it must travel to reach the saints. Ministers have to travel, and their gift will not pay their railway fares. The saints must see to this.
Rem. And live.
J.T. Exactly.
D.L.H. And be lodged.
Eu.R. You include all that in the thought of need?
J.T. It certainly is a very notable obligation. If the work of God is to be carried on, what am I doing? Am I remiss in regard of it? Suppose God did give gifts; they have to live, and to travel, and be lodged, as was said. How is that going to come about? If God raised up fifty gifted men so that every meeting should be visited, how are they going to visit the meetings? Their gifts will not carry them.
Eu.R. If we clothed them as 'messengers of
{480}
assemblies', it would greatly stimulate us to help them on their way.
J.T. What they have got is, as Paul says, "this treasure in earthen vessels", and they have to be cared for in a temporal way.
Ques. Should not our giving be on sacrificial lines, costing us something to give?
J.T. That is what is worked out here. The Lord, though rich, became poor, that we through His poverty might be rich.
Rem. "But of doing good and communicating of your substance be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased", (@Hebrews 13:16).
J.T. Just so, and "Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things", (@Galatians 6:6).
Ques. An odour of sweet-smelling savour -- is that the level?
J.T. Exactly. Now chapter 10:1 brings in "the meekness and gentleness of the Christ" -- another beautiful touch as to the level of ministry -- and then the weapons of warfare that are employed, for now things take a military turn, and conflict is included in the service, so that he beseeches them by the meekness and gentleness of Christ -- a remarkable introduction to a military chapter. And then he speaks of the kind of weapons in the conflict. "For the arms of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful according to God to the overthrow of strongholds; overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ", (verses 4,5). That is the first thing, and then, "Having in readiness to avenge all disobedience", (verse 6). The general calculation in service is having the saints generally right and in order, every high thought brought down by spiritual weapons; and then, not sparing the guilty, for in all issues and conflicts there
{481}
are *some* guilty ones, and these cannot be let go. We can never proclaim a general amnesty in the things of God. There must be the dealing with whatever there is that has given rise to the conflict. The general principle is to have order among the brethren; all brought into the obedience of the Christ, which is an immense thought to have in mind.
S.J.B.C. What is the character of this conflict? Is it in the wilderness, or does it touch the Canaan conflict? Pulling down strongholds seems to remind one of Jericho.
J.T. It does; but I think what is in view here is the state of things at Corinth. Will was at work, and Satan had got a footing and the whole meeting was affected; so it was a question of using skill -- "the meekness and gentleness of Christ" marking the servant -- and employing spiritual weapons to bring in obedience in a general way, so as to avoid a breach, or the possibility of any being carried off, but that all should be saved. But if there be the continuance of will and disobedience in certain ones, they have to be dealt with. "Having in readiness", he says, "to avenge all disobedience", (verse 6).
M.W.B. Why does he add, "when your obedience shall have been fulfilled"?
J.T. He means that his aim was to save the whole assembly. Had he gone to Corinth with a rod, doubtless a large number would have been thrust into the camp of the opposers. But he is using the utmost skill in order to reach them all, and that the whole assembly should be brought into subjection. Then there were outstanding ones; he deals with them in chapter 11:13, calling them "false apostles".
Ques. Would the suggestion be that when their obedience was made manifest, what would be left would be leaven that would be dealt with? Is that why it brings in "when your obedience shall have been fulfilled"?
{482}
J.T. He would have the whole assembly with him; that in anything he would do, there should be no danger of a general rupture.
P.L. Do you get the thought of the meekness and gentleness of Christ in the scripture, "I drew them with cords of a man", (@Hosea 11:4)?
J.T. Just so. Then, another thing in this chapter is the principle of *measure* -- that we do not go beyond our measure. God is the God of measure. It is remarkable how God is brought into every phase -- God in Christ, here "the God of measure". Those present at Corinth were not going on that principle at all; they really had no measure. Paul's measure was a measure that reached "to you also", as he says. These men -- false apostles -- were working in a ready-made state of things, made ready to hand by somebody else. That is not anything. They were measuring themselves by themselves, but then, that is no standard at all; it is a question of *God's* measure.
Ques. Is that why he brings in the suffering? Is a man's measure according to the measure he can suffer?
J.T. The result of a man's ministry, what he effects by ministry is his measure, as he says, "The measure ... to reach to you also", (chapter 10:13). Then in the next chapter, among other things, you have a very beautiful thing, that is, the "simplicity as to the Christ", (chapter 11:3).
A.S.L. The expression, "God of measure", which is a scriptural expression, is absent from the Authorised Version, which is a very great lack. The God of measure measures out in sovereignty to everybody as He thinks fit.
J.T. It shows the value of the New Translation. Then I was remarking on the next chapter, as to the "simplicity as to the Christ". They were in danger of being corrupted from that, and he brings in Satan: "As the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, so your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to
{483}
the Christ". Simplicity is another feature that should be noted in service, and I think it is beautifully illustrated in David as rejected by Saul. He comes to Nob and needs bread, and he says to the priest, "What is under thy hand?" (@1 Samuel 21:3). Now that is the point, what is under your hand? As in a meeting you may complain that the gift is very little, that there is very little help, but the point is, what is under your hand; whatever there is, use that. Well, the priest said, there are these loaves, and there were five of them, but David says, Give me those. They were just coming off the table of shewbread. David is ready to explain to the priest that the simplicity that was in him was really priestly; he knew that the bread was really "in a manner common" (verse 5), showing that he is able to judge of a thing as well as the priest himself; but, as simple, he would use what was available.
A.S.L. I suppose Eve herself is the very best possible illustration of the lack of "simplicity as to the Christ", (chapter 11:3). She had only to attend to Adam, and she ought to have referred the serpent to her husband. But she was defective as to simplicity as to her head. So we cannot do without the book of Genesis.
J.T. Then she gave of the forbidden fruit to her husband *with her*.
A.S.L. In passing, it is very interesting to note that the great attack of the enemy today is on the book of Genesis, but you find the New Testament is full of references to it.
J.J.T. Have you in mind that in small meetings even, there is the possibility of stimulating what there is of God and making use of it?
J.T. You make use of what there is. You cannot expect God to give you more if you do not use what He has given you. Then David asks for a sword, and the priest says, I have not any save the sword of Goliath, and it is wrapped up behind the ephod;
{484}
that is, it was not being used. It was kept seemingly with priestly care, wrapped up behind the *ephod*, but it was not in use. David would make use of it, and he said, "There is none like that".
H.E.S. In the gospels the Lord takes up what was under His hand from time to time.
J.T. It is a great lesson to be simple in regard to what there is; as used it will become larger and more effective.
Rem. God said to Moses, "What is that in thy hand?" And Andrew says to the Lord, "There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fishes", (@John 6:9).
P.G. Have you anything in mind as to its being Goliath's sword?
J.T. No; but it was *there*. The priest did not apparently think much of it. It is what is under your hand; that is the thing.
Now chapter 11 is full of details in regard of the wonderful life of Paul, a wonderful history of experience, but we can hardly touch on these. They are more to be looked at soberly, as the dear apostle is forced to disclose what he would have loved to have kept secret, and would rather not have spoken about. It must have been a real sorrow to him that he was forced to speak about these private matters that belonged to himself and the Lord. He would have infinitely preferred to have left them until the Lord would bring them out and accord to him what is due; but he was compelled to speak of them beforehand on account of the state of the Corinthians.
F.W.J. David with the lion and the bear was very similar. He would not have told about it had it not been drawn from him.
J.T. It was no question of honouring himself.
D.L.H. We can thank God that Paul spoke "as a fool" (verse 16) on this occasion, and that David had that drawn out from him.
{485}
J.T. We are indeed profiting at their expense.
Eu.R. What is the feature of Satan transformed into an angel of light?
J.T. It is the common habit of opposers of the truth pretending to represent God in some new feature, to put themselves forward as angels of light, but there ought to be some proof of it, and so the apostle challenges them here. He says, "If indeed he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or ye get a different Spirit, which ye have not got, or a different glad tidings, which ye have not received, ye might well bear with it", (verse 4). They could not. There was not anything different to be brought from God than what Paul presented, and so their professing to be angels of light was fictitious; they were liars, they were false apostles. Paul has come to the real crux of the matter now at Corinth, and he is exposing those men who were darkening and blinding the brethren.
P.G. Why should the apostle wish to keep this wonderful vision of his private?
J.T. It was like the hardships he endured, a private matter. The question is whether you or I could keep a wonderful thing like this for fourteen years without telling about it. I fear we should have retailed it at every fireside and every table! It is a question of being able to keep things. They do not lose by the keeping. No doubt Paul never expected to have to use it in this way, but God knew it would be needed. So he brought it out when it was needed.
H.E.S. He would not do anything for his own glory, because he had the glory of God always before him.
J.T. He was not after his own glory, but the visions and revelations he had in the third heaven had an immense effect upon his ministry. You want to let the brethren have the benefit of anything you have got, but not to enhance yourself. Ability to
{486}
keep things, and use them when needed, is a matter of importance.
A.S.L. Do you think that in that connection there was an intentional connection between being let down in a basket and then going on immediately to speak of being caught up?
J.T. There seems to be; it is very remarkable.
A.S.L. The one was humiliating, the other tending very much to exalt.
J.T. He says, "Through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall", (chapter 11:33) Those were the facts; that is, he presents the humiliating side, but the facts related elsewhere point to the love of the brethren. He was let down by *them*. That was another thing, but he does not bring that in here; to be let down by *them* would be no suffering to him, but that he was let down in this way was a humiliating thing.
Rem. I am glad you speak of that, because we are often inclined to think the brethren let us down to humiliate us, but that is not the thing.
J.T. No. If you look at @Acts 9:25 it says, "But the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket". That was not to humiliate him, but to *make it easy* for him; that he should not strike the ground heavily; it was love.
A.S.L. I have always heard of brethren letting him down in a basket in this way as an illustration of the gentle way of dealing with your brethren.
E.G. It is "through the wall", in @Acts 9, but here it is "through a window". Is there any difference?
P.L. Would the going down promote the qualities with him in which heaven could acclaim him? Would there be some analogy? The one who could thus accept the humiliation is morally qualified for entrance into heaven. The Lord Himself was chosen to go up into heaven in answer to His humiliation.
J.T. There seems a relation between them.
{487}
"Through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall". Think what that meant for a man who had been brought up at the feet of Gamaliel!
E.J.M. I thought the basket was a coffin generally used in the East in those days.
J.T. The translation says "basket". Acting in simplicity, they used what was available. It was a question of letting the brother down with the least inconvenience or hurt to himself. It was a matter of love, but it was humiliating to him otherwise.
J.H.T. He escaped from the *Jews* in Acts, but from the *political* sphere here. We need to escape from both in our service.
J.T. In @Acts 9:23 it is from the Jews. It says, "When many days were fulfilled, the Jews consulted together to kill him", but here it is the ethnarch of Aretas, the king of the city, that is, it is the political agent. Undoubtedly the Jews got him to do this.
H.H. Could we have a word on what "a man in Christ" is?
J.T. As has been remarked, the humiliation of the end of chapter 11 prepares us for the great exaltation of chapter 12. It is a man. Every true believer is in Christ, but here it is "a man in Christ", that is, it is a developed or mature thought. It is such a one as Paul, "a man in Christ", and he says, I know him; not, I knew him, but I *know* him. It is a present thing. He was *consciously* "a man in Christ".
A.S.L. Fourteen years made no difference as to this.
J.T. No; he was "a man in Christ" then, and also when he spoke. He brings the thing down to the present, to the time of writing.
H.D'A.C. That is open to all of us to know consciously "a man in Christ"; and it is therefore an episode he can share in common with many others.
J.T. Exactly; and we lead up to the top note in this -- to what is in the mind of God, "a man in
{488}
Christ". The Corinthians were not that; they were "babes in Christ".
W.C.G. Would you say the consciousness of what we are with God is according to the measure of the work of God effected in us?
J.T. Yes. In this sense "a man in Christ" presents the full thought of God. Of course, the word 'man' is used in many connections, but the context here shows that the full thought of God is in view -- what we shall be in heaven. He could only speak to them as to babes in Christ. But here is a man, and that is brought in as the top note, as we might say, of his whole instruction. In chapter 5:17 there is new creation "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation". That is the general position; but here is "a man in Christ" singled out, and, as he says, "caught up to the third heaven"; first, to call attention to the *elevation* accorded to him, what was in the mind of God as to elevation, and then to paradise, which indicates the *delightfulness* of the place.
H.W.S. Do you look upon that as specially the portion of the apostle, or is there any way in which it can apply to us?
J.T. I do not think for a moment it was common. It is mentioned as an extraordinary experience; but still it is not an apostle that is alluded to, but "a man in Christ", and one should have that in view, as to whether one can consciously, as I may say, regard oneself as "a man in Christ".
H.D'A.C. It is open to such a one to be beside himself to God, is it not?
J.T. Quite; as is alluded to in chapter 5.
A.S.L. Is it a personal experimental arrival in the soul at what is said in a general way in chapter 5? "If any man be in Christ". Here is a man who can say, "I know a man in Christ", that is, in his own soul.
{489}
He could not only quote the general principle, but he himself had the conscious knowledge of it.
J.T. Quite. He says, "If any one be in Christ", in chapter 5; that is, it is not the idea of the man but any one, whoever he may be; but here what is in view is the divine thought of "a man in Christ" and what is available to him in the way of elevation.
M.W.B. Would the being caught up to the third heaven be a question of divine pleasure?
J.T. It is what God may do for you in His sovereignty. Attention is called to the elevation and delightfulness of the heavenly region spoken of -- the third heaven and paradise.
