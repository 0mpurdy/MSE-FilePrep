READING (1)
@Luke 22: 14 - 20; @Luke 24: 33 - 35; @1 Chronicles 12: 1, 2, 8, 16 - 18, 26 - 28
J.T. It may help us at this time to look into the features of the assembly in its *public* character, as it appeared at the beginning.
What comes out in Chronicles -- corresponding, I believe, with Luke -- is that there were some who came to David at Ziklag, and some who separated unto him to the stronghold in the wilderness, and a large number from each tribe are also mentioned as coming to him at Hebron; their object, in the latter case, being to transfer the kingdom from Saul to him. The Lord may show us in our consideration of this subject what it is to come to Himself as at Ziklag, when David kept close, as it says, because of Saul; what it is to come to Him in the stronghold in the wilderness, separated to Him; and what it is to come as to Hebron. You will notice that while we have only two distinct names mentioned in the latter case, namely, Jehoiada and Zadok, in the other sections a great many names and exploits are recorded.
Now Luke, I think, presents the subject of gathering from the standpoint of Paul's ministry; so that it covers our own time.
Ques. In what way do you connect Chronicles with Luke?
J.T. Chronicles traces the testimony from the beginning -- from Adam. Luke goes back to Adam. He presents the public assembly in its component parts; if we take his gospel and the Acts, he presents the public body.
{2}
Ques. Do you mean by the 'public body' what is seen existing outwardly now?
J.T. What existed at the beginning, when every member of the body was actuated, or influenced, by Christ.
Rem. As we have it in the end of Luke's gospel -- the disciples were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
J.T. Chapter 24 shows that the Lord was *gathering*. Two of them were straying, and that chapter shows how they were gathered; returning to Jerusalem they found the eleven and those that were with them -- the fruit of Christ's earlier work. And the fact that they found the eleven gathered together, and were able to take part immediately in what was proceeding, goes to show that those two were truly gathered. They had thought that all was lost. Ziklag, I think, stands for that principle. It had been burned with fire, and all that was of David had been carried away. But then Ziklag also stands for recovery. Where defeat had been, recovery and victory are seen.
Ques. What does Hebron stand for?
J.T. Colossians and Ephesians; Colossians particularly. There are very few who stand out distinguished there.
P.L. Would Ziklag suggest Romans; and the separation to David in the stronghold in the wilderness, Corinthians; and Hebron, Colossians and Ephesians?
J.T. Yes; Romans shows that where the defeat occurred victory is brought in; and in Corinthians separation is called for (the Gadites separated themselves to David in the stronghold in the wilderness); but in Hebron you may count a large number, but practically no distinguished names are mentioned -- there are only two.
Ques. Why are so many names recorded at Ziklag?
{3}
J.T. I think it is like Romans, where you have a long list of worthies at the end. It was a great matter that there were so many at Rome who were personally distinguished. The assembly at Rome was not Paul's building. It is a notable fact that he was there as a prisoner. He was not the founder of the assembly at Rome; there were very notable persons there before he arrived, who had held the ground in the midst of the greatest opposition; because, I suppose, Rome would be regarded in that light. So we are encouraged to individual efforts in the absence of the apostle.
I think that all these names mentioned in the earlier part of the chapter have reference to those who are distinguished in the presence of fierce opposition; because David was still kept close on account of Saul. Their exploits all come out in that connection. At Hebron Saul is dead. There the power of God is evident. It is a question of resurrection -- the operation of God that wrought in Christ, and not a question of individual exploits. Two priests are named -- Jehoiada and Zadok. That is to say, there is prayer; that which brings in the power of God, which is now known.
Rem. So while there may have been notable individuals present, when it comes to what was taking place at Hebron, as such they disappear.
J.T. When it is a question of God's world, and the resurrection, what is priestly is in evidence; the priest brings in God's power -- he prays. You need that to be maintained in the new order of things. Hebron is looking into a new world altogether.
Rem. God's work is carried on on the principles of death and resurrection. God is gathering on those principles.
J.T. That is what you come to at Hebron particularly. But we have to begin at Ziklag, where there was public defeat. It is no small matter to join the Lord when things outwardly are against Him -- public
{4}
defeat -- but then it is defeat changed into victory, and you come to the light of that; David recovered everything!
Ques. Do you think that Ziklag suggests the kingdom side of things?
J.T. Yes; as has been remarked, it corresponds with the epistle to the Romans; where defeat occurred, victory occurred. But Saul is still reigning. In the first verse of chapter 12 they go to David to Ziklag, while he kept still close because of Saul the son of Kish. Then, in verse 8, you have the strong-hold in the wilderness; that is to say, there is protection there.
Rem. Our brother connected that with Corinthians.
J.T. I think that is right; the assembly is treated of in 1 Corinthians. It runs parallel with Romans.
Ques. Where does Matthew come in?
J.T. @Matthew 18 is the kingdom, and the assembly is brought in as a support of the kingdom; it is that to which appeal may be made.
Ques. Why are Saul's brethren brought in?
J.T. To show that those who came to David had overcome natural feelings and preferences. Where natural preferences are allowed to exist you cannot have the assembly. The Colossians were separated in their affections, and so were the Ephesians. In @1 Chronicles 12 there is a list of mighty men, and the first mentioned are the Benjamites, Saul's brethren. They are put at the top, I think, to show that they had overcome natural family affections. Later we are told most of them followed Saul; but there were those who did not, and they are specially distinguished.
Ques. Hebron suggests Colossians; what does Ephesians suggest?
J.T. Colossians is a crucial epistle, and it is a great test.
Rem. I thought that in Hebron you get the full
{5}
purpose of God, which would be portrayed in Ephesians.
J.T. David's history extends to Ephesians. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
Rem. Of course Jerusalem had to be taken.
J.T. That is so, but it is really a detail; the battle was already won. All the tribes of Israel, it says, came to Hebron to transfer the kingdom from Saul to David. That is to say, at Hebron Saul is left for ever. He is no longer administering. Whilst Saul is administering, you cannot have the assembly functioning.
Ques. You would attribute importance to the fact that those who came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul, were armed with bows and arrows and could hurl stones with both the right hand and the left, and could handle the shield and buckler; it would suggest a greater form of offensive and defensive equipment than those who were armed with staves and spears?
J.T. I think so; and when you come to Hebron, you see, they know now what is needed in the way of weapons and armour; they were ready "armed for war".
Ques. What would answer to Saul today?
J.T. The will of the flesh in persons who are in office, and are influential.
Rem. The bows and stones would indicate that the conflict is carried on by combatants at a distance from each other.
J.T. It is artillery warfare.
Then in verse 16 we have a combination of Benjamites and men of Judah; these came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David. This is a remarkable combination, because one section of it would be affiliated with Saul in their *natural* feelings, and the other with David. So it is very
{6}
interesting to see that these are the only ones that David challenges. Persons who are in outward relation with Christ through their parents, or other natural influence, are ever liable to be unreal; moreover they are liable to be influenced by externals. Children of the Lord's people are already in relation with Christ; they are of His brethren, in this sense, and He challenges them, for they are likely to be unreal, governed by externals, and so untrustworthy if admitted on these grounds. So David challenges them, Why did they come? "Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee". (verse 18).
Rem. Amasai first came to David, and then the Spirit came upon him.
J.T. Yes; the Spirit shows Himself in the children of the Lord's people on such occasions. Amasai is distinguished here as the leader of this group, and the Spirit comes upon him, and he speaks to David. That is the answer to any doubt we might have about anybody -- the presence of the Spirit.
Rem. I suppose anyone who can truly confess Jesus as Lord would have the Spirit.
J.T. That is right. That is what comes out in @1 Corinthians 12, where the proof, or test, is, whether one can confess Jesus as Lord. It would be by the Spirit he could do it.
Rem. It is encouraging that these people proved to be real.
J.T. It is delightful! How pleasing it must have been to David when Amasai came forward and said, "Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers".
Ques. Would not that be practically confessing David as Lord?
{7}
J.T. Yes; and you do that by the Spirit. It is not simply a form of speech, parrot-like.
Rem. Not only were their hearts completely won over to David, but they also went to those who helped him.
J.T. Quite so. They were not going to claim anything on natural lines from David; they recognised those who were there before them. But David was not slow to recognise what they were fit for; he made them captains of the band.
S.J.B.C. And while all may not be like David's mighty men, we can all be helpers of the Lord.
J.T. Quite so, they would be sons of peace, and an immense accession to the ranks of David.
P.L. If we are in a spirit that is foreign to peace, we might betray Him to His enemies.
J.T. Yes; I think that is pretty sure to happen if we come in under any natural influence; we shall be tested, and will give way. If one cannot say by the Spirit, Jesus is Lord (and of course it is for the saints to discern that it is by the Spirit), he is not qualified for the assembly.
Then you have others coming to David. In verse 19 we read, "There fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon deliberation sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul at the peril of our heads". These would typify people coming into fellowship when things were not clear. Though David was going to battle with the Philistines, yet he had accessions. It shows what an attraction David was. Outwardly there was not much to attract, but still they came. One has often heard of undesirable local conditions, and yet gathering went on; showing what an attraction the Lord is. Where God is working all difficulties are overcome.
{8}
Ques. Do we become equipped by being brought into association with Christ?
J.T. Yes; one learns by following the Lord what equipment is needed if you would have part in His war.
Ques. What might we look for in a person who has the Spirit? How can we know?
J.T. Well, you see they have confessed Jesus as Lord; and you hear how they speak to God. It is a wise thing to have people pray when you go to see them on such an errand. There may be a number of things which would indicate they had the Spirit; for example, you get a list in @Galatians 5. You would look for these things.
Ques. Would you say it is by the Spirit that Christ becomes attractive to us?
J.T. The Spirit would lead one to Him. It is for the priest to discern whether one has the Spirit.
Ques. So *that* part of it is left with the saints?
J.T. Certainly. We may be able to tell who has the Spirit.
S.J.B.C. What you say is true; the great test is prayer. When a man opens his lips in prayer he usually shows his spiritual whereabouts.
Ques. Is it spiritual material that is built into the assembly?
J.T. Yes; I think that @Luke 24 shows that though the Lord had said much to the two on the road to Emmaus in the way of expounding Scripture, and their hearts burned in them as He spoke to them, the definite spiritual touch is that they recognised Him in the breaking of bread; that was what moved them, and showed that they were a spiritual element. And when they went back to Jerusalem it was of that they spoke, not the exposition of the Scriptures, although of course this helped them also. At Jerusalem they found the eleven and those with them gathered together and that brings in what I had in mind in regard to chapter 22. The Lord having
{9}
received a cup at the passover, when He had given thanks said, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves" -- that cup, I apprehend, was, so to say, the essence of what God was to Israel. Now when those two came back to the eleven and those that were with them, they were in possession, as we may say, of the thoughts of God in the Old Testament. It was all there in principle; every divine thought was there, as I may say, livingly.
Ques. And would you say then that every thought of God in connection with Israel has been handed over to the assembly?
J.T. Well, I think that is what is meant. The Lord took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves". All that God was to Israel was brought near to them in Christ, and it was for them to enjoy it. The cup was there, and the Lord received it. It was a convenient means for Him to express all that was of God for Israel; and He gave it to them and said, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves: For I say unto you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come". It was passed on to them.
S.J.B.C. In Matthew and Mark He does not say of the passover cup, Take this and divide it among yourselves.
J.T. No, but He does in @Luke 22. Then we have the cup that is for us, for it says, "Likewise also the cup, *after supper*". And again in @1 Corinthians 11 we read the same words -- meaning that it was wholly separate from the passover.
Rem. The passover cup would connect with what the Lord said to the two on the way to Emmaus:
"Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded
{10}
unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself" @Luke 24: 26, 27.
J.T. Yes, I think so. And when they came back to the gathered ones -- notice the words *"gathered together"*, which is peculiar to Luke's record -- they would find these elements, because the eleven had all drunk into the passover cup. The Lord would bring the spirit of the Old Testament livingly before them. There never had been such a passover as this. In @Acts 7 Stephen went over the ground, and traced the divine thoughts -- what God had been to Israel.
P.L. And I suppose that in his shining countenance there is evidence that his heart was knit to David. He had the spiritual touch.
J.T. Yes; what is heavenly is already reflected in him; and his message was all the more painful because he had to announce what was coming: "ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers, ye also", (@Acts 7: 51). The Holy Spirit had been speaking to them all the time. And I believe all that enters into the cup.
I think this chapter in Chronicles greatly helps. In the presence of it you find out where you are; whether in Ziklag, or in the stronghold in the wilderness, or at Hebron; and then there is feasting. You want to know, if you have carried over what was in the passover cup, whether you cherish the thoughts of God for His ancient people. Paul had such love for them, he says, I could wish I had been cut off for them. The Lord wept over them, and He actually was cut off because of them. One who is with God cherishes the thoughts of God in regard to His earthly people.
I believe the Lord's supper is entirely for the assembly. It is "for you", He says. He is giving it to them.
Ques. The Supper was a new institution.
J.T. Yes, an entirely new thing that He was bringing in Himself. The passover was not His
{11}
institution; He had part in it. I do not think the Lord's supper is carried over; it does not, I think, extend beyond the assembly.
Rem. It is "until he come".
J.T. As far as we are concerned that is the light in which we view it.
Rem. You would not link the new covenant with the Lord's supper in a day to come?
J.T. No. "This cup is the new covenant", He says, "in my blood, which is poured out for you".
Ques. In what way would the passover have an application to us now?
J.T. Only in the sense in which it is dealt with in @1 Corinthians 5, Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, etc. That is the typical teaching. So you find in that section in 1 Corinthians that all these things happened to them as types, and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. That is, all the dispensations of God converge on us; so we cherish them. The passover (including the unleavened bread) means that we deal with sin in ourselves.
Ques. How is He made known to us in the breaking of bread?
J.T. Well, that brings in the spiritual element that we have been speaking of. Unless I discern Himself in the memorial, I have lost the spiritual touch.
S.J.B.C. I was thinking that the cup, in Corinthians, might reach wider than the loaf. It is one loaf, one body; but the cup, according to what the Lord said to Paul, is the new testament in His blood. He does not add, "shed for you".
J.T. It is the love of God, and of course that does go beyond us necessarily. The new covenant was made "as regards" Israel, but we come into it; thus its bearing in the Lord's supper is towards us.
{12}
Ques. "Poured out for you;" would that suggest the fulness of God's love to us?
J.T. I think it gives point and application to it. It is "poured out for you;" not 'for many', as in the other gospels, but "*for* you". It is the love of God in its application to those who form the assembly. Luke undoubtedly wrote to confirm Paul's ministry. The new covenant is not made with the assembly, but we come into it.
Ques. Is the thought that what is connected with the assembly must be greater than the love of God known in an individual way?
J.T. Well, I think it is greater in its bearing towards us. One can understand that, because of the greatness of the assembly.
S.J.B.C. We are all baptised into one body, we have all been made to drink into one cup. That is drinking into the love of God.
J.T. Yes; and it is remarkable that it is presented to us in such a small vessel; that what is so infinitely great should be presented to us in what is externally so small. But there is enough there for the saints to drink into. We have the greatest possible thing brought near to us in what is outwardly small.
Here the Lord had the cup in His hand, and He says: "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you". I think it has a bearing on the present time -- the greatest thing presented within a small compass. The word to the shepherds is, "ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger" (@Luke 2: 12). Now think of that! That was the wisdom of God speaking. And then Simeon takes Him in his arms while He is yet small, and he speaks of the greatest things; he says, "mine eyes have seen thy salvation" (verse 30). In the Babe he saw "a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel" (verse 32).
{13}
READING (2)
@1 Samuel 1: 21 - 28; 2: 1, 2; 3: 19 - 21
J.T. I had in mind that we might, in considering these scriptures, see how manhood according to God is developed, as in Samuel; and then manhood according to men, as in Saul. One is exercised at the present time as to the numerous local eruptions in various places, arising from personal feeling, and indicating a want of manhood according to God.
Hannah, I believe, is one who sees the need of manhood. She has priestly insight. Things seemed to be in order, outwardly, in her day; her husband went up yearly to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh; religious observances were recognised; there was an official priesthood in Eli and his sons. But underneath all this there was distance from God which He felt. Hannah, representing the spiritual element underneath (for there was no ostentation about her), came in for persecution. There was opposition in Elkanah's other wife, and the exercise occasioned by this opposition brought about in Hannah the desire for a male child; so that she develops a priestly state; and that in itself brought her into persecution, for even the high priest regarded her as a drunkard.
S.J.B.C. Who do you think her adversary was?
J.T. Peninnah.
Rem. It was serious that the high priest had lost his discernment.
J.T. He regarded her as a drunkard; but *she* was the priest on that occasion, not Eli, for she was speaking to God. Then, moreover, she leads her husband into right lines, and the high priest as well, without any effort on her part; showing what priestly power is as it works unostentatiously; he is
{14}
led to worship God by what she says. There can be no doubt when such conditions exist, that though things may appear right externally, yet when they are looked into, and examined, we can discern that there is distance from God. The priest was accustomed to sit down, and he was a fat man. These things indicate how matters stood when the true priestly element develops in Hannah; and the product of it, Samuel, represents the priesthood in its supplicatory service, for that was a great feature of his ministry; he was marked by prayer. Now I believe all these local sorrows arise from want of growth.
P.L. *Men* are trustworthy. The Lord speaks to the Father of "the *men* whom thou gavest me" (@John 17: 6).
J.T. Yes; He had the men with Him. They were the main theme of His prayer, because they were to be responsible in His absence. So it will be found that in every movement of God, He begins with full maturity.
Rem. He began with Adam in full maturity.
J.T. Yes; he never was a boy. The animals were brought to him "to see what he would call them". His full maturity was manifested. Whatever Adam called a living creature that was its name. And so with Noah, and right down the line it will be found, until we arrive at the Lord Himself, that God operates on the basis of maturity, or full growth.
Rem. Hannah's faith is signally emphasised here. She had faith, and her request was granted, and she names the boy Samuel, that is, 'asked of God'.
J.T. And then you see how spiritual instincts should show themselves; she would not take him up to the house of Jehovah, to Shiloh, until he was *weaned;* she would not have him depend upon nature when she places him in the house of Jehovah. That is not where the parent will hold a claim on his child; when he places him in the house of God he
{15}
is not to be dependent on natural supplies. So Hannah waives her maternal rights; she hands him over entirely.
Rem. One thinks of David's words in @Psalm 131: 2 in connection with this incident: "Surely I have restrained and composed my soul, like a weaned child with its mother: my soul within me is as a weaned child".
S.J.B.C. She loans him to the Lord and He gives her good interest, five hundred per cent, so to speak:; three sons and two daughters. What we lend to the Lord always proves a good investment!
J.T. And she brings him up to the house of Jehovah at Shiloh, and with him three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine, which indicates feelings of priestly appreciation. Notice, *she* takes them up; it is not her husband now.
S.J.B.C. The bullocks would suggest the burnt-offering, and the flour the meat-offering, and the wine, of course, would be the drink-offering.
J.T. You can see what an appreciation she had of what was suitable to Jehovah.
Rem. She did not bring forward the priestly food till he was weaned.
J.T. Well, I think that indicates that he was now to be nourished on spiritual lines. One of the most painful things amongst the saints is to see the exercise of natural influence. Hannah relinquished that in refusing to bring him up until he was weaned. Natural influences interfere with the formation of the Spirit, so that in result we have babes, and fleshly-or carnal-mindedness, and personal feelings arise in that state, which is the very opposite of what is according to God.
Ques. Might not that state exist in one who has been a long time on the way, as well as in a babe|?
J.T. The carnal state is the babe state, even though it be an old person. This marked those at
{16}
Corinth: "I, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ", the apostle says, "for ye are yet carnal", @1 Corinthians 3: 1 - 3.
S.J.B.C. Trouble has often arisen from leaders disagreeing. In such cases would you say it is really a return to infantile conditions?
Ques. Do you suggest that Eli's failure was due to self-indulgence?
J.T. Well, he sat on the seat at the door-post of the temple of Jehovah. That is not the posture of a priest. The priest *standeth* in the house of the Lord. Then Eli was a fat man; he lived to be ninety-eight years of age, but that in itself was not a credit to him; his eyes were set, that he could not see, he was old and heavy, and "he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died" (@1 Samuel 4: 18). All this indicates the opposite of a true priestly state in Eli.
Rem. In bringing the bullocks, Hannah's outlook was a right one; the coming in of Christ was the ultimate point in view.
J.T. Yes. She also brought to Shiloh a supply of priestly food.
Rem. I would like to hear you say something about the three bullocks.
J.T. It was her great appreciation of what was due to God. It is a very interesting point, because it refers to the largeness of her outlook.
Rem. It is very strikingly in contrast with the outward state of things at the time. And then Samuel was coming in.
J.T. Yes, to prepare the way for the king; because in her prayer -- although it says she prayed, she really *worshipped* God -- she says, "Jehovah ... will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed" (@1 Samuel 2: 10). The second chapter shows what the three bullocks mean, in her beautiful tribute,
{17}
poetic indeed as it is; it was the outgoing of her heart in appreciation of Jehovah. And then you have the flour, which would balance that -- her apprehension of the perfect humanity of Christ.
Now those are the elements that build up a man according to God. And the wine, the drink-offering, is what makes glad the heart of God and man. Her offering contemplates a delightful state of things in the presence of God; her soul is in direct relation to God, in plenty and in joy.
Ques. Would you say, typically, she went from Ziklag to Hebron?
J.T. Well, just so. In her prayer she discerns that the priest is to walk before Jehovah's anointed. She has a prophetic understanding of what is coming in.
Ques. How do you account for the fact that neither the weakness of Eli nor the bad state of his sons turns her from relinquishing her son?
J.T. I think she knew God. She was dealing with Jehovah really. If she had been governed by the ordinary religious feelings of the day she would probably have made her request to Eli; but she does not do that, she makes her request to Jehovah direct, and the offerings speak of her appreciation of Jehovah. That is the secret of deliverance. However feeble the priestly element may be, you can have direct relations with God, direct access to God.
Ques. Does she not appear to ignore what was there?
J.T. She was not quarrelling with what was there, but she was dealing with God; that was her concern.
Ques. Would it be like @Psalm 84: 7 "They go from strength to strength; each one will appear before God in Zion"? There everything but God was eliminated from her soul.
J.T. Quite so.
P.L. The man of God is told to "Remember Jesus
{18}
Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David" (@2 Timothy 2: 8). Is the ideal of manhood, Jesus Christ, raised from among the dead?
J.T. Yes, that order of Man; He is approved of God as raised from among the dead. Resurrection is the evidence of divine approval: "God ... giving the proof of it to all in having raised him from among the dead" (@Acts 17: 30, 31). He was heard, it says, "from the horns of the buffaloes" (@Psalm 22: 21).
We are dwelling upon Hannah, however; she represents that priestly element which is unobtrusive, yet nevertheless produces results; so that her offerings have their counterpart in her prayer in chapter 2.
S.J.B.C. Would you say that for the formation of Christ and the reaching of manhood there would be personal exercises, and then the appreciation of Christ would be set forth in the offerings?
J.T. Yes. And although you may not be able to do much, you have the divine thought before you; you see that it is God's way to use full manhood. That is a principle He begins all His dispensations with -- full maturity. Christianity is not a development; it is perfection at the beginning. Hence everything is to be according to that which was from the beginning. So God would bring about maturity, and then work. And those who love God would have it that way. Normally the brethren do not commit themselves to babes; they wait for a man. Before the brethren at Antioch committed themselves to Saul of Tarsus he was a year there with Barnabas.
S.J.B.C. And then in @1 Corinthians 10: 15, Paul says, "I speak as to intelligent persons: do ye judge what I say". And again in @1 Corinthians 14: 20 he says, "in your minds be grown men".
Ques. Do not we come into it?
J.T. We are brought to what God began with, as we see in 1 John. It involves growth in us until we
{19}
arrive at the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. It is a perfect idea at the outset. And so you find here that "Samuel grew before Jehovah" (verse 21); then in verse 26 it says, "The boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men;" and then finally in chapter 3: 19 we read: "And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground". You do not get that said of him until he reaches maturity. Here the references to his growth end.
S.J.B.C. There was a time in his history when it is said of Samuel that he did not yet know Jehovah. The apostle speaks in @Colossians 1: 10 of "growing by the true knowledge of God", not exactly in the knowledge of God (though I suppose we really do grow in knowledge, that is, so far as doctrine is concerned), but growing by the true knowledge of God.
Rem. All this took time; so the outward situation would become very exercising, occasioned by the weakness that existed.
J.T. That is what comes out in chapters 2 and 3. There had to be patience in waiting for Samuel. But in chapter 2 we read of *a man of God*, indicating that whilst God waits for maturity He is not without resource; things have not to rest until Samuel grows; God ever has resources.
Rem. We can accept the outward state of things, in the light of what God is doing at the moment.
J.T. Yes; and you will always find that God has resources. Here in verse 27 we read, "there came a man of God to Eli". His name is not mentioned, but he is a man of God, available to Him while Samuel is growing.
The young believer grows in the house, and as he grows the saints are interested in him; he is not yet entrusted with anything, but as he goes on growing his circumstances become enlarged, and he is allowed more latitude.
{20}
S.J.B.C. The fact is he is developing spiritually in the house. Samuel learned a great deal of what was outside, no doubt; but the soul is developed in the house.
J.T. The mother takes notice of that. It is a yearly matter. You cannot notice a day's growth, or a week's, but you can notice the growth of a year, though God can notice the most minute growth. The maternal side is seen here; she comes *every year* with a little coat. There is a certain amount of latitude given to a young preacher, but as he increases in growth he knows better how to preach. It is a great mistake to entrust young believers with anything prematurely; the better way is to wait until manhood is developed. But, you may say, what shall we do in the meantime? God has His resources! Here is a man of God, and *he* must have grown, somewhere, though we are not told where; we are told, however, that he was a man of God and in introducing him thus the Spirit is indicating to us that God has His resources.
Ques. Would you kindly say a little more about not entrusting anything prematurely to young believers?
J.T. Well, I mean that God commits or entrusts things to those who are fully grown. The Lord Himself is a good example of it. You see Him in the temple at the age of twelve years desiring to look after His Father's business: "did ye not know", He says, "that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?" (@Luke 2: 49), but He does not take up the work until He is thirty years of age. And He was conscious of that, because you have it recorded in @Luke 3: 23, "And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old". That is more than merely an historical reference; it is, I think, an allusion to conscious manhood. Of course He was ever divinely perfect; but Scripture presents maturity in manhood.
{21}
Ques. How would full growth spiritually be indicated outwardly?
J.T. In manly qualities. You can put away "malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings" (@1 Peter 2: 1), and all that belongs to a babe, and you are able to take account of everything that comes up in a broad way. A babe looks at a thing from one side, but a man would look at it from every point of view, and judge righteous judgment. I think it is most important to see that the service of God has not to wait till the young brother is developed or fully grown. The man of God was there, and he represents God's resources. So you may rely upon it that God will always have His resources; He is never without someone to represent Him and His interests. Here you get things grouped together to show how God meets a condition like this. Samuel is not told to tell Eli of the mind of God; he only tells Eli what Jehovah said when pressed by him. Nor does he rebuke Eli; it was the man of God who did that, as we read, commencing at verse 27, "there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah;" and in the verses that follow you have an arraignment of Eli and his house. An awful condition of things existed which did not altogether appear outwardly; but it was now being exposed.
Rem. It is encouraging, I think, to see that in a day of ruin like that, God had a man who would go and speak to Eli the word of the Lord. It is remarkable, too, that he is nameless.
Ques. Would what we read at the beginning of chapter 3 exercise us as to continuation?
J.T. Yes. You see before this man of God is introduced it says, "the boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men". He is coming on now, and nearing the point where he can be trusted; God speaks to him, and reveals
{22}
His word to him; He tells him about Eli and Eli's house; He entrusts him with His mind. One has no power unless one has a communication from the Lord. A communication from the Lord cannot be gainsaid. It becomes apparent that a brother is not speaking from himself. It is one of the most interesting and important things conceivable to receive a communication from God, and that is what comes out in Samuel. The point is, he began to be trustworthy. There are very few that are trustworthy in this respect.
Rem. Mary Magdalene would be one of them in Christianity.
J.T. Yes; and in @1 Corinthians 6: 5 you have the same thing. Paul has to say, "Thus there is not a wise person among you". It would appear that there had been no growth there.
Ques. Would you say that maturity is reached in some before others? David was a young man.
J.T. Yes; he matured early evidently, and was considered an old man at the age of seventy years. The question is whether one serves one's own generation by the will of God.
S.J.B.C. We are told that the word of the Lord was scarce in those days, and the eyes of God's priest began to wax dim, and the lamp in God's house was burning low. It seems to be the breakdown of the priestly element.
J.T. Young brethren ought to see what God would use; to see the divine way there must be maturity. If one is thrust into service while he is a babe, the inevitable result is that he breaks down. I have to grow, and I have, so to speak, to get so many little coats; there is growing and coming into favour with God and with men.
Ques. Would you say that the coat does not suggest restriction, but rather the thought of maternal care?
J.T. It is an evidence of maternal care. The coat
{23}
would not retard growth, it would make room for it.
Ques. How are we to understand what is written about babes having the unction in 1 John?
J.T. That refers to the fact that they have the Spirit. It means that you are not going to listen to men. It is most important that young believers should know that. You are there reminded that you are not to listen to men, or to antichrist.
Ques. What is to be learned from the fact that God spoke to Samuel three times?
J.T. Well, I think that would show how patient God is. He waits on young men and young women; He will cause His voice to be heard. He is patient with all. Here He says, "Samuel, Samuel". Now He gets his ear, and He speaks to him; He is communicating a most important thing to him, He is unfolding to him the actual situation as it exists. Think of what it must have been to Samuel to learn that Eli and his sons were such as they were! But the point to be specially observed here is, that Samuel had a divine communication. And in the morning he proceeded with his ordinary work; he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and it says he feared to declare the vision to Eli. That was becoming. There is no haste nor unseemly energy. His behaviour was most becoming in a young person!
Rem. There was no thought in Samuel of displacing Eli.
J.T. Not at all. There was no pride in his heart, no desire to rival him. Then after this you find that he grew. Now he is beginning to speak. I think this reference to his growth (@1 Samuel 3: 19) would indicate that he was mature, because not only does it say that he grew, but that Jehovah was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. That is to say, God is with you for service, and the first thing is that your words have some weight with your brethren.
{24}
You are not saying something you have borrowed; you have it yourself, and there is weight in what you say.
P.L. You have taken character from the One who speaks with authority, and not as the scribes.
J.T. Exactly; and when such is the case, as it says of Samuel, God will let none of your words fall to the ground. Jehovah is giving him weight amongst the saints; there is power with him.
Rem. Samuel was instructed of Eli.
J.T. Well, there is much in an old brother that is helpful, and there was much in Eli; he reproved his sons and was concerned for the safety of the ark; and God would take account of that. The Holy Spirit recognises what is commendable in him. God would never overlook anything that is commendable. God's communication to Samuel was more or less a secret one: it was to furnish him for service. It is essential that one should have the mind of God about a situation in which he is to serve.
Rem. Samuel kept nothing back from Eli.
J.T. There is transparency with him, and Eli bows to what was said. I do not think the words of Samuel were to expose Eli. The man of God had exposed all to him. You can understand Samuel having the mind of Jehovah about the environment in which he was set. From the light he had got from God as to Eli and his house, he would never expect recovery for that order of things.
S.J.B.C. Prophecy began with Samuel, "all the prophets from Samuel and those in succession after him ... announced also these days" (@Acts 3: 24). The prophets speak with convincing power, "all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah".
J.T. You see in these instances how God helps the young brothers; you have the mother, and the influence of the house of God, but now in view of
{25}
service God Himself comes in. And how beautiful the stages of progress; first he is growing in favour with God and man, and then he gets the revelation to fortify him, that he might know that existing conditions are such that it is hopeless to look for recovery in that direction, and that God has to begin over again. So you find Samuel beginning in Mizpah -- not in Shiloh; (@1 Samuel 7: 6). Jehovah lets none of his words fall to the ground; He gives weight to his words among the people.
Ques. To refer back for a moment, would what was expressed in Hannah's offering need to be maintained all along?
J.T. It was maintained from her side. She would never ask Samuel back. These are principles that every young brother should take a note of, because the need of service is very great. God will give you a message. He will reveal Himself in some way so that you may see how things are; and then He says, as it were, I will give you a word for the brethren, and every one will recognise that it is right, so that it will not fall to the ground. How often our words do fall to the ground!
Rem. So that we have to recognise what a young brother has got from the Lord.
J.T. Yes, that is right.
Ques. Is it necessary to first gain the confidence of our brethren if you are to help them?
J.T. That is what comes out here. Samuel was in favour with God and man.
Rem. When Timothy is first mentioned, it is said he was well reported of amongst the brethren.
Ques. What is meant, exactly, by the statement that Samuel's words did not fall to the ground? Is it that his words were carried out?
J.T. They were resultful. And it goes on to say that he was recognised from Dan even to Beer-sheba as a prophet. Because levitical service is never
{26}
restricted to a locality; gift is always general. God has set certain in the assembly. To regard gift as local makes for metropolitanism. A man's gift is to be known from Dan to Beersheba, so to say.
P.L. Is that why the revelation is given from Shiloh?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord appeared again in Shiloh; for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh, by the word of the Lord. This shows that there was an additional revelation, which we may expect in such cases.
P.L. Jehovah's revelations are made at Shiloh; that is to say, they are not made for a locality; the disclosures God makes to one whom He has gifted are for the whole assembly.
Rem. Shiloh was where the ark was.
Rem. You were saying something with regard to local eruptions.
J.T. Well, it is a very humbling thing that there should be such. The enemy would seem to be generally forcing his attacks on this line at present; and it appears to me that the Lord would meet that by calling attention to spiritual manhood. Manhood would meet such a situation. Where personal feelings are manifested it indicates that there is a want of growth; a carnal state exists.
Ques. But may not eruptions be caused apart from personal feelings?
J.T. I doubt it, if they are local. The enemy may of course attack general principles, or doctrine; but I think local eruptions are generally due to personal feelings.
Ques. Did the attack of the enemy at Corinth come through the allowance of personal feelings?
J.T. Just so; Paul charges them with being babes, and he could not speak to them as to men. They were divided into parties, each having its leader.
{27}
S.J.B.C. They were making service an object, because of the distinction it brought.
Ques. Would the way in which Paul was attacked at Corinth suggest personal feeling?
J.T. No doubt. There was a spirit of rivalry, "his letters, he says, are weighty and strong, but his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught" (@2 Corinthians 10: 10).
Rem. It may be they had personal feelings against Paul for some time before they gave expression to them.
Rem. In cases of difficulty, as you were pointing out, God has His resource. So we can wait upon Him for the development of a man of God.
J.T. Yes; but in the meantime He has got a man of God available. The nameless man of God in Scripture would represent the resource that God has, while you may be waiting for some distinct movement in the work and testimony of God.
P.L. Would you say that Paul represents the idea of manhood in the two epistles to Corinthians? Sosthenes had suffered for the testimony, was not he a picture of manhood? And Timothy also?
J.T. Just so. I think that if there had been a developed man at Corinth, Paul would have called attention to him. He sends Timothy that they may learn in him the apostle's ways as they were in Christ.
P.L. Paul says of Timothy in @Philippians 2: 20 - 22, "I have no one likeminded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on ... But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings".
So that all care in the assemblies is entrusted to those who are mature.
{28}
READING (3)
@1 Samuel 7
J.T. In undertaking to consider this book, the thought was that we might see how a man according to God is developed; and then, when difficulties arise, to see how man according to man is developed. The first is seen in Samuel; the second in Saul. Our inquiry this morning led us to the beginning of chapter 4, where Samuel is seen as matured, and recognised from Dan to Beersheba. Chapter 1 shows the conditions obtaining in Israel which led to this development that we see in Samuel. It was pointed out that God always begins with what is mature, or full grown.
Ques. When you refer to full growth, is that in view of taking up the service of God?
J.T. That is what appears here. It says in @1 Samuel 3: 19, "Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground". We have no more reference to his growth, so that evidently he had reached maturity there. Already he was in possession of the mind of God in regard to Eli, and Eli's house; and now the Lord is with him, and lets none of his words fall to the ground. His service is beginning, and God is helping him so that he should acquire recognition amongst those whom he served; hence it says, "All Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah" (verse 20).
Ques. Would this thought of maturity apply to us, for do we not all continue to grow?
J.T. Yes; we never cease to grow in one sense, but there is what is termed perfection in Scripture:
"As many therefore as are perfect" (@Philippians 3: 15) -- which alludes to the development of the senses, of
{29}
which there are five, and these should develop uniformly.
S.J.B.C. And we read in @Hebrews 5: 14, that "solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil".
J.T. Yes. I should take the growth that we are dealing with here to be represented by the class called "young men" in @1 John 2. Now after we have Samuel established, and recognised a prophet in Israel, we have three chapters in which he does not appear, namely, chapters 4, 5 and 6.
Ques. What is the significance of that?
J.T. To show, I think, that God can take care of His testimony under all circumstances. In chapter 3 we have a man of God whilst Samuel was growing up; and then we have Samuel fully matured, and recognised as a prophet; then the ark is captured, and what comes out in this chapter would, I think, teach us that God can look after His testimony, even using instruments to this end that He has not formed. So we see the ark restored, and restored on spiritual lines; it is restored by oxen which, contrary to nature, left their young behind, and are offered up in sacrifice.
Ques. Would anything answer to the ark being in captivity now?
J.T. It may be viewed in two ways: first, it refers to Christ personally delivered up to His enemies, but triumphing over them; and then, I think, it may be regarded as representing the testimony of Christ in a more extended way, even down to our own time. Paganism was overthrown by it; and reinstated paganism was overthrown by the testimony in Europe. It was first overthrown externally, but the stump remained; it fell on its face, and it was set up again; then its head was broken off, and its hands, so that the stump remained; but instead of
{30}
those responsible being humbled by such a result, they became more darkened, they became superstitious. There was light in the overthrow of Dagon for all; it was God's act, but it was never bowed to really. Instead of bowing to the powerful intervention of God, men grew superstitious, and instead of breaking down the whole system, seeing that God was against it, they became more darkened. That, indeed, is what we see around us at the present time, but nevertheless God withdraws not His hand until the ark is restored, and in a measure restored on spiritual lines.
S.J.B.C. I suppose the former operation teaches us more strictly the knowledge and the power of the enemy, overthrown, of course, when they cut off the head of Saul and sent it into the land of the Philistines round about, to announce the glad tidings in the houses of their idols. The idols did not fall down on that occasion.
J.T. This passage is alluded to in @Psalm 78: 61 - 66 He "gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor; And delivered up his people unto the sword, and was very wroth with his inheritance: The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not praised in nuptial song; Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation. Then the Lord awoke as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth aloud ... and put them to everlasting reproach". We have here, however, a more extended thought, which comes down to the present time. What we have to see, I think, is the pagan system, which has been retained in some measure; the head and the hands were broken off, but nevertheless the stump remained, and with it superstition (verse 5), which is one of the most darkening things in the world.
Ques. Would you open up a little what you have in mind regarding the restoration of the ark? I
{31}
think you suggested it was restored on spiritual lines, the oxen returning with it and leaving their young behind.
J.T. Well, you see in chapter 5 the history of the overthrow of Dagon, and the governmental act of God in smiting the Philistines with hemorrhoids. The god of this world was dealt with by the testimony, but the persons who were supporting idolatry are attacked governmentally. These are extended thoughts, but they are necessary for every one who serves, and indeed every Christian, to have before him, that he may know how God deals with the darkness of this world to make a way for the testimony. How far-reaching and how powerful His way is! And yet here there is neither Levite, priest, nor prophet in evidence. It is God dealing with the situation Himself, God and the ark, and then in the governmental act, the hemorrhoids attacked everybody. He is dealing with men severally in relation to His testimony; and this leads to a serious taking into account of things. The ark is sent from city to city, from place to place, only to bring out this governmental act of God. "And it came to pass, when the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people. And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark ... For there was deadly alarm throughout the city: the hand of God was very heavy there; and the men that died not were smitten with the hemorrhoids; and the cry of the city went up to heaven" (@1 Samuel 5: 10 - 12).
Those who are set for the testimony can always rely on it that God will act; He will act governmentally against paganism, but He will also act directly with every man and woman who opposes Him. The governmental action here is of a secret, painful and humiliating character; it is most drastic,
{32}
but it brings about the desired result. Then the Philistines "called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah?" (@1 Samuel 6: 2). And in result these men indicate what should be done, showing how God so orders things that His will shall be carried out, whatever the conditions. The advice of these priests and diviners is very far removed in quality from Hannah's song or prayer; but nevertheless what they said indicated what God would have done. There was an acknowledgement of God, forced indeed, and not intended to indicate conversion; God, acting from Himself, was forcing things to carry out His will, without any testimony, by means of such as He found there. We may see another example of this in Balaam. God forced him to convey His mind. There are many instances one might refer to, but I just direct attention to this to indicate what God is, and what we can reckon on Him for, in such circumstances. Things can never be too bad for Him to act. He has always the means of working out His thoughts.
All this is leading up to chapter 7; it is, indeed, collateral with it. God can act even though there be neither priest nor Levite available. Samuel is there, but there is not a word about him; not a word about a prophet. God, Himself, is acting.
Rem. In this extended way He might use people who are outside, unconverted priests, and others.
J.T. God makes everything further His testimony; what these priests and diviners said is very far removed from what Hannah would say, yet it is in the right direction. They said, "If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; ye must at any rate return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed ... . Five golden hemorrhoids, and five golden mice, the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague is upon them all, and upon your lords ... .
{33}
Why will ye harden your heart, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? When he had wrought mightily among them, did they not let them go, and they departed?" (@1 Samuel 6: 3 - 6). You see how these men knew what God had done, and they bring it to bear on the present position, and yet they were Philistine priests and diviners.
Ques. I suppose the trespass-offering here does not involve redemption; it is connected with government?
J.T. Well, they had an idea of a trespass-offering. Their idea was that God had to be appeased. We must not treat lightly any such ideas that men may have, for God may use them.
Rem. The golden hemorrhoids and mice would be a confession that it was the judgment of God that was upon them.
J.T. Yes; there is a full recognition of the judgment that lay upon them.
Rem. God had Samuel in the background.
J.T. Yes, God has His Samuel; but still He is acting in government to further His testimony. Through Samuel God intervenes *directly*, but here we have His governmental dealings.
Rem. And we need to be spiritual in order to perceive what He is doing.
Rem. He is acting in judgment in relation to the world, and Samuel would come in in relation to those who were of God. So that even in the darkest moment you have evidence that everything is being taken care o
P.L. "Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him" (@1 Peter 3: 22).
J.T. Yes; He has got control of everything, and all is actuated by Him to the furtherance of the testimony; and yet I do not believe one Christian in a hundred has any thought regarding God's governmental
{34}
activities for the preserving of the testimony. The whole world is under the government of God; every country. Samuel, on the other hand, was a vessel for the direct service of God to His people.
Ques. Would you say that the nations in their deliberations have the support and help of God?
J.T. Certainly; but, of course, not in the direct way in which His people are helped.
Rem, Then perhaps, as you were suggesting, Christians do not believe sufficiently in the government of God.
J.T. It is a great comfort to see His eternal vigilance, and His power available to support His will. Everything is forced to support the testimony.
Rem. So that we would not be depending upon the League of Nations to support it.
J.T. No. If men are acquainted with the Bible, that is well; many may be what we call 'fundamentalists', and they may defend the Bible; God is ordering that, though they might not be converted.
Rem. And we are thankful for it, and pray for them to that end.
J.T. Yes, surely.
P.L. When the people were taken captive, do you think there was a recognition of this with the prophets?
J.T. Well, Ezekiel gives dates that indicate this; he recognises the government of God; he dates from the *captivity*.
Rem. The priests and the diviners here recognise God in the course of events.
Rem. What you were saying yesterday regarding the passover cup would have a bearing upon this; all is preserved in the present testimony.
J.T. Yes. The diviners recognise the judgment, though they do not make any reference to Dagon. They speak of the God of Israel (verse 3), and refer to what He did in Egypt. The cart is not a spiritual
{35}
thought. You may be sure they will never fully answer to spiritual thoughts, for they are not on that line.
Ques. What would you say about the men of Beth-shemesh?
J.T. We read that they looked into the ark of Jehovah. That would be an unhallowed way of treating the things of God. The testimony had come into their hands, and theirs were not priestly hands. They were Israelites, and so should have known better.
The milch kine are a remarkable type of the Lord Himself. Forsaking their natural offspring they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. They went *against nature*. The more you are with God, the more you go against what is simply natural. "The cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemeshite, and stood there; and a great stone was there. And they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine as a burnt-offering to Jehovah". The men of Beth-shemesh were punished for looking into the ark of Jehovah. Then messengers are sent to the men of Kirjath-jearim asking them to come and fetch up the ark to that place. It was therefore brought up and placed in the house of Abinadab, and Eleazar his son was sanctified to keep it, and it remained there for twenty years.
It is to this very point that David leads in @Psalm 132: 6, "Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah, we found it in the fields of the wood". From this place David takes it up; and he had to learn that it must be carried in a levitical way. There is no excuse for David using the cart, or for the men of Beth-shemesh looking into the ark. When the Bible comes into our hands, and we have the Spirit, we as true Christians must not look into the ark, nor may we put it on a cart; for God deals with us according to the light
{36}
He has given us, according to our relationship with Him.
Rem. And David had to learn this afterwards, when Jehovah made a breach upon Uzzah for his error in taking hold of the ark when the oxen had stumbled.
J.T. Whilst we recognise those men whom God uses governmentally, we must be very careful not to imitate them or their *methods*. What God does governmentally is one thing, and what He does through His priests is another.
Ques. Could the Bible be put on a cart?
J.T. When I refer to the Bible, I refer to that which reveals the mind of God; and any human means that may be employed to further the testimony would be represented in the cart. The testimony should be presented by converted persons, by matured persons, by true Levites.
Rem. We see in Christendom how frequently the things of God are brought forward in a merely human way.
J.T. That is what marks the whole system around us -- natural ability and human learning and ceremony; whereas the priests and the Levites are supported by the Spirit of God. Paul says, "I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not wrought by me, for the obedience of the nations, by word and deed, in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ" (@Romans 15: 18, 19). He did not use a cart.
Ques. Do you think that Samuel knew well what was going on, but did not interfere?
J.T. I think it is rather that God is presenting this as *another feature*. We cannot be sure as to dates, but these things run together; and these
{37}
three chapters present the government of God in promoting and taking care of the testimony.
Now in chapter 7 we come back to the ark in the hands of Israel, and one sanctified to keep it; and God has His people brought back, for we read in verse 3 that "Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If ye return to Jehovah with all your heart, put away the strange gods and the Ashtoreths from among you, and apply your hearts unto Jehovah, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. And the children of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and served Jehovah only". You have thus the mind of the Lord *directly* communicated through Samuel.
Ques. Is repentance indicated in verse 6?
J.T. Yes. We are now in the presence of Samuel, through whom the mind of God is unfolded. Then the answer to that is that they pour water on the ground. Samuel does not do it; the people do it.
Rem. Samuel waits for God to act governmentally before he unfolds His mind to the children of Israel.
J.T. Yes, he acts on the results of the government of God; and so should every true servant.
S.J.B.C. Water spilt on the ground is an example of weakness, as is shown by the woman of Tekoah; (@2 Samuel 14: 14).
J.T. Yes. She said that as one who had the words put into her mouth, but nevertheless they are perfectly true words; she said, "we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again". But here the water is poured out *before Jehovah*, so that there is hope of it being gathered up. And in answer to that Samuel offers the whole burnt-offering, a sucking lamb, to Jehovah. The one is typical of what we are, and as poured out before the Lord was the acknowledgement of their state before Him; but the sucking lamb represents
{38}
the intrinsic worth of Christ as presented to God. So that we are taken up now according to this.
Ques. Would the pouring out of the water on the ground indicate that idolatry amongst them had been judged?
J.T. No doubt. It is a complete acknowledgement of their state. It indicates that they must disappear for ever as on the ground of the flesh. Man must go back into the earth whence he came. The whole burnt offering is for God; so that resurrection is the legitimate answer to that. We are gathered up again on the ground of the sacrifice of Christ. We are gathered up in resurrection. The water, as I have said, indicates what we are before God-nothing! The whole burnt-offering is what is positively for God; the intrinsic value of Christ presented wholly to God.
Rem. The sucking lamb is a very beautiful type; it suggests Christ in dependence on God.
J.T. Yes; peculiarly precious to God at that moment.
P.L. Would this suggest Philadelphia in @Revelation 3: 8, "Thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name?" Are they gathered up now?
J.T. Quite so; and it shows the manhood of Samuel; how mature he was; how he sees God's ideal, Christ. With the mature man everything is comely and right.
Rem. He not only saw the situation, but he saw the remedy.
J.T. The state of the people is taken account of by Samuel; they had poured out the water, and he offers the lamb, and he prays. He enters into all these exercises; he is marked by dependence on God. And so God thunders on the Philistines.
S.J.B.C. Samuel subdued the Philistines by
{39}
prayer; that was something that Saul could not do with his sword.
J.T. The hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
Ques. The moment the people humble themselves at Mizpah, the Philistines, who had sent back the ark because they had been smitten, again go to war against them. How do you view that?
J.T. As soon as brethren come together and recognise their true state before God, recognise the assembly, and what is due to the Lord, then the Philistines will turn against them.
Samuel here is on the side of the people, he conveys the mind of God to them; but he is on the side of the people when he prays for them and offers the sacrifice.
S.J.B.C. Whom do the Philistines represent? Is there not in each of us the Philistine element more or less, unless we judge it? Do you refer to persons so much as to a moral element?
J.T. Well, I think we are entitled to refer to persons -- I mean persons who are not Christians; persons who have taken up a position externally without acknowledging death on themselves. Here the people of Israel are acknowledging that death is on them, by the pouring out of the water. Now that is the very opposite to the Philistine idea. The Philistines are people of fame, people who have acquired a reputation; they will go with you to a point, but as soon as the saints come together in true humiliation and self-judgment before God, then you will find they will turn on you; they will not go so far as that.
Ques. What does the gathering to Mizpah signify in contrast to Shiloh?
J.T. I think it indicates a new point of departure. The mature man knows what is becoming, and he does not pretend to go on the old lines. God had
{40}
judged the old position. Samuel in spiritual intelligence begins anew.
Ques. The ark was not returned to Shiloh, was it?
J.T. No; it was never returned to Shiloh. Samuel makes no effort to restore the ark, or prepare a place for it. It is with him rather a question of the state of the people, and getting them through self-judgment into relation with God.
Rem. And in that way he combines the offices of prophet and priest; he intercedes.
Rem. And then in all this he is an expression of spiritual manhood.
J.T. Yes, he knows what to do; he is a man who had understanding of the times, and knew what Israel had to do. Then the Holy Spirit proceeds to tell us that Samuel judged Israel *all the days of his life*. It is really as much as to say that God will never give this man up. Because God would occupy us with such a man as this; He would have us keep him in view, a man with whom God was well pleased.
S.J.B.C. What about these four places which Samuel visited from year to year in circuit?
J.T. That would indicate how different he was from Eli; he did not grow fat in laziness. Bethel means "the house of God". He recognised the house of God in his circuit; and at Gilgal he would recognise the judgment of God on man in the flesh -- he maintained that in his ministry. You will always find these features in a man who is with God. He will insist on the house of God, and in doing that he has to see that it is not simply local, it is universal, it includes *all* the saints; and he will insist on the judgment of the flesh.
Rem. He goes out from Bethel carrying the principles of the house of God.
J.T. Yes; the principles of the house of God are maintained really in the visit to Gilgal. Because
{41}
you do get encouragement among the saints in serving them, but then you have to be careful lest you become elated; therefore you go to Gilgal. And so you see it is "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts" (@Zechariah 4: 6). To the apostle He says, "My power is perfected in weakness" (@2 Corinthians 12: 9).
Ques. What is the significance of the stone being set between Mizpah and Shen, and called Eben-ezer?
J.T. The word Eben-ezer means, 'hitherto hath the Lord helped us'. How beautiful it is to see that a man of such power as Samuel does not attribute anything to himself; it is all what God is doing. One could understand that Samuel would love to have that stone near to the centre of his operations.
I think Mizpah would institute a new beginning. There is no command what to do. It was on Samuel's own initiative, but evidently God was with him in it.
Rem. It was wonderful that he could say what he did, when the ark had not come back.
J.T. Yes, a brother might come to him and say, Well, Samuel, you seem to have, got something of your own, you do not recognise tradition, you do not recognise the fathers. But, Samuel says, look at that stone; God is with us! If God is with us, what can be said? There was abundant evidence that He was with Israel now -- *the Philistines were subdued*.
Rem. The Lord is here dealing with the enemies in a public way; you were directing attention to the fact that previously He had been dealing with them in a secret way.
J.T. Yes; now He is thundering on them. What can you do in the presence of thunder? It is overwhelming! So there is the complete defeat of the Philistines. And that is what Samuel recognises. If anybody questions the new movement, he could say, Well, there is the power, and who can deny it?
{42}
Ques. What would you say would be a corresponding indication in our day?
J.T. The power of God is the great thing. Of course you have the doctrine, but the convincing thing is the power of God, and you cannot get away from that.
P.L. You find that illustrated in Stephen. They could not withstand the power with which he spoke, and he was bringing in what was new.
J.T. Quite so; and his face was like that of an angel. They could not contend with him; they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.
Now the last -of the places mentioned in the circuit, that our brother has called attention to, is Ramah. That is where Samuel's house was. He judged Israel where his house was. One's house has to be right for this. I suppose Ramah signifies elevation. I think it is an allusion to what is morally elevated in what is specially the Lord's own immediate circle. It says, "there he built an altar to Jehovah". So you have an order of things there in which God is fully owned. Samuel's altar at Ramah would indicate the place God had with him. If Samuel's house had not been in order, he could not have gone round on circuit.
Rem. It says, "There was peace between Israel and the Amorites". It reminds one of @Proverbs 16: 7: "When a man's ways please Jehovah, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him".
{43}
THE GRACE OF THE PRESENT DISPENSATION
@Luke 4: 33, 34; 5: 1 - 11
I am impressed at this time with the grace of the present dispensation; the grace in which God, through the Lord Jesus Christ, presents the testimony in this our era; and it is my desire that you all may be impressed with it. Luke is specially intended to convey this grace to us. It is he who tells us (quoting the Lord), that the glad tidings should be preached to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem; and in that statement is wrapt up the grace to which I have alluded. Further, he tells us that the apostles who should present the gospel, were to tarry in the city of Jerusalem until they would be clothed with power from on high. I need not say they were equal to the clothing that would descend upon them; they were not babes; heaven knew their measure; and as having grown up under the influence and culture of the Lord, they were equal in their constitution and growth to the heavenly clothing.
You will remember how the mantle of Elijah fell from him as he ascended into heaven; and Elisha, the vessel through whom the testimony was to be set forth, took it up, and, rending his own garment, appropriated it. He had been under Elijah's tutorship, and he recognised that the clothes which he had worn while at school would not be suitable when he faced the sphere of his testimony here; so he takes up Elijah's mantle, and appropriates it. The disciples had been, so to speak, at school. I think it is well for young people to consider this matter. Young Levites were permitted to enter upon a sort of apprenticeship at the age of twenty-five years, but they were not to take up their levitical work strictly
{44}
until they attained the age of thirty; then it was that the clothing suitable for public service was put on. Even our Lord Jesus Christ led the way in this, for, though perfect in every stage here, the heavens were opened on Him at the age of thirty, and the Holy Spirit came down in the bodily form- of a dove, and abode upon Him; and it was in that garment, so to say, He went forth to testify, and this chapter tells us that He returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit.
So, correspondingly, His disciples whom He had taught were to tarry in the city of Jerusalem until clothed with power from on high. They were not morally inferior to the clothes. You will remember, when Peter stood up, how beautifully they sat upon him. On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down in the form of cloven tongues as of fire, and sat upon each of them. Each one would therefore be conscious of what had come down. And if the Holy Spirit sat on each there would be that deliberation, that restfulness, which is befitting levitical work. Peter stands up with the eleven, and in his heavenly clothing he presents the glad tidings. It is the only clothing becoming to a servant of Christ. We may see around us people wearing religious habiliments, but they are not in keeping with the heavenly garments. Heavenly garments alone befit the message that is to be presented. And so, reverting to our Lord as having received the Holy Spirit, Luke tells us that He descended in a bodily form upon Him pointing to the fact that the Spirit did not come in part, but in entirety. Think of the grace and power wrapt up in the presence of the Holy Spirit in that bodily way!
This is the dispensation of all dispensations, in the mind of God. The Holy Spirit has come in in His entirety; a divine Person has come in, and the testimony is to be presented in its fulness, and in all
{45}
the grace and power involved in the presence of the Spirit. Our Lord Jesus Christ being divine, being equal with the Father, was alone equal to such clothing. Coming in at Pentecost, the Holy Spirit sat on each of the hundred and twenty. It was a collective idea, but each one was taken account of. Whereas the Holy Spirit came in a bodily form on our Lord, and only on Him in a bodily form.
It is in taking these things in, dear brethren, that we get some idea of the initial presentation of the testimony in the gospel.
So, in keeping with what I have been saying, the Lord is seen in the synagogues, in this evangelist. He, of course, is also seen operating in the synagogues in the other evangelists, but pre-eminently in Luke you will find Him there. And I wish to show that His operations are carried on in relation to men in this world, first in the religious sphere, then in the domestic sphere, and finally in the business sphere.
Now I dwell on the religious sphere first. What you find in this evangelist is that the Lord returns into Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and He came to Nazareth where He was brought up, and entered into the synagogue. I mention this point about the synagogue because it represents man in his religious relations; and these religious relations were hostile. It is in that connection that you see the grace to which I have alluded.
The Lord invades the religious sphere, notwithstanding its known hostility. You will remember that the sequel to the first synagogue visit was that all that were in it were enraged; not as they came out of it, but in it. Was the Lord not aware of the innate opposition to Him in the religious world? He was; but nevertheless He went into the synagogue according to His custom. He would invade the religious sphere; He would show the magnitude of the grace that overcame the murderous opposition that existed
{46}
in the religious sphere. Notwithstanding that opposition, He brings out and establishes the dispensation in its religious features in the synagogue in Nazareth.
And what I would remark is that whatever exercises there may be about the religious world, we must bear in mind that God operates in it; that He has got a right to operate in it; that it is in keeping with the dispensation that He should operate in it, and that His operation in it is the very expression of the grace of the dispensation. So you find that in the synagogue there is a Bible. I thank God for the presence of the Bible. If I were to go into a Turkish mosque I should not find a Bible there; if I were to go into a pagan temple in China there would be no Bible there; but in many of the so-called churches of this country, and of Europe, there are Bibles; and surely we should thank God for those Bibles. For the placing of Bibles in such places could not be attributed to the enemy; the open Bible in Europe is not the work of the enemy, it is the work of God. It involved tremendous conflict to obtain liberty that the Bible should be appointed to be read in churches. Is it nothing that it is read there? It is indeed otherwise. I do not propose to read it in churches, but nevertheless the Bible is there, and the Bible is read, and where the Bible is read God can operate, and He does operate. He is greater than the op position of the religious system.
And so it says they handed Him the Scriptures. He did not bring a Bible in as far as we can see, there was one there. And He stood up for to read, and found the place where it was written, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me". Think of that! There was in the synagogue that which witnessed to, Christ. "He found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me to preach to captives deliverance,
{47}
and to the blind sight, to send forth the crushed delivered, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord" (@Luke 4: 17 - 19). Was that not wonderful! *He* read it. The passage had never been read before like that; doubtless it had been often read before, but never like that. And then He sat down; as if He was inaugurating the dispensation. He sat down, having read that text; it was selected by Himself as governing the dispensation. You cannot limit that text; it may be read anywhere; and wherever it is read, God is with the reading. It does not appear there were any results, but there was a *testimony*. Thank God for the testimony! He sat down and began to say to them, "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears". If not in their hearts, it was fulfilled in their ears. There was a testimony. God is wondrously interested in His testimony. Presently they were enraged, because He spoke the truth. Nevertheless there was a testimony.
Well, now, He spoke to them, and as they listened to His words they were enraged, "and rising up they cast him forth out of the city, and led him up to the brow of the mountain on which their city was built, that they might throw him down the precipice". How dreadful to contemplate the innate opposition there is to Christ in the religious world! But God is greater than the opposition, and in His grace rises above man's wickedness, and continues the testimony.
Then the Lord comes to Capernaum, and again enters a synagogue, and now He finds a man with an unclean demon. Think of that in a synagogue! In the official religious meeting place, as you may say, of the town, there is a man with an unclean demon. The Lord rebukes the demon. The grace of God, you see, moves on in its majesty from synagogue to synagogue. And the demon comes out, and he comes out without hurting the poor man! Such is the gracious consideration of God, that the demon is
{48}
ejected, and no harm accrues to the man. You see how complete is the power in the hands of God. The man is unharmed, and he is relieved of the unclean demon. Now such is the presentation of grace in the religious world. I dwell upon it because I see and find in my own heart the tendency to narrowness, to limit the operations of God. God is operating; He is operating everywhere. You may say, Why don't we go to these places? The answer is very simple -- the servant has to obey; and I should not go to these places. What the Master may do is another matter. He has got rights; He has got ways and means. The servant's part is to do what he is told to do. "Obedience is better than sacrifice, Attention than the fat of rams" (@1 Samuel 15: 22). We may not be able to cope with the murderous hostility that exists in these systems, but the Lord can, and He can rescue the souls of men notwithstanding those conditions, and He is doing it.
I next touch on the domestic sphere. And here we do not find the same opposition. I have no difficulty about going into any family, if the door be open. The Lord left the synagogue, we are told, and entered into Simon's house, who was potentially a great servant, but this fact was only known to the Lord at the moment, and his wife's mother was taken with a great fever. There can be no doubt that the enemy had an eye on Peter at this early stage, and divine discipline doubtless required that there should be a person in his house in this state, for he was already in the school of God. The greater the service one has to enter upon, the greater the privilege, the greater the discipline; and the discipline in having a mother-in-law with a great fever in the house, would be considerable. It is a very serious matter beloved friends, when Satan can operate in our houses. She was not possessed with a demon; things are not so serious but nevertheless there was that there which
{49}
would preclude all peaceful and restful service Godward or manward. And it says that the Lord stood over her. It does not say He stood over the man in the synagogue, but He stood over the woman in Simon's house.
The secret, I believe, of all household difficulties lies in *insubjection*. And here is a Man with all divine authority vested in Him, standing over her. She never had such an experience as that before. Peter could not have stood over her with any measure of moral weight evidently, for he was not right himself. No one can have moral weight in his house until he learns to judge himself. No one can rule another until he learns to judge himself. He who rules his own spirit is greater than he who takes a city. But the Lord was here in holy subjection to God, and in Him was vested all the authority of God; and He stood over her, and rebuked the fever, and it left her. We need that, dear brethren. The Lord is operating in the domestic sphere, and what He would bring about is subjection. So the fever left her, and she stood up and served them. How immense was the help to Simon, that the Lord had brought in, in such a striking manner; the element of authority. The fever leaves her, and she stood up to serve. You have to stand up; it is no time for laziness; it is a time of service, and you have got to stand up.
Now, finally, I touch on the business sphere. In the next chapter there is great interest. The people are crowding to hear the word of God. There is very great interest in preaching at the present time, but is there anyone to present the testimony? One has the feeling that the businesses of the brethren are standing in the way, and the testimony suffers. You know business is a most insidious thing; it is usually entered on to make money; it may be in some cases to make a livelihood, but business usually opens up to moneymaking. And here are men in
{50}
business: Simon Peter, and James and John; they are partners. I suppose they would enlarge their business by entering into partnership. But the people were crowding on the Lord to hear the word of God; that which is of supreme interest to heaven -- the word of God. The people are hungering and thirsting for it. And the Lord enters into Simon's ship and He requests him that he would thrust out a little from the land; and He sat down and taught the people.
Teaching is a tedious matter; it is a matter that requires deliberation. By the space of three years Paul taught at Ephesus. Teaching requires deliberation; and the Lord Jesus *sat down* and taught the people. But in doing this He was within the radius of Peter's business affairs. Some would eliminate divine things from their business, making their business one thing, and the Lord's things another. But the Lord invades Peter's business affairs; He sat down and taught the word of God in Peter's boat.
If I am not right in my business affairs, I cannot be right in the house of God, nor can I have any part in the teaching; and this is the lesson Peter has to learn, if he is to be the great leader in the service. The Lord invaded Peter's business affairs when business was bad. There can be no doubt that mercy lies behind poor business. God has His own designs to work out through the depression of business. There were empty boats, but the owners of the boats were washing their nets. That is a good occupation -- washing your affairs. You know if you go into the business world, it is full of filth. The nets have to be washed; our business affairs have to be washed, and we have got to attend to the washing. Peter and his partners were doing that. So far so good! But there was more to be learned than the necessity of washing the business affairs, though that surely is important.
{51}
And now the Lord finished speaking. There is something very beautiful in the way Luke presents things. There is a time to finish speaking. Long addresses are not generally profitable. The Lord finished speaking, teaching the people lesson after lesson -- wonderful things! and now He would secure Peter. You know the Lord is seeking vessels to rightly represent the dispensation, and He was set on having Peter. He had him in His mind; Peter was long foreknown. And now the Lord is in his boat; and He says, "Let down your nets for a haul". And there is the humbling acknowledgement, "Having laboured through the whole night we have taken nothing". The Lord is going to secure Peter, but He would not take him away from a *bad* business.
It is a poor thing when a man relinquishes his business and goes into the Lord's service when trade is bad. It is a very questionable thing to do. But if you leave a prosperous business to do so, that is another matter. The Lord would give Peter the honour of entering on the service from a good business; and so He says, "Draw out into the deep water and let down your nets for a haul ... and having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes. And their net broke. And they beckoned to their partners who were in the other ship to come and help them, and they came, and filled both the ships, so that they were sinking". The partners were brought in; they had had a share in the small sales; now that they have become great they will share in the prosperity. It was a question of sharing everything! And now the servant is secured. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus knees. "Jesus knees" are peculiar to Luke. It is Luke who specially presents Jesus praying.
Now you may depend upon it, the Lord had been speaking to the Father about Peter. I do not know
{52}
of anything so encouraging as prayer. Brothers and sisters alike -- for they are all priests -- have access to God. How much may not be accomplished by an appeal even by one sister to God, to meet the situation! The Lord, according to this evangelist, was much occupied in prayer. Prayer governed everything, as one might say, and it governed Peter's confession; he fell down at Jesus knees. He would need those knees again; the Lord would pray for him again; he says, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord". But he was at Jesus knees. How we need the intercession of Christ as we discover our sinfulness! But the work was done; he had found out that he was a sinful man in his business affairs.
You know there are plenty of things that could be brought up in one's business affairs that would prove that one is sinful. Under no circumstances will a man be proved a sinner more easily than in his business affairs. And so in Peter's affairs he is convicted of being a sinful man. In whatever way he sinned his sinfulness had shown itself, and it was now all out; whether he had been unfair to his partners or not I do not know. But anyway the thing was now out, and he falls down at Jesus knees; he is a sinful man. It is a wonderful thing to come to that. We can never be here as descriptive of the dispensation until we come to that -- until we have learned our sinfulness. And Jesus said to him, "Fear not; henceforth thou shalt be catching men". Is there anyone here who would aspire to that? The Lord, I believe, is looking for such. The need abroad is great, yet God will not take us up in order to meet it, save as we are clothed with power from on high. And for that we have got to discover that we are sinful men. And then that precious word, "Fear not;" He says, "thou shalt be catching men". He will enable you to do it, for it will be the Lord's own work.
{53}
And so Peter is affected, and the partners are affected. For if God causes His light to come into our business affairs, everybody will be affected, and first of all the partners -- James and John. And they pull their boats ashore, and leave all -- leave *all*! And they followed Jesus! That is the word, dear brethren; leaving all, they followed Him! The Lord is beckoning to us. He would have followers; those who catch men. That is the way Luke puts things. Not in a time of depression, but in a time of excessive prosperity, they leave all, and follow Him. It is not that they despised the boat, or the fish; for they pulled the boats ashore. Somebody else can see to them; they were creatures of God, to be used ashore; but as for themselves, they followed Him!
The Lord is beckoning to us at the present time, calling attention to the need. But He insists on the qualification. He has means whereby He can carry on His work, but He would employ us. And if He is to employ us, there must be the qualification; there must be the complete surrender, and an acknowledgement of what we are; and then the clothing from on high of which I have spoken. But here it is the attractiveness of Christ. And they leave *all* and follow Him! May God help us to do so.
{54}
READING (4)
@I Samuel 8: 1 - 7; 12
J.T. We started with the circumstances that gave the occasion for the introduction of Samuel, and I think it would be helpful to consider the circumstances that caused the introduction of Saul. There was dissatisfaction with what God had approved in such a marked way, as the previous chapter indicated, and the dissatisfaction that had already existed found a convenient excuse in the misconduct of Samuel's sons. Chapter 12 shows that there was nothing in Samuel to furnish this excuse. They had to testify to his integrity from his youth till he became grey-headed. The dissatisfaction that shows itself against what God approves opens the door to the man after the flesh.
S.J.B.C. And I suppose the Lord goes to the root of the matter when He says, "they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them".
J.T. Yes; that was at the root of the matter.
Ques. Why, do you think, did they make Samuel's sons an excuse?
J.T. Because there was none other. If our wills are at work we are sure to find an excuse for what we do; and of course this was a very convenient excuse; there was misconduct, but it was not with Samuel.
Ques. Would you say that the cause for doing wrong things does not always appear on the surface? The Lord discerned what the real issue was here.
J.T. Yes; and the elders of Israel evidently fixed their minds on this plea, whereas the Holy Spirit would direct us to the root of the thing -- what the real issue was. The real issue was the state of
{55}
the people. The difficulty did not lie with Samuel. Of course his sons conduct was bad, but the real issue was the state of the people. Chapter 12 brings that out. Samuel waits, as that chapter shows, until they have had a little experience of Saul, to raise this issue, and to bring home to them what was underlying their suggestion to have a king.
S.J.B.C. Is there any moral thought in their request, "Now appoint us a king to judge us, like all the nations"?
J.T. Well, it goes with their general state; they would drop down to the level of other nations, overlooking the fact that they were infinitely superior in their king. It was Jehovah they were dispossessing.
P.L. Was the "shout of a king" among them heard in Samuel's ministry?
J.T. There was power with Samuel personally; there was no rising up against him. He judged Israel all the days of his life, notwithstanding what they said. The "shout of a king" (@Numbers 23: 21), is really more important in a way than the king. You may have the king without the shout. In Saul there was not the shout of the king; the power of God was with Samuel.
Ques. Have we got a similar thought in Miriam and Aaron complaining against Moses, using as an excuse his marriage with an Ethiopian woman?
J.T. That is a very similar case. What lay at the bottom of that was jealousy.
Ques. Would it be right to suggest that Samuel's house was not in order?
J.T. The fact is stated that his sons conduct was reprehensible. But then chapter 12 shows that *his* conduct was not reprehensible. He challenged Israel; and he represented God; his sons did not.
Rem. Hosea reviews the situation: "O Israel, thou that art against me, against thy help. Where then
{56}
is thy king that he may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes? I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath" (@Hosea 13: 9 - 11).
J.T. Exactly; that is the comment of the Spirit later on this event.
Rem. Yes; both the comment of the Spirit, and the lesson to be learnt from it.
J.T. What it all points to is that the danger of the dispensation is to quarrel with what God may be using, and with what God may be approving. That is a serious matter; quarrelling with the position in which there is evidently the power of God. The earlier circumstances, that is to say, the circumstances in relation to Eli and his house, was the opposite of this. There was no evidence of the power of God with Eli or his house. The ark was taken. There was the observance of externals; thinking that the ark itself, as a mere symbol, would save them in such a manner as is described in the earlier chapters. So that, if in a general way God is with His people in any locality, it is a most serious thing to interfere with the regime as it stands. There may be weakness, and there may be mistakes, but it is for us to discover whether God is there with His people, notwithstanding. God goes a long way with His people.
Ques. How are we to understand the fact that Samuel made his sons judges over Israel?
J.T. I think there was a recognition with Samuel of the natural. Who is there that is perfect save One? We see in Samuel how he mourned for Saul after God had rejected him; and we also see how he mistook Eliab for Jehovah's anointed. But, notwithstanding these defects, God was with him, and that is what we have to go by. If God is with a man, it is a serious thing to question him.
Rem. There should have been faith with the
{57}
people that God would continue His regime. Instead of that, they said Samuel was getting old.
J.T. God could raise up another. Samuel was getting old, but he was still there.
Ques. What does it mean, to judge Israel?
J.T. To deal with everything that arises, according to God. It does not mean punitive judgment. When the Lord was brought before the high priest, one of the officers which stood by struck Him, because they thought He was railing on the high priest. But He said, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?" (@John 18: 23). He was not defending Himself, He was asserting judgment where judgment should have been, but where it was not. The high priest represented the position of a judge, but he was wanting in judgment; judgment was not there. And so Micah says, "They shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek" (@Micah 5: 1). The Judge of Israel was at the bar externally; He was enunciating judgment. And that is the principle we get in Judges and in Samuel. Samuel refers in chapter 12 to the raising up of Moses and Aaron, and Jerubbaal, and Bedan and Jephthah and himself, to meet the situation. It is one of the greatest principles, really, in the maintenance of the testimony, that there should be the elements of judgment, because things are constantly arising requiring judgment. So the Lord asserts it in the presence of the high priest: "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?" *He* was the Judge of Israel.
S.J.B.C. Many have a wrong conception of judgment, as though it meant punishment. Judgment would mean discrimination, or discernment.
P.L. He uses the balance of the sanctuary, and weighs things before the Lord. Is that a feature of manhood?
J.T. Quite so. The first great judge in Israel
{58}
was Othniel; a man who was eminently qualified to judge and to make war. Then after him Ehud was raised up, a Benjaminite, and a left-handed man. He judged on the principle of the word of God, which the two-edged dagger would represent.
Ques. Would you say the elders of Israel were wrong in taking the judgment into their hands?
J.T. You see they were quarrelling with what existed. They gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and said to him, "Behold, thou art become old", etc. They had grounds for quarrelling with the sons of Samuel, but they had no grounds for quarrelling with Samuel. And whatever he had done in appointing his sons, *he* had judged Israel in a circuit. So notwithstanding his sons misconduct they might have reckoned on Samuel. We do not need to think of tomorrow's requirements; it is what we have got now that should engage us.
S.J.B.C. There are those who have got spiritual discrimination, who act on God's behalf.
J.T. I think an analysis of the judges in Israel will indicate what should mark us in judgment. Take a man like Ehud, for example; he was left-handed, but he had a dagger which had two edges, and he used it with great dexterity. One needs to recognise how to use the word of God with skill. And then Shamgar judged on the principle of an ox-goad, which would indicate experience. A goad is to keep you in cheek, to keep you within the harness, so that you do not take any licence in what you are doing, you are kept within limits. As Paul says, "I buffet my body" (@1 Corinthians 9: 27). One has to know how to keep oneself in subjection. And so he gained a great victory.
And then Deborah; she was a prophetess, and a woman who sat under her *own* palm tree. She had evidently gained the victory over herself. She had acquired great moral weight, which overcame the
{59}
great disadvantage of her sex. She did not assert her position; they *came to her* for judgment. So no matter who it is who has acquired victory, and sits under his own palm tree, people seek him out, because of these qualities. Deborah sent for Barak, and said to him, "Hath not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded?" (@Judges 4: 6). It is a question of what God's commandments are, in her mind.
Then Gideon; he was a man who threshed wheat in a winepress, to secure it from the Midianites. God will use such a man. An angel of Jehovah came and sat under the terebinth that was in Ophrah, as if to take a note of what there was in the locality; this young man was occupied in threshing wheat in the winepress. It was in a winepress, but the wheat was threshed and kept from the Midianites. "And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him, and said to him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valour" (@Judges 6: 12). He was a remarkable expression of Christ in judgment; a man who could appease his brethren when they quarrelled with him; he says, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer?" (@Judges 8: 2). That is the kind of man!
Well, all these features have got to be linked up together, in order to see what judgment is. And I believe they were all linked up in Samuel. So Israel was found quarrelling with what God had brought in.
Rem. One is struck with the attitude of Samuel; he prayed to the Lord, he had a resource. Naturally it would be very humiliating for one who was a prophet, known from Dan to Beersheba, to be set aside thus.
J.T. It was a very great test for him.
Rem. One thinks of the words of the apostle Paul, "the arms of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful according to God to the overthrow of strongholds; overthrowing reasonings and every
{60}
high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God" (@2 Corinthians 10: 4, 5).
J.T. Samuel does not quarrel with the people. Who could deal with the matter but Jehovah? for the movement was against Him. And so he prays; he had gone to the root of the matter. "And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them ... . testify solemnly unto them, and declare unto them the manner of the king that shall reign over them". So in the subsequent part of the chapter Samuel goes over the features of the king. God mercifully forewarns them that he would be a man who would think only of himself, and would take their sons, and their daughters, and their fields and their vineyards. He would think only of himself; that is the kind of character he bears. Very well, they say in effect, we will run the risk of that; and at the end of the chapter the people refused to hear the voice of Samuel, and they said, "No, but there shall be a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations; and our king shall judge us, and go out before us, and conduct our wars". You see how completely self-centred they were, and their king would be like them. The conditions existing were such as would expose them to the rule of the flesh; and God mercifully outlines what they may expect.
Rem. God gave them a king after *their* hearts, before He brought in a king after *His* heart.
J.T. Just so; He gave them a taste of what the man after the flesh is, before He brought in His king. So in the next chapter we have Saul. There he is, a fine-looking man! There is not a comelier person in all Israel. Surely they may have said, We are justified now in desiring a man like this; he has ability, and he is just what we want! In a wide
{61}
way it is typical of what obtains in the whole of Christendom today.
P.L. If one attaches importance to the meaning of names, Samuel means 'asked of *the Lord*', but Saul means 'asked *for*' simply.
Rem. The man after the flesh is described here that we might take it to heart as a warning, and not set aside what God has provided.
J.T. There may be great weakness, but you have what God has provided, and you do not set that aside; otherwise you just drop down to the level of the religion around you.
Saul's lineage is given, and from his shoulders up, his head and his neck, he exceeded all others; there was not a man to equal him all around.
Rem. Plenty of *head* knowledge!
J.T. Just so. Well, the record is proceeded with, and the first thing is that the asses are lost, and Saul is looking for them. As a man after the flesh he is a comely person, but as a spiritual man he is discredited from the very beginning. The asses are gone, and *he* cannot find them. A man of God is never puzzled; he knows what to do. And Saul's servant knew more than he did. Then Saul began to think about his father's anxiety, and he said, "Come and let us return". But his servant said, "Behold now, *a man of God* is in this city". I do not know that Saul had ever used the expression "man of God", that would not be in his vocabulary. "And", the servant continued, "the man is held in honour; all that he says comes surely to pass. Let us now go thither: perhaps he will show us the way that we should go". Saul did not seem to know anything about Samuel. His servant knew very much more than he did of what was of God.
S.J.B.C. Yet in Saul was there not a great deal commendable to start with? When the people came together to Mizpah, when the king was to be selected,
{62}
Saul hid himself among the baggage, and he had to be fetched out.
J.T. Well, but we have to notice there are these touches that God gives for the spiritual mind to discern. So far as the natural man is concerned, what you are referring to would no doubt be greatly esteemed. It is, however, quite evident that Saul's servant was much further on, spiritually, than he.
Rem. Although Saul was the son of a wealthy man, he had nothing to bring to the man of God, not even as much as a quarter of a shekel.
J.T. Yes. He says, "What shall we bring the man?" He says, "What have we?" And the servant answered Saul again and said, "Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver". The servant *had* something.
P.L. And he would not trust it to Saul; he says, "That will I give to the man of God".
J.T. And Saul said to his servant, "Well said". That does not go very far; to say it is a good remark does not count for very much. However, he adopted the servant's suggestion. But see how the man after the flesh is exposed! The natural mind might not see anything in these incidents, but they are set down here to show that the man after the flesh is discredited from the very outset.
Ques. What about the asses?
J.T. Well, they were lost. You see there was a discrepancy even then. Why should they have been lost if Saul had been diligent? And even after a search he fails to find them. They *were* found, but not by Saul.
And "As they went up the ascent to the city, they met maidens going forth to draw water; and they said to them, Is the seer here?" One might point out that verse 9 is a parenthesis in which we are told that "In former time in Israel, when a man went to ask counsel of God, he said, Come and let us go to
{63}
the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was in former time called a Seer". The change from seer to prophet would indicate a better spiritual apprehension of the features of a prophet. So they asked the maidens, "Is the seer here? And they answered them and said, He is; behold, he is before thee: make haste now, for he came today to the city". You see, they knew the meaning of the word 'seer'. They were spiritual. It was a great matter that there should be a prophet in that town. He was a man that was noted. These young women were interested and intelligent; they knew the seer, and they knew where he was, and they knew what he was doing. But all this was evidently foreign language to Saul; he was not accustomed to these things.
Rem. The maidens were evidently intimate with the movements of Samuel.
J.T. Just so; they knew the great gain of a visit, because they go on to say, "He is before thee: make haste now, for he came today to the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place", etc. Now just analyse that speech from a spiritual standpoint, and see how much these young women understood; how thoroughly they were in the understanding of what was going on on the part of God in that city at that time.
Rem. Saul did not seem to have had much thought about the seer up to that moment.
J.T. And I think it is very interesting to see in Saul's servant, and in these young maidens, how God works in what might appear to be insignificant people.
Ques. Would you say that the people recognised the power of Samuel when they said him, "Cease not to cry to Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines"? (@1 Samuel 7: 8).
J.T. I think so. But I think it is important that we should take notice of these particular touches
{64}
whereby we can discern whether the man who may be coming forward into prominence is spiritual or not. If you have got your eyes open, something will come about which will enable you to tell whether he is really on spiritual or on fleshly lines.
Rem. The apostle says in @2 Corinthians 11: 2, 3 "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, so your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ". He feared lest they might be going on in a wrong way.
P.L. It is interesting to notice the difference in the words which God speaks to Samuel concerning Saul and David; in @chapter 9: 17, when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said, "Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee! this man shall rule over my people". But then in @chapter 16: 12, 13, when David is brought in before Samuel (he was ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance), "Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he. And Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren".
J.T. As a matter of fact, a king according to God is born. And so we have the king in the book of Ruth born before you have anything of this. Also in the New Testament, we read: "Where is the king of the Jews that has been born?" (@Matthew 2: 2). He is anointed afterwards. And in @John 18: 37, in answer to Pilate's question, "Thou art then a king?" the Lord says, "Thou sayest it, that I am a king, I have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth". He was born a King.
S.J.B.C. Saul was anointed out of a *vial*, which would be of human manufacture, and suggestive of the human element which would have set him up as a king; but David was anointed with a *horn*, which
{65}
may very likely have been obtained from an animal offered in sacrifice to God.
Rem. These principles come close home to us, do they not?
J.T. That is what one would have in mind, that we might see how to guard against the man after the flesh, and his influence, and be content with what God approves. Of course you do not want to condone the conduct of Samuel's sons, nor even of Samuel himself in appointing them judges over Israel. It was a very convenient excuse the elders offered, and doubtless the people would be carried by it.
Ques. What is the thought in the seer?
J.T. A seer is a man who *sees* things. A prophet is a man who conveys the mind of God. Of course he sees things, but more than that, he conveys the mind of God and brings God to the conscience of the people. Samuel conveys the idea of a prophet in his ministry.
S.J.B.C. And in Samuel we have the thought of intimacy; he "heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the ears of Jehovah", (@chapter 8: 21. It seems to indicate personal intimacy with the Lord.
J.T. Yes. And now in chapter 9 you have the wondrous grace of God taking up Saul, and helping him in every possible way, so that he might have every advantage, and that the desire of the people might be fully tested. He obtains light from the prophet; he is anointed, and kissed, and God sets him on his way with every possible advantage; so that there should be no mistake in our judgment of the man after the flesh. There is nothing to be expected from the flesh. With all possible help it is an utter breakdown. So it is better to be with Samuel and his failing sons. Now this occurs every day; conditions arise that give an opening to man after the flesh, and the result is what we see in Saul.
{66}
Ques. Is it on this line that antichrist will be received?
J.T. Just so. The door is open for him through conditions in the world.
P.L. Gaius and Demetrius are approved; they rejected the Saul element; 3 John.
Ques. Referring to the present time, would you say that Samuel and his failing sons suggest an abnormal state?
J.T. Yes; but it is not irremediable. God can come in and meet a situation like that. So it is much better to go on, and give God the opportunity to come in and deal with it. The Holy Spirit tells us that Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. Thus God had His way in His servant, in spite of the people's attitude.
P.L. Saul's servant, and the maidens, did not seem overwhelmed by any lack in Samuel!
Rem. Samuel is still in Ramah, while his sons judge Israel.
J.T. Yes. He was not on the level of his sons; he was in his own house, where he had his altar. The elders ignore this.
Rem. In these instructions given to Saul there would not be any mention of the man after the flesh?
J.T. Well, you see it was still a tentative time. God was still testing man; and I think these advantages spoken of in chapter 10 show that God would set him out with every possible advantage. And that only brings out how hopeless the flesh is.
P.L. Does it not also suggest the last overtures of God through Christ to Israel? I was thinking of the grace in which the Lord waited upon Israel.
J.T. Yes, quite so. If there was no fruit, the tree was still there; and the vinedresser says, "Let it alone for this year also, until I shall dig about it and put dung, and if it shall bear fruit -- but if not, after that thou shalt cut it down" (@Luke 13: 8, 9).
{67}
Rem. When they went to look for Saul when the, king was being selected, he had hidden himself.
J.T. Yes. You do not see anything like this in David. It is all of the flesh. Hiding amongst the baggage suggests the backwardness of the flesh, which is of no value at all -- no more than the forwardness of it.
Ques. What would the king suggest? It says here, in verse 16, he was to save the people.
J.T. He was to represent God in His supreme authority. For this he should be like God. David typified Christ in this respect. See @2 Samuel 23: 3, 4.
Ques. Would the shoulder and what was on it, which was set before Saul to eat, be suggestive as to whether he would be able to sustain the people for God?
J.T. I think so; it was food that a king needed.
Rem. In @chapter 9: 13 we read, "For the people eat not until he [Samuel] has come, because he blesses the sacrifice; afterwards they eat that are invited".
J.T. That is what the maidens say; showing that they knew what marked occasions like this. They would not eat till he came, because he blessed the sacrifice. And then those that are bidden eat. The prophet, as representative of God, being there, the occasion was an auspicious one, and these maidens were in the spirit of it.
Ques. Although things are in a weak state, is there not power available, that the man of God should be according to God?
J.T. Certainly. And then also what existed under Samuel was not beyond remedy. So that there was really no cause for asking for a change. It is these changes and revolutions that are so dangerous; because if things are not right, God can put them right. Let us not take it into *our* hands to do so.
{68}
P.L. Would you say that the scripture in @Ecclesiastes 10: 4 applies: "If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for quietness pacifieth great offences"?
J.T. I think so.
Rem. Gideon said, "Jehovah will rule over you" (@Judges 8: 23).
J.T. Yes; they wanted to make *him* king. Chapter 12 brings out all this, for Samuel would not let the people off; there was a great lesson to be learnt, and they had had experience of Saul. So Samuel comes, and he says to the people, "Come and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there" (@1 Samuel 11: 14). He would bring them all down there, because it is there that you learn things in the light of God; it is there that self-judgment is customary. "And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed peace-offerings before Jehovah. And there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced exceedingly" (verse 15).
And now Samuel seizes the opportunity to bring all the light of chapter 12 to bear on them. All had been going well with them evidently; they were so far in keeping with Gilgal; but he would go to the bottom of things, for the lesson has to be learnt. I think this chapter shows that we shall reap the bitter fruits of our sowing as we are governed by our wills. God will not let us off; He loves us too well to allow us to miss the lesson of it.
So Samuel says, "Behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all that ye said to me, and have made a king over you. And now behold, the king walks before you; and I am old and grey-headed; and behold, my sons are with you;" he is not hiding his sons, or what they were. And he says, "I have walked before you from my youth up to this day". They were thus brought face to face with what God
{69}
had provided, and also with what they themselves had provided. And he says, "Here I am: testify against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I injured? or of whose hand have I received any ransom and blinded mine eyes therewith?" One is reminded of Paul's address to the elders from Ephesus in @Acts 20. Samuel has the people before God, and they own that there is nothing in him, no justification at all for having asked for the change; it was their own will. And they are to learn now the fruits of their own will.
God will not let us off when we open a door for the flesh by being discontented under what He has provided; we shall reap the fruits of it. Samuel had been ill-treated by them, but he is not really concerned about that, he is concerned about Jehovah -- how did all this affect God? And so he continues: "It is Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt". He brings in God, and all that God had been to them. So that it was an opportunity to learn not only the bitter fruits of their own will, but also what God had been to them from the outset.
P.L. Does not the Lord in His rejection speak somewhat similarly? The works that He had done for the Father bore witness; @John 5: 36.
J.T. Yes; and again, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" (@John. 5: 17).
This chapter is the climax of the instruction to be gained from bringing in Saul. This is the chapter for the people, that they should profit by the exercises, profit by their failure, and see what God had been to them from the very outset.
{70}
READING (5)
@1 Samuel 16: 1 - 13; 18: 1 - 21
J.T. This morning we looked at the circumstances that were the occasion of the introduction of Saul, the man after the flesh. There had been dissatisfaction with God's provision in Samuel, and the people would have a king; they found a convenient excuse for their request in the misconduct of Samuel's sons, whom he had appointed judges in Israel. So they asked for a king, that they might be like all the nations around.
It was pointed out that Samuel had been asked for *from the Lord*, as his name indicates; whereas Saul was just 'asked for'. And it was pointed out, further, that God gave them a king in His anger, and took him away in His wrath; (@Hosea 13: 11). David was not asked for, he was *God's own* provision, without any solicitations from the people; "Jehovah", Samuel says, "has sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah has appointed him ruler over his people" (@1 Samuel 13: 14). So that David is neither the result of spiritual solicitations from any of the people, as was Samuel, nor fleshly solicitations, as was Saul; he is *God's own* provision, a man after God's own heart.
Ques. Is he in that way a peculiar type of the Lord?
J.T. Yes. I think God had His own affection for the people. Samuel was a wonderful provision for them, but he is not said to have been a man after God's own heart. So in considering this we are in the presence, not of human exercises, whether spiritual or fleshly, but of divine exercise, which lifts the matter to a higher level. Think of divine desires!
Rem. You were saying that one of the first things
{71}
recorded in connection with Saul was the lost asses. It is, I think, interesting to notice that David had been minding sheep in the wilderness, but when he left them, he left a keeper in charge of them.
J.T. Yes. Those are spiritual touches which the natural eye would not observe, but the spiritual eye takes account of them. They mark off a man after God's own heart. The Lord said, "Those thou hast given me I have guarded, and not one of them has perished, but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled" (@John 17: 12).
In chapter 13 the first great breakdown of Saul was that he could not wait for Jehovah with patience. He said, "I forced myself". He had been directed to go to Gilgal, and wait there. Saul offered up the burnt-offering, and this brought about the remark of Samuel, "Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God which he commanded thee". God rejected him; he had proved himself unfit in that he could not wait. But in order to bring out fully what the flesh is, God directed him to exterminate the Amalekites.
S.J.B.C. Saul had waited the set time?
J.T. But Samuel had said to him, Wait until I come to thee. It is "until I come" that tests us.
P.L. The Psalmist says, "I waited patiently for Jehovah" (@Psalm 40 1). One looks to be kept in waiting, and to wait in the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so. "I waited *patiently* for Jehovah".
Ques. Would the test in the first case be dependence, and in the second obedience?
J.T. I think patience enters into both. He had transgressed the word of the Lord in that he did not wait. I think that the first shows the impetuosity of the flesh, which is often apparent in young brethren. Thus we are disqualified; it is in little things one shows where one is spiritually.
Ques. In what way?
{72}
J.T. In not being able to wait for the Lord. You take things into your own hands and attempt to settle them yourself. That was what Saul did. He forced himself; he said the Philistines were upon him, and he had no other course. But he was leaving God out, and thus he disqualified himself. The second test is as to whether he can deal with the flesh in its entirety, or whether he discriminates in favour of what he considered good in it. He destroyed everything that was bad or wretched, but he saved what was good in the Amalekites, including the king.
S.J.B.C. The first is more in the nature of a secret test. Chapter 15 is more public. He failed in secret. I think there is a principle in it, there is always failure in secret before there is exposure in public.
J.T. In the introduction of David we are in the presence of divine exercises; and that becomes a theme of great and precious interest. What is going on in the heart of *God*? What is *He* thinking about? And now what comes out is that He has not only David in His heart, but He wants to have a feminine response. We have nothing about the female side in Samuel; nothing about his wife, nothing about Saul's wife; they are not in sight, but a great deal is made of David's marital relations. So Samuel is to proceed to Bethlehem with a *heifer*. We are in the presence now of a potential subjective result.
S.J.B.C. I think you said at Los Angeles that the heifer signifies what is subjective; it has to do with the female side.
J.T. I think so, leading up to feminine affection.
Rem. Paul's great exercise was Christ and the assembly.
J.T. Yes, that is what he had before him. The epistle to the Ephesians presents to us the desires of the heart of God: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us
{73}
with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ; according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love;" and then he goes on to say: "having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself" (@Ephesians 1: 3 - 5. We are now in the presence of what God has been thinking about, altogether outside human exercises. No doubt He puts us, in His government, through certain things that would prepare us for this, and I think the lessons in this book would prepare us for what God has in mind and heart. How great a thing that the saints in any locality may be for God to work out what is in His mind! There are few localities that that could be said about. There was Ephesus in Paul's day.
Ques. Would you say it could be worked out now in any way?
J.T. Well, I do not think there is very much in the way of appreciation of divine thoughts and purposes; we are so necessarily occupied with our own state, and the difficulties that are arising, that there is very little liberty to enter into what God has before Him.
S.J.B.C. Is not that brought out in Ephesians, where the apostle writes of the intents and purposes of God? He could say, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ", etc., but when he comes to deal with the moral state of the saints, he gets down and prays.
J.T. I think, however, that at Ephesus there was a state exceeding most other localities. The apostle could speak of the "hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory: which none of the princes of this age knew (for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory)". And he goes on to speak about "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which
{74}
have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God" (@1 Corinthians 2: 7 - 10). It is no question of meeting their needs, but things *prepared* for them that love Him, and He has revealed them. So it is a question now of whether we are prepared to face the things from that point of view; what God has in His mind -- what He has prepared.
P.L. In the disciples there was a state capable of entering into these things.
J.T. Quite so; and I am sure they would be impressed as they listened. After He had spoken to them all that is recorded in @John 14, 15 and 16, the Lord lifts up His eyes to heaven. They would be prepared for it, and He would occupy them in His prayer with the glory that He had with the Father before the world was.
One feels how great is the incapacity to rise to what is in the divine mind for its own pleasure. And that is what David stands for.
Ques. Would you say there is a moral necessity for the earlier chapters?
J.T. Yes. Now there was in the people a moral state which would enable God to bring out the feminine result. So that you would have a man beautiful in appearance, and all Israel loved him -- David.
Rem. It is the Amalekite comes into view here, not the Philistine.
J.T. Yes, in chapter 15 it is the Amalekite; that is, the flesh through which Satan acts.
Rem. And God will make war with the flesh from generation to generation.
Ques. Would the epistle to the Romans give you the administration of Samuel, to bring the people into line with God's will? Colossians would be the true David, in the sense of being the head; he
{75}
becomes the loved object of affection. But souls must be brought into subjection first, otherwise they are apt to be diverted in following their own will.
J.T. So that Romans and Corinthians run together; the first bringing in subjection to Christ. You obey "from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed" (@Romans 6: 17). So you find at the end of Romans a list of worthies to confirm that. Then Corinthians is the authority of Christ recognised collectively. We have to learn to obey collectively. And then Colossians, as you say, is Christ as the Object of affection to the saints. Thus His personal greatness is presented.
Rem. So that you follow the object you love into the land of promise.
J.T. Exactly.
Ques. Have we to take to heart the length of time necessary to lead us over the necessary details? The Lord would delight to bring us into the richer and fuller things which He has in His heart for us.
J.T. Yes. Ministry directs you to what is in Him. Deuteronomy is a rsum of all that preceded, only with particular features of personal affection for the people, and motives to lead them to love Jehovah; it is to bring about obedience in the heart, not forced obedience. It is said of Moses that he was "king in Jeshurun" (@Deuteronomy 33: 5). That is a remarkable word; it means, I think, that Moses acquired a place in the affections of the people. Although he kept on enforcing the word of God, in time they gave him a place in their affections. You say that Jesus is Lord; but no one can say that truly except by the Spirit. I think it is in that way the Lord is enthroned in the heart. You say, "Lord Jesus" by the Spirit. He is enthroned in the heart; and that prepares us for Colossians, where you see that He is the Son of the Father's love, who created everything and was before everything. He personally controls you.
{76}
Ques. Would on say that the introduction of David would typify the introduction of the Spirit in contrast to the flesh?
J.T. It is the introduction of what is for God's own heart. You may have an ideal, and I may too, but think of what *God's* ideal is; a man after *His* heart!
Ques. Does the subjective state of the people find its expression in the thought of the woman as suggested by the heifer?
J.T. We are coming to that. God is laying the basis of that in the heifer. As having the spirit we may understand what is to be done here. He says, "Fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite". But first of all attention is called to Samuel. Great man as he was, he was still clinging to Saul; he was mourning for him. A man so distinguished as Samuel was, so spiritual, yet giving way to the natural-that is noted; and so God says, "How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?" Samuel has to be brought into line with what God was doing. And then God says, "Fill thy horn with oil". It was *Samuel's* horn. When anointing Saul, Samuel "took the vial of oil and poured it upon his head". Here we see that Samuel had a horn.
S.J.B.C. Is there a difference between a horn and a vial? Saul is anointed out of a vial, David out of a horn, and Solomon out of a horn in the tabernacle of the congregation. I suppose the latter would be a universal thought?
J.T. Yes; here it is, "Take *thy* horn".
Ques. What is your thought about that?
J.T. I think it would allude to Samuel's spirituality. The horn would no doubt be connected with death; it was "thy horn". As our brother has remarked, the vial was different, it was of human manufacture. The horn was the growth of a beast,
{77}
and possibly implied the death of the beast. For there could be no oil without that for any of us. Then the heifer, as we have remarked, would be the basis for a later development, which chapter 18 indicates. And what we may note is that Jonathan takes the lead in this. God specially mentions him. He was able to take the initiative even in Saul's day, when Saul reigned, before David was introduced, Jonathan took the initiative, and a great victory followed. He is specially distinguished, I think, by the Spirit, as giving the lead to those who should afterwards love David.
S.J.B.C. That is very nice; would you open it up a bit? he gave a lead.
J.T. Well, it is a help to have someone to do this. It is God's way in everything to give a lead. I suppose John gave a lead in the way of love for Christ in his day; and Paul in his day.
S.J.B.C. Jonathan's love was personal, was it not? We read that Saul loved David greatly. That is remarkable. I suppose it was the love of selfishness. And then Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him, which would suggest the love of admiration. And all Jerusalem loved him; that is the love of gratitude because he went out and came in before them. But Jonathan's love seemed to be personal -- he loved David for David's sake.
J.T. He loved David when he had ended speaking to Saul. His father had spoken to David in a supercilious way: "Whose son art thou, young man?" There was reproach in that, and David made no effort to cover it; he said, "I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite". And when he had ended speaking to Saul, it says, "The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul". It would appear that the grace and humility of David attracted him.
P.L. Would you say that would be a similar case
{78}
to the incident recorded in Luke's gospel, where the Lord addresses the supercilious man, Simon the Pharisee; @Luke 7?
J.T. Yes; I think there is a very good connection there. The woman became a model lover. If the Lord finds a lover He sets him out as a model. He said to Simon, "Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house; thou gavest me not water on my feet, but *she* has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair. Thou gavest me not a kiss, but *she* from the time I came in has not ceased kissing my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint, but *she* has anointed my feet with myrrh" (@Luke 7: 44 - 46). She is free before Him; He could call attention to her; and I believe that is what is so important in localities: the presence of someone who is a model. The Lord could appeal to that. It is the concrete thing before us. At Corinth it does not appear that there was anyone just like that; because the apostle has to speak about it in an abstract way; he does not speak of any person as expressing it there. But he speaks of what it is; lie is forced to do that.
Ques. Is it on the line of surrender?
J.T. That is what comes out in Jonathan; he disrobes himself and gives his robe to David, and his dress, "even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle". The Lord calls attention to the woman; how humbly, and in such self-sacrifice she expressed her love. It was expressed, too, in an adverse atmosphere; there was nothing to draw it out save Christ, nothing to enhance it. It was His Person that drew it out.
S.J.B.C. It was so in Jonathan. It was not the victory that drew out Jonathan's heart to David; it was when he had finished speaking to Saul. There had been something in the very tone of his voice that drew out Jonathan's love to him.
J.T. And then you see the women of Israel come
{79}
out to meet them, and they said, "Saul hath smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands". You see how God's thought is being developed in regard to David; He would have David, but He would have lovers of David, too. Well, that is the thing we ought to see all through, here. There is a mixed following at the outset. It is a transitional period. It was right that Saul should have some place, but the more you advance, the less Saul should be recognised.
Ques. Would the bringing in of David suggest the presentation of the Lord Jesus Christ in the gospel as one of affection?
J.T. Yes; I think the apostle Paul had that in his mind in all his preaching. He knew what was in the mind of God; he had knowledge of the mystery, and the saints were to understand this. He had the mind and the heart of God before him in his preaching. We have in Abigail the full development of this typically. But there is a good way to travel. We have to see now that love is progressing, first in Jonathan, then in the women, and then in all Israel. We see how Saul's hatred is aroused, and the extraordinary course he pursued to harm David. He proposes two wives for him, as if he would forestall the divine thought: first Merab, and then Michal who had a certain love for him. But in all his thoughts Saul has only hatred for David.
Ques. And does he not outwit himself? for Michal becomes in effect the saying of David.
J.T. She does; but nevertheless, as regards Saul, his object was to destroy David; and I think that it must allude to the public history of the church. The enemy saw that the thought of God was a bride for Christ. That came out in the mystery which was by revelation; and Paul had great combat for the Colossians that they might know the mystery; showing what opposition there was to it. And
{80}
Satan, seeing that Paul's ministry was blessed, and the church coming into being, devised, I believe, the Romish system and the Anglican system. The object of all this is to do harm to Christ.
Ques. You spoke of Samuel giving the lead; would you suggest that, following on that line, we should be separated from the house of Saul?
J.T. Yes. I think that Jonathan, though he loved David, yet later on really furnished material for what we are speaking of; he was really identified with that which would damage David, which is a very serious thing. I may be a lover of Christ, and *yet be identified with that which is damaging to Christ*. There are thousands in systems which are calculated to damage Christ, and they are strengthening them.
Ques. In what way would lovers of Christ move today?
J.T. Oh, we want to get back to the primary thought that we are to be identified with what is in the heart of God, namely, the mystery, the great thought of God; and that came in by revelation. That is the greatest thing in the dispensation. The epistles to Colossians and Ephesians are mainly occupied with it. Satan is ever against that. Every lover of Christ will give up everything that is damaging to Christ, however antiquated those things may be, for they were first of all intended to damage Christ.
Ques. What would you say about the women and their song here?
J.T. They would suggest to one the authors of *some* of the hymns. There is a great deal of Christ in them, but also a great deal of man after the flesh. There must be a pruning of all that is according to Saul. To have spiritual songs, that which appertains to Saul must be eliminated.
Ques. How do you account for lovers of Christ being in the systems and not knowing it?
{81}
J.T. There are a good many reasons. You see how, for instance, Jonathan was held by natural affections.
S.J.B.C. He was very slow to believe that Saul was as bad as he was; he spoke about sounding his father; chapter 20: 12. And I suppose some of us have sounded man in the flesh, to see if there was any good in him towards David.
J.T. Saul had already been well sounded; and Jonathan himself had said, "My father has troubled the land", and yet he clung to him.
Rem. Hannah had outlined all this in her song.
J.T. Yes; so that when you come to chapter 25 you have not a Merab nor a Michal, but a woman of a good understanding and of a beautiful countenance. And although related to Nabal by marriage, and a true wife as far as things went, she had a true judgment about him. That is where Jonathan missed it; he was related to Saul, but he did not judge Saul truly; whereas Abigail had true judgment about her husband Nabal, and his nature.
S.J.B.C. As regards Jonathan, I think perhaps he had thrown in his lot for a moment with David, until Saul cast a javelin at him. If we truly identify ourselves with David, we must expect to get what he got.
P.L. If David has left, let us go unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. Jonathan stood up beside his father and spoke good of David. It is not enough to stand up. One would sit down again, I suppose.
J.T. And then, finally, his attachment to David was marked by artillery, he shot three arrows on the side of the stone Ezel. He intended to love him *at a distance*, which is the case with many.
S.J.B.C. Jonathan returned to Saul's table, and then he went to the city, and finally David went to the cave of Adullam.
{82}
Rem. With regard to chapter 25, the first verse states that Samuel died. What you said about Abigail followed on that.
J.T. I think it would signify that the prophetic ministry is followed by the assembly. The assembly typically takes up that position. Everything is found there; and what is called attention to is her appearance, and her understanding, because she answered to the mind of God. David was a man after God's own heart, and she is a suitable companion, because she is of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance. And then also she has judgment about that to which she had been related; she also had a right judgment of Saul. There are thousands of Christians related to that which hates Christ, and yet they have no judgment about it.
{83}
READING (6)
Genesis 5: 1 - 24
J.T. There is in this book a line of instruction relative to recovery. We have at least four instances of it recorded, in each of which the result is for the pleasure of God. The one in the portion of Scripture which we have read culminated in Enoch who, as we are told in the New Testament, was "the *seventh* from Adam" -- meaning that he was the great end of an exercise. In Hebrews 11: 5 we read that before Enoch's translation "he has the testimony that he had pleased God". So that the end of the exercise resulting from Adam's failure was a product for God's pleasure. Then in chapter 8 we have Noah, who in the recovery after the deluge offered up every clean beast in burnt-offerings; and the Lord smelt a sweet savour. That was for His pleasure.
Again, in Jacob's departure, when he arrives back at Bethel it says he poured out a drink-offering; meaning that he was for God's pleasure as restored. And then in the recovery of Joseph's brethren we have a like thought; he embraced them. It was mutual; there was unity in it; "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!" (@Psalm 133: 1). I thought it would be a help for us to see, as we are living in a day of recovery, that this is what God has before Him in it. Whether it be collective or individual, there is no true recovery unless there be pleasure for God in it.
Chapter 3 recounts the fall of Adam and Eve, as we call it; and chapter 4 is the result of that in the way of disaster, in which Eve takes the initiative.
Rem. The point in the recovery is that it is for God's pleasure.
{84}
J.T. Yes; if there is not something for God's pleasure, recovery is not complete.
Rem. And if there be real recovery, those recovered share in God's pleasure.
J.T. Exactly. And this thought is conveyed by Enoch in a special way, because he is mentioned as the *seventh* from Adam; the end of a spiritual exercise.
Ques. Would walking with God be the evidence of recovery?
J.T. Yes. Enoch's name, I think, denotes 'discipline'. So the discipline of God brings about a state pleasing to Him. His name would indicate what began with Adam in chapter 5.
Ques. Is it like a new generation?
J.T. Yes; God begins over again in chapter 5. In chapter 4 the light begins with Seth. Recovery is always by means of light being introduced; it says that Seth had a son, and he called his name Enosh; meaning that he recognised that man was mortal; that he was not going to live for ever; that he was born to die. That implies that he had light. And "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah" (@Genesis 4: 26). If there had been no light, there would have been no recovery.
Ques. Would @Luke 15 come in here?
J.T. Well, the prodigal, as we speak of him, would be pleasurable to God.
P.L. In the recovery of David, after he numbered the people, there was light as to the house of God @1 Chronicles 21 and 22.
J.T. Just so. He recognised the judgment of God on him, and then thought of the house -- preparing for it in every way. This was pleasing to God.
Rem. Seth accepted the judgment of God on the flesh.
J.T. The name given to his son indicated that all his posterity were mortal, notwithstanding their
{85}
longevity (the life of one of them extending to nine hundred and sixty-nine years, almost a millennium), but what is to be noted is that *he died*. That is in keeping with the light of that particular moment. In subsequent events there is always the light covering the period; and the light which covered this period was that which Seth had in naming his son Enosh. In fact, the first chapter of Genesis, what we term creation, was recovery. It was not what it had been as the primary work of God. All that follows the first verse is recovery. And the same principle obtains now. Indeed, it is a principle that runs through the whole of Scripture. God said, "Let there be light" (@Genesis 1: 3). There can be no movement Godward at all, save where light is introduced.
Ques. Why did they live so long in the dispensation of Seth?
J.T. God had His own wise thoughts in allowing such longevity. But no matter how long a man's life lasted, he had to die. The light Seth had was concerning every family. It was there as testimony.
Ques. Would you say that while God works in the way of recovery, where departure has taken place on our side, the departure has to be acknowledged?
J.T. Yes; that is so. And I think the first chapter of Genesis encourages us to hope for that; it enables you to be patient when things happen. In @Genesis 1: 2 it is said that "darkness was on the face of the deep". But the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters, waiting, no doubt, for the time when light should be commanded. And God said, "Let there be light". It does not say that the Holy Spirit said, Let there be light. He is always subservient to the will of God. In the address to the assemblies in Revelation the Lord speaks: "These things says the Son of God", etc. (@Revelation 2: 18). That is the commandment, that is authority. But what the Spirit says is the development of that. And so in Genesis 1 the command
{86}
is from God, but the Holy Spirit was waiting to come in on the light. He works in the light. The will of God and the activity of the Holy Spirit go together. That is a great principle running right through from the beginning.
Rem. So there is an appeal to the ear: "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says", (@Revelation 2 and 3).
J.T. Yes; but notice that when the Lord speaks, you do not get that. It is authority. But, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says". You are not to judge what He may say, because He brings things up, and applies what the Lord says.
Ques. Would you say that recovery is sovereign?
J.T. Yes. What can we do if God does not operate?
Rem. You get the same thought in connection with John the baptist; he did not begin his mission until Christ was here, so that he had One to point to.
J.T. John was a burning and a shining light, but he was not the true light. The true light was here, and it was in that light he operated.
I do not know any part of scripture that has been more assailed in modern times than the book of Genesis; the enemy has attacked it. Save in the first verse we are not occupied with God's primary operations. The first verse says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth". All that follows is to bring in recovery, and that begins with light. What can men know about the book of Genesis, unless God commands light in their souls?
Rem. And our part is to look to Him to let the light shine in.
J.T. Yes. And the Holy Spirit was hovering there over the darkness, ready and waiting for God to speak. For it was due to the Creator that He should speak; and He said, "Let there be light. And there was light".
{87}
P.L. Have we the sovereignty of God in connection with the Galatians? "God sent forth his Son", (@Galatians 4: 4); and then immediately after that we read that "God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (@Galatians 4: 6). They had fallen away, and God brings in greater light than they had before to recover them. Then God sends out the Spirit; that would answer to the recovery.
J.T. Just so; and the Spirit cries, "Abba, Father". This is pleasing to God.
Ques. Would increased light be seen in Enoch?
J.T. Undoubtedly. But this chapter gives you the moral features of the recovery. Chapter 1 gives you the same thing in moral sequence: you have light, then separation of light from darkness on the first day; the firmament on the second day; the earth, vegetable life, fruit trees, etc., on the third day; lights in the heavens on the fourth day; fish, living creatures and fowl on the fifth day; and on the sixth day we have human life. And so it is morally, too, in that way. Whatever the disaster in the second verse arose from, we cannot say much about that; but we do know that the disaster in chapter 4 arose from sin in man, and the recovery that is dealt with in this chapter had to do with that. "From the beginning the devil sins", we are told (@1 John 3: 8); what the history of that is we know little about, but we do know the history of sin *in man*.
P.L. And we have got our hands full in facing it.
J.T. Yes; we begin with ourselves there.
In chapter 4 it is the mother that is spoken of, whereas in chapter 5, it is the father all through. It is a question of begetting.
Ques. What would help us in regard to local difficulties?
J.T. Well, no man can have authority unless he
{88}
has moral power. And I think that is what comes out in Adam; he had re-acquired the position of head. So chapter 5 begins over again: "This is the book of Adam's generations. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him". God will never give up His original thought; He ignores chapter 4, so to speak.
Ques. He "called their name Adam:" what is the meaning of that?
J.T. It means that Eve was merged in him; that she was not taking the lead. He "called their name Adam, in the day when they were created". Adam is the head; he is to dominate everything.
Rem. I thought it was suggested that Eve had taken the lead in chapter 4.
J.T. She did; she thought she had acquired in Cain a man from Jehovah.
P.L. The expression that puts 'I' first, and 'Jehovah' last, will carry its own sorrowful fruit.
Rem. God exercised His right in regard to Enoch.
J.T. That is what comes out. Noah is the beginning of an exercise. Enoch is the end of one, and therefore I think he sets out this great principle we are dealing with, because it was said of him that "before his translation he has the testimony, that he had pleased God" (@Hebrews 11: 5). And what led him to walk with God was that he begat a son, Methuselah. After he had begotten Methuselah he walked with God three hundred years. He was not going to duplicate Adam's mistake; he was going to hold the position God had given him. If he is to have moral weight to bring up his children, he must walk with God.
Ques. Enoch saw the "holy myriads;" as it says in @Jude 14, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads". Enoch prophesied that. Do you think he saw the result of his walking with God?
J.T. He was probably alone walking with God in those days. Apparently he did not have many companions
{89}
in walking with God, so it would be a great stay to his heart to see the "holy myriads". Holiness is essential to walking with God.
P.L. @Hebrews 3: 1 speaks of "holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling".
Rem. Enoch was evidently converted when he was sixty-five years of age. It says he "walked with God after he had begotten Methuselah three hundred years".
J.T. It brings up the question of the household. The presence of a family involves serious consideration. How can I represent God to them unless I walk with Him? And one has always that privilege one may always have such companionship. What God did not find in Adam in the garden He found in Enoch. He walked in the garden in the cool of the day, it says, and He called for Adam. I suppose God intended that Adam should be a companion. He breathed into him; the transaction was very intimate. He desired that Adam should enter into His thoughts. But what He did not find in Adam He now finds in a disciplined man.
Rem. If the head of every household walked with God, what an immense change there would be!
J.T. Yes; and especially so had that been the case in the era before the flood, before the national order was introduced. That was a time of families, or tribes, hence the great importance of the head of a tribe or family walking with God.
Rem. There is a growing line of apostasy in this section of Genesis, and the only thing for it is that the head of a family should walk with God.
J.T. Noah "prepared an ark for the saving of his house" (@Hebrews 11: 7). This thought is accentuated in Noah. If Enoch is taken up to heaven, his testimony remains, and the Holy Spirit uses it; it is material that He can use, and so He brings it forward in Noah. I have no doubt the thought began with Seth really,
{90}
that is to say, the thought of the head of the house naming his child, and walking with God before his family; and it runs right through, so that you find it in Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, etc. In other words, it is the great patriarchal thought.
Ques. Is recovery to the likeness of God? Is that the thought?
J.T. You get the thought of likeness in the first verse, "In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him". Then it says, "Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his likeness". So that these are initial thoughts, but they convey what God intends to emphasise, namely, that there must be likeness. So that Adam was in God's likeness, and Seth in Adam's likeness. There must be likeness if the families are to represent God on the earth. However ungrateful the children may be, the parents concern is to pass on the likeness; that is their responsibility.
Rem. 1 suppose in Timothy we find an example of the likeness having been passed on from his mother, and his grandmother.
Ques. How can we pass on this likeness? We are dependent on the sovereignty of God.
J.T. Quite so. "I have nourished and brought up children; and they have rebelled against me", God said (@Isaiah 1: 2), but He kept on to His own principles; He never gave them up. You can count on God to use your testimony for the following generation.
Ques. Would the testimony be what we reflect?
J.T. The testimony is the measure in which you reflect God. The patriarchal idea necessarily emanated from God.
Now when man is created, God enters into relation with him; chapter 2. What infidels cavil at involves the most precious truth; that is to say, man is in special relationship with God, hence the name. *Jehovah* here.
{91}
Rem. It is interesting to notice that the patriarchal thought, which would go with the thought of likeness, is traced back in Luke's gospel to Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
J.T. That shows that God had recovered His primary thought, a generation running right through. It is an immense thought for parents to lay hold of. The thing is to hold on to your responsibility to convey likeness. That is a treasure of the soul, and God will use it. It affords material for the Holy Spirit. It is remarkable that David, although he failed so remarkably in his house, acknowledges it: "Although my house be not so before God", he says, "Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant" (@2 Samuel 23: 5). And the Holy Spirit first recognises in David -- on the day of Pentecost -- that he was a patriarch, and Solomon was the product of David's fatherhood. In whatever other respects he failed, he looked after Solomon, and he brought him up patiently and tenderly.
P.L. David was a disciplined man before Solomon was born.
J.T. Yes; he refused to take food or to wash himself while the child was ill, but when the child died he said, "Why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me" (@2 Samuel 12: 23). There was perfect resignation to the will of God. And then Solomon comes in; he is the offspring of a disciplined man, and he has all the advantage of having a disciplined father.
Rem. Though one might not live to see it, yet the child would get the gain of it.
J.T. God follows up the light that shines on a faithful parents household.
P.L. So that the greatest heritage a man could leave his children would be the fruit of his discipline with God.
J.T. Now we find in all these extensive families,
{92}
their years being given, that every one died. We have a like passage in chapter 11, but it does not say they died, because the point there is not to emphasise the light that Seth had. Here it is to emphasise that light; and so it says of each one that he lived so many years, "and he died". Longevity must not blind us. Things may arise that seem to dispute the light that governs the position, such, for example, as the apparently long delay in the return of the Lord, so that the scoffers say, "Where is the promise of his coming? ... all things remain thus from the beginning of the creation" (@2 Peter 3: 4). But they are *wilfully* ignorant.
And so, if you take in all these heads of families, some of them living nearly as long as a millennium, you could understand how blinded the young people would become to the fact that their fathers would die. These men would possibly have thousands of descendants, and that fact would seem to deny the truth of the position; that is to say, that men should die. So that Enoch brings in the confirmation of the light; and we may be sure that the Lord is not failing to give confirmation to faith regarding the Lord's return. We know the promise is sure, we are not deceived by the delay. Enoch walked three hundred years with God, and I suppose his sons and daughters would be reminded of that every morning, if, indeed, not every part of the day. He walked with God, and "before his translation he has the testimony, that he had pleased God".
Ques. Is there a difference between walking in the light, and walking with God?
J.T. There is not much difference, because God is in the light. "If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another" (@1 John 1: 7). Walking with God emphasises that.
Rem. Of Samuel it is said, that "Jehovah was
{93}
with him", but Enoch "walked with God". Is there any difference?
J.T. There was no commission given to Enoch. Nothing is said about his service. Samuel had a commission, and he needed divine support in his service, which is of course important.
But what I believe the Holy Spirit has in this passage is that the result of the exercise is recovery. God has man walking with Him for three hundred years! Well, that is worth all the exercise, and all the breakdown. If He did not get it in Eden, He got it in a scene of breakdown in a disciplined man. No one is fully recovered save as he is walking with God.
Rem. Then God in this case had greater pleasure than He would have had in Adam if he had walked in innocence for ever.
J.T. Yes. Enoch is the fruit of God's moral dealings -- a disciplined man. Adam, as he stood, was the fruit of His creatorial power. Morally, Adam could not be translated to heaven; he was not made for it, he was made for earth. But the first man under discipline becomes a heavenly man. Enoch was a disciplined man. The first essential point in recovery is what God has got out of it for His pleasure.
P.L. A disciplined man can give God pleasure, which a man in his sins cannot do. Do we get this principle in the man who is mentioned in @John 9? The disciples ask the Lord, "Who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind? Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him" (@John 9: 2, 3).
J.T. Yes; there was a moral element in that man. He had sight given to him; but that was not all, he had to go through a process; and in that process the works of God were manifest.
{94}
Rem. The exercise here is complete.
J.T. I think so. Enoch was the *seventh;* which would signify complete exercise.
Rem. Often in individuals, as well as in companies, you may see partial recovery. That does not reach the pleasure of God.
J.T. No. There may be an endeavour to meet things legally, by arrangements, and what not, and yet there is nothing for God in it.
Rem. It does not come about as the result of walking with God.
J.T. In the case of Cain there was a certain reasoning with him, and then he said, "My punishment is too great to be borne" (@Genesis 4: 13). There was not a word about his *guilt;* he did not go to the root of the matter. But see how merciful God was! Even to such an one as Cain, He says, "Whoever slayeth Cain, it shall be revenged sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should smite him. And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah" (Verses 15, 16). There was not the slightest sign of God's pleasure there. He went out, and left God behind him.
Rem. Enoch walked with God three hundred years. The Lord Jesus Christ was here only a comparatively short period.
J.T. Yes. He was so delightful to God that He would have Him in heaven. So Luke makes much of heaven's delight in Him. In @Luke 9: 51 we read "It came to pass when the days of his receiving up were fulfilled, that *he* stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem". It does not say His 'going up', but His *"receiving* up;" because heaven wanted Him back. And then as He was blessing them, "he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven" (@Luke 24: 51). And we may be sure that heaven does not wish the assembly to be delayed here; but God would honour us that we should be in accord with His long-suffering. The church as disciplined, and
{95}
knowing His mind, should be content to be in the great position of identification with God in His long-suffering.
P.L. So the generation that God wants is a generation He can leave here, and entrust with His thoughts and interests.
J.T. And so John comes in at the end to show us the greatness of being trustworthy. God honours us, and entrusts us with His thoughts in the end of the period.
Ques. Would walking with God at the present moment involve walking in the light of the dispensation?
J.T. Yes; walking with God at any period means that you are walking in the light that governs that dispensation.
Ques. Is there such a thing as partial recovery?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. They may stop in the middle of it.
J.T. Yes, they may indeed. Whereas what we have in this chapter, in the light of the New Testament, is "the seventh from Adam" -- the complete thing.
Ques. Would Jacob be partially recovered when he took the stone and set it up for a pillar, and poured a drink-offering and oil on the top of it; @Genesis 35?
J.T. As soon as Joseph was born, Jacob says "Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my country" (@Genesis 30: 25). Recovery, I think, begins there. It is the light of Christ in the soul. But he waited still in Syria after that for a time; then finally he leaves it, and ale wrestles with God. He was further on there. He says, Now I want to get the blessing. Heretofore he had been occupied in getting cattle, and wives, and children, and what not, but now he says to God in effect, I want you to bless me. He had plenty of this world's goods, but
{96}
he wanted something more. That shows he was progressing spiritually. He says, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me" (@Genesis 32: 26). And we read, "He blessed him there". He got it. That was a fresh step. Then afterwards he gets into disgrace. But God is faithful, and He says to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar unto the God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother" (@Genesis 35: 1). And Jacob set up the pillar, and poured on it a drink-offering, and poured oil on it; showing that God had secured the full result.
Rem. How many there are in Christendom who have got the light of forgiveness and justification, but never move on into the light of sonship!
J.T. Just so. And where sin happens, however much acknowledgement there may be, unless the thing is bottomed, and unless the soul is really with God about it, the pleasure of God is not there.
Rem. In recovery a good deal would lie in the sensibilities.
Ques. Does God stop short in carrying out His intentions to recover a soul; does He not bring one finally to what He had in His mind for them?
J.T. Yes; but then there are hundreds like those to whom He refers in @Matthew 23: 27 when He says, "How often would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!"
Rem. But if you are clinging to God, He will never cease until the final result is accomplished.
J.T. Yes; but that depends on how far I want to go. I might turn aside to Shechem and build a house. You see it was God who suggested to Jacob to leave Shechem. That was the faithfulness of God.
P.L. Recovery depends on going down. Was it not characteristic of the Lord? He recovered all by going to the greatest depth.
{97}
Rem. I suppose in the case of the ten leprous men, partial recovery would be suggested in nine of them, but the tenth, the one who came back, was *fully* recovered.
Rem. In the epistle of @Jude 24, already referred to as speaking of the seventh from Adam, we also read that God "is able to keep you without stumbling, and to set you with exultation blameless before his glory".
J.T. Yes; and Jude also says, "But *ye*, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God" (verse 20).
Ques. In connection with light and recovery do you think God calls attention to a divine principle in it as a rule?
J.T. No doubt something would come out of it. "Out of the eater came forth food" (@Judges 14: 14). Whatever spoil there is, is to be a permanent asset in the house.
{98}
KNOWLEDGE THAT COMES OF REFLECTION
@John 3: 9 - 13; @1 John 2: 20; @1 Samuel 10: 1 - 8
In remarking on these scriptures, my object is to seek to create an exercise as to spiritual understanding; what is referred to in the book of @Proverbs 8: 12 as "the knowledge which cometh of reflection"; not simply what comes from reading, although reading is of prime importance to a christian, as the apostle Paul says to Timothy, "give thyself to reading", (@1 Timothy 4: 13). He also refers to the books which he left at Troas, which Timothy was to bring (@2 Timothy 4: 13); so that in his advanced years the apostle evidently gave attention to reading. But wisdom speaks of "the knowledge which cometh of *reflection*", and in order that the believer might have whereon to reflect, God sets certain features before him as he sets out in his christian career. Now the first great thing for the believer to understand, from this point of view, is that however little *he* may know, things *are* known; not only are they to be known, they are known. The apostle, who, as he tells the Colossians, had great combat for them that they might know the mystery, speaks to the Ephesians of his knowledge of it; he says that "ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery" (@Ephesians 3: 4). They were to know that it was known; not only that it was to be known, but it *was* known.
The gospel of John brings out, in this connection, what is known. In @Ecclesiastes 6: 10 we have a statement which is very remarkable -- "what man is, is known". The Scriptures anticipate, much more accurately than we are prone to think, what believers have to deal with at the present time. The very first chapter in the Bible, indeed, anticipates what we
{99}
have to face in the way of opposition. So in the pretentious effort there is to investigate in regard to man, christians have this statement, "what man is, is known". Hence we are not investigating on that line; we leave that to those who are willing to spend their time and means in that way.
The Lord in the gospel of John is said to have known what was in man, and that His knowledge of what was in man led Him to refuse to have any confidence in him; @John 2: 24, 25. Many of us, doubtless, would have thought that a great work of God was proceeding when many believed on the Lord Jesus in Jerusalem because of the signs; and, doubtless, those believers, or those who correspond with them in our times, might be numbered as converts. The fact that one under such influence raises his hand in acknowledgement of what he hears, is not conclusive that he is converted. I do not wish to undervalue what proceeds, but John sets us on our guard; he notifies us at the very outset of the danger of taking people at their word, when it comes to spiritual things. A man whose word might be his bond in natural things will utterly fail you in spiritual things, unless he is really born again. It says, "many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he wrought. But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men" (@John 2: 23, 24). Solomon had said, "what man is, is known", and in the presence of Jesus on earth this is emphasised, and this knowledge leads the believer to distrust man. It is not that we live in the region of distrust in relation to our fellow-men. Of a truth, indeed, "all men are liars". It is not that they are accustomed to tell lies about *ordinary* things; it is when the test is applied that a lie comes. And so the Lord did not commit Himself to them, for He knew all men.
The next chapter, therefore, introduces the necessity for the new birth. If there is to be anything reliable
{100}
in regard to the things of God, a man must be born anew. Nicodemus says, "How can these things be?" It is a great matter when people begin to make inquiry; and we may expect this, for while the Spirit of God remains here, men shall be inquiring. Not inquiring in curiosity merely, as on Mars Hill, where they came to hear the news of the day -- Nicodemus inquiry was not of that order, he had genuine exercises. And while the Holy Spirit is here there shall be such. And who is to answer the inquiries? John brings in a Man *who knows*. That is what I have before me. The Lord says to Nicodemus, "Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things!" Nicodemus did not know, although he should have known. How many teachers there are in "Israel" at the present time who do not know! If we are to be here in representation of Christ we must know.
The Lord proceeds to say to Nicodemus, "We speak that which we know". John speaks therefore at the outset of One who can say, "We speak that which we know, we bear witness of that which we have seen,; and ye receive not our witness". The Lord had to testify in conditions similar to our own, but nevertheless He testified what He knew and what He had seen. I want you to take in just that simple thought of a Man here dwelling among men, who could say "I know", and who could go over the earthly things and unfold them as no one else could. Then also He could unfold the heavenly: "If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe? And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven". I want you to dwell upon that as illustrative of John's ministry -- that you are in the presence of One who knows. He knows what man is; He knows all the ways of God in regard to the earth, and He knows the heavenly. He came to earth with the infinite
{101}
knowledge of what was in heaven, and He spoke it. "No one", He says, "has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven".
You see what christianity is from this passage; how all other religions simply disappear as utterly unworthy of comparison. Here is a Man who knows everything. He knows the ways of God on earth; He knows what man is, and He can bring out and unfold what is in heaven; and He does. So we have a perfect model; whatever I may know or not know, things are known, not only to God, but in a Man on earth, and they are brought down to us thus.
And so Nicodemus came to the right Man. If any one is in need, and has any inquiries, make sure that you find the right Man. There is the man that speaks froward things -- beware of him; and the woman who flatters with her mouth -- beware of her. The former includes the modernist, the infidel, the sceptic, who say what they wish to say without any fear and without regard to divine authority. The woman who "flatters with her mouth" is that which is connected with the senses: the feelings, the lusts; the theatres, the picture-shows. The christian has to be on his guard in regard to these two great agencies of the devil to nullify the revelation of God.
So John brings out that there is a Man who *knows;* and if you are exercised and make inquiry, make sure you find that Man. The apostle Paul brought this forward when writing to the Ephesians; he says, "ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery;" and the whole of the epistle to the Colossians is to guard the saints from man's teaching -- philosophy and vain deceit.
I want to go on to the epistle of John, to show you how the young believer has, in principle, by the possession of the Spirit, a means of being independent of man. He says, "Ye have an unction". He is
{102}
speaking to "little children;" and I desire to be as simple and as pointed as the beloved apostle, for he certainly did not aim over anybody's head; he included the little ones in his epistle. He addresses believers in their varied stages of growth, and in this section he addresses the "little children". He says to them, "Ye have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things" (@1 John 2: 20). That refers to the believer as having the Spirit, the unction referring to the Spirit; it dignifies the believer.
I see a christian recently converted, and he is reading the Bible, and I see him turning to God as he reads, and discarding the pernicious books that he read before he was converted. I see him, like the Ephesians when they were converted, burning the books, although they were costly, and I say, Although that young christian thinks very little of himself, in the eyes of heaven he is dignified. It is in a very little thing that you show you are taking on the heavenly dignity; for the olive tree (which is a type of the Spirit) in refusing to rule over the trees would not leave his function, for by him God was honoured and man was honoured.
If I accept the Bible and reject man's productions, I am honouring God. What leads me to do that? the Spirit. The very instincts of the Spirit lead me to reject what is of man and to accept what is of God. Nicodemus had those instincts, although not yet having the Spirit; he says, "We know that thou art come a teacher from God" (@John 3: 2). He did not know very much, but that was of paramount importance and he was dignified to that extent. He traced the miracles to their source, attributing them to God; and the One through whom they came had Himself come from God. So Nicodemus is on the line of learning, when he says, "we know that thou art come a teacher from God".
Well, the apostle says to the little ones, "Ye have
{103}
the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things". That is what I might call potential. Although the young believer does not know things in detail, he does in principle, he has got the means of knowing them; whereas the most learned man, if unconverted, has not. The youngest believer has the unction from the Holy One to know all things.
The apostle says further, "the unction which ye have received" (verse 27). That word "received" means that there has been an action by the believer. The gift of the Spirit is from the divine side, but the reception is from my side. I have committed myself; so He says that "the unction which ye have received from him abides in you". You may rely upon it, the Holy Spirit will not leave you; He is here to teach you. You are precious in the eyes of heaven, and the Holy Spirit has taken charge of you, and He will work to preclude all that is of man, "Ye have not need that any one should teach you" -- that is not a man like the apostle John -- all the gifts are men. What is referred to is the man that the Lord knew, and refused to trust, a man that is not born again, and one who has not got the Spirit; you do not need him.
Thus the believer is set up in the understanding of the Spirit in independency; he is dignified by the anointing. But one's dignity is sustained so that one is in dependence. The word 'independent' is a good one for christians, but if you apply it in your relations with God, or with your brethren, it expresses what is bad. But it is a very important word as expressive of what we have in the Holy Spirit, so that I am independent of the men of this world to teach me I do not need them.
Now I want to show you from the book of Samuel how God brings forward the elements of help. In Christ you have a Man that knows; being ascended on high as a Man, He has received gifts in relation to men, and He has given them here, so that these things
{104}
may be known; it says, "with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (@Ephesians 4:12, 13). So there is that here which corresponds with Christ above; things are known, and what is known thus is available to every believer.
We have in Samuel the things whereby we are helped on this line of acquiring spiritual understanding and spiritual fitness for the representation of God. I do not dwell on the poor man who is alluded to here -- Saul; he was a man after the flesh, and what applies to the man after the flesh applies to him. I refer to this chapter as setting forth what is available to the believer; what was available to Saul is available to every believer. These things were not recorded as mere history; they are available to us. So what we see is, Saul was anointed, and kissed -- a very beautiful touch; a touch, indeed, which every young believer should experience. Then he was to have a position in relation to the inheritance of the Lord; he was to be captain of the inheritance. Think of being introduced to this! Think of having part in the inheritance! whatever your part may be in it. The apostle prayed for the Ephesians, that they might know what is "the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints" (@Ephesians 1: 18). Think of having part in that! Saul is anointed and kissed, and then he departs. He is on his own responsibility now. A believer has to learn to walk; he has to start out on his own account, but fully furnished.
So Saul finds two men at Rachel's sepulchre: "When thou goest from me today, thou shalt meet two men by Rachel's sepulchre ... and they will say to thee, The asses are found which thou wentest to seek, and behold, thy father hath dismissed the matter of the asses, and is anxious about you,
{105}
saying, What shall I do for my son?" We come now to that which is to be reflected upon -- the knowledge that comes of reflection. What a subject of reflection was Rachel's sepulchre! You will remember how Jacob reared up a pillar over Rachel's grave. Benjamin was born as she died. The more you stop and dwell on the sepulchre of Rachel, the more wonderful the thing becomes; the mother dies, but a son is born -- the son of his mother's sorrow, but of his father's right hand. What knowledge comes of such reflections! Sorrow on the one hand -- a believer is worth little or nothing who has not had sorrow. You may look out for sorrow in the christian path, for it is "through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God" (@Acts 14 22); but in the sorrow there is power. There is the Son of the Father's right hand -- crucified in weakness, indeed, but He lives by the power of God, and His strength is made perfect in weakness. That is what I may call the first lesson. It is the knowledge that comes of reflection in things presented to you.
But then you are a *son* too! Benjamin was the son of his father's right hand. Saul, too, had a father and the father was sorrowing: "What shall I do for my son?" You are impressed at the outset that the Father is interested in you. It is a great comfort and a great source of strength to the young believer to know that God is interested in him as a son. Then the causes of any anxiety you may have will surely be removed for you: "The asses are found".
These are elements divinely appointed, so that the believer might progress and have understanding and intelligence. The two men are witnesses by Rachel's sepulchre; you find adequate testimony to these things, and to the interest that is in you. If there is a young believer here tonight who is not conscious of being a subject of interest, I can assure you that
{106}
you are. You are wanted as a son; God would have you in that liberty. How much there was in all this for Saul, but there was no real ability in him to take it in! There is, however, in the believer ability to take in these things.
Having gone forward a little, you come in contact with people who go up to the house of God: "And thou shalt go on forward from thence, and shalt come to the oak of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God, to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three cakes of bread, and another carrying a flask of wine". I address myself to the young people and I say, Have you met these three men? The house of God is a new thing to you, and you see men going up to it. There was a time when I wondered why people assembled together so regularly and with such interest. I had not the interest they had, but presently I got it. They were going up *to God;* it is a wonderful thing to see persons going up to God. Think of the sense of holiness that would mark such men! And they are not going up empty. Not only have they Bibles, so to speak, under their arms, but they know what is in them. Thank God for the open Bible, but then what about what is in it? I may have a Bible under my arm and not know what is in it. These men understood things; they had things in their hands -- for us -- spiritual things. As you will observe, one was carrying three kids, another three cakes of bread, and another a flask of wine. They were men that *carried* things; they had things; in their hands that referred to God, and they were going up to God. Have you met these three men? You may meet them constantly in many places and they ask after your welfare. In the so-called churches around there is but little of this. There is a stage in the progress of the believer where he comes into contact with people who are going up to God as in His house;
{107}
and they do not go up empty. In @1 Corinthians 14 we have the suggestion -- one has a psalm, a teaching, etc. You have *something;* you know what God requires, and you are carrying something. A young believer coming into contact with such, learns what it is to go up to Bethel.
Then they give him two loaves of bread. Not only do I see what it is to go up to God, but I see I am in *the region of gift*. The woman in @John 4: 10 came into the region of gift "If thou knewest the gift of God". Now I know not only that God gives, but I know that the brethren give; if a man loves God, he gives.
Then he comes to the hill of God, where was a garrison of the Philistines. Things have been in your favour hitherto, but now you have enemies to contend with. The Philistines are at the hill of God; in the sphere of christian profession there are Philistines, men who are not christians. They are influencing people, and you have got to meet these men; you are to be "a good soldier of Jesus Christ" (@2 Timothy 2: 3). You have to learn that. Then as you come into the city you find a situation that greatly encourages you. It is said, "thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with lute and tambour and pipe and harp before them; and they themselves prophesying". Now you are in *the region of prophecy* -- you have already come into the region of gift.
Everything was in Saul's favour; as he comes into the city he finds a company of prophets and they have musical instruments, and he is in the region of prophecy. Our meetings are not for brethren to pass from one to another what each one knows; the principle of our meetings is prophetic. The things of which we speak should not be as at a distance; if the Holy Spirit is among us we have the spirit of prophecy. It is not a question of one saying what he
{108}
knows, and another saying what he knows; it is a question of prophesying, and it ever will be so where the Spirit is.
"They themselves prophesying. And the Spirit of Jehovah will come upon thee" -- Saul comes under the spirit of prophecy. What an experience that is! There are those who sit mute in the meetings, and are as spectators; the interested ones come under the spirit of prophecy, and say things they never expected to be able to say. Why? Because they have come under the spirit of prophecy. "And the Spirit of Jehovah will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man". Look at that! Your view now is different; you have come under the spirit of prophecy, and you join in it. Take @1 Corinthians 14 again: an unbeliever or an ignorant person comes in -- they are prophesying, and the man falls down and acknowledges that God is among them of a truth. He comes under the influence of prophecy. You see how Saul came under the influence of it: "the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied". It is not now simply the anointing; it is a peculiar thing; it belongs to the company. When the Holy Spirit comes in, in this way, we are different; we are lifted out of what we are naturally. It is a wonderful experience, and it all tends to make the believer spiritually intelligent in regard of what is of God.
Samuel continues: "And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou wait, until I come to thee and inform thee what thou shalt do". Now, you see the believer has gone through all these things so that he might have the knowledge that comes of reflection, and have spiritual experiences, because of the Spirit -- not only in himself, but in the company. It is one thing to
{109}
have the Spirit and to walk in the Spirit, and to live in the Spirit; but it is another thing to understand the Spirit in the company, in the region of prophecy, where the mind of God is disclosed.
Now, after all this you go down to Gilgal, where everything is adjusted in your soul; you are sobered, you are not carried away by elation. It is a sort of 'cooling' process by which things find their level, and it is there where you are permanently formed, where you learn to judge the flesh and disentangle things in your mind, for fleshly feelings are sure to come up after such experiences. The real work is done at Gilgal, and you have to wait there. That is a test. You say, I have a gift; I have been prophesying, and I do this and that! You must learn to *wait*. Many have made shipwreck because they refused to wait. Saul lost the kingdom because he refused to wait and to act on the word of Samuel. Samuel had said, "Wait until I come". You will have a blessed time at Gilgal, for God will be with you, helping you to judge and disallow the flesh. But Saul did not wait. Is there not a warning for us in all this? It is an immense thing to go to Gilgal and learn to wait after you are brought through this wonderful experience -- after having so many spiritual things presented to you. The great things presented in Christ as for us are not to clothe the flesh, hence the necessity for Gilgal. May God bless these thoughts to us all!

READING (7)
Genesis 8: 15 - 22; 35: 9 - 15
J.T. What is before us is to see how in recovery after failure there is that which is for the pleasure of God. Yesterday we saw that Enoch was the end of an exercise arising from the failure of Adam; and that he, as we are told in Jude's epistle, being the seventh from Adam, had the testimony *before* he was translated that he pleased God; (@Hebrews 11: 5). It was a very great testimony. And each one of us may have this testimony as we walk with God.
Now in the next occasion of exercise, we find that Noah walked with God; so that what Enoch set out is carried forward. In @Genesis 6: 9 we read: "This is the history of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect amongst his generations: Noah walked with God". That is a sort of formula in the book. And Noah goes through the deluge, which was the judgment of God on the world on account of the failure and sin of mankind. Nevertheless, all that is of God is carried through it; nothing is lost; and the result, as set out in chapter 8, shows that there is that which is for God's pleasure; it says of the burnt-offerings that Jehovah smelled a sweet savour.
Ques. Peter speaks of Noah as being the eighth -- what is the thought in that?
J.T. It means one of eight.
Rem. The new earth is first introduced in the savour of the burnt-offering.
J.T. The point is that the result of the exercise was for the pleasure of God. And what is acquired from the exercise, namely, Noah's testimony, is passed on to those who follow. I think the exercise in our reading yesterday was to see that when sin or
{111}
breakdown occurs, recovery is only complete when there is something to please God as a result.
Ques. Partial recovery would not be exactly for the pleasure of God?
J.T. In some cases there may be much to satisfy the conscience of a brother, or of brethren, but complete recovery is what pleases God. That is, the testimony that a man has; it is there to be seen, and it is carried forward, an added asset to what has been there already.
Rem. It is good to see that what had been in Enoch is continued in Noah.
J.T. That is the point -- nothing lapses; Enoch goes to heaven, but his testimony remains here, and it is carried forward.
Ques. Would Elijah and Elisha suggest a similar thought, namely, that there might be continuation of the man who had been here for God?
J.T. Yes. I think Enoch's testimony is gathered up in Noah, and it would necessarily greatly enhance Noah's testimony, who is said to have been a preacher of righteousness. We are not told in what particular feature Enoch pleased God; he walked with God. But in Noah we have *righteousness;* it is said of him: "Noah was a just man, perfect amongst his generations", and God had only found him righteous.
Rem. Noah pleased God, and he had whereof to offer on the altar. Would that indicate increase?
J.T. Yes; and he is the first we find *preaching*. He was a qualified vessel in that he was righteous personally, and had a good report among his generations. One has to take account of these things.
If it be a question of sin and recovery, we have a model before us in this chapter of God's ways with a man who was righteous himself, and just and perfect among his generations.
Ques. Did God foresee the sacrifice Noah would offer when he came out of the ark?
{112}
J.T. He did, undoubtedly, in directing that there should be an increased number of clean animals; seven instead of two.
Ques. When you drew attention to the fact that Noah was the first preacher, and you connected it with righteousness, what had you in mind?
J.T. I think we see how the testimony is cumulative; as it progresses it carries forward what came out in Enoch, and adds the thought of righteousness personally in walk, as in Noah, who also preached righteousness. He must have been a very great man morally in a world such as had developed, and as is outlined in chapter 6. He would be a man of great moral strength to stand out against it, maintaining righteousness personally, and preaching it.
Rem. That would give great weight to his words.
J.T. He was known in this way in his generation, as it says here; he was "perfect amongst his generations".
Ques. Would you say that he got the knowledge of the clean and the unclean as a result of walking with God?
J.T. No doubt. You can see it in what he was personally in his testimony, and then how he goes through the result of the sin of others. That is a thing that I think may be noted. The deluge was not on account of him; it was on account of others, but he goes through it; and he goes through it with God.
Ques. Would not the same principle apply in measure to ourselves?
J.T. Whatever occurs locally, or generally, whether personally responsible or not, one has to go through the thing. With Adam and Eve there was personal penalty imposed, and also with Cain; but others had to go through the consequences of their sin. There is no personal penalty attached to Noah, but he has to go through the consequences of the sins of
{113}
others. It is as having gone through that, that you sacrifice an offering of a sweet savour.
P.L. Enoch prophesied, but Noah went through the judgment. That would indicate an advance on what is set forth in Enoch.
Rem. The Lord died, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God. Is that the thought?
J.T. Yes; the Lord in that very connection is said to have suffered: "Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God" (@1 Peter 3: 18). We are not called upon to suffer for sin, but as a result of sin. Noah went through the penalty that others brought in.
P.L. Would it be the sin-offering in verse 20?
J.T. I think so. The others were overwhelmed by the deluge, but Noah got the experience of going through the consequences of their sin. That applies in every instance; the person responsible comes under the governmental dealings of God, but all have to go through it in spirit. Those who take it upon themselves in this way get the gain of the experience; they are on the line of the Lord when He says "then I restored that which I took not away" (@Psalm 69: 4). He faced judgment personally, not on His own account, of course, He went through it for others. And Noah in a way foreshadows this; he suffered, so to speak, the just for the unjust; he went through the judgment, and hence on coming out of the ark on the new earth he offers up a sacrifice. You will notice that Noah did not come out until he was told to do so. It is God who must release us when we have passed through things that come upon us on account of sin.
Rem. We have to wait in patience on God for that.
J.T. We have to wait in the prison-house until God opens the door.
P.L. "Know that our brother Timotheus is set at liberty" (@Hebrews 13: 23). Do we not get that
{114}
principle in Ezekiel as well? He sits among the captives, and then he gets the gain of the light of the temple.
J.T. Just so. In the government of God we have to learn to suffer with others; although we may not be personally responsible, being bound up in the fellowship we cannot escape suffering in the government of God, and we have to wait on God to release us. The waters assuaged, and in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. That is one thing; but then it says, "God spoke to Noah, saying, Go out of the ark". The release was a divine command; that means that one has got to wait on God for it.
Rem. Our tendency would be to endeavour to get out as soon as possible.
J.T. Yes, we get restive in the limitations, but Noah evidently did not.
Rem. You spoke yesterday of the test of waiting, in connection with Saul; he was not up to it.
J.T. I am sure that is where many of us come short.
P.L. Would you say that while you are waiting you experience what Noah did in the return of the dove with the olive leaf?
J.T. There is beautiful instruction in connection with Noah. As the waters rose, the ark rose. What a sense of the awfulness of death, and the judgment of God, would lay hold of Noah's soul as the waters increased, engulfing all those people! But what a sense of God's mercy he would have as the waters gradually decreased until the earth was dry! The earth was dry; the judgment had disappeared, but all that experience had been gone through, and it is the man who went through it that is directed to come out.
Rem. And so, similarly, God would, permit us to
{115}
feel the discipline increasingly until we get a sense of the judgment.
J.T. Yes. I think we have to see things as they actually are, when sin occurs. David, as we all know, could judge another with great accuracy. When Nathan brought the parable before him he had no hesitation in judging another. We are not behind him in that. But when Nathan says, "Thou art the man", David is equal to it. That is how the light of God shines in a man; David says, "I have sinned against Jehovah". He has no excuse to offer. He had a sense of the seriousness of the thing; it came home to his soul. Then Nathan said, "Jehovah has also put away thy sin: thou shalt not die" (@2 Samuel 12: 13). Yet he had to go through it all; he lost the child. Until the child died he had refused to eat, he lay upon the earth, and acknowledged his guilt; but when the child died he rose up and presented himself, and explained that whilst the child was alive he recognised the hand of God, inasmuch as that He might have mercy upon him, but when he was dead he says, "I shall go to him, but he will not return to me" (@2 Samuel 12: 23). We see how David went through the thing; he saw that he would die too. The psalms show how much he suffered in going through it; and in result how pleasing he was to God.
Rem. Would you attribute any significance to the sending out of the dove? Would it set forth spiritual inquiry to ascertain how things stand?
J.T. Yes; the raven would suggest human means of investigation, but the dove is a type of the Holy Spirit. She found no rest for the sole of her foot. The judgment had not as yet been removed; the hand of God was still heavily upon the earth. I believe in all such cases those who have the Holy Spirit have the means of acquiring that knowledge; they know how things are. The dove came back faithfully to Noah. It touches the personal link
{116}
between Noah and the dove, which is very beautiful. In verse 7 we read: "he sent out the raven, which went forth going to and fro, until the waters were dried from the earth". There is no real result from that effort, for the raven does not return. But in verse 8 it says, "he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had become low on the ground". There was a link with him in the dove; she is sent out *from Noah;* there is a personal touch in that. Then it says, "the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her foot, and returned to him into the ark". There is a beautiful link there in the dove as a type of the Spirit. He took her in to him, and knew by her that the waters were still on the earth. So that there is thus the means of determining how things are.
How beautiful, too, it is to see God directing Noah to come out of the ark and everything that had life! "Thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons wives with thee. Bring forth with thee every animal which is with thee, of all flesh, fowl as well as cattle, and all the creeping things which creep on the earth, that they may swarm on the earth, and may be fruitful and multiply on the earth. And Noah went out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons wives with him. All the animals, all the creeping things, and all the fowl -- everything that moves on the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark". So that we have a scene now moving under divine direction and control, a living state of things. Then Noah builds an altar.
Ques. Would the burnt-offering be a vindication of what God had done on the earth?
J.T. I think so. It was in keeping with Noah's name. The word 'odour' is the same as the word 'Noah', which means that God intended to have rest in that man; but evidently He did not have that fully until Noah went through the judgment. It is in going through the consequences of sin with God
{117}
by divine appointment that the savour of rest comes in.
P.L. Do we get that principle in @2 Corinthians 2: 15? After Paul had gone through discipline he could say, "We are a sweet odour of Christ to God".
J.T. It comes in very suitably there. He had been down to the gates of death himself, and God had delivered him from "so great a death", chapter 1: 10. No doubt that was in view of the second letter, that he might write with more affection and a deeper sense of discipline.
Rem. One feels the need for continuance. Noah was one hundred and twenty years building the ark. In passing through exercise we are kept secure; but there is the possibility, when we come on to a new line of things, that we might fail, as did Noah; we might not be up to it.
J.T. That is seen in the next chapter. This chapter is all under divine direction. Noah went in under divine direction, and now he has come out of the ark as commanded of God.
P.L. The day after a battle is the most testing. The precious fruits of the conflict might be frittered away in self-indulgence.
J.T. In the altar you have a link with God. It means that you are publicly in relation with God; you have set up public worship as it were. The whole universe might see now in this man who had come out of death under the hand of God, that publicly he has God before him, and that he worships Him. So the altar is a very important feature, because it shows that one is definitely and publicly committed to God.
Rem. And then, too, he would share in the pleasure of God.
J.T. Well, you see what comes out here; it says, "Noah built an altar to Jehovah; and took of every
{118}
clean animal, and of all clean fowl, and offered up burnt-offerings on the altar. And Jehovah smelled the sweet odour". He is for God's pleasure, and he has committed himself to it in the altar. So the new world has a wonderfully good start. Noah in doing this was recognising God as the only God to worship.
Rem. And one delights in that which gives delight to God!
Ques. When Lemech called his son Noah, saying, "This one shall comfort us concerning our work and concerning the toil of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed" (@Genesis 5: 29), was he speaking prophetically? Later, we read that when Jehovah smelled the sweet odour He said, "I will no more henceforth curse the ground".
J.T. Doubtless Lemech had very little knowledge of what it meant; but he had light in the naming of his son, as we saw in regard to Seth, who also had light. Doubtless he understood but little of what it would involve, or how rest should come about, and what Noah would have to go through in the way of experience.
Ques. As you mentioned, the world had a good start; it would be on the principle of resurrection. Would the principle apply in the same way today?
J.T. Yes. Christianity, one might say, is the antitype to this. God said, "I will no more henceforth curse the ground on account of Man, for the thought of Man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will no more smite every living thing, as I have done. Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease" (verses 21, 22). In the savour of the burnt-offering we have an order of things set up in stability. Notwithstanding the state of man's heart, God has found means of rising up above it, so that a stable order of things is set up. And if I have transgressed or
{119}
sinned, God is greater than my heart, and greater than my sin. The knowledge of God in that way becomes a great lever in the soul.
Rem. And in recovery there is always an asset.
J.T. Yes; you see what Noah passed on to the new world; what a start it had in Noah! There is always the spoil where recovery is complete.
Now, going on to Jacob, we see what he learnt of the house. His first experience of the house, before his discipline and before his breakdown was, that it was a "dreadful" place; chapter 28. He set up a pillar, but there was no drink-offering. There was no pleasure for God in that. Jacob had to go through twenty years of bitter experience before we read of the drink-offering.
Ques. A pillar would be a witness, would you say?
J.T. Yes; it stands. It is an asset in the house. In chapter 35 we read that "God went up from him in the place where he had talked with him. And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had talked with him, a pillar of stone, and poured on it a drink-offering, and poured oil on it. And Jacob called the name of the place where God had talked with him, Beth-el".
Ques. When a soul is restored, is he given something more than he ever had before?
J.T. Yes; and not only does he get it, but the house of God is enriched. In Noah the new world gained. A recovered person, or company, would gain by it.
Rem. We have an example of that in Peter.
Ques. What was signified by the pouring of the oil? Jacob was able to do that in chapter 35, but apparently he was unable to do so in chapter 28.
J.T. I think it is a matter of the spiritual intelligence which he had acquired in the meantime. The book of Genesis is a book of *roots*, the fruits appearing later in Scripture, and we find the principle running
{120}
right through, that those who are in the house of God are intelligent, and know what to do. The drink-offering was the outcome of Jacob's knowledge; the knowledge that comes from experience. It was true movement when he returned to his own country.
Rem. The offering that Noah presented to God was of clean animals. He knew what would be acceptable to Him.
Ques. In the pouring out of the drink-offering, Jacob would have the sense that he was pleasurable to God in so doing?
J.T. God talked with him. In chapter 28 God was at the top of the ladder, and Jacob at the bottom; there was distance between. But in chapter 35 it was not so, for God came down and talked with him on the earth. Jacob knew that a change had come about; but the change was in himself; God was the same in both cases, but he was not the same.
Rem. There would be joy in the drink-offering.
J.T. Everything was to convey to Jacob that God was just delighted to have him in the house; and Jacob was conscious of this.
Ques. Then he had come to know God better?
J.T. Certainly. And in John's first epistle the whole point is to bring about conscious knowledge -- "that ye may know", he says; (@1 John 5: 13). That epistle would enable us to consider, and be conscious of all things. Jacob had very little consciousness of what the house of God was in chapter 28, for he spoke of it as a "dreadful" place. He was wanting in the consciousness of being suitable to it. But in chapter 35 he poured out the drink-offering on the pillar first. That is to say, he was conscious of God's pleasure in him; and then he poured oil on it.
Rem. He set up the pillar in the place where God talked with him.
J.T. Yes and he gave it a name. It stands for all time.
{121}
Ques. Do we get in connection with Paul also the thought of the Lord looking down on him from heaven in tender compassion at the start, and then afterwards He comes close to him to bring him in touch with Himself?
Rem. I suppose that here God was preparing Jacob for further and perhaps more trying exercises.
J.T. Yes; the death of Rachel is recorded next. But before that Jacob has the consciousness of being suitable to the house, and for God's pleasure.
Rem. This consciousness would give us greatly enlarged thoughts.
J.T. Where God is pleased with a vessel, the anointing comes upon it.
Rem. The drink-offering is the symbol of eternal joy.
J.T. The Lord said of Saul of Tarsus, he "is an elect vessel to me" (@Acts 9: 15).
{122}
READING (8)
@Genesis 45: 1 - 15
J.T. The subject before us is to touch a little on the recovery of *brethren;* and, as has been previously remarked in regard to Enoch, Noah, and Jacob, I believe we shall see that in the recovery of Joseph's brethren there was what was for God's pleasure. What comes out in the last book of the Old Testament, is that God loved Jacob and hated Esau. Now Esau was Jacob's brother, and notwithstanding the fact that he had been shown great consideration throughout his history, he never manifested the spirit of a brother towards Jacob. We have also in Cain a brother who, although standing in that relationship with Abel, was a murderer; indeed, Esau was little better, for he maintained an implacable hatred of Jacob, in whose family the spirit of a brother was developed. So that the book of Malachi is very solemn, coming in at the end, and pointing out one who, in the relation of a brother, failed in the spirit and affection that belong to it, and came in for divine disapproval; the word in regard to him is, "I hated Esau" (@Malachi 1: 3). That is in view of his history, the history having been completed.
Rem. He made himself hateful.
J.T. Quite so; he maintained an implacable hatred for his brother.
P.L. "Because of violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever" (@Obadiah 10).
J.T. Yes; and you find how true that was. There we get one who prophesied about God's judgment on Edom, or Esau; and Ezekiel also refers to it twice; before he brings in the truth of the new birth (involving God's family) and the resurrection,
{123}
he devotes a whole chapter to God's judgment of Edom; chapter 35.
P.L. Esau broke the brotherly covenant.
J.T. Yes; as we read in @Amos 1: 11, "For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not revoke its sentence; because he pursued his brother with the sword, and cast off all pity; and his anger did tear continually, and he kept his wrath for ever". I think Esau is typical of a brother who is wanting: in the spirit and affection that belong to that relationship. And that only throws greater light and importance on this chapter, which deals with the recovery of Joseph's brethren, because even in them the murderous spirit existed; but they were recovered. It shows, I think, that the ministry which is being carried on at the present time by the Spirit of God has in view the recovery of the people of God from the different associations in which they may be, and to bring them together. In order that this may be rightly understood, there has to be a definite judgment of that which Edom or Esau represents.
P.L. They said one to another, "We are indeed guilty concerning our brother" (@Genesis 42: 21).
J.T. Joseph's brethren were not Edomites; they were capable of recovery. But Edom was incapable of recovery. How terrible it is when overtures have been made time and again to find no result. Edom had overtures made to him, and the greatest consideration accorded him. When coming out of Egypt, Israel would not interfere with Edom his brother. He turned aside and passed his land; he would not fight with him, but turned away from him; @Numbers 20.
Rem. Edom usually joins with the enemy against Israel.
P.L. We have the last great overture to Edom in Paul the prisoner appealing to king Agrippa.
J.T. The Herods were Edomites, and true representatives
{124}
of the race. As you say, Agrippa had a wonderful overture made to him.
P.L. Paul was not trying to take his brother's birthright, he was offering it to him. He said, "I would to God, both in little and in much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as I also am, except these bonds" (@Acts 26: 29).
Ques. Would recovery here be the climax?
J.T. I think there are four features of recovery in Genesis.
Ques. Would this answer to Philadelphia?
J.T. Exactly; brotherly love. I think we can see a certain line running through, beginning with Seth; so that we arrive at brethren dwelling together in unity in Genesis.
Ques. Why does the cup come in here? Would it suggest what is for God?
J.T. It comes in in a very interesting way. When the brethren come to Egypt, they are put into custody for three days. That is a preliminary process, seeing there had been sin. And this was a most heinous sin; it was not the sin of one, but of many, for ten of them were in it. Benjamin, however, was not involved; and I think he represents the overcomer, leading up to Philadelphia, as has been suggested. Now the first thing Joseph does is to put them into custody. It is important that where will is active there should be restriction.
Rem. He did that before he made himself known to his brethren.
J.T. Yes; the first experience is to be put under restraint three days.
Ques. How does that work out practically?
J.T. The Lord has His way of limiting us. Joseph here, all through, is presented by the Spirit of God as a type of the Lord -- one with unlimited and supreme authority and power.
{125}
Ques. Would you say that the governmental discipline of God led up to the personal discipline?
J.T. The government of God is always in view of the testimony. No doubt Simeon, who was detained when the others were released, would go through the more severe experience. He would be a representative of all, and as such he would go through things in a more solemn way. All the while he would have in mind that he was suffering, not only on his own account, but on account of all of them. That was suggested last night in connection with Noah. He had to suffer on account of others, not on his own account.
P.L. Joseph wept at the time Simeon was bound; showing what is in the heart of Christ when He sees the saints in difficulties and bondage.
J.T. The Lord has no pleasure in causing these limitations, but wisdom requires it. So that we may be sure that if we have to undergo these limitations, we have got the sympathy of the Lord in them. And if we have to place a brother under limitation we feel for him in it. The idea of punishment is not to penalise, but to correct; the principle is correction. Joseph had correction and recovery in his mind.
Rem. "In all their affliction he was afflicted" (@Isaiah 63: 9).
J.T. And even Jacob himself had to go through all this, because it is a family matter.
P.L. In @Genesis 42: 22, Reuben seeks to excuse himself he attempts to conceal his part in what had occurred. And is there not ofttimes in us a tendency to seek to escape from what is affecting the family circle?
J.T. That was not in keeping with what Joseph had in his mind. So Reuben had to go through the exercise. He said, "Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the lad? But ye did not hearken; and now behold, his blood also is required". There
{126}
Reuben was exonerating himself and putting the onus on others.
Rem. That is a usual tendency. I suppose Reuben was saying what was true, but he has to go through the exercise with the others.
J.T. He was under delusion all this time.
P.L. A negative attitude is a guilty one in the presence of what is contrary to the Lord.
Rem. In chapter 44 the movement of Judah is on the line of recovery to the brotherly principle.
J.T. Judah is the link of recovery; Reuben did nothing. There was no light in his remark; it was self-vindication. He was seeking to exonerate himself; his attitude was a negative one. One may often see that in local difficulties. But it is not possible to get clear in that way, because one has to go through the trouble with the others. So here it is Judah who becomes the link of recovery.
Rem. He exhibits the spirit of a brother; he is ready to lay down his life for his brother.
P.L. Reuben offered his two sons for Benjamin, but Judah offered himself.
Ques. How would what you speak of in connection with Judah work out now?
J.T. Well, exercise sets in. You see how wonderfully skilful the Lord is in the way He brings about recovery in this case. Exercise begins with someone, and all get the gain of it. As in Seth, light came in in the naming of his child. It was Judah's speech in this instance which led to Joseph disclosing himself to his brethren.
P.L. With regard to Reuben, would that scripture in @Leviticus 5: 1 apply: "if any one sin, and hear the voice of adjuration, and he is a witness whether he hath seen or known it, if he do not give information, then he shall bear his iniquity"?
J.T. Yes.
{127}
Rem. And it should be taken up in a brotherly or family spirit?
J.T. I think so; that is one feature. In the light of the assembly, but also in the light of the family. We are dealing here with a family matter. Benjamin had to go through it, and even Joseph himself. Although he is acting the part of the lord of Egypt, he is one of the brethren. So the Lord takes up things, and feels them with us. We know from @John 11 how He felt for the family at Bethany. It was a question there of one of the family taken sick and dying; and we see how the Lord wept there. So here, what happened was a family matter, and it was a common shame. That Joseph felt it secretly came out afterwards, and the others, and Jacob, too, had to go through it.
Rem. "I am Joseph your brother", he said. He was as much their brother in suffering as in anything.
J.T. Yes; and he felt it more keenly because the more spiritual one is in these matters, the more one feels them. You may have to take severe measures, as Joseph did, but you feel the thing. You are not doing it punitively but correctively.
Rem. Joseph handles the matter wisely. He asks them about their father, which was a common interest.
J.T. You see how deep a sense Judah had of what his father was enduring, and what Benjamin was to him. "His life", he says, "is bound up with his life, it will come to pass when he sees that the lad is not there, that he will die". How tenderly he spoke about his father and his brother Benjamin! There would seem to have been an element of trustworthiness there.
Rem. He had touched Joseph.
J.T. That was the motive of it. It says he came near to him. Judah's approach to Joseph had feeling in it. There was conscious knowledge, for he saw
{128}
the seriousness of the position, and he felt it, and was prepared to meet it at all costs to himself. He said, "Ah! my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh. My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? And we said to my lord, We have an aged father, and a child born to him in his old age, yet young; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set mine eye on him. And we said to my lord, The youth cannot leave his father: if he should leave his father, his father would die ... . And now, let thy servant stay, I pray thee, instead of the lad a bondman to my lord" (@Genesis 44: 18 - 22, 33). These are not idle words, they come from the heart. Judah is a brother who is feeling things before God.
Rem. It reminds one of Moses interceding for the people, at a later date. God delights to be entreated.
J.T. Joseph must have been impressed when he saw how full of respect and reverence Judah was. One feels that Judah had got to the bottom of things; he was considering for others. It shows how God comes in and uses a brother who feels with Him.
Rem. A testing moment like that would show exactly where he was.
Rem. It has been said, with reference to the passage you have read, that no other language contains such pathetic words.
J.T. All that preceded it accounts for it.
Now as soon as Benjamin arrives on the scene, the *house* comes into view. As you will notice, it says "And Joseph saw Benjamin with them, and said to the man who was over his house, Bring the men into the house, and slaughter cattle, and make ready;
{129}
for the men shall eat with me at noon" (@Genesis 43: 16). Benjamin is typical of the overcomer, I think, but he is with the offenders; externally he is one of them. In Joseph's mind, however, he is very different from them. So "the man brought the men into Joseph's house". That is a tribute to Benjamin. Although ostensibly he is with them as one of their brethren, in Joseph's mind he is very different from the others, and Joseph honours his presence. Instead of putting him into prison, they are all brought into the house; so they benefit from Benjamin.
Whilst we take our place in the shame, the Lord in His infinite wisdom recognises everyone's part in it. He knows just where we are in it personally, and He knows how to recognise that, and to make others recognise it. "Bring the men into the house", he says (not only Benjamin -- all of them), "for the men shall eat with me at noon". Instead of the prison now, it is the house. There would be an atmosphere there that would greatly help towards the restoration of all.
P.L. It is touching to see how Joseph stood in the house waiting for them; it says that "Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was still there; and they fell down before him to the ground" (@Genesis 44: 14). It is a great feature of revival when the Lord is going on with the house.
J.T. He is still there! If others have left the light of the house, the Lord has not. And what is to be noted further is that the first thing he had was a prison house; and then the house in which they are at home as a family -- the sphere in which the Lord discriminates, and makes each one feel his position. In @Genesis 43: 33, 34 they were brought in, and it says, "they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one at another. And he had portions carried to them from before him. And
{130}
Benjamin's portion was five times greater than the portions of them all. And they drank, and made merry with him". They all were present, but they were set down from the eldest to the youngest. That indicates, I think, that Joseph had great understanding in his house; he had a right to set them down as he pleased, so he placed them in that order. It would mean that there would be a sense of greater responsibility in them according to the positions they occupied; for whilst we all take a part in the shame, we are not really all equally responsible. God is infinitely fair in His dealings, whether now governmentally in regard to His house, or in eternity. The judgment pronounced will not be the same for all men, for God is fair, and each is judged according to his work. So in his dealings with His house, there is graded responsibility. Joseph set his brethren down from the eldest to the youngest, that is, Reuben comes first; but when the portions are handed out, Benjamin is the first. He loved Benjamin greatly; he had no part in the crime they committed, and Joseph in fairness did not fail to recognise that.
Departure having taken place in the assembly, this service of Christ is going on all the time. He deals with us in infinite fairness, He sets us down according to age. I am responsible according to the light and experience and privilege I have had. Your age is according to your light and experience.
P.L. In Hebrews 3 the house is introduced, and then in chapter 4 we have the word of God, living and operative.
Rem. It is a serious thing to be an old brother.
J.T. Very; you are placed at the top. There are more eyes on you than on the others, and the Lord would impress you with that fact. Then, as is presented here, there is a young brother, and the Lord honours him. Why is this? It is His sovereignty.
{131}
Joseph loved Benjamin as the overcomer. As a matter of fact, in all these exercises Benjamin has been entirely free from the crime the others were guilty of, but he goes through the sorrow of the family, and the Lord knows how to honour him; he gets a portion five times greater than any of the others.
Rem. One is judged according to experience; it is not merely a question of years.
J.T. We are speaking on general principles. This service of the Lord is going on all the time. He shows the brethren their sinful condition. Brethren may be mixed up with different systems, which would correspond with the mothers of Jacob's family; they had four mothers. The mother would have reference to the system in which I am brought up. How many brethren at the present time are mixed up in human systems! The service is a difficult one, because of the influence of these mothers. The principle here remains, because in a specific case in any locality the Lord is infinitely fair in His dealings; He grades the responsibility, and honours those that are to be honoured.
Rem. A state of famine existed all over the land.
J.T. Yes; and Benjamin suffers too. Do you not think there is famine in all these systems around? The food that the Lord gives the assembly at the present time is for *all* the saints, even though they be in evil associations. But then you see we are come into "Joseph's house" where there is plenty, and where He has means of differentiating -- placing responsibility upon some, and honouring others.
P.L. It is like the inspection of the guests in @Matthew 22.
J.T. All this works up to Judah's acknowledgement. As has been remarked, Judah's is a beautiful speech, and ought to be studied by every brother, because you may be called upon to make it one day --
{132}
to speak to the Lord about local matters, and spread them before Him.
Rem. I suppose the tendency would be with some of us to seek to escape like Reuben; but we want to take it to heart, so that recovery may be brought about.
J.T. Yes; and then you see what would help you to make a speech like this would be the feeling of tenderness and sympathy on the part of the Lord. It is pleasing to the Lord, and every one who hears it is affected by it.
Rem. You referred last night to David accepting the rebuke, and taking the whole guilt on himself; I think we might be free to release our brethren if we took the whole guilt on ourselves.
J.T. You have no pleasure in a brother being bound. When Simeon was bound, Joseph must have felt it as much as anyone; Joseph knew what it was to be in prison himself, and he knew that he could not do a better thing for Simeon. We see the features of representation here. Reuben represents selfish obligation, which leads us nowhere. Simeon represents one who suffers representatively. Judah represents one who suffers through the discipline and accepts it, and he is the one who speaks to the Lord. He represents the whole family.
P.L. The Lord invests rule in such an one; "The sceptre will not depart from Judah, Nor the lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come" (@Genesis 49: 10).
Ques. Do you think that Judah had a sense of the grace that was in Joseph?
J.T. No doubt he had come to this; and he possibly had some inkling as to who it was he was speaking to.
Now, with regard to this principle of representation, when I see the thing, I should not be like those who after the example of Reuben exonerate themselves.
{133}
Simeon represents the whole of the brethren, and they released, but he is detained. Judah represents are the spiritual element. When the Lord has been working with us in discipline, there is a spiritual result, and Judah represents that.
Rem. So discipline is corrective; it is not punishment.
J.T. We might perhaps be inclined to look on it as punishment, but I am sure that is not the thought of the Lord. You want to get those who are under discipline restored to the family.
Rem. If we are to deal with sin we have to take it home to ourselves as our own shame, as Judah did.
Ques. Do you not think that when the Lord disciplines us we are all inclined to look on it as punishment?
J.T. We sometimes regard it in that way, but it is not. "Judgment will be without mercy to him that has shewn no mercy. Mercy glories over judgment" (@James 2: 13).
In closing, Judah says, "And now, let thy servant stay, I pray thee, instead of the lad a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren; for how should I go up to my father if the lad were not with me? -- lest I see the evil that would come on my father". There is the spirit of Christ; he is prepared to lay down his life for the lad and the father. I think we have arrived in this at the spirit of Christ reproduced in a brother. It is just what He did; He laid down His life. John says, "Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us; and *we* ought for the brethren to lay down our lives" (@1 John 3: 16). So that the perfect result is reached. "And Joseph could not control himself before all them that stood by him, and he cried, Put every man out from me" (chapter 45: 1). Now he is prepared to disclose himself. "And no man stood with him when Joseph made himself known to
{134}
his brethren. And he raised his voice in weeping". Then later on it says, "he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after that his brethren talked with him". It must be noted that the weeping was not the weeping of sorrow; it was the weeping of joy. So that there in unspeakable pleasure in Joseph's heart, in that he has now got his brethren, as represented in Judah, repentant and recovered. There is mutual embracing in connection with Benjamin. Benjamin in returning the embrace showed his spirituality typically. Joseph kissed all his brethren, but it does not say they kissed him. The Holy Spirit never fails to differentiate; if there is anyone more spiritual and who loves the Lord more than others, he is brought into evidence.
P.L. In verse 12 Benjamin's eyes are distinguished.
J.T. Joseph "kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after that his brethren talked with him". There we have the subjective result; the brethren are free now to talk -- not about troubles -- they are free to speak to the Lord. A normal state of things exists when we are free to speak to the Lord and He to us.

Pages 135 to 234 -- "Christianity Characterised by What is New". Croydon, June, 1926 (Volume 82).
THE NEW CRUSE
2 Kings 2: 19 - 22; Acts 1: 13 - 22; Mark 9: 49, 50
J.T. It was thought that we might look at those features of christianity that are designated as *new*, going to the types for one -- the new cruse, then the new bottles of the gospels, the new man of the epistles, and the new Jerusalem of Revelation. The proposal is that the four readings might be taken up under those four heads.
It was also thought that as the promise to the overcomer in Philadelphia involves what is new, our subject would yield in the way of qualifying us to take up that promise. The Lord said that He would write upon the overcomer in Philadelphia the name of His God, the name of the city of His God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and then, *My* new name. If we are to be overcomers, we should be prepared for what is new, we should be characterised by what is new, for I apprehend that what the Lord promises to an overcomer would indicate the feature of the testimony that God takes up in his day.
R.B. What thought had you as to the type in that connection?
J.T. I was thinking particularly of the element of *preservation* among the saints. The divine terms that were living and vital at the beginning have lost their power and significance in those who are lacking in the element of preservation. Take any term in the Acts or the epistles, full of life and sap at the beginning -- one finds that each has degenerated in the public use. They have lost their original pungency and sap; this can be seen in the use of the word
{136}
'church', or even the word 'christian'. I think the Lord would remind us of this, lest in our mouths these things should become degenerate and be spoken of lightly. His thought is that they should retain their freshness. That is what is specially before me. There is much that might be said as to the type, but I think that is a practical feature that enters into it.
R.B. Do you connect that thought with the salt?
J.T. Quite. Of course we may consider the cruse by itself, but I would connect it with the salt, for the salt is inseparable; I mean, the salt is not to be separated from the vessel. The salt is to be put into it; the cruse was for the purpose of containing it.
P.L. The returning captives in Ezra's day brought back salt, without prescribing how much.
J.T. There was plenty of it. That shows, I think, the place salt should have in recovery, because there is so much corruption. But the idea of the vessel is very important and most interesting, because God has brought His people back, not only as vessels *severally*, but to the idea of *one* vessel in which things are preserved.
E.J.McB. Was your idea that at the very outset these christian terms had a living meaning to all the brethren, and, if our restoration is in power, they will have a living meaning to us, such as the assembly and the body?
J.T. Quite. I believe that the vessel in which the preservative element appears is involved in the fellowship, and I thought we might see the nature of the vessel in @Acts 1 -- what it was; then the Holy Spirit coming into it, you have the preserving element.
G.J.E. You said the cruse was prepared for the reception of the salt?
J.T. Yes. It was probably an open vessel, out of which the salt could be easily obtained. It is a
{137}
different word, I think, from that used for some other cruses, but I thought the vessel should be such that the salt is available. But the salt itself has to be preserved. If it become savourless it is worse than useless. But the idea of the vessel, I think, is of first-rate importance, and @Acts 1 gives its component parts as the Lord formed it. This latter thought should be carefully noted.
H.F.N. Has the first reference in Scripture to the thought of new -- the type of the new meat-offering in Leviticus -- any bearing on this?
J.T. I think it has. It would refer to the new company. Perhaps that is what you had in mind.
H.F.N. Yes.
J.T. The two wave loaves, I suppose, would refer to the same thing as the cruse refers to -- the saints as seen in the early chapters of Acts.
R.S.S. There seems to have been salt contained in this vessel and also oil in a vessel in chapter 4. What would you say was the distinction?
J.T. Oil in a vessel comes in in 2 Kings. There in chapter 4 you have it as the means of livelihood. It would be the Holy Spirit as a means by which one discharges one's obligations and lives. I thought it would be the same thing, only looked at in a different way.
R.S.S. In connection with the salt, it is the thought of preservation.
J.T. That is the thought. First the healing of the waters -- a pure source of influence brought in -- but the thought carried through into the New Testament involves preservation, as we see in many passages.
Ques. You spoke of the component parts. What was in your mind?
J.T. The names given. First those who saw the Lord ascend came to Jerusalem and went to the
{138}
upper room. That was new -- religiously, that was new. I used the expression 'component parts' in regard of the company seen in Acts 1. They had seen the Lord go up, and then they came back to the upper room where were abiding the apostles and the Lord's mother and His brethren. These are new; religiously the position is wholly new, and I think it is well to observe that in regard of the vessel, the cruse -- the company together there who had been formed by Christ. The upper room bears on it.
D.L.H. Are you speaking in contrast to the temple and the existing order of things religiously?
J.T. Yes; what existed at Jerusalem. The end of the gospel of Luke would show that the disciples went into the temple and continued on in what was old externally, but this treatise begins with what is new, hence you have emphasis laid on the word 'assemble'. The Lord assembled with them, it says, and furthermore, the apostle that was to take the place of Judas was to be one who had "assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up". It was there the great new features came out.
D.L.H. I should like to get clearly defined what was in your mind in speaking about the new element. Is it something that was wholly new in contrast with the existing order of things which practically was being set aside in the Lord being in the midst of His own assembly?
J.T. That is exactly what I thought, and I believe it will commend itself to you.
Ques. Would the thought of the Lord being with them after His resurrection be an addition to what was before them prior to His death? As you were saying, He had assembled with them and had given them a distinct commandment that they should tarry there. They were not only waiting but expectant.
{139}
J.T. It was from the time of the baptism of John until He was taken up; all is included. The component parts of the cruse -- of the vessel -- were formed in that environment. He came in and went out among them from the baptism of John until He was received up. In resurrection, as it says here, He presented Himself living after He had suffered, with many proofs, and "being assembled with them". There would be the confirmation in Him thus as in the midst, of all that had come out before His death.
E.J.McB. Does the thought of the field of blood show the necessity for this cruse -- the character of things when Judas went out and he died in the midst of the field? Does that show the public position in contrast to this upper room?
J.T. The case of Judas would express the very opposite of preservation -- the very opposite of salt. His bowels gushed out. A very dreadful thing, pointing doubtless to what is around us in a spiritual sense.
F.H.B. Do you understand the salt represents the preservative element, or does it represent more?
J.T. I expect you know better than I, but I apprehend that physically life is the greatest preservative. As soon as life disappears from a tree or an animal decay sets in.
F.H.B. Yes; so that the maintenance of the terms without life would be of no value at all.
J.T. That is what I thought. Judas was formerly called a devil by the Lord. The corrupting element was there from the outset.
H.H. What the Lord Jesus had brought in could not be continued in Judas. It would be continued in the new cruse.
J.T. In @John 6: 67, 68 the Lord says, "Will ye also go away?" Simon Peter says to Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal;" that is to say, it was not a question of what was written,
{140}
but what the Lord had. In Him the words were living.
H.F.N. Being written is not the preservative idea. The preservative idea is in the things being held in the person. "Thou hast words of life eternal". As you were saying regarding Philadelphia, "I will write upon him;" the saints are to be the record.
J.T. That is it -- persons. So that Peter in his answer to the Lord expresses the vitality that was there. He apprehended the thing. This is in John's gospel, where you would expect it. It was not a question of what was written; it was a question of what was in the Person. "Thou hast words", and so he says, "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God".
E.J.McB. Then do I understand that you connect the thought of the words with salt?
J.T. Exactly. They were held livingly in the Lord.
E.J.McB. And your exercise is not so much the salt as the cruse that would contain it?
J.T. Well, I thought of both. Peter says, "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". It was *experience* he gave expression to. And then the Lord says, "Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil" -- the very opposite of Peter, as expressed in his words.
W.J.H. So before the cruse is put together, so to speak, what Judas represents had to be eliminated, not only personally, but in the consciences of the others. So that each one of them said, "Is it I?" That would exclude from their hearts that which Judas stood for.
J.T. Very good, and I think that what comes out in @Acts 1 is that the Holy Spirit, in bringing in the vessel in its component parts, does not let Judas pass, but brings in the facts relative to his death to show the end of that man -- the field of blood.
{141}
W.J.H. And so, too, Peter says, "he was numbered amongst us", in that way taking home to themselves that they had links once with that element. Do you not think we have to maintain that? Denials of what was true in the things of God must be excluded practically, if the new features are to be maintained.
J.T. Quite. So that Matthew and Mark tell us they were eating when the Lord said "one of you shall betray me". Judas was there with them, and hence the emphasis is laid on "one of you".
P.L. The moment Judas goes out it was night, and the Lord speaks of a new commandment in John's gospel.
E.S.H. In @2 Timothy 2: 22 we depart from iniquity, and "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart". Is that the new cruse? And then, life is emphasised there. Is that the salt?
J.T. I think that is good. That epistle begins with life. Things are emphasised as being "in Christ" there, meaning they are secured, and so Timothy is charged to "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit" (@2 Timothy 1: 14). You must keep it; if you do not salt it, it will become corrupt. Things are preserved in a living way as kept by the Holy Spirit.
R.B. Referring to the allusion you made to Philadelphia -- "I will write upon him ... my new name", etc. -- these are not fresh elements; they are those that were at the beginning.
J.T. Quite. We have not anything that did not exist at the beginning. All we have was at the beginning, only I think the Lord would emphasise the thing at the end, so that the overcomer at the end should possess it. He reserves it for Philadelphia. There is nothing in any other promise just like what He says to the overcomer at Philadelphia; it is what is related to Himself. It supposes that He had
{142}
acquired His place in the affections of His people, that they had come to understand that things were new, that christianity was really new, and that all that is involved in Him coming out of death in resurrection is new.
J.J. I suppose the Judas or corrupting element is seen in what follows in Laodicea. The salt had to be used there.
J.T. Yes; Jezebel, the great corruptress, is in christendom; it is where Christ has been betrayed; not only denied, but betrayed.
F.S.M. Would the action of Elisha in going forth to the source of the waters and putting the salt in there suggest what you are saying, that we have to face the question of going right back to their spring? Would you enlarge on that a little? It seems very much the key.
J.T. It is, and what is to be observed is that the Holy Spirit says the healed state continued. The waters remained in that state -- they were "healed to this day". The situation was pleasant. I suppose the allusion would be to the Jewish position at Jerusalem. The situation was good, but the waters were naught and the land was barren. There was nothing for God nor men, and I think the new vessel comes in at Jerusalem. The Lord emphasises in Luke that the disciple s were to be there, to remain in the city; that is, the new thing, the new vessel, was brought in there. It was a wonderful thing that God should consider the position. It was a position that was right and desirable, and He would give it another opportunity. So that the vessel was there -- the new cruse, and the salt put into it, and the new source, as you might say, of the stream of influence, for God came in in the Spirit. That was how matters stood according to Acts 2.
J.S. In that way it was an open vessel and so it would be available to those in the place.
{143}
J.T. That was it. "We hear them speaking in our own tongues the great things of God". The things were there in freshness.
J.S. The principle of the new cruse and salt therein would apply to a local company in a city.
J.T. Quite, you want to see to that; as has been suggested things are dealt with at their source and their freshness continues.
Ques. You said something about the preservation of the salt. Has that any reference to the aspect of salt in connection with its savour and seasoning in @Mark 9: 49, 50?
J.T. The first thing you have there is, "every one shall be salted with fire" -- a most sweeping corrective of what is corrupt, for fire is the most drastic thing in dealing with what is corrupt, but if there is something of God there, it will stand -- it will stand the fire. Every one of us has to take that into account, and it is a most solemn thing that "every one shall be salted with fire". You cannot escape it, for God is too much concerned about the component parts of the vessel, that there should be any corruption allowed. Hence the sweeping process, "every one shall be salted with fire". That is a general thing. He will not have any evil left. Instead of the deluge, it is fire. And then, "every sacrifice shall be salted with salt;" the sacrifice is to be preserved. The fire will consume everything that is corrupt; the salt preserves what is good.
H.H. Do you get the principle of it in @Joel 2: 30? -- "I will shew wonders in heavens and on the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke". Morally they are the last days now. There is the giving of the Spirit, but there are the other elements brought in.
J.T. Just so. You see how the enemy's effort from the outset of recovery has been to corrupt, but we have this word: "every one shall be salted with
{144}
fire", for God will not tolerate the corrupt element. And then it is, "every sacrifice", that is to say, every one who has offered himself, which, I suppose, would apply to every believer, for we are not of much account unless we are offered as a sacrifice. The great result of Romans is that you offer your body a living sacrifice. I suppose that is where the salt lies. "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness" (@Romans 8: 10). There is the salt -- the preservative element.
H.H. That is the elementary feature of what is priestly; you present your own body a living sacrifice.
J.T. Exactly, and it is *living*. "Every sacrifice shall be salted with salt", for God will not accept anything else. "With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt" (@Leviticus 2: 13).
H.F.N. Would that be seen in Mark himself? The apostle said, "He is serviceable to me for ministry" (@2 Timothy 4: 11). I was thinking of what you were saying about being salted with fire and then salted with salt, and whether it did not work out in Mark's own personal experience, so that he is the great witness to recovery.
J.T. Quite; he speaks of the young man with the *linen* cloth, and then the young man with a long *white* garment. Romans, I think, works out the idea of priesthood initially -- from the very beginning of the believer's history. He delights in the *law of God* after the inward man. He begins to find the value of the law and to fulfil its righteous requirements. Then you get, "if Christ be in you, the body is dead". There the corrupt element has ceased to act so far as sin is concerned. Sin is the corrupt element. The woman of Samaria was corrupt to the very core, but she discerned by the Lord's remarks that her body was to be a vessel, that He could take what had been so corrupt and use it. It says, she "left her water-pot". She had come out of the city with a water-pot
{145}
to draw water, but the point was that she herself was to be the vessel, and she discerned this. So she left her water-pot and went her way into the city and went to the men. She is no longer exposed to their corrupting influence, she is able to speak to them about Christ; in principle, the Christ was in her instead of her life of sin, which was death morally. The point was the Christ; she herself raised it with Him, saying, "I know that Messias is coming", and He says, "I who speak to thee am he". His very words were living; they spoke of living water, and in principle Christ was in her, and so her body was no more the vehicle of sin.
H.H. What you have been saying would include the sovereignty side. I mean, the gospel of John enlarges on that.
J.T. Well, quite. The thing is to get hold of the idea of the vessel, that which is salted with salt. In Romans the believer as in this corrupt world is to present his body a living sacrifice. "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin". It is no longer the vehicle for sin, so you present your body a living sacrifice salted, and thus you have, I believe, a component part of the vessel that God can use to preserve things. If each of us is governed by the light of Romans, our bodies are available, free from the element of corruption. Thus we are prepared for what is collective: "we, being many, are one body in Christ".
J.J. Do you think the Lord had that in view in securing Bartimaeus and Zacchaeus at this very spot where these waters were healed? Do you think He was after these vessels?
J.T. That is a good suggestion.
W.C.G. In Romans 12 you get the many who are after the pattern. Would that not be the cruse?
J.T. I thought that is where the vessel is first seen in Romans; "one body in Christ". We are
{146}
not one body by any fleshly, mutual accommodation, but as "in Christ". Thus you have the vessel free from corruption, and so available for the preservation of divine things.
E.J.McB. Then do you think that the present exercise produced by the ways of God with us, even to fiery trial, is to enable Him to secure a vessel that can be salted?
J.T. Yes, I should think so. "Every one shall be salted with fire". There is no escape from that; it will come one way or another; so the thought of salting with fire enters into the vessel. That is what comes out in Corinthians. The corrupting element was present, as we know, and the apostle speaks of "a new lump", by purging out "the old leaven", and then he goes on to speak about our bodies. One would especially like to make that clear, because without the idea of Romans and Corinthians in their bearing on our bodies, we cannot arrive at the divine thought as to the cruse. Romans and Corinthians deal with our bodies, so it says, "glorify now then God in your body". "Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ?" (@1 Corinthians 6: 20, 15). They were exposed to corruption there and we are, so he emphasises the importance of keeping the body pure. When the new cruse was first introduced, as seen in Acts 1, it had been formed under the influence of Christ here, and the coming of the Spirit brought in the preservative power. But of course for the full divine thought of the cruse it supposes being built up not only in Paul's ministry but also as entering into the reality of @John 20. We come to have our part in it by learning in a real and vital way the truth as set forth in Romans and Corinthians.
G.J.E. So sacrifice means sacrifice, and sacrifice salted with salt is a component part of this new cruse.
J.T. That is what I was thinking.
Ques. You indicated the cruse was fellowship.
{147}
Had you in mind, "called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord?" (@1 Corinthians 1: 9).
J.T. Quite. In the Corinthian epistles there is the fellowship of God's Son, the fellowship of His death and the fellowship of the Spirit. The principles governing fellowship are to preserve us from corruption.
Rem. It follows on Romans.
P.L. Would you link it up with the covenant of salt referred to in @2 Chronicles 13: 5?
J.T. I think there you have the same thought. It is a covenant that does not decay. God sees to that. The kingdom was secured to David for ever.
J.B.C-l. The sons of the prophets in Kings would present a contrast to a new cruse with salt put therein. You spoke earlier as to the line of overcoming, and that would mean being in the power of what has been from the beginning. I was feeling, while you were speaking, that in these sons of the prophets there seems to have been a lack of power of overcoming, and a very meagre sense of what they were anointed to be the vessels of. Their history, as the Spirit of God gives it in Kings, seems to indicate they had not the power of blessing present with them. So I thought the power of overcoming is indicated in the ministry of Elisha, and in bringing in the cruse and the salt he heals the waters and brings in fruitfulness for God. Do you suggest it is possible for us to be *formally* attached to what has been from the beginning but not attached to it in a living way, as those who are overcoming?
J.T. Exactly. The sons of the prophets were their heirs, and they should have retained the thing that their fathers maintained. Samuel introduces the great prophetic ministry; others followed, but Elijah comes in abruptly, and fire marked his ministry. It was the testimony to the power of God to deal with corruption. The altar was built and the fire comes
{148}
down and licks up everything -- the offering, and the stones and the water; everything is licked up by the fire, alluding, I apprehend, to the power of God to deal with corruption, because it was corruption that was there in Jezebel. Now, these sons of the prophets should have reflected this and other prophetic features, but, as you say, they were defective indeed. They would set aside the leading truth for the moment. Though they recognised the Holy Spirit formally -- the spirit of Elijah resting on Elisha -- yet they were always *at a distance* in relation to what was spiritual. What was spiritual went on between Elijah and Elisha, which is very suggestive, but these sons of the prophets are at a distance. When the crucial time comes, they recognise the spirit of Elijah on Elisha, but they deny the ascension, and if you have not got the ascension, you have not got the new thing, for the new thing must involve that. The book opens with one man falling and another man going up into heaven. The leading feature of the new thing was involved in Elijah being received up into heaven. The new thing was a man going up into heaven by a whirlwind, and this is what the sons of the prophets deny. They deny it in a most effective way. So powerful was their influence, that it affected even Elisha. They bow down to Elisha, but speak of fifty strong men who should go to seek Elijah. This was nothing new; it was in keeping with the king of Israel, as we see in chapter 1.
G.W.W. Do you suggest that when corruption begins to do its work, the sense of the importance of ascension gets lost in the soul, and salt would preserve one from losing that sense? Corruption had already taken place with the sons of the prophets.
J.T. Exactly. So in Revelation the men on the earth are ready to acknowledge the God of the heavens. He is that, but He is the God of the earth as well. Men are giving up all thought of heaven as
{149}
regards themselves. Earth-dwelling, as marking those whose calling is heavenly, is resented. The hour of trial which comes on all the world shall be the portion of earth-dwellers.
G.W.W. Is not one great important principle in preservation that the soul is held in the apprehension of what is involved in the name of Christ?
J.T. Quite. His "new name". That is seen in Philadelphia, hence the Lord says, "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth" (@Revelation 3: 10). If we give up the heavenly, we shall dwell on the earth and become corrupt.
J.J. It was the men of the city who told Elisha of the water. Do you connect that with the reconciliation of the world owing to this new vessel being here?
J.T. It would come out in those who are serious about things. These men of the city were not the same as the sons of the prophets. They were not denying the ascension; they were not denying anything. They were consciously in need. They presented a very different picture from the sons of the prophets. They knew the situation and desired to have it remedied.
E.S.H. You referred just now to life being the great preservative. I was wondering whether the words of the Lord in @John 17: 11, "Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me", would be the introduction of family life on the line of preservation.
J.T. Quite so. "Keep them in thy name" implies what is incorruptible.
H.F.N. Would you say a little further word in regard of the thought of ascension? One feels it is the great distinctive truth of christianity.
J.T. It is a very striking thing that the sons of the prophets should be the ones to set that aside.
{150}
It is a solemn question to all young people amongst the saints, because, unless the element of preservation is maintained in them, they will find themselves in a like position, denying the truth for the time -- the special truth for the moment, whatever that might be, particularly what is heavenly; whereas heaven is *our* distinctive place -- all our blessings are there.
E.J.McB. Is not that true in regard of resurrection? It can be taken account of as an action of God in regard of Christ, as the expression of His power, but ascension is the platform from which He is going to fill everything, and apart from that nothing is filled.
J.T. I do not think you could have christianity apart from ascension. Everything depends on Christ's going on high. Some years ago there was a theme amongst us as to the basis on which the assembly stood, whether on that of resurrection or ascension, and I think the Lord made it perfectly plain that it stands on the basis of ascension -- including His death and resurrection, of course.
E.J.McB. Hence the importance of the "large upper room".
J.T. Just so. I believe the word for 'upper' here (Acts 1) is stronger as to elevation than in the gospels.
E.R. There could be no coming of the Holy Spirit apart from ascension.
J.T. No. Everything begins with heaven, but in what is set up on the earth in the future, you do not get the element of ascension. I believe @John 12-the scene in Bethany -- is a figure of what will be set up in the future; that is on the basis of resurrection, but @John 20 is, "I ascend".
Ques. Would you say that what is exclusively church property is bound up with Christ going up -- with ascension?
{151}
J.T. Quite, so in @1 Timothy 3: 16 it says, "received up in glory".
Rem. The distinction between Elisha and the sons of the prophets was that Elisha saw him go up, and the same fact is emphasised in the beginning of Acts, in regard of the disciples.
J.T. That is right, and they come back into the upper room.
W.J.H. The name of the ascended Man is maintained in that upper room.
J.T. Quite, also the Father's name: "my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". That I thought is what underlies the promise to the overcomer in Philadelphia -- the Father's name and Christ's new name.
G.W.W. The maintenance of all that is the great preservative from corruption.
J.T. Indeed; understanding John's gospel, the overcomer in Philadelphia appreciates the Lord's promise to him.
Ques. Do you think there is some special form of corruption which assails the assembly at every stage of its history down here, and we have to fall back on the salting with fire to preserve us in relation to the new cruse?
J.T. Quite; and so the component parts of the cruse, I think, involve that our bodies are kept right. "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness". It is that that enters into the idea of the vessel or the cruse. It is a new one. The teaching of Romans prepares us to have part in the assembly, in which things are preserved for God, corresponding with Acts 1.
W.J.H. It would appear that that is what the disciples felt in regard of their prayer as to the one that was to take the place of Judas. They referred to God as the One who knew the hearts of all.
{152}
J.T. And so Peter when referring to the gift of the Spirit to the gentiles, says, "the heart-knowing God". Then you see how the psalms are brought in -- the Old Testament; Acts 1. What is so striking about the witness of the Spirit in Hebrews, when things had begun to decay, is the idea of life emphasised in ministry to the Jews. Things had begun to decay and the Old Testament would be held in the letter. So it says, "even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice" (@Hebrews 3: 7), meaning that the Old Testament is a present living voice. It is not that they are simply written. The Spirit *says* it. It is a present living thing, and that is really how the Old Testament should be held. And so again in @Hebrews 10: 15, where you have the witness of the Spirit, it is the Old Testament brought in livingly as a present witness in the Spirit in regard of the new covenant. "The Holy Spirit also bears us witness".
H.H. You appreciate all the Lord's interests in regard of the Old Testament, but you can only do it intelligently in the appreciation of the new cruse, of that which is formed in the full light of Christ as the ascended Man.
R.S.S. The Lord said to the Jews, "Ye search the scriptures, for ye think that in them ye have life eternal, and they it is which bear witness concerning me" (@John 5: 39). Is it not true that very early in the church's history corruptive influences began to work? As far as the record goes, it was in the sin of Ananias and Sapphira coveting a place amongst their brethren, and then again, the murmuring on the part of the Grecians because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. These were corrupting influences.
If we do not follow righteousness, faith, love and peace with them that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart, decay and corruption are going on. It is very essential that we should judge everything of a contrary
{153}
nature, anything that would bring in a corruptive element in the assembly.
G.W.W. Where there is deliberate going on with what is corrupt, recognising a corrupt principle and going on with it, one has no longer a pure heart. The salt is not there.
R.S.S. Then as to the murmuring, the Grecians were murmuring because their widows were neglected. It was a national thing and therefore corrupt.
J.B.C-l. Do you make any difference between the thought of the Lord ascending and being received up?
J.T. I think there is a difference. One is John's presentation and involves His Person -- that He was a divine Person. The other is Luke -- that He was received up -- or carried up, as it reads -- which would be His humanity, pointing to heaven's appreciation of Him as Man.
J.B.C-l. I was just turning over in my mind whether both these thoughts were not bound up with what you have been suggesting as to the position of the assembly. I thought possibly the Lord being received up accorded with the assembly being here in testimony and responsibility, and the other more connected with what she has in the way of privilege and so of heavenly power. But I am really inquiring.
J.T. I think that is right. John is pre-eminently the gospel that gives our position from the standpoint of counsel and privilege; the word 'assembled' (chapter 20: 19) should not be there. It is not that side at all. It is a question of *persons* in their relation to the Lord and in their relation to the Father, so we read, "where the disciples were". It is the family in its heavenly and eternal setting.
E.J.McB. I gather one great exercise that comes before us in this subject is the actual necessity of being here in the body in a way that is suitable to God.
J.T. I think that is one of the most important
{154}
things we can take account of. John's gospel leads up to the position of the saints viewed from the standpoint of divine counsel. They are in family relationship with the Father and the Son. Chapter 20 is thus light as to the mind of God regarding us. The breathing into the disciples effectuates the *state* in us suitable to this, and lays the basis for Paul's ministry. There is thus what is wholly new, and the vessel, as a collective feature, is secured in the breathing into the saints of the Holy Spirit, and developed in Paul's ministry. Thus there is that in which divine things are preserved livingly. What Christ was here is maintained in the assembly. It was truly a new cruse with salt in it.
{155}
THE NEW BOTTLES
@Luke 5; 36 - 39; @Acts 2:1 - 4, 41 - 47
Ques. Would you repeat your leading remarks of this morning?
J.T. We were considering those features of christianity that are spoken of as new, having in view that the Lord said He would write upon the overcomer in Philadelphia the name of the city of His God, new Jerusalem, and His own new name. The desire is that we may apprehend what is new and thus qualify for the promise to the overcomer in Philadelphia. The subject is one in four parts. The first has reference to the preservative element, that which ensures the preservation of the things of God in freshness. The feature to be before us on this occasion has reference to the *strength* of the vessel into which the Holy Spirit came -- the vessel of the testimony. What one feels with regard to oneself is that one is not equal in spiritual formation to the light -- to the things that one deals with, so that it may be said we are not morally as great as the things we are dealing with, the things that we have by faith.
E.J.McB. I think we would all agree with that. I suppose that is what you had in mind as to the thought of the cruse.
J.T. Yes.
E.J.McB. Then, do you look on the question of strength as being connected with the actual relations of the saints in fellowship with one another?
J.T. Yes, I think the consideration of the thoughts connected with the new bottles would perhaps enable us to see that there is a great disparity between us as believers, as nominally in fellowship, and the things that we possess by faith and speak of.
{156}
E.J.McB. Then do you look at the bottles as more connected with the question of joy?
J.T. Well, I thought they symbolise what God intended should contain that which came in by the Spirit -- the great blessing administered by Christ in the coming in of the Spirit. The Lord intended by the use of these symbols -- this parable, as it is called -- to call attention to the greatness of the thing that was coming in -- the new wine -- the power of it, and what was needed to contain it, so that there should be no disparity, and that both might be preserved together. It is not in the way of criticism at all that I speak thus, but one feels it for oneself -- the great disparity there is between oneself as a vessel and the things that are dealt with. I suppose no one would avoid sharing that feeling.
F.H.B. I am sure no one would fail to own that.
J.T. I think that the divine intent was that they should be correlative. The heavenly city is not divine in its dimensions; it is human in its dimensions, but it has the glory of God. It contains morally what God has set out in Christ. There is perfect correspondence between it and what it has, and sets forth.
E.J.McB. Do you mean that, speaking practically for oneself, one should not be satisfied unless the matter dealt with, and one's own spiritual measure in dealing with it, are one?
J.T. That is what I think we should see, and I think @Luke 5 and 6 help specially in the formation of the bottles severally.
E.J.McB. Would you just say one more word as to the difference in your own mind between the thought of the cruse and the thought of the bottles?
J.T. The thought in the cruse was that it was new and suited as a vessel for the salt. It was not a question of strength, but that it was new. The word denotes something open but containing. The salt
{157}
was put into it, which was a separate idea -- introduced and then taken out again and applied to the source of the waters, so that it is not a question of strength in the cruse, but rather that it was new. Here (@Luke 5) I think the newness denotes strength. The first part of the parable has reference to a piece of cloth, but that figure is not carried through. It is alluded to only to emphasise what the Lord had in His mind. He refers to a new piece of cloth, that is to say, new in the sense of being unmilled or unfinished, as the word used in the corresponding passages in Matthew and Mark means. There was no strength taken out of it by the finishing process. He introduces that thought, which is very obvious, to convey what was in His mind as to the question of strength, and then He carries the thought through in the bottles, that there should be something continued. The new piece of cloth is not referred to again, it simply suggests what is in His mind, but is not referred to as carried through or preserved. In the cloth it is not a question of freshness but of strength; it is new in that sense, but the idea of continuance is in the wine and in the bottles or skins, so that what is in view is strength.
W.J.H. So that Paul and Silas in prison would be two bottles strong enough to hold the wine.
J.T. Just so. Under the greatest pressure from without the strength came out in prayer and praise. That is what comes out in @Luke 6. The Lord spends the whole night in prayer before selecting His apostles. It was an important matter that the selection should be right. Thus we have in Him here an example of *endurance* in prayer -- an important feature in the "bottles". We are to pray and not faint.
A.E.M. Is the old bottle the man after the flesh?
J.T. It is, I think, what Judaism had become. It had come down to be a fleshly thing, and it was not great enough to receive what the Lord was bringing in.
{158}
D.L.H. Is there any thought in the new skins of that which is individual in the way of formation by the Spirit's power, so that the vessel -- each vessel in fact -- is qualified to hold what is put into it? I thought that the cruse is more the thought of what is collective, and that the bottles have the thought of what is very much individual. I do not know whether I am right in that thought.
J.T. No doubt the individual side is in view in the bottles, but the thought must culminate in what is collective. The allusion is to the bottling of wine in a vineyard and so the plural had to be used, for one bottle would not suffice in the figure. The Lord was speaking of the strength needed in that which should contain the new wine. The twelve men at Ephesus received the Holy Spirit at one time under the same circumstances; in them I think you have what was to develop into that which should contain the new thing in its fullest sense, that is, through Paul's ministry. I think the new wine acquired its greatest strength through the apostle's ministry. The word for 'new' here signifies what is fresh, young, so that the strength would increase rather than diminish.
R.B. I notice you made a point that the cruse was open, but these bottles would appear to be closed vessels.
J.T. I think there is a good deal in that. We all know, if we know anything about wine, that the bottle ought to be kept closed. I think the bottles signify the contents kept in -- the idea of the mystery is in it, things are *hid*. The wine should be kept in to maintain it in its strength.
H.F.N. Would you kindly say a word as to the previous incidents in the chapter? Do they show how the bottles are formed? Would it begin with Peter?
J.T. Yes, I think that is a good suggestion.
{159}
@Chapter 5 is from the divine side; @chapter 6 the result in us in the main, "Blessed are ye poor", etc. @Chapter 5 begins with men taken up out of their business relations. I believe that our businesses are more in view in the gospels than we may have thought. The great servants of the dispensation -- the leading apostles -- are introduced in their business relations. Then what comes out as expressed in the next paragraph is that there is a state of sinfulness in the leprous man. Then the Lord cleanses the man who was full of leprosy. There has to be a definite judgment of sin in relation to our businesses. So the Lord cleanses the leper by a touch, and afterwards He Himself is seen without in desert places and praying. Then it says that there was power there to heal them all. The next case is the paralytic who is healed and who goes to his house, and then we have the Lord entertained in Levi's house; that is to say, there is a chain of adjustment in the soul, until the Lord acquires a place in the house.
The relation between the business and the house is obvious. My house should be according to my business normally. If I am governed by natural considerations, the Lord will not be considered. The guests in the house here were publicans and sinners, such as the Lord would wish to have.
Ques. Do the bottles suggest the new capacity given by the Spirit of God in the soul?
J.T. I was just endeavouring to follow out what was suggested, that the chapter really lays the basis from the divine side for the bottles; that is, that if we are to have part in the new heavenly thing that is coming in, the moral steps indicated in the chapter have to be gone through; and so your house is not now a question of your business or social relations. Levi made a great entertainment for Him and the guests were *suited to Him*. They were such as the Lord would have -- publicans and sinners. He had
{160}
come for those, and the Lord confirms the selection of the guests. He says that He had come to call sinful persons to repentance. I think that as you proceed in the chapter you see what underlies the bottles, because in the testimony we should be marked by all these features. Then in @chapter 6 what the saints are, as the subjects of the work of God comes out. The Lord lifted up His eyes *upon His disciples*, and said, "Blessed are ye poor", etc. We have also instructions and exhortations, so that we should be adjusted and formed as "new bottles".
J.J. Then would you suggest that persons who are not right in their businesses and in their houses would not be strong enough to contain this testimony?
J.T. If you look at the next chapter in this gospel, you have first, as I said, the Lord spending the night in prayer to God, then He descends into a level place with the twelve, and lifting up His eyes upon His disciples, He said, "Blessed are ye poor". That is the thing, because the wealth accruing from riches is sure to damage the bottle.
H.H. Do you think it means literally poor?
J.T. Well, there it is. "Blessed are ye poor". That is the first thing He mentions here, and the first thing He mentions after He speaks of being anointed is that the gospel is preached to the poor. See @chapter 4: 18.
J.C.S. Would you say that there is in a way a very narrow boundary between our business and the world, and the strength of the vessel would be greatly tested in that connection?
J.T. "Blessed are ye poor" has its voice at the present time, I am sure. We must beware of growing rich through our businesses. The snare is great.
C.H.W. Why should God choose the poor? @James 2: 5 says, "Has not God chosen the poor as to the world?"
J.T. The apostle says, "consider your calling,
{161}
brethren". You have to look around and see whom God has called -- the kind of people He has chosen.
C.H.W. Christ is spoken of as "a poor wise man".
J.T. It says definitely, "For your sakes he, being rich, became poor" (@2 Corinthians 8: 9). I only just touch on that because I think it enters into the question of the bottles; the relation in the chapter between a man's business and his house should be noted. Levi corresponds with Peter, the chapter presenting sequence.
E.S.H. "Silver and gold I have not" (@Acts 3: 6).
J.T. That is how the dispensation began; that is what would correspond with the new bottle. "Silver and gold I have I not". "Look on us". That is a most searching thing, because in relation to the gospel you must be prepared to say that; not that you would actually say it, but you must be prepared for people to look on you and see just what you are in your locality -- what there is in your business and in your house.
H.F.N. Would you mind saying why you selected the gospel of Luke, seeing this incident comes in in Matthew and Mark? What is the great feature of Luke?
J.T. I was really thinking of the other narratives, but Luke *adds* one thing, and that is, "no one having drunk old wine straightway wishes for new, for he says, The old is better". He shows the difficulty of giving up the old, and the importance of laying aside what ministers to the old and makes the old palatable.
E.R. Is that the legal system which gives man an importance?
J.T. No doubt.
H.H. Do you think, @2 Corinthians 6 would apply at all, where the apostle brings before the Corinthians that their hearts needed to be expanded?
J.T.. Yes. They were narrowed in their affections through worldliness. They needed expansion towards
{162}
himself and towards each other, also to take in the truth in its fulness.
W.C.G. Do you think if a man's bottle is equal to what is in him, he is marked by power? Peter said, "Such as I have".
J.T. Quite. He was in keeping with what he had.
D.L.H. But the man is the bottle, is he not?
J.T. The man is the bottle, but he is liable to be affected by worldly things, so that he is not equal to what he professes to have. This is seen collectively at Corinth. In Galatia it also appears, for they were going back to law.
P.L. Do you see this with Elihu? You were saying the wine is to be preserved and better for keeping. He said, "Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new flasks, it is ready to burst" (@Job 32: 19).
J.T. Quite so; he was ready to burst. But you do not get that in christianity. You do not get the thing ready to burst; the bottle is strong enough. But still, there is a remarkable analogy, because he was able to keep the thing till the right moment came for him to speak. He spoke in that way to show the power of the truth in him.
W.J.H. As the Lord gets hold of us in relation to our business, and the question of sin is judged in our own souls, and our hearts are held for Him, there is preparation in that way for a vessel to contain the wine.
J.T. Your circumstances are to be in keeping with the new wine. I have no doubt the garment alludes to one's circumstances. You have in the types leprosy in a garment and leprosy in the skin. We have to be on our guard against these things. There the skin refers to profession, I think.
J.J. Do you think the condition Luke gives is expressive of what would come in by Paul? "Straightway wishes for new".
{163}
J.T. I think he says that to show the great strength of the old, so that you should be on your guard against it, and not ministering to it or providing for it. The old intrudes itself in many ways.
In our chapter we have the idea of fasting too, following out the suggestion that has been made, which I think is most helpful. Why did they not fast? Of course, fasting is right, but not till the bridegroom has left them. "Then shall they fast in those days". Fasting is to reduce. There are to be fasting and prayer; the one shuts out the flesh, and the other brings in God.
J.C.S. That would increase the strength of the bottle.
J.T. It would. It is a question for each as to how to be in the strength suggested in the new bottle. That is the point. We have had wonderful things handed down to us, but what about the containing vessels? As already remarked, we have the plural here, but the thought is to call attention to the strength required in what was to contain the new thing which was coming in from heaven. That, of course, is the assembly, and it is composed of the saints.
E.J.McB. I suppose that in the type the newer the bottle the stronger. So that, if we were fresher we should be stronger.
P.L. Would the expression, "A vessel ... meet for the master's use" enter into it?
J.T. It would in the sense that it might be used for containing purposes. The stone waterpots were filled up to the brim.
J.C.S. Would the idea of the bottle be seen in what the Lord said to the apostle when he was taken up, that he was to be a minister?
J.T. The apostle was equal to it morally. He says, "we have this treasure in earthen vessels" (@2 Corinthians 4: 7). He knew the value of the treasure, and the vessel was
{164}
equal to it. God helped him in discipline to maintain the vessel in accord with the treasure that was in it. I think 2 Corinthians shows that after the first letter Paul could open up the idea of a vessel. He set it out in himself; "we have this treasure in earthen vessels", but, in saying that, he deals with what he was personally, and he was a model for them.
H.D'A.C. But you would not put the earthen vessel on the same line as the bottle, for the earthen vessel breaks.
J.T. I am referring to what Paul was morally as outlined in that chapter; that whilst God disciplined him, the life of Jesus was displayed in his body. He begins by speaking about renouncing the hidden things of darkness "by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God" (verse 2), and he goes on to show that, "If also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost" (verse 3). All about him was in keeping with the truth; he was equal to it. His body might be dissolved, or swallowed up of life, but that is another thing. While in the body *he had* the treasure.
H.D'A.C. But where does the renewal of the man come in in that chapter? Is that allied to the vessel in any way?
J.T. I am sure it is. He is renewed day by day. Paul alluded to his body in speaking of the earthen vessel, but the moral thing underlay that. "We have this treasure in earthen vessels".
H.H. Would the thought of enlargement come in in your way of looking at it? The skin would expand and allow for that when the wine was put into it. Is the vessel made suitable in that way?
J.T. Yes; its elasticity would enhance its strength.
H.H. "In pressure thou hast enlarged me" (@Psalm 4: 1).
D.L.H. And is there not a suggestion, in a way, of the expansive force of the wine that is put into
{165}
the vessel, and the vessel which would be suited to hold this new force?
J.T. I think that leads to what was in one's mind. The Lord said in His instructions when He sent Peter and John to prepare the passover, "He will shew you a large upper room" (@Luke 22: 12). The Lord had in mind, I believe, in this instruction the great influx of persons that should result from the preaching of the gospel; then, too, in the first part of the Acts we read, "they were all together in one place", and the Holy Spirit came. Now, they were not disconcerted in any way, they were not perturbed; the thing was expected, and they were ready for it. In contrast to that we find that when the Lord came in after He rose, they were *not* prepared for it. They were not as great then as they were at Pentecost. There is not the slightest indication of any perturbation or inconvenience when the Spirit came; indeed, what happened was that they began to speak *as the Spirit gave them utterance*. There was room for the Spirit to move even in regard of their articulating organs; all that shows the formation there was.
Ques. Do you look on every believer, in receiving the Holy Spirit, as being a new skin -- a new bottle?
J.T. Certainly. Potentially he is; but it is a question of how great I am morally. When the Holy Spirit came in, there were there one hundred and twenty as far as we can reckon. If you were to take the greatest men on earth at that time, selected out of Greece and Rome, what would they have done under such circumstances? But these men were prepared for it; they were great enough for it. Then, later on, the Holy Spirit says there were three thousand added. It is mentioned to show the great influx from the first sermon, and there is not the slightest evidence of any inconvenience.
H.D'A.C. What do you mean by inconvenience?
J.T. Well, if we take the question of rooms, you
{166}
say, where are they going to meet? Where did they meet? Who can tell? Three thousand persons added, it is quite a number, and yet there is not the slightest evidence of any inconvenience at all. They broke bread "in the house", we read. They knew what to do.
.E.J.McB. Was your thought that the Lord had actually secured in the first incident a bottle sufficiently strong to stand, speaking reverently, the presence of the Holy Spirit, and then, as the thing enlarged, its capacity stood the enlargement?
J.T. That is it, exactly. Here is the greatest thing come in from heaven -- heaven's maximum in the way of gift, for that is how the Lord puts it Himself. "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" (@Luke 11: 13). The Holy Spirit Himself comes in and there is not the slightest evidence of any perturbation or excitement whatever.
E.J.McB. And in contrast to that, earlier they had actually been afraid when the Lord came in.
J.T. They were not equal to it then, but the forty days during which the Lord had been with them as risen had intervened.
W.J.H. When the angel appeared to Manoah, he was afraid.
J.T. That illustrates it. But in a man like Abraham, you have one who was perfectly equal to a divine visitation. It is a question of moral greatness. See @Genesis 18.
D.L.H. But then that is a question of formation. Being sealed of the Holy Spirit is, of course, characteristic, properly speaking, of every christian, but is there not the idea of formation by the Spirit? That seems to me to be suggested rather in the thought of the skin -- the bottle -- that which the Spirit has actually formed by His operations in the soul, so that
{167}
it is equal in the power of the Spirit to what God may do.
J.T. I think that is right, only you would admit, as our brother suggests, that any one sealed is potentially a bottle?
D.L.H. Quite so.
R.S.S. Do you see development brought about in those present on the day of Pentecost?
J.T. Certainly, development from what had marked them earlier, as we said; @Luke 6. I think as you look at this chapter, you get the main features of the bottles. We cannot go into it now, only to mention it. The Lord shows that He made His selection after a whole night in prayer, which is an important thing to notice; @Luke 6: 12. As remarked already, He sets an example of endurance in prayer; and then later He looks on His disciples as if recognising what they had become as under His influence and teaching.
R.S.S. And then it says in Mark, "that they might be with him". That would bring about a certain development in their souls, and then they would be acquainted with Him in resurrection and also in ascension, and thus further development be brought about which enabled them to carry themselves on the day of Pentecost in the way in which they did.
J.T. They were the subjects of His own handiwork, and they were formed by what they saw in Him. We were remarking this morning on the objective environment -- what the Lord was as with them. At the baptism of John, He is seen praying as He is baptised, and then the Holy Spirit comes in a bodily form, and abode upon Him; and during all His ministry amongst them, the Holy Spirit was there and known to be there in Him. Well, the disciples had to be brought to that; they were to receive the Holy Spirit, and hence the qualities of
{168}
Christ in the way of power had to be worked out in them, and I think, as you said, the education during the forty days greatly augmented them. His own first visit to them after He rose perturbed them greatly, but here is the Holy Spirit coming in from heaven, and there is not the slightest intimation that there is any perturbation at all, and they spoke as He gave them utterance. They were subject to the Spirit immediately. Supposing you have a great gift from the Lord and you are not formed, you will not speak as the Spirit gives you utterance. You will begin to study oratory. That is what people do who are not formed, and you can understand it, but what you find in these vessels is that they spoke as the Spirit gave them utterance. They were prepared, as I said.
H.H. It is remarkable that men were there from every nation under heaven and they admitted they heard the wonderful things of God in their own language wherein they were born. The men who spoke had been formed by the Lord.
W.C.G. Do you think Paul had the same thought of strengthening in mind when he said, "Admonishing every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ" (@Colossians 1: 28).
J.T. Just so.
H.F.N. Do you think that Peter, in the vision he had later on, was not wholly equal at that moment to the light that was coming in, and did the Lord's dealings with him increase the strength of the bottle so that he could take in the light?
J.T. I think so, but at the very beginning as the numbers increased -- we have it mentioned twice, three thousand and five thousand -- they were ready for it, but then there was on the other side what came in from heaven. What comes in from heaven goes with that; I think they should run together, that is
{169}
what comes in from heaven, and what comes in as the result of the testimony. There was steady increase and yet no inconvenience or anything uncomely. The bottles were marked by strength. I think that is the thing.
J.C.S. So there is not a drop of wine lost here.
J.B.C-l. Do you think the apostle Paul was concerned, when speaking to the elders at Ephesus as to the test that would come upon the saints in relation to the ministry they had received through him? One of the things he states is that he had not shunned to declare the whole counsel of God. He evidently felt that would be the test. Historically it comes out that it was so, because many apparently left him when he brought in the heavenly side of his ministry. It does not say they left the profession, but evidently they had not acquired a taste for the new, for they turned away from Paul. Is your exercise that the time may have come when the Lord will test brethren as to the ministry they have received?
J.T. I am sure that is true. His intent is that the saints should be morally equal to what they have received.
E.J.McB. Had you any thought in your mind that the Lord might add to us many of His people who are around us?
J.T. Do you think we are equal to it?
E.J.McB. I would like a ministry that would enable us to be.
J.T. Supposing the Lord brought in a distinguished gift in P -- -- -- -- . How would you feel about it?
E.J.McB. I think we would receive him with open arms, even if it displaces us.
J.T. Well, do you think it is so generally? Do think we would like our localities invaded by men who are our equals, or even our superiors?
E.J.McB. I believe what you raise is a very grave question, but I think the interests of Christ
{170}
would become more real to us if vessels were raised up even above ourselves.
J.T. I hope so. I take the matter to myself, but it should be an exercise as to whether we are ready for what God may do in the way of gift and addition in every way.
H.D'A.C. Were not these early disciples very specially prepared so that they could begin at once to do what they had to, whereas in these days perhaps it takes years with many of us before we are much equal to any service? Is it not so? Likewise with Paul, the apostle was ready at once for the service.
J.T. He was, but were the brethren ready for him?
H.D'A.C. No, I do not think they were, but at Pentecost they were all ready.
J.T. If Paul had been brought in at Pentecost, they would have gladly received him, but the Lord had to go before to prepare the brethren to receive Paul at Damascus, and Barnabas had to introduce him at Jerusalem.
E.J.McB. That evidently touches on an interesting fact in regard of this line of exercise, that is, the different view of the position as seen in @Acts 2 at the start and our present position today, for there it was pretty evident that the vessel was adequate to the occasion.
J.T. So I think if Paul had come in then, there would have been no question, and that is what one is exercised about. How much can we stand of that? If God brings in to your locality men or a man of greater calibre, are you equal to it? God is entitled to do that. He has "set certain in the assembly", and He can do that. Still, am I equal to it? Then again, if God is pleased to work and bring in a large number in any locality, are we prepared to take account of that and house those people according to God?
{171}
D.L.H. If we have got our hearts set on the assembly, surely we would thank God for every one He would send along who would help the saints or be a real blessing in that way. I mean, any thought of self is a perfect abomination in the assembly of God.
J.T. Well, it is, but then, while that is quite obvious, are we always in accord with it?
E.J.McB. Then that raises an interesting thought in relation to the remark you made in regard of the skins. While there is no doubt whatever the old bottles were skins, they were not skins capable of containing new wine. Very often, the opposition does not come from what is not skins, but from *old* skins.
W.J.H. Barnabas seemed to be equal up to a point. At any rate, he went and brought Saul to Antioch, where God was adding. He was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit.
J.T. I think he came in where he was needed, and the apostles were also equal to the acquisition; it was for that reason that they surnamed him. You have to surname the man that comes in, that is, you have to make room for what God has wrought in him. Barnabas was a "son of consolation". That requires discernment, which enables one to know what an incomer is capable of.
Ques. Would our ability to answer to such a test be the place the Lord has with us individually? That is where we would be tested.
J.T. I am sure the brethren are tested all over the world on that very point. The test at any time is whether we can make room for what God is doing. I believe if there is little done it is because there is little room. On the one hand, there is generally but little expectation that God will act, and on the other, little preparation if He does act.
E.J.McB. Now, in regard of the cruse, was your
{172}
thought as to it the basic principle on which this can operate?
J.T. I think so. I think that comes first.
E.J.McB. We have peace amongst ourselves as having the salt in us.
J.T. Yes, and you have things preserved. Thank God if our doctrine is pure and we are able to discriminate in regard of those whom we receive, and we seek to maintain holiness in God's house. But look at the greatness of God and the greatness of the work of God! Think of what He may do if there is sufficient moral greatness for it! Hence Ephesians answers fully to what we are saying. The apostle's prayers in that epistle have in view this very thing, that there should be first that expansion in the way of intelligence to take in the great things of God -- to take in what is *for Him*, and then, secondly, to apprehend the greatness of the things into which *we* are brought.
H.H. It lies, as you were saying, in the thought of the large upper room furnished. We have to keep that before us.
J.T. I thought that would help, because the Lord provided in that for what should come in, and what you find in the three thousand added at once is that they merged with the others. It does not say the Lord added them in verse 41. The point there is not that; but that so many *were added*, and they were in keeping with that to which they were added; hence, it was a work of God. "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". They were in keeping with the thing. In verse 47 it is stated that the *Lord* added.
F.S.M. Would the thought of the new wine admit of the holy, pure, and heavenly joy in contradistinction to natural experience? How much that is associated with the thought of joy. If we were more truly happy, how the Lord might use that in
{173}
attractiveness to those who are sad and without that joy.
J.T. What one finds is that one has more light than joy. I fear but little is known of the blessedness of the new wine. The wine is new in the sense of being young, fresh, and increasing; the bottles are new as *different* from what existed before; and strong, in the sense of being contrary to what is around religiously.
G.W.W. Do you think the Spirit ever proposes anything to us for which He has not prepared us? Do you not think there is a work that goes on that renders one capable to receive what is proposed? The Spirit is always seeking to strengthen the vessel in view of a higher appreciation of this joy. But the strengthening of the vessel has to go on before it is capable of receiving a fresh accession of light, whether individually or in a company of saints.
J.T. Quite. I have no doubt that God came in when conditions at Jerusalem waned. The strength of the bottles, so to speak, had not been maintained. Barnabas coming in had that in view; it required that element of interest in what God was doing. The question was what God was doing now since Jerusalem was weakening. At Pentecost it was equal to what God was doing, but the later chapters show it was weakening. As an illustration or proof Peter was in prison, and it says that continual prayer was made by the assembly to God for him, and God answered. But when the answer came they were not ready for it. Rhoda comes in and says, Peter is knocking outside, that is, God is acting. No, they say, you must be mad. The bottle was not there; they were not equal to what God was doing, even in that. But then Peter continued knocking, for that is the way; God keeps at it. And then, sure enough, it was Peter, but the vessel was weakening. But now there was a Barnabas, and he was in touch with what
{174}
God was doing outside. He heard about what had happened at Damascus, a long way off, and he brought Saul to the apostles at Jerusalem, and later on went to Tarsus to seek for him and brought him to Antioch. It says that he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit. He was a bottle in that sense, He represents the idea, I think, when Jerusalem was waning. He had no thought of himself at all, and it was necessary that there should be such a man as that, because God was going to bring in the greatest accession of light, and it was very important that there should be preparation for it, and Barnabas is the link for it.
R.B. So you refer to the new bottle as having regard to the assembly; new, as contrasted with Judaism, which was not capable of holding what God had to give.
J.T. Yes. I think the newness is in the strength of it.
A.L.O. Why do you say the wine had to be kept in?
J.T. I think that means the mystery; the new bottle represents the ability in us to cherish the precious things of God, so that we do not profane them by bringing them down to the level of man's mind. The thing is to be preserved in its integrity. But I think it is very beautiful to see how Barnabas meets the contingency that was arising. When he takes Paul and introduces him at Jerusalem, they gave to him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship. Then, I think, the bottle is developed at Antioch, and later at Ephesus. What you find is that Barnabas and Saul laboured; they laboured at Antioch in the assembly, and then it says that there were such and such in the assembly that was there -- a number of gifted men -- such men as were needed for the new development of the work of God. That is what you get.
{175}
E.J.McB. Would you say a word as to the twelve men at Ephesus?
J.T. I think what I said leads up to that. You have indicated, it seems to me, under the influence of Paul and Barnabas, the development of the bottle, of that which is great enough to take in the new thing that was coming in. Anyone can see that the basis henceforth is Antioch and not Jerusalem, although in the wisdom of God the link with Jerusalem was preserved. So Barnabas and Paul go out and there is a wonderful work of God -- an extraordinary work of God. They come back to Antioch and relate what had been done, and things are quite normal. There is no evidence of anything abnormal. Antioch is quite in keeping with the new work -- this great work of God through these men. I think that is how the thing is seen in the Acts. From chapter 11 to 15 everything is operating in relation to Antioch; after chapter 15 you have Europe, and all that God did through Paul in Europe, and I think that would link on with Ephesus -- the great work in Asia.
Ques. How do you account for the fact that Barnabas was not quite equal to that?
J.T. There again you have the bottle weakening. What he shines in at the beginning, he breaks down in at the end. There is a warning in that.
Rem. We would not like to compare ourselves with such a man as Barnabas, but it is wholesome for us to consider the fact of his breakdown.
J.T. The thing is to be great enough morally for what God is doing -- that you are able to take it in. There must be no natural feeling or rivalry.
G.W.W. Do you think that in @John 17 we have the Lord speaking to His Father in view of this new vessel?
J.T. I do, indeed. The position of the saints here in testimony is mainly in view there.
{176}
G.W.W. Then one was thinking and connecting it with what you were saying about the work at Jerusalem, and then Antioch, and then Ephesus, and then Philadelphia, and finally the new Jerusalem. It is all on that line; the new bottle is there, and the comfort for us today is to be found in the fact that in Philadelphia you have the Spirit bringing about the present answer to Christ's prayer.
H.F.N. Do you see a link between the twelve apostles in @Luke 12 and the twelve men at Ephesus?
J.T. It is "about twelve" at Ephesus, but I think *twelve* being mentioned has a spiritual meaning, and this underlies the great structure that Paul reared up. Twelve is a complete administrative idea. They received the Holy Spirit at one time by the laying on of the apostle's hands, and this would greatly tend to unity and strength. In connection with this, you have the rearing up of the assembly at Ephesus. @Acts 20 and the epistle to the Ephesians would show that this assembly expressed pre-eminently the strength of the new bottles.
Ques. Would you say a word why the apostles select Barnabas to go to Antioch? When he goes there, he is struck again with the great light that God has sent, and he goes again and seeks out Paul. Why would you say the apostles sent him again?
J.T. I think they saw what God was doing. Barnabas is to be regarded as a special provision to meet a certain emergency. God is always doing these things, and the saints would do well to take note of them. They were great enough at Jerusalem to take note of it. They saw the link between the work among the Gentiles and Jerusalem, and the report of it reaching the ears of the assembly there, they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.
A.S.L. Barnabas had salt in himself.
{177}
J.T. "He was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith". Thus he was peculiarly fitted to overcome any national feelings or prejudices that may have existed, so that unity was maintained in relation to the work of God, as it was then extending out among the nations.
{178}
THE NEW MAN
@Colossians 3: 9 - 17; Ephesians 4: 17 - 25
Ques. Could you give a short summary of what was before us yesterday for the sake of those who were not here?
J.T. Our subject in all four meetings is one, that is, it embraces the features of christianity that are spoken of as *new* under four distinct heads: the new cruse, which we considered yesterday morning; the new bottles, which we considered yesterday afternoon; the new man, which we propose to consider on this occasion; and then the new Jerusalem, which it is thought should be considered this afternoon.
At our first reading we dealt with the new cruse, reading from @2 Kings 2, part of @Acts 1, and the closing verses of Mark 9, to bring out a little the preservative element in what was left here by the Lord as formed by Him. The vessel, or cruse, it was thought, was seen in @Acts 1, and the new features were noted. Then the salt put into it was particularly enlarged on in a practical way, as showing how divine things are preserved in freshness amongst the people of God. Then, in the afternoon, the closing verses of @Luke 5 were read, which speak of the parable of the new cloth and the old garment, the new wine and the new bottles, in conjunction with the opening and closing verses of @Acts 2, to point out the strength of the vessels into which the Spirit came; how the assembly at the beginning was great enough, or rather those who formed the assembly, were great enough to receive the Spirit. There was no evidence of any incongruity in the away they behaved. With the presence of the Holy Spirit in them they were equal to the further increase, as it were, from heaven through the apostles ministry -- the vessels were great
{179}
enough for it -- and great enough also for the influx of converts through the gospel. So in that way it was a question in the bottles rather of moral greatness and strength.
E.J.McB. The general impression in my own mind in the morning, was that we reached the thought of what was preservative, and the feeling in relation to peace among ourselves; and in the afternoon we saw the importance of there being a vessel here that would answer to any outpouring that God might give in relation to it, so that whether it was a question of increase of spiritual capacity it would stand it, or an increase of numbers in the saints it would stand that too.
J.T. Our subject on this occasion, as has been remarked, is the new man, which obviously presents a different line of thought, and I think what may be borne in mind to begin with is that the new man is what is for God in the midst of what is old and corrupt; first, as in Colossians in the way of freshness in the energy of life, and then secondly in Ephesians, as a creation, a positive creation marked by what stands in the midst of the corruption, and holds for God in that freshness. It is "created in truthful righteousness and holiness", and the renewing in the spirit of the mind involves that that is maintained in freshness. The word, "being renewed", would indicate that what is created does not grow old; it remains fresh.
A.S.L. What is the thought of the new man in Colossians being spoken of as fresh, and in Ephesians as what is entirely new? What is the precise point? You said something about it with regard to life.
J.T. In Colossians there is that in the new man that is fresh as a child is to its parents -- the freshness of life. The *knowledge* that marks it is of a *different* kind. The idea of youthfulness is not in that knowledge. "Renewed in knowledge" is not the idea of
{180}
youthfulness, but knowledge that is different, whereas in Ephesians the *creation* is *different*. It is a new man "created in truthful righteousness and holiness", and the renewal of the spirit of the mind is what conveys the idea of youthfulness. There is remarkable wisdom in the use of the words; perhaps you know that better than I do.
A.S.L. It is very interesting and practical. It is new in Ephesians in the sense of that which never was before -- the new man created new altogether, but then kept fresh.
J.T. Kept fresh. The "being renewed in the spirit of your mind" is the youthful thought in Ephesians, whereas in Colossians "renewed into full knowledge" is the thought of a different kind of knowledge.
E.J.McB. Then is the Ephesian thought to secure something that never gets old?
J.T. That is what I thought. There the word 'new' means it is different, whereas the renewal of the spirit of the mind is, it is kept youthful. There are two words used in the original in Colossians, the new man is youthful and the knowledge is different; "renewed" there is not the idea of youthfulness, because it is to the image of Him who created him.
G.J.E. Was there anything in the reading of Colossians first?
J.T. I thought we might consider what is for God in youthfulness first. We have, I think, indications in the Old Testament of what God found, or intended to find, through the death and resurrection and ascension of Christ. For instance, in @Genesis 1 the earth emerges from death, as you might say, and we have immediately the evidence of life, and, as is obvious, in peculiar freshness. The earth coming up out of the waters brought forth by the divine word grass, herbs, and trees. There would be nothing old there. The life obviously would be all fresh and new. A delightful scene it would be for any one capable of
{181}
taking it in. I think in measure as the earth emerged from the deluge, there would be that also. Things began over again.
A.S.L. And new in the sense of what never existed, coming out in freshness.
J.T. Then again in regard of persons -- the Israelites coming out of Egypt: "When Israel was a child, then I loved him" (@Hosea 11: 1). There God was taking account of the freshness of the affections that marked them as coming out of Egypt through the Red Sea. Then again he speaks of "the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown. Israel was holiness unto Jehovah, the firstfruits of his increase" (@Jeremiah 2: 2, 3). There was that beautiful freshness in them that delighted God, and though He would have preserved them, Ephraim grew old and developed grey hairs: "grey hairs are here and there upon him" (@Hosea 7: 9). So in Romans 6: 4 you have the same thought: "so we also should walk in newness of life". The word there is not the same as here, I admit, but still there would be what was for God, the "newness of spirit" and "the renewing of your mind". All these things, I think, lead up to what we have formally stated here as the "new man".
A.S.L. Newness of life would be a kind of life that had never been before.
J.T. Yes, in Romans, that is the force of the word "new" used throughout.
A.S.L. "Newness of spirit" in Romans 7: 6 is the same word -- quite a new kind of thing.
J.T. And so, too, the renewal of the mind in chapter 12.
P.L. Do you distinguish in that way between the words in @Genesis 1? "In the beginning God created". Would that go with the Ephesian thought? Then
{182}
later, "God made". Would that go with the Colossian thought?
J.T. It is interesting to note that you have not got the word 'made' in connection with the new man in Colossians, but you have it in Ephesians. In chapter 2 you have the word 'formed' in regard of the new man: "that he might form the two in himself into one new man". He is not only created, he is formed. I think that the distinction would be like what we get in @Genesis 1; that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Whatever there was we do not know; whatever there was for God is not stated, but when you come to the third day of creation, you have life for the first time, and it is in the sense that we are speaking of it. Then on the fifth day, you have animal life. In @Isaiah 45: 18 we read, "he formed it to be inhabited".
R.B. How do you speak of the new man as having the Lord Himself in view?
J.T. Well, it would only be as a pattern. I do not think it ever speaks of Him directly in that way.
R.B. Not personally.
J.T. It would be in the sense of the race. We have in Genesis the word 'man' as covering one person; it is used to designate Adam when there were no other men; then you find it as designating the whole race. The new man would refer to what Christ is in character rather than what He is personally; it could not refer to Him personally. True enough, He was a different kind of man, but He was not a creation. Of course, as come personally into manhood, He was necessarily a different kind of man, but then the new man is said to be created, therefore you could not apply it to the Lord personally, but you can apply it as referring to His character. The old man, as a race, took its character from Adam, and so we take our character from Christ, only that the new man is definitely a creation. It is not the idea of a
{183}
person at all. It is the idea of the character of those who have put it on.
E.J.McB. The pattern from which life characteristically is formed is Christ.
F.H.B. What came out in Christ as a Man is seen characteristically in the saints.
A.S.L. You could not have the new man without Christ as model and pattern, any more than you could have the old man without Adam. It is a collective thought, is it not?
J.T. Yes, it is. It includes all the saints; it is not their persons exactly, but their character, what they are characteristically, as already said.
J.J. Would the new man be illustrated in @Acts 3? You have mentioned chapters 1 and 2 in connection with the other two points. The freshness of the man leaping up, walking and praising God, and then the times of the restitution of all things being brought to light.
J.T. Well, quite. The new man was there characteristically in Peter and John, and then, too, in the man that was healed.
Ques. Does it connect with the second Man out of heaven?
J.T. That would enter into it, but the idea stated of the second Man is that He is "out of heaven". It refers to the Lord personally. We take character from Him as heavenly. The idea of the new man has in view our being in the midst of what is still old. We shall not speak of the new man in eternity. Of course, when you come to new creation, you do not get any designations of contrasts, for all things have become new.
J.J. What connection is there between the new cruse and the new bottles and the new man?
J.T. The new cruse involves preservation, as we have been seeing, and the new bottles, being containing vessels, refer to how things are contained here.
{184}
It is how the things of God are contained -- a vessel great enough to contain what came in. But in the new man it is not that at all. It is not either of those things. Of course they all run together, but the new man is what is for God, and what is here thus in testimony in contrast to the old man. It is *put on*, as the old is put off.
E.J.McB. Would it not be right to say that in the new man both of those thoughts of preservation and containing are conserved?
J.T. No doubt there is a sort of constructive line of thought leading up to the heavenly city, but you can see in the new man what is for God. The man is for God. I think if we bear that in mind, we can understand that ultimately it will be God and men. I think in the new man we are in the presence of what is for God, not exactly in the future, but now, in the midst of what is corrupt, in the midst of what is under death and decay. There is that which is fresh and which continues fresh and which is incapable of being contaminated or corrupted.
W.C.G. Would you say that the new man is the testimony and in having part in the new man we have part in the testimony?
J.T. That is the effect of it, but I think it is what is for God first. I quite go with the thought of the testimony which the Lord may make clear, but I think we should see what is for God. Compare @Colossians 3: 12 - 17.
W.J.H. The cruse and the bottles, and indeed the new Jerusalem are vessels, but the new man is not exactly a vessel, it is a character.
J.T. Although we say it is not a person, yet it is a creation involving persons, and primarily that must be for God. It seems to me that if you think of man as a creation you must think of God "by him and for him", we read. Every creature is for God's
{185}
pleasure. "For thy will they were, and they have been created" (@Revelation 4: 11).
Rem. That is the great thought in your mind -- what is for God, for God's pleasure.
J.T. I think we have to keep that before us -- what is fresh, as in the energy of life, and different to what is around.
H.H. And it is what is on the earth. Colossians does not go beyond the earth, does it?
J.T. No, it is what is developed here, I think, in relation to Christ. Christ is the characteristic feature of Colossians.
H.H. Is there not a link between Romans and Colossians which would not come in in regard of Ephesians? I thought there was a sort of past history in regard of Colossians, that is, you could not really, so to speak, be a Lazarus unless you had come under the grace of Christ and divine support previous to that. Colossians would view the saints as risen, but on the earth.
J.T. Just so. I see what you mean. Christ is the dominating feature of Colossians. We are not exactly in the presence of the sphere of divine counsel in Colossians.
P.L. Moses in Psalm 90: 17 says, "let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us", and it says of him in Deuteronomy, that his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated. Would that be what is for God in freshness and life?
J.T. I think that is good. There was the work of God. Psalm 90 contemplates what man is as dying, and then what God would do. "Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy majesty unto their sons. And let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us: yea, the work of our hands, establish thou it" (verses 16, 17). There would be, I think, there the thought of what we have before us, the beauty of the Lord.
{186}
H.F.N. You made a very interesting connection yesterday between the new cruse and @Acts 1, and the new bottles and chapter 2. Is there any point in the history of the Acts where the truth of the new man is developed?
J.T. Speaking of it fully contemplates the Jew and Gentile. In @Acts 3, as has been suggested, you have Peter and John going up to the temple together at the hour of prayer. They went up *together*. I think there was there God's best, as it were -- Peter and John, a beautiful blend of experience and love. They went up together, it says, "into the temple at the hour of prayer", and then the invited the man to look on them. "Look on us". I think that heaven would look on them with supreme delight at that time. In fact, if you take the closing verses of chapter 2 you have the features that we are dwelling upon, in the beautiful relation in which the saints were set; it is not what they were *told* to do, but what marked them, as it were, naturally; I mean, of course, in a spiritual sense.
There were added three thousand on "that day", and, as we remarked, there was no inconvenience. There is seen to be ample accommodation, and then the Spirit goes on to tell us what marked them, not in the way of obedience to a commandment, but what they did. "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" (@Acts 2: 42). And no one counted anything they had as their own. They continued in a happy mutual state, and it says that they broke bread in the house. I think that there must have been a great many houses in Jerusalem. The wide reference to the house in the Lord's ministry must have had in view what would come in as the Holy Spirit came down -- the great influx of converts, so that they should be properly housed, that they should be under hospitable roofs, as it were, where family affections should be
{187}
developed. We do not know whether there were any halls in Jerusalem large enough to accommodate such numbers; I do not suppose there were any such, but they were not without accommodation.
I think the Lord had prepared houses for the saints, so that there must have been a great many houses for the breaking of bread. They broke bread "in the house", that is to say, not in any particular house, but house-wise, as we might say; the whole scene must have been perfectly delightful to heaven. It was the immediate result of the testimony of the Spirit here. Peter and John, I think, would be, as it were, the very cream of that in the way of intelligence, and experience, and love. They were perfectly united, for the Spirit says they went up *together* to the temple.
J.B.C-l. It seems significant that the first great interruption to what you speak of was on the line of untruthfulness. The bringing in of the lie against the Holy Spirit was the first great interruption of what had been separated in the power of the Spirit.
J.T. That is a most important remark, because one has felt of late the peculiar influence of lying, which is, as you might say, the first mark, indeed, the characteristic feature of the old man. How it comes up in difficulties of local matters -- a spirit of untruthfulness. You can hardly fasten it on anyone, and yet there it is. As soon as a local difficulty arises you have an untruthful spirit, and hence in Colossians it says, "Do not lie to one another" (@Colossians 3: 9), and in Ephesians, "having put off falsehood" (@Ephesians 4: 25). I believe that the traits of the new man would be the antidote; "The law of truth was in his mouth" is said of Levi; @Malachi 2: 6. It is not only that he says the thing literally that is true, but the *law* of truthfulness is there. He will not deceive you whatever he says to you. He will convey what is true, whereas a man who has not got that law in his mouth might say true
{188}
things, and yet leave you with an untrue impression.
G.W.W. That is the very opposite to what came out in Christ. When they asked Him who He was, He said, "Altogether that which I also say to you" (@John 8: 25). There you have truth.
J.J. So the new man would be transparent like the heavenly city.
J.T. And as was remarked, this beautiful thing that came in consequent upon the ministry of the Spirit was interrupted by untruthfulness. It was the old man working, as you might say.
R.S.S. Untruthfulness and lying were immediately exposed in connection with christianity. In the Old Testament lying was passed over. Take Rahab, for instance, and many other instances of the same sort. But when the Lord came into the world, when grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, great account is taken of truthfulness, and so we get the new man "created in truthful righteousness".
J.T. Quite. That is very interesting, and because, of the old man God bore with things then which are simply intolerable now, because we have now got the new. We have discarded the old.
J.C.S. Is the new man God's way of securing in a scene of falsehood and corruption those precious features presented here in Christ?
J.T. That is right; that is just what it is -- the continuance of the features of Christ in the scene of corruption; and it is, I assume, what we should keep before us -- that there should be, however small, at least that.
J.C.S. How would it work out in regard of one another? The primary thought is what is there for the approbation of God.
J.T. That is what I thought. It is seen as it should work out amongst the saints, in the verses we have read; @Colossian 3: 12 - 15.
R.B. How does the word fit in to Laodicea?
{189}
"The faithful and true witness". Does that stand related to what we are speaking of?
J.T. I think it would. Faithfulness is that you are true to what you say, or you are true to what you are entrusted with; it is a great feature. To be true is that there is no deviation from the path; you stand by it in all its features.
W.L. So in the interruption that came in in the early days of christianity, what was said was true but was not the truth.
J.T. Just so; it was not all the truth.
H.F.N. Does it work out in the close of Revelation, where it speaks of those within who have washed their robes and have right to the tree of life, and without is every one that loves and makes a lie? Is the Lord working with us in regard of local difficulties to make us realise what properly belongs to the within and the without, so that in result every one that makes a lie is found without?
J.T. It is very searching and solemn; wisdom is so essential in regard to those difficulties. "But wisdom, where shall it be found?" (@Job 28: 12) and "Thus there is not a wise person among you" (@1 Corinthians 6: 5). Wisdom comes into evidence, I think, in the locating of the offender, so that the least possible damage is done. I believe that one of the greatest things in discipline is that there should be the least possible damage and yet that the offender should be dealt with according to God. So, as you were saying, the one who loves and makes the lie is outside. It seems to me that the peculiar attack at the present time is in local eruptions. In these the features of the old man develop, and the antidote is in the development of the features of the new.
Now in @2 Samuel you have, I think, an antichristian uprising, first of a general character in Absalom (chapter 15), and then of a local character in Sheba (chapter 20). The latter would have made it a general
{190}
thing if he could; he said, "We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, Israel" (@2 Samuel 20: 1). Many went after him, but happily the uprising became local. He was in the city Abel and apparently no other city was involved. Now Joab would have destroyed that city in dealing with the offender, having no thought of saving all the others. His one thought was to destroy the offender, but without any thought of the many that might go down with him. And I believe that is where wisdom comes in. It says there was a wise woman there and she went to all the people in her wisdom -- mark, to *all* the people. In a local matter it is the responsibility of every person there, and you want every person to act, because it is in acting, in taking up the obligation, that one saves oneself and proves oneself clear in the matter. So it says that she went to all the people in her wisdom and they cut off Sheba's head. *They* did it, and threw it over the wall, and the city was saved. The offender was dealt with, but the saints were all saved. There was the least possible damage; there was no damage in regard of anyone, but the evil was dealt with.
It is a question of developing what is new in dealing with these things. It is not certain ones in the company grouping together against others. That is simply the old method -- the old man. We have to revert to new measures, and new measures are wisdom's measures, and wisdom's measures are God's measures, and they are effective.
J.S. Hence the importance of having that which is new in the meeting.
J.T. It is so very easy to group, to take sides in matters, and the meeting become divided. That is not new at all. That marks the world.
H.H. The woman did not undertake to cut off the head of Sheba and throw it over the wall; she spoke to the inhabitants of the city and they did it. The
{191}
principle is important. *I* must not cut off the head of a brother.
J.T. No, you must not. That is very important. Sometimes it is done. All the saints should be brought into such matters.
H.H. In that same scripture you have referred to, the wise woman said, "They were wont to speak in old time, saying, Just inquire in Abel: and so they ended" (@2 Samuel 20: 18).
J.T. I have no doubt the allusion is to what is available locally. It says, "Inquire in Abel", that is where the trouble was. For instance at Corinth -- that is where the trouble was -- they had the means of dealing with it. They might have inquired; they were "temple of God". "Inquire in Abel; and so they ended".
A.S.L. The wise woman did not dwell at Corinth.
J.T. Apparently there was no wise woman there. The apostle says, "Thus there is not a wise person among you" (@1 Corinthians 6: 5).
G.J.E. The elements set forth in the wise woman, and her being able to influence the city, one would desire to be found in every local gathering.
J.T. That is just what I was thinking. 1 Corinthians develops wisdom, but it is called "hidden wisdom", and I believe that is available in the temple, and it is wisdom that was predetermined before the ages for our glory. So we have resources that existed before the world; all will remember the well-known allusion to Hebron -- that it was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt. His princes were at Zoan. It would appear to be the place of worldly wisdom, and I believe that many of us are there in dealing with assembly matters, bringing in the ordinary methods of the world in grouping together locally, one against another, instead of resorting to inquiry together as the temple. Then you get at the resources that were before the world, and so you are sure to
{192}
undo what Satan is doing. They are the only methods, the only resources capable of undoing what Satan has built up in this world.
Judah's princes were at Zoan; there they would take counsel, but Jehovah said, "they are but fools, the princes of Zoan, ... their counsel is become senseless" (@Isaiah 19: 11). The princes of this world do not know anything about the hidden wisdom; they crucified the Lord of glory, but the believer knows. He knows, or should know, and the appointed way is to inquire. If we ask of God, temple-wise, there will be a solution; I am sure of that, and we do not need to lean on any party. God will come in and there will be the locating of the offender, and all the saints will be with you in it.
W.W. Would the "wise woman" involve the formative work that would come to light in Colossians?
J.T. I think she does. Colossians is what was before the world morally. You have something that is of God set over against what is in the world, so that philosophy or human wisdom is rejected, not only because it is bad, but because it is not needed. You have got something better.
E.J.McB. So in a way you have got the Colossian thought in Antioch, where they were first called christians. I thought a totally new character of man was in evidence that you could not connect with either the Jew or the Gentile.
W.J.H. And Peter and then Barnabas tried to bring in the old man through the principle of dissimulation. The enemy is always at work on that line, because he is a liar and the father of lies, and the old man was begotten by him.
J.T. Certain came from James, showing how we may influence one another in what is evil.
P.L. So that just after Antioch, Elymas the magician appears. Is that the element of the old man and opposition to the new man?
J.T. Just so.
{193}
H.F.N. The brethren sending relief to the poor saints in Judaea from Antioch would be the contrast to that -- the early working out of the new man.
J.T. I think in following the thread in Acts (we have been dealing with chapter 3) chapter 4 presents the climax of it in Jerusalem. Peter and John had rendered their testimony together, and the man "held" them. He leaped up and walked with them into the temple and praised God -- a delightful condition that was in itself so pleasurable to heaven. Now chapter 4 shows that their testimony, as set out in these two chapters, being finished, they went to their own company, and they merged in it, for, as they reach the company they are no longer distinctively Peter and John. As together they represented something for God, they served in that connection, but when that is finished, they come back to the company and merge in it. So it is no longer Peter and John in the company, but the whole company and all the apostles having their place. The same features that appeared at the end of chapter 2, seen in that company in an intensified way, is the climax of the work of God in Jerusalem from the standpoint from which we are speaking. After that you have the sin of Ananias and Sapphira, and then the dissatisfaction of the Hellenists, which give, as it were, the end of a chapter; so that from that point God operates towards Antioch and the things that we are speaking of develop there. We get the assembly that was there and things are presented as wholly according to God.
J.B.C-l. The introduction to the gospel of Luke seems to have this Colossian idea in view, I mean as to the divine pleasure. "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men" (@Luke 2: 14). I was turning over what you suggested as to the new man being for God first. It would really be the bringing to pass in the power of recovery of what was for the divine pleasure in the midst of corruption.
{194}
J.T. Yes; that is so.
W.J.H. So untruthfulness in Ananias and Sapphira and the sectional spirit in the widows were the first efforts of Satan to get a footing in that which bore the character of the new man in Jerusalem.
J.T. Yes; the old showing itself in opposition to the new.
P.L. So as things were waning in Jerusalem the features of the new man are seen in Stephen -- the shining countenance and the spirit of Christ.
J.T. Quite so.
F.S.M. The expression, "Having put on the new", in Colossians -- would you say a word as to how that works out?
J.T. The idea has to be laid hold of in your mind. Putting it on would be an act of your mind, as I understand it; that is, you take it up as an act of your mind, being enlightened as to it. The apostle does not introduce it as something they did not know about. He refers to it as something of which the Colossians knew -- something they had done; and I apprehend they had, on the principle of faith and in their minds, taken up the idea of the new man, which, I suppose, would have come to them, through whomsoever the light came, as the character of Christ. They were evidently lovers of Christ; they had received Him, it says, and they would, as loving Christ, put on the new man. But the taking it up in that way as an act of your mind does not mean that the thing characterises you, and so, I think, the apostle introduces it here that it might characterise them.
You will observe that he goes on to point out what marks the new man which they had put on, that he was renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him. There was no room in him for Greek philosophy or anything of that kind. It was the kind of knowledge, as it were, in God Himself,
{195}
the Creator. Then he points out that there is no distinction of nationality, nor is there anything there that marks men in this world. He states first what this new man is, and then he says, "Put on therefore, as the elect of God". That I think is what confirms what we are saying, that the new man is for God. As having put on the new man they were God's elect. "Mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!" (@Isaiah 42: 1). They corresponded to Christ. He had elected Christ. It is not a question there of what the Lord was in His own divine Person, but what He was here as a Man -- that He was delightful to God. He was God's elect, in whom His soul delighted, but they would give delight only in the measure in which there was this beautiful freshness in what they were to put on. As it says, "holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering". These are the things that God has delight in.
W.C.G. The hymn we sang helps us in that connection, 'Lord Jesus, source of every grace' (`114:1).
J.T. Just so.
F.S.M. While having put on the new man, they still needed the exhortations that follow.
J.T. The exhortations indicate how it works out in you. You are regarded as having taken the thing up as a matter of light by faith, but now you put on all these things and you are perfectly delightful to God. One would love to get the thought into one's soul in "Mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!" -- God speaking of what He found in Christ, and, in measure, what He finds in the saints also as His elect.
F.S.M. You pursue the things so that they may be true characteristically.
J.T. The things are illustrated by the green grass, herbs and trees -- which the renewed earth, the earth as coming up out of death at the beginning yielded to the Creator. Everything was fresh, and so it is with the saints. It is one thing to come up out of
{196}
death, but then the earth might be bare. You might have the earth coming up out of death without grass. It is the grass and the herbs and the trees that make the thing delightful -- the evidence of life is there.
D.L.H. I was going to ask whether, having put off the old man and having put on the new, does not correspond with what we have in the previous chapter in the thoughts of circumcision, burial, risen with Christ, and quickening. Do not these thoughts of having put off and having put on correspond with those statements in the previous chapter?
J.T. I should say that fully. Chapter 2 is, as you might say, the doctrine.
D.L.H. And that is how it is applied, because, if they were buried with Christ, where was the old man? And if they were risen with Christ, there was the new.
P.L. Would not the half-open flowers in the temple, within and without, answer to the thought? The within for God and the without in testimony for men.
J.T. The half-open flowers are the evidence of *fresh life*.
A.S.L. Would you say a word on the remarkable expression, "As the truth is in Jesus".
J.T. Well, in Ephesians you come to the complete thought involved in the new man and in the old. The truth as in Jesus is stated there as involving the putting off of the old and the putting on of the new, so that it would involve His death and resurrection.
A.S.L. The personal name is striking -- Jesus. "Bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus" (@2 Corinthians 4: 10).
J.T. Do you not think this would link on the idea from Colossians with the new man in Ephesians, in that he begins with *Christ* in the passage? "But *ye* have not thus learnt the Christ, if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus".
{197}
F.H.B. Why does he say "in Jesus", rather than "in Christ?"
J.T. Christ is the One in Ephesians who does things for God. What I learn, I learn from Him. I have heard from Him because being anointed He instructs; but then, what the apostle is at is to bring out the connection between Jesus, which is what He was here as a Man and what He is now too, and the new man. What He was personally as here, we are as a creation; that is, we are "created in truthful righteousness and holiness". It is the difference, I think, as to the kind of man, between Adam innocent and Christ. Innocency will not do, and that shows what this word 'new' signifies. You might have another Adam like the first one. God could do that; it would be new in the ordinary sense of the word, but it would not be a *different* one. The point is to see that it is a different one. The difference is that Adam was created in innocency, not in righteousness nor in holiness.
The new man is created in truthful righteousness and holiness, and that is what Christ was as become Man, and if you have a creation in truthful righteousness and holiness, that creation is going through. That can never be dominated by Satan and that is the reason why Ephesians presents the full thought -- that God has got something capable of standing in the corruption. It is a creation, but it is a creation in truthful righteousness and holiness, and then the renewal of the spirit of your mind keeps it in freshness, because the word for renewal is that for freshness. It is ever fresh and untaintable. It never grows old.
A.S.L. Does not the thought of the introduction of the personal name of Jesus take you to the cross, where the old man had been dealt with and removed?
J.T. Quite. I think it is a question of what has come about in one Man, in Christ as a Man, in Jesus.
{198}
D.L.H. But is it not the moral features that were set forth in Jesus as a Man here?
J.T. I think it is, only the truth involves His death. There could not be the putting off of the old without that. It is to be noted that in Ephesians the new man is created "after God", as it is said. The new man reflects what God is morally as revealed in Christ.
J.J. In Ephesians it is, "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord". In this connection, I suppose it would save from all local difficulties.
J.T. What precedes what you have quoted is, "but be filled with the Spirit", so the saints are preserved in being filled with the Spirit; all that goes to make up what we are speaking of. There is the preservation of the new thing in freshness, so God's delight is in it, and one would particularly like to keep that in view, because God looks for His own part, and if we love God, we shall not deny Him His part. So I think we want to preserve these beautiful traits of Jesus in our relation with one another.
A.S.L. "Ye have not thus learnt the Christ". Did you think that the expression "the Christ" would involve the new man -- Christ Himself and this company associated with Him? Because there is a difference between Christ personally and *the* Christ.
J.T. I think "the Christ" is a question of the anointing. There is that which God anoints. As anointed, He has set forth what God is, and the new man corresponds with this; he is created "according to God ... in truthful righteousness and holiness".
A.M. "If the Lord delight in us". Would not that be the commencement? If God delight in us as expressing the new man, we shall have the consciousness of it.
J.T. He creates what He delights in; He creates
{199}
"Jerusalem, ... And I will rejoice over Jerusalem" (@Isaiah 65: 18, 19). Enoch had the testimony that he pleased God. There was that there for God in the midst of corruption.
H.W.S. Would there be the possibility of the acceptance of the truth of putting off the old man without having the qualities of the new?
J.T. I think that is what is intimated here. He brings in these qualities that they should not be lacking. You may sow your field and it is potentially the crop, but you have got to wait for the springing up of the crop.
J.C.S. God will accept no human substitution for these qualities.
P.L. Would you think that the expression in Proverbs 12: 11, "He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied", goes with it? Satisfaction is in the tillage.
J.T. Quite. A divine thought received into an honest and good heart and understood is the seed. Then there is the needed care that the desired fruit may come.
J.C.S. Would you say a word how the assembly, the body, and the new man are presented in Colossians?
J.T. They run together. Colossians does not go on to the full thought of the assembly. You do not get the full thought of God in Colossians. What is emphasised is life in the way in which we have spoken of it, and one can see how that bears on the truth of the body. He is Head of the body, the assembly. That is a general thought in Colossians, which is worked out in Ephesians. It is brought in in the former epistle to show His greatness, but the truth of the mystery is not really developed in Colossians. It is a question of the greatness of Christ and the saints having life. It really resolves itself into this, do I love Christ? If I do, then Christ is everything to me, and the more I know Him, the more I know I have everything
{200}
in Him. That is how I understand it. Everything comes out of Christ, but the main thing is to see that He is my life, and that in the new man He is everything. "Christ is everything, and in all". You want nothing outside of Christ.
As said before, Ephesians presents the full thought of the new man, he is created *after God;* he reflects the character of God -- righteousness and holiness of truth.
{201}
THE NEW JERUSALEM
@Revelation 3: 7 - 13; 21: 1 - 17
D.L.H. What is the connection between what we have been considering and the new Jerusalem?
J.T. I think the promise to the overcomer in Philadelphia would indicate that he would have knowledge of the new man. He would understand the bearing of the word 'new', as we have been remarking. The new man is evidently for God, that in which He finds delight on account of its freshness, but the new Jerusalem introduces another thought. It is a *complete* vessel, including, I judge, all the other features that have occupied us. The element of preservation is evident in the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; what is presented includes what was from the outset. The foundations were made intact and would be included in what was new. In other words, the fruit of the work of God in the whole dispensation is seen there and is included in the newness. I suppose that every thought of God in regard of government is found in it, and that livingly. His government through providential means, and His government through Israel -- the twelve tribes -- all these thoughts are there.
D.L.H. Would you mind saying a word in regard of the distinction or difference between the new Jerusalem in its eternal setting and the holy city in its millennial setting, to which you are just now referring?
J.T. Its bearing towards the eternal state of things is evidently as a divine dwelling-place; that in which God will be with men. The thought would be, I suppose, taken up from the Lord's presence here. He became flesh and tabernacled amongst us. It was new. God had tabernacled with Israel but "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us" (@John 1: 14). It was a wholly new way. God was there, but there in a new
{202}
way, and so He will be, I apprehend, eternally in that new way. The assembly will be His tabernacle among men.
D.L.H. I should like to ask also whether the new Jerusalem, which is referred to in the promise to the overcomer, refers to the eternal condition or to the millennial state?
J.T. I should say both, only the word 'new' is not connected with the city in chapter 21 in connection with the millennial order of things.
D.L.H. That is what struck me; it is not.
J.T. Nevertheless I think the Lord has the millennial order of things in view in all the promises to the overcomer in Philadelphia.
H.F.N. Was your thought that we need what is eternal to maintain that which is new? What is administrative merely will not maintain it.
J.T. I think that John's ministry -- John's gospel peculiarly -- fits us for eternity. He alone speaks of the Lord coming in in that way -- He dwelt among us. The dwelling was new. It was a new way and I believe that apprehending the manner of it, as presented in John, prepares us for eternity, so that the first disciples that are drawn to Christ through the testimony by John ask the Lord where He *abides*. "Where abidest thou?" and He says, "Come and see". They were to apprehend the thing. It was a new thing. There is no reference to any geographical position or to any material surrounding. It was a spiritual thing, and so, I believe, if that is laid hold of, the eternal conditions begin to dawn in your soul; so that in sending the message to the disciples through Mary Magdalene, there is the assumption that the thing would be understood. "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (@John 20: 17). It is the full family thought, I think, and then the relation between God and men. These are two things, I
{203}
believe, that will run together eternally, so that an apprehension of John's gospel prepares us for eternal conditions, and we understand the force of the new Jerusalem. It is still new after the thousand years, as we have often remarked. Its unchangeableness is thus emphasised, and although it had its place in what belongs to time, it retains its qualifications for eternity.
H.F.N. You have given us moral thoughts in regard of the other features, preservation and strength and what is for God. What is in your mind in regard to the introduction of what is new in relation to the city?
J.T. Well, it is just as I have been remarking; the overcomer in Philadelphia, I believe, understanding John's ministry, is prepared for Jerusalem as presented at the outset of chapter 21 as the tabernacle of God, that is to say, that in which He will be with men. The thing itself includes, I think, the family relationship that is involved in "My brethren" - the relation to the Father, and the overcomer in Philadelphia understands that. He has become accustomed to what is new. Christendom would be regarded as having become old, because the addresses to the assemblies contemplate that the thing had become old. We know it is so. We know that what is public -- what is regarded as christianity publicly -- is not different from what was of old. Men have returned to the old. The public features of christianity today are not new; they are based either on Jewish practices or on heathenish practices.
The recovery of the truth has revived what is new, and so it is brought in, I think, in the address to Philadelphia. It is once brought in earlier, but in a secret way, that is, in the address to Pergamos -- in the word to the overcomer there, only, as I said, in a secret way -- the new name written on a stone of white known only to him who receives it. But
{204}
Philadelphia, I think, contemplates the recovery of the mind of God, and every purpose of God, so that you have "the temple of my God", as He says, and then "the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name". The recovery of the truth involved all the mind of God set over against the old conditions in the public way, and thus the Lord keeps the overcomer from what was coming in in a public way. The promise does not refer to what is private or secret; it is the reward given in a public way, and hence what is written is written *on* the overcomer, so that there is, I believe, a knowledge of what is new, and the Lord therefore writes upon him what is new.
D.L.H. The writing would have a present application, would it not?
J.T. I think there is that in the overcomer that corresponds with it; there is, in his public bearing, the stamp of what is new.
W.J.H. Would you say that that is really the feature of the overcomer in Philadelphia, where the general state is good? God has nothing that He expresses disapproval of in the general state, but even there He introduces the thought of overcoming, and I wondered if the overcomer was one who continued in that which was fresh.
J.T. I think so. You can discern that in your own experience; whilst in a general way those with whom you walk are going on with God, yet you yourself have to overcome. In fact, it is in your overcoming and in the overcoming of others that the thing is maintained. The idea of overcoming relates to what is evil and opposed in a *general* way, not simply to the state of any given church.
F.H.B. Would it consist in holding fast what we have?
J.T. Quite so, and in a general way, as I said.
{205}
The need of overcoming is present always, and one qualifies as in Philadelphia for a position in the temple. The temple is that in which the mind of God is preserved, and this is the first thing mentioned, "him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God", showing that an overcomer is concerned primarily about what the mind of God is, and the thoughts of God being preserved and maintained here. That is the first idea you get, and the next is "the name of my God", which includes *revelation*. I apprehend an overcomer now holds to the complete revelation of God. He sees that the world as an organisation is set against that.
Organised opposition is the most powerful opposition there is, and the book of Revelation shows that there is that character of opposition in the world to the love of God flowing out. Then there is the great city Babylon, the most powerful of all organisations against God, against the revelation of God. Well, the overcomer in Philadelphia stands against all that, so that he has the name of His God written upon him, and then the name of the city of His God. He holds to divine administration, and that it must be complete, as the heavenly city suggests. In other words, the overcomer stands for everything that has come out in the dispensation. He stands over against Sardis, whose works are incomplete. The overcomer in Philadelphia goes on to completeness. He will have that feature, and I think that is what the city would suggest -- "the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God". Then he understands the Lord's new name. He sees the Lord, I apprehend, operating, but all that has come out in Him is in relation to what is new.
J.J. The mystery?
J.T. I think it would include that. The new name alludes, I think, to the ministry of the last days.
{206}
J.J. Where would Paul's ministry come in in this connection?
J.T. I think John makes room for it. As you say, the mystery is involved in the Lord's new name.
G.W.W. What do you understand by the Lords new name?
J.T. I think it is what has come out in Him especially in these last days, as standing over against what marks public christianity. To remember that this is said to an overcome in our days, I believe, helps. If the Lord promises one anything, it is what he would value, and the revival of the truth has brought in the new. Emphasis has been laid on the new, and you cannot connect the Lord with what is old. Since the Reformation, I should say, there has been an immense impetus to knowledge, and the trend of modern teaching is to connect the Lord with what is old. He is linked on by secular writers, as well as by religious writers and teachers, with what is old, whereas those who know the truth realise that they stand for what is new.
H.D'A.C. Is that connected with what is holy and what is true? He that is "The holy, the true".
J.T. Quite so. Holiness, as I think we shall see, is intimately linked with the idea of newness in the city. But you can see how modern teaching, whether secular or religious, connects the Lord with what is old. Even if you take the Romish system, it connects the Lord personally with Mary. Well, that is not new, because the understanding of His new name means not simply that He was born of woman, but what marks Him coming in by Himself. He brought it in, acquiring nothing from His mother morally. The humanity that He came into was new in a moral sense, and I think that Romish teaching, as well as Protestant teaching, is to connect the Lord and all that has come out in Him with what is old; whereas the Holy Spirit coming in in the way of revival has
{207}
brought in a living state of things, and in connection with that, the understanding of what is new. So I think the overcomer in Philadelphia understands what the Lord means in those promises. He is prepared for what is new.
D.L.H. Is not what is new connected with ascension somewhat? I thought that christendom, as you have been saying, connects the Lord with men here, I suppose, universally. The great idea is that the Lord Jesus has rehabilitated humanity here, but they seem to have lost sight entirely of the fact that the Lord Jesus is in heaven and is a Man of a new and heavenly order. In my own mind I rather connected the thought of the new name with that which really stands in contrast to the generally received notions in regard to Christ in christendom.
J.T. I think that is right; as you follow John he will prepare you for that. In @John 3: 13 he speaks about "the Son of man who is in heaven" -- a most remarkable statement. Then again, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before" (verse 62). Your mind is filled with the thought of the difference, of something wholly new in a Man.
G.W.W. Is it all that He brought into manhood and which He has now carried through into His new position in resurrection?
J.T. That is what it would come to. The ministry of the last days peculiarly emphasises all that. Public christianity has grown old, like Judaism.
G.J.E. So would you say that the new was really before the old?
J.T. Well, quite. That is what comes out; as John says, "A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me" (@John 1: 30). That is how John brings the thing into your mind; that here you have a Person who, as he says, comes after him. He came after him historically, but He *was* before him.
{208}
G.W.W. So that the overcomer would resent any attempt to connect what is true of the Lord with anything that relates to what is old and decayed and which vanishes away.
J.T. That is wherein we shall profit, as we see that this subject is introduced in Revelation in connection with an overcomer. I think that gives the clue to the thing. If one is an overcomer, one is prepared for what is promised.
J.C.S. The overcomer stands for what comes out of heaven.
J.T. Quite; and this should work out practically in our ways, especially in the spirit and order marking our service and collective relations.
W.C.G. Does the writing suggest the thought of an indelible impression given to a person?
J.T. The Lord says, "I will write upon him", etc. You come into the knowledge of the idea in the new covenant. If we understand 2 Corinthians, I think we can understand something about this writing. This feature of the truth is prominent in Revelation.
W.C.G. So the overcomer has things in consciousness, not merely in figure.
J.T. Yes. In 2 Corinthians the writing is manifested to be the writing of Christ written on the fleshy tables of the heart, "not with ink, but the Spirit of the living God" (@2 Corinthians 3: 3). The thing thus is known to us.
W.L. Why is it "upon him" -- "I will write upon him", not in him, but *upon* him?
J.T. I think He is dealing now with what is going to be *public*. In Pergamos it was private -- it was secret -- but in Philadelphia it is public, because it contemplates what is going into the millennial order of things.
W.L. Do you mean it is to be public now?
J.T. There would be that in the man's testimony, but I think he will come out in the millennial day with this writing. It is the thought of the distinction
{209}
that will be placed upon him -- a pillar in the temple of God, and the name of God written upon him, and the name of the city of God, and the Lord's new name. If we look at him in the millennial day with intelligence, we shall know what a history that man has had. He will be known as a man of distinction in the testimony.
E.J.McB. Do you connect the thought of being an overcomer with the kind of person that has secured in his affections the features we were speaking about in regard of the new man?
J.T. I thought those features would be taken up by the overcomer.
E.J.McB. So in the overcomer we would have a visible element here now that would exemplify the truth written in the two epistles, Colossians and Ephesians.
J.T. Quite; these two epistles insist on what is new and heavenly. They enter specially into the ministry for the end, preparing the assembly for the coming of the Lord.
D.L.H. These traits of the overcomer would be manifested now, would they not?
J.T. That is what I think our brother meant -- that the overcomer would take up in his affections all these features we have been dwelling upon, but when you come to the city, you have the thing in its completeness.
H.D'A.C. There will not be a different set of pillars then than there are now.
J.T. I think that what one is now he will be then. That is, I think, what the Lord means. He makes a promise to you that you value; you value what a pillar in the temple is now. The value of the thing promised has to be known to be appreciated.
P.L. You get the expression in Psalm 87:6 "This man was born there". Is that the testimony seen then?
{210}
J.T. Well, quite. The overcomer will be known as belonging to a certain church period.
R.S.S. Do you connect John the baptist in his ministry with what is old? He said, "He must increase, but I must decrease" (@John 3: 30), and the Lord said of him, "There is not arisen among the born of women a greater than John the baptist. But he who is a little one in the kingdom of heavens is greater than he" (@Matthew 11: 11). Would you connect John the baptist with what was old?
J.T. I would. He came in on that line. The twelve at Ephesus knew only his baptism; they came into the new by the gift of the Holy Spirit.
A.S.L. It is the introduction of the new that makes everything else old.
J.T. Quite. Then there is what grows old and aged; that marked the Jewish system, and so it disappeared. The same applies to historical christianity, and so it is 'disappearing'.
F.H.B. I was wondering whether the thought of the new name would indicate something different from what had been set forth in the Old Testament -- the Spirit having come.
J.T. I think it would be what He is in relation to the assembly, known particularly in the last days.
F.H.B. Quite.
D.L.H. I should like to ask what the word is for new there. Is it *kainos*?
J.T. Yes, it is.
R.S.S. I suppose what God set up in Judaism is referred to as old.
J.T. I thought the Lord at the last passover gathered up in His own Person all that had existed of God, all that God had been to Israel. He took the cup. Luke mentions two cups, but he only. It is said the Lord received a cup, and He said, "Take this and divide it among yourselves" (@Luke 22: 17), for He would not drink at all of it until He drank it new, or in a
{211}
new way. The manner of His drinking would be new and will be new in the future with Israel. There was the cup, but it was connected with what was old, and He gives it to the disciples and says, "divide it among yourselves". I apprehend He meant that what was there livingly in Him, all that God had been to Israel from the very outset, was passed on to them, and was to be preserved amongst them. They were to divide it amongst themselves. That was one cup. Then, after that, He takes another cup, and I think that the new thing that He speaks of here is in the second cup, that is to say, the cup of the Lord's supper. He says of it, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you" (verse 20). What belonged to Israel does not disappear; it was in another cup, and they were to have that up too. But the passover was not to be celebrated again by them in that way, but the cup that He received was given to them to be divided amongst themselves. He says, as it were, You are to share that; I will have to say to it later, but in a new way. In the meantime, every divine thought in regard of His earthly people is cherished by those who love Christ. But then there is the second cup which He says "is the new covenant in my blood", and that is where the Lord becomes our object constantly. He comes in freshly to our affections by that, and I think that His new name is understood by those who drink that cup.
J.B.C-l. I have been thinking, whilst you have been speaking, of the accounts of the transfiguration in the synoptic gospels. Would they not in principle bear on the thought of the Lord's new name in that sense? There they saw the Lord in contrast to that which publicly surrounded them in a religious way on the earth, and God the Father speaks in regard of that Person. There you get God saying, "This is my beloved Son" again; He is set in a new connection
{212}
I mean that the transfiguration would bring to bear upon the spirits of the disciples that the Lord had not come in for the rehabilitation of things upon earth, but for the bringing down from heaven of that which was of God. Would it really be that earth-dwelling arises from the lack of the interpretation of the Lord's new name?
J.T. I believe that is so, and those who have come back to the cup in the Lord's supper cherish His new name. They do not forget His relations with Israel. Indeed, Revelation shows that He will resume His relations with Israel, but the overcomer in Philadelphia, understands the new name, for I think it enters into the cup of the Lord's supper. The *setting* of the breaking of bread in @Acts 20 confirms this; although at Troas, it is an *Ephesian* setting.
W.J.H. Why do you think so much is said about the name in connection with Philadelphia? In three different settings the name is brought in.
J.T. Well, I think it is because of the attitude of the world and the professing body to revelation. The revelation of God in Christ is systematically opposed by the world as such -- by men in it, and by the professing body (Babylon) now. 'Name' is what has been set out in revelation whether on the part of God or of Christ.
H.D'A.C. They absolutely refuse the new name in the world. Nothing in the new name is at all palatable to the world.
J.T. They do not want what is new in that sense, whereas the overcomer in Philadelphia stands for the name, for what is set out in the name. He clings to Christ's name as against the many names that have been adopted in christendom. He especially regards it as seen in His relations with the assembly.
J.J. Will you say a little in connection with the thought of what is strictly new in christianity in contrast to what belonged to Israel?
{213}
J.T. Well, I thought we had got over that. I was thinking as you spoke of "the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem ... and my new name".
J.J. What I meant was that the thought of the body is absolutely new, is it not, whereas the many things that are old were connected with Israel formerly, like the covenant, and the house, and the temple. But in christianity you have the body.
J.T. That is right, and the mystery is new, but I think that great stress is laid on what has been called attention to -- the name. What is set out in "the name of my God" involves revelation, and "the name of the city of my God" involves every thought of God. What I understand by the city is that every thought of God is there, because the measurements would indicate there is nothing left out. One observes the way in which men leave things out and make things fit to suit themselves, but the name of the city, I think, means that the overcomer would have everything; nothing must be left out; the very smallest things must have their place. The city is thus a vessel that includes everything, not only certain things, but everything is gathered up there, and the overcomer in Philadelphia understands that. He understands the special relation of the Lord, in what has come out in His name, with what is new. I believe His new name has reference to His relation to the assembly in what is peculiar to herself.
D.L.H. Is not the name connected with the thought of renown, what a man is set for and is identified with in a kind of public way here? Is not that the thought of name, and ought not every one of us and every overcomer be in a kind of way set for all these things?
J.T. I am sure that is so. One would particularly emphasise the vessel in which every divine thought is secured, because there is such a tendency with us
{214}
as believers to leave out things, omitting them -- ignoring some and forgetting others. What the name of the city suggests is that there is nothing left out. Every divine thought is there. Someone was remarking yesterday that it is in the light of ascension that you get the first vessel for the preservation of divine things, that is to say, Noah's ark. There you get the beginning of this thought of a vessel for the preservation of divine things. Now, when you carry that idea on through the whole of Scripture, you see how it comes out in a vessel that is perfect in every way. You look at it, and there is not a thought omitted from it of all that God has given expression to, and that ought to act upon us at the present time, as to how we are holding things that God has given expression to. Much is made of the cities of this world now and of great human organisations generally, but the overcomer has no part in them; but he will have part in the heavenly city.
W.C.G. Is that the way the glory of God is secured -- by the expression of the name?
J.T. Well, no doubt. I suppose the glory of God is the shining out of what He is. That would be involved in His own name. What strikes one about the city is what she *has* -- not exactly what is given to her, but what she has. There is evidently the sense of acquirement; she has things. The first thing mentioned is she has the glory of God. She has it.
G.W.W. Would you say that the measure in which we shall each one be contributing to the shining out of the glory must be the measure in which we have acquired an apprehension of all that which is spoken of here, ending up with the new name?
J.T. Just so, and the Lord said, "For whosoever has, to him shall be given, and whosoever has not, even what he seems to have shall be taken from him" (@Luke 8: 18). What I think is going on at the present time is that nominal christianity is losing everything
{215}
it has had. Years ago there was much more in the so-called denominations than there is now. They are gradually losing what they have had because they have not had it in a real way in the true sense of the word. To have a thing in reality is to have it by the Spirit, and I think that is how the city is apprehended. She has the glory of God. Where did she get it? It is what is going on now. The believer who has the Spirit has got something, and hence Philadelphia is called upon to hold fast what she *has* that no one take her crown. It is in the holding fast to the thing that you have -- what has been recovered to us -- that other things are added. "For to every one that has shall be given ... but from him that has not, that even which he has shall be taken from him" (@Matthew 25: 29).
E.J.McB. Would the expression of Paul in @Philippians 4: 19, "My God shall abundantly supply all your need", convey to your mind the thought of one morally on whom "the name of my God" was written?
J.T. That is good. What impresses one is how near Paul had come to the Lord; "my God and your God". The apostle says, "my God".
J.J. Would it be right to say that the principle of that is seen in the end of @Acts 4? You have referred to the first three chapters. No one said that anything they possessed was his own, neither was there any among them that lacked, for distribution was made to all as every man had need. The principle of the city was there.
J.T. Quite. What I think is going on now is that what people seem to have is being taken away from them and given to others who have. Hence the Lord would lay it upon us that we should have divine things in a spiritual way. This leads to the new Jerusalem.
{216}
H.D'A.C. So that whilst christendom is losing, true christianity is gaining.
J.T. That is right, and it will all come out presently in the heavenly city.
D.L.H. The pound taken away from the unprofitable servant was given to the one who had ten pounds.
J.T. That proves the principle. The unprofitable servant is morally unfit to have what belongs to God.
J.C.S. Would you think the writing on the saints at the present moment involves much suffering, but the result will be a vessel formed and that vessel will be put alongside of Christ as the Lamb's wife -- the suffering One?
J.T. That is true. The Lamb is the rejected suffering One, and the church as *His* wife must correspond.
G.W.W. I gather that what the Lord appreciates in Philadelphia is the *having*, and not the *seeming* to have. One feels what a vast difference there is between the two things. One is the definite work of the Spirit which gives us to have, but one might seem to have by a mental act. The latter will pass away, but what one has as the definite work of the Spirit of God is abiding and eternal.
J.T. And I think that is what underlies the new Jerusalem. She has the things. An overcomer, you might say, really represents the thing. He represents the heavenly city, because in principle he has the things which will appear in the city.
H.H. Do you not think that the assembly in that way qualifies at the present time for coming out as the heavenly city; she will take things up publicly in that day, because she has cherished the interests of Christ when they are outwardly refused? Although the ruin is complete, there is still the public side of things.
J.T. There is certainly a public side at the present time. If the Lord's supper is anything, it remains a
{217}
testimony, until He come. But whatever there is is on moral ground, not official -- "as unknown, and yet well known".
H.H. What is an exercise amongst the saints now will come out in the heavenly city.
J.T. Yes, every exercise and formation that is of God will find its own setting there. For that we wait, accepting present obscurity and reproach.
F.S.M. You were saying that lovers of Christ are characterised by the new man, and, as lovers of Christ, should we not be led on to be overcomers, and would not that lead to the inevitable consequence that the city comes out prepared as a bride? Does not the thought of affection carry right through?
J.T. Quite so. "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready". That is what is going on. Now, what may be remarked in regard of this subject in the two epistles in which the heavenly city is mentioned, is that it is spoken of as the heavenly city and not as the new Jerusalem. In @Galatians 4: 26 it is "Jerusalem above", not the one coming down, but the one above. It is the present bearing -- what is above. Then in @Hebrews 12: 22 it is the "heavenly Jerusalem", that is, the character of the thing is heavenly. But in Revelation it is "the holy Jerusalem", "new Jerusalem" because it is a question of coming into view there, and in coming into view, the element of holiness and the element of newness appear.
N.L. What is the force of the word Jerusalem? Why does he say Jerusalem?
J.T. I thought it denotes the seat of the great king, the seat of rule, the seat of light and rule according to God. Some of us were saying the other day that you might build a city such as David had, stone for stone, temple and all, but that would not be the idea of new Jerusalem here. There will be an earthly city literally, but the idea of new Jerusalem
{218}
is not another one built up again on the same site, stone for stone, house for house, and the temple; that would not convey what is meant by the *new* Jerusalem. The word means that it is a Jerusalem of another kind, a Jerusalem that never existed before. The name Jerusalem is retained because it is a question of light and rule, but there never had been such a Jerusalem before. It is a totally new idea. Anyone can see it is so from the fact that it comes down, and that it is a cube. It is not built of stone and mortar at all. It is not simply a replica of the old made over again; it is a totally new thing; one, as I said, that never existed before. The name is retained because the name stands for light and rule, and that is what the thing is, but it is light and rule in this wonderful vessel. The retention of the name shows the divine thought effected spiritually.
D.L.H. But is it not the case that the word Jerusalem refers to righteousness and peace, and that that is the reason why it is retained?
J.T. I have no doubt it refers to peace. Possibly there may be a link with Melchisedec.
H.F.N. Would you add a word in connection with the voice out of the throne? The final voice says, "Behold, I make all things new".
J.T. I think it all goes with the Revelation. The throne is the centre of everything from chapter 4. God is asserting that He is not content with anything old at all. You will notice that it says, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth", but it does not say the old heaven and the old earth have passed away; we read, "for the first heaven and the first earth". Whilst it is true what the psalm says, "All of them shall wax old like a garment", still the point is not that they are old, but they are the first. God virtually says even the material creation as it is will not do, and that is educational, because we all touch the material creation as it is, and may be content with it.
{219}
God announces here that even that will not do; everything must be new, and the question is what kind of material will it be? That is the thing we have to learn. The original word 'new' means it is totally different. What kind of heavens will it be, what kind of earth? That has to be found out. They are to be totally different.
A.S.L. Like the new man we had before us this morning -- -a kind of man that never was before.
F.H.B. "That which is spiritual was nor first, but that which is natural" (@1 Corinthians 15: 46).
J.T. Just so.
R.S.S. What is the relation between what we find in @Isaiah 65: 17, 18, and what we have been saying? "For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create. For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy".
J.T. That is alluded to in @2 Peter 3: 13. He refers to what is a promise for faith, where he says, "According to his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness". The prophet gives you that, and then he brings the idea down to the millennial side of things. Peter does not allude to the second part -- what relates to Jerusalem as created a joy -- but to what is eternal, which we also get here; @Revelation 21.
R.S.S. So the one refers to what is eternal, as in the beginning of @Revelation 21, and then he goes on to speak of what there will be here in the millennial state of things.
J.T. That is right; indeed millennial joy will be on the same principle. It is on the principle of what is new, as the Lord says, "when I drink it new with you", or, in a new manner.
J.J. Will you say a little how we find out what the new things are?
{220}
J.T. These things are found out spiritually. The Lord says, "Come and see". That is the principle in John. "They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day" (@John 1: 39). John's writings are intended to make us spiritual: "new Jerusalem" is understood on that line.
H.D'A.C. The city and the citizens will be one, like the house and the household.
J.T. Just so. There is no distinction really.
H.D'A.C. And while he looked at the city, there was a voice, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men". Why is that?
J.T. The city is what is related to Christ. It is the Lamb's wife. The *tabernacle* is what is related to God. It is the tabernacle of *God*. That was how He first dwelt with men.
E.J.McB. Do you think that the expression, "Her shining was like a most precious stone", indicates the answer to our brother's question as to how to find out what is spiritual? She has found out.
J.T. Oh, quite. I am not saying one does not know something about the thing, but John would tell you to come and see. Then, another thing John says, "Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others said it to thee concerning me?" (@John 18: 34). John would teach us to say things of ourselves, to get things for ourselves. He has a way of making us spiritual, of compelling us to go to the source of things. That is what we must do. The eternal order of things is spiritual, new; it is not to be defined, it is apprehended by the Spirit.
W.J.H. The Lord is to be known -- His name is to be known as Father of eternity. As we know Him by that name, we have some idea of what eternity is like.
J.T. Exactly.
G.W.W. In that way, the greater will be our apprehension of the conditions in which He will abide eternally.
{221}
J.T. I think the overcomer in Philadelphia has become habituated to going to the source of things.
G.W.W. That is God.
J.T. God is the source of all. The overcomer understands the great mediatorial system of things, which is perhaps less understood than anything. The name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, and my new name belong to that system. The city is mediatorial, as the Lord's name is also. The great thought is God.
E.R. There is one question I should like to ask. "Shall know that I have loved thee;" what is that?
J.T. The Lord I suppose, will in His own way compel those who are opposed now to worship before the saints feet and to know that He has loved them -- a very precious thing. He will compel them to know that He loves us.
E.R. Do you not think that is the secret of all -- the love of Christ?
J.T. Yes, quite.
W.L. Would you say that in the overcomer in Philadelphia you find all the great essential features of christianity, and all are preserved by and in the overcomer?
J.T. That is so. He understands the mediatorial system, and all that leads up to the city, because you get every thought of God there. I do not think there will be one thought that has been set out in Christ omitted in the city.
Ques. In that way, will it contain "things new and old?"
J.T. The agencies of divine government from the outset are seen in the city in its relation with the millennium, but I do not think they will appear in the eternal state. It is in the latter connection the city is said to be new.
F.W. "As a bride adorned for her husband". Would that suggest what is new?
{222}
J.T. Yes. She is new and holy.
F.W. I was wondering whether the adornments (@Revelation 21: 2) were connected with His new name -- characteristics of Christ.
J.T. I suppose the adornments would correspond with Him as she knows Him. His wife *has* made *herself* ready.
J.J. Did you say last night that the love of God was connected with what was mediatorial?
J.T. Well, it is made known mediatorially. It is made known by the Son come into manhood. We are dependent on His mediatorial service. Revelation *must* be through the Mediator -- a divine Person become Man. God, being a Spirit, can only be apprehended fully by men in a Man.
J.J. I thought what was mediatorial suggested some distance, whereas the love of God and that love to us rather brought in the thought of what was near.
J.T. But the idea of mediator is He has come in on behalf of and towards men. What should we know of God without the Lord becoming man? Everything must hinge on His mediatorial position.
{223}
HINDRANCES TO THE OUTFLOW OF DIVINE LOVE
@John 3: 16 - 21; @Revelation 15: 5 - 8; 1: 13; @2 Corinthians 6: 11 - 18
I wish to speak on this occasion about divine love and particularly to point out what hinders its outflow and activities. I read the passages in Revelation in order to show you what hinders the outflow of divine love, first in its bearing towards the world, and, secondly, in its bearing towards the assembly.
John points out, or asserts by the Spirit, in the passage read in his gospel, the bearing of the love of God towards the world; and in his first epistle he asserts its bearing towards the saints. In each connection he speaks of the Lord Jesus as the only-begotten Son of God. In the epistle he says: "Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him" (@1 John 4: 9). Thus he formally distinguishes between the love of God in its bearing towards the world and in its bearing towards the saints, and I hope to show from the passages read in Revelation what hinders its outflow towards the world, and what hinders its outflow towards the saints, so that we may be able to determine severally whether these hindrances have any place with us, and if so, that we may, as discerning them, judge them and abandon them, for we cannot, beloved, afford to be without the present outflow and service of divine love.
Now in speaking of this, I am quite conscious that I am speaking of perhaps the greatest thing; indeed, I am speaking, or hope to speak, about God Himself -- an undertaking of which one is conscious, for there is a sense of one's meagreness and littleness in regard
{224}
of God. But notwithstanding that one is conscious of one's smallness, one is also conscious of God's greatness, and His greatness is seen in measure in His ability to use what is small; for we are in a day of small things and, one may say, in a day of small vessels. One is therefore encouraged to approach such a great theme, and in approaching it I would refer for a moment to the revelation of God, or, as the more correct word is in @John 1, the declaration of God.
What you will observe in this passage, which is so brief and yet so full, is that there are two different tenses employed by the Spirit: "the only-begotten Son, who *is* in the bosom of the Father, *he hath* declared him" (@John 1: 18). The declaration is viewed as in the past. The mind is directed to the records of the gospels. This gospel was written long after the death, and resurrection, and ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ into heaven, and the writer directs our minds to the present position of the only-begotten Son as being, in the bosom of the Father; as it says, "who is in the bosom of the Father". Our minds are therefore directed to the source of love, and to the channel of love -- the holy, divine channel of love, and in using that expression as I do with reverence and holy regard for the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, I would suggest to you the importance of understanding His mediatorial position. Everything emanates from God, "for of him, and through him, and for him are all things" (@Romans 11: 36). Everything that emanates from Him must return in its results to Him, and in between lies the great mediatorial position and service of the Lord Jesus Christ. Unless we lay hold of that we shall be beclouded in regard of many portions of scripture, and the wonderful passage which I have cited, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father", is a mediatorial reference. You may say, it is a family reference. Be it so,
{225}
beloved; He is the only-begotten Son, surely; but, being that, *He is where the love is*. The love *is;* it is something that exists. The revelation of God is spoken of as something that has occurred; the declaration of God has taken place; it stands, but, He by whom it has become effective is in the bosom of the Father.
Christianity is a living thing. Think of the influence that flows out -- not that flowed out, or will flow out, but that flows out from the only-begotten Son as in the bosom of the Father! Think of the magnitude of the position! The declaration is complete as to testimony; it cannot be added to; it stands for every family, but the only-begotten Son in the bosom of the Father is a present thing.
The Son is where the love is, and being there, He is competent to make it known, and to give it freshness of application; and the Holy Spirit is here corresponding to that. The position is marvellous -- the present position -- the Son seen mediatorially as the only-begotten Son where love is. It is all in His hand, and in order to make the thing effective He is seen as the Spirit of the covenant -- not as the Son, but as the Lord: "Now the Lord is the Spirit" (@2 Corinthians 3: 17). He is pleased to assert His divinely given authority to make the love effective, for what is before God, is not only that His love should be commended, but that His love should be effective and, as regards ourselves, that it should be in our hearts. The Son is in the place of the love -- the bosom of the Father -- but He asserts His authority so as to enforce it, and as we know what He is doing, we are perfectly restful in according to Him full rights as the Spirit of the covenant. "The Lord is the Spirit", it says, "but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".
Having said so much about the position, I want to show you, by the Lord's help, the things that hinder.
{226}
First, as regards the world. You will observe that these seven angels come out of the temple of the tabernacle of witness in heaven; that is to say, there is an allusion to that in which God would show Himself. The tabernacle is that in which God would show Himself, that in which He would set out what I have been speaking of; but now, instead of showing Himself, as He sought to do and as He still seeks to do (thanks be to Him!) through the gospel, instead of showing Himself in the tabernacle of witness, these seven angels come out clothed in pure white linen, but girded about the breasts with golden girdles. These circumstances call attention to what had been available to the world. God had come out tabernacle-wise, so to speak; He would make Himself known. Baptism, according to Matthew's gospel, was to be to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit -- a most wonderful privilege for men, for God was there. He had come out in the mediatorial system; there was the Father; there was the Son; there was the Spirit -- all the blessed divine Persons revealed and active for the blessing of men. Now that marks the present moment, but instead of the continuance of it, you have in this passage the temple and the executors of divine wrath issuing forth. The angels are clothed with pure white linen -- characteristic of those who draw near to God. I hope we all know what this means -- pure white linen. The Lamb's wife is clothed with such. Those of us who avail ourselves of the privilege of access to God know that it is the requirement of God within. But then alongside of that we find the breasts are girded; love has been hindered -- a solemn thing for the world! It is for us, as having access, to understand that divine love towards the world has been hindered.
Now what I want to show is that the hindrance is through organised means. John in the passage I
{227}
read says, "men have loved darkness rather than light". The condemnation was and is that light has come into the world -- the most wonderful light has come, as I said, in that mediatorial way, but men loved darkness rather than light. I want to point out briefly how men's love of darkness had led them to organised opposition to God. Opposition in one person is bad enough, but opposition in two is worse, and so as it multiplies the evil increases. Hence in chapter 16 we have outlined for us the varied features of this organised opposition to God.
I think it advisable that attention should be called to this, because at the present time we are faced with this organised opposition to God. I do not charge all those who are in it with knowledge of it, or intent, nevertheless the thing is there. I am not for the moment speaking of religious organisation (I hope to speak of that later), but of organisation among men. John says that men loved darkness rather than light -- a terrible indictment against our race! Much is made of man as a race at the present time; there is much effort to exalt him, but here is the solemn statement of Scripture -- of God -- that men loved darkness rather than light, and hence, in order to effectively shut out the light, they have resorted to organisation. You will find in the gospel of Matthew opposition to God in pairs of men; for instance, in the two possessed with devils; @Matthew 8: 28. The revelation of God in the gospel is met by organised opposition.
And so these angels, with the public testimony in the golden girdles about their breasts that men are shutting out the love of God, proceed to deal judicially with what is most responsible. But how God, to the very end, would call attention to His own love; the executors of His judgment, as I may say, wear the badge of it, negatively, I admit, but nevertheless there. The golden girdles about the breasts proclaim to all that God is resenting the exclusion of His love
{228}
by men. Consequently, you find the cities of the nations fall. Cities refer to centres of government, to centres of organisation, and the effect of the judgment executed by these angels is that the cities of the nations fall.
I cannot go over the features in detail, I only call attention to them. Judgment falls first on those with the mark of the beast; secondly, on the masses of mankind; thirdly, on the sources of influence -- the fountains and rivers -- and so on, to the governments of the world. God takes account of all these features among men as representative of the organisation that exists to shut out the love of God from this poor world; and then having told us of the complete overthrow of this organised opposition to God among men John says, "and great Babylon was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath". See @Revelation 16: 19. Babylon is the greatest organisation that has ever existed; its ramifications and antiquity exceed anything that has ever existed among men, and the Holy Spirit reserves for it a special place in this awful judgment that God is about to pour out. And why? Because it has effectively shut out the love of God. It is the most effective weapon in the hands of the enemy to shut out the revelation of God in Christ from the hearts of men. Its fall will be complete. God's eye has been on it, and is on it. It is a carefully developed system, covering hundreds and hundreds of years, and it stands today as the most effective organised weapon the enemy has ever wielded against God. Now that is a solemn indictment, but it is true, and it is well that christians should be aware of it. "Strong is the Lord God who has judged her" (@Revelation 18: 8). It is true the beast and the ten kings will be His instruments, but God does it; He alone can do it. I do not believe there is in this world the means of doing it. It is a spiritual organisation and it stands out, as I said, the most
{229}
effective weapon ever wielded against God -- against the revelation of God in this world.
Well, so much for these seven angels who came out of the temple; in all that solemn affair, God asserts that it is because they have stood in the way of the outflow of His love to men.
Now in chapter 1 I come to what is nearer home. In what we have just spoken of we had the Lord presented in His relations with the world, but here He is walking in the midst of the seven golden lamps, and as there He proclaims by His habiliments that divine love is hindered. It is a most solemn thing to hinder the outflow of divine love. God is love, and He is set for the flowing out of what He is; He delights in it. So the Lord appears to one who knew well what the breast of Jesus meant. John presents the Lord Jesus as *in the bosom* of the Father. He alone does it; he was competent to do it, for he himself knew what it was to lean on the divine bosom. A wonderful thing, beloved! He was accustomed to lean on the bosom of Jesus; he knew it well, and only those who know it can rightly speak of divine love. Of course, we may speak of what Scripture speaks of, even with unhallowed lips, alas! but who can speak of divine love? As I said, it *is*. The only-begotten Son who *is*; it is a present thing. Now John knew what that thing was; he knew what it was to lean on the bosom of Jesus, and so he would understand what the golden girdles meant; he would understand that it was a question of *God* -- gold usually has reference to God. God would notify the assemblies that there were hindrances to the outflow of His love, but you find they are not yet organised -- thank God! The organisation of which I spoke sprang out of the bosom of the assembly -- terrible thing! As Judas went out from the very bosom of the circle in which Christ was loved, so Jezebel has gone out. But the assemblies are not regarded as organised against Christ (thank
{230}
God they are not!), but what you find, alas! is that the greatest, the most privileged, the most enlightened of them -- Ephesus -- had left *her* first love. She had receded.
Who is there here that has receded from the love that you once felt beating in your heart for Christ? What about it now? If you have moved away, you have moved back, and what can the Lord do now but exercise authority? He has authority. Look at the habiliments of the Lord Jesus in this passage and repent -- do the first works. You say, It is a dispensation of grace. It *is* a dispensation of grace, but do not turn the grace of God into lasciviousness. If you have receded, He has authority and He threatens. Does He threaten in vain? No, He carries out His threats; "except thou repent", as He says. Do not let the night pass over you without repentance, if you have receded.
But then He deals with everything in the assemblies that stands in the way of the outflow of the love of God. He brings in the fire: "every one shall be salted with fire", @Mark 9: 49. So the next assembly, Smyrna, has persecution ten days. Happy for Smyrna! Happy for everyone whom the Lord chastens, upon whom He brings in the fire; it is their salvation. And so Smyrna is, as it were, saved, for He says, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life".
And then another hindrance to the outflow of God's love comes in in Pergamos, where a wave of lawlessness sweeps in and the doctrine of Balaam is taught. You say, What is that? It is friendly associations, and keeping up family relationships, having ungodly people around you and forming links with ungodly neighbours -- that is what that is; "who taught Balak to cast a snare before the sons of Israel, to eat of idol sacrifices". The Lord is dealing with the *things* that
{231}
interfere with the love of God, and so one would appeal to the saints as to this doctrine of Balaam, lest we are allowing Midianitish relationships, friendly acquaintances and visitations with those who are of social status but who are not christians, or are worldly christians -- one of the most deadening things that the enemy uses to hinder the outflow of the love of God to us.
Then there is Thyatira, which I need not go into -- that great development of which I have already spoken -- great Babylon, and following on that there is the incompleteness of Sardis, and, lastly, the worldliness and independence of Laodicea.
And may I not, beloved, in connection with the Laodicean hindrances say a word of exhortation in regard of the danger of wealth? "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning", @James 1: 17. "Every creature of God is good ... being received with thanksgiving", @1 Timothy 4: 4. But I know of nothing that makes more for independence than material wealth. "I am rich, and am grown rich, and have need of nothing", @Revelation 3: 17. I know that that refers to more than material wealth, but may I not be warned myself, and warn others, too, as to the danger of accumulated wealth? The Lord says: "He has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor" (@Luke 4: 18); and again, He says in His answer to John the baptist "poor have glad tidings preached to them", @Matthew 11: 5. I am dwelling on things that hinder the love of God. It must appeal to every christian that anything that hinders the love of God must be dealt with in ourselves at once and drastically, for we cannot afford to do without the love of God. And so He comes down to Laodicea, she is wealthy He says, "thou art neither cold nor hot". Her wealth and boasting
{232}
entered into this. He is dealing with the things that interfere with the outflow of the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. You will understand I am not speaking in favour of anything like socialism, because the Scriptures place a value on material things; for if rightly used, and if those who have them are qualified to administer them, they are of great value; but I do see in myself, and in many, the great danger of accumulated means. It is the divine intent that there should be "in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of Jehovah", @Zephaniah 3: 12.
Now, in order to enforce what I have been saying, I want to say a word as to @2 Corinthians 6. Midianitish influences had been at work at Corinth. The Lord had directed His servant Paul to write to them, for He was not yet girt about the breasts with a golden girdle; thank God, the girdle was not yet on! The Corinthians were still loved, and the Holy Spirit being there, there was still a channel for the communication of divine love, so instead of coming with a rod the apostle sent a letter -- a very wise and loving way of dealing with them, and, as the sequel shows, a most effective one, so that although there had been the danger of the necessity of putting on the golden girdle, he says now, "Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is expanded". He is dealing specially with the saints in that city. "Corinthians" -- he was speaking feelingly, he wanted them to know that the love of Christ which was in his heart for them had been driven back, but now it was flowing out again. "Our heart is expanded", he says. But then there was still a great straitening amongst them, so the apostle adds, "But for an answering recompense ... let your heart also expand itself". "Ye are not straitened in us", he says, "but ye are straitened in your affections;" then later, "if even abundantly
{233}
loving you I should be less loved", @2 Corinthians 12: 15. There was no straitening on his side; if there was straitening, it was in their own affection.
And so, in closing, may I make appeal to the young people here, "Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers". That is what marks many, I fear, consequently there is a narrowing up, a straitening, so that the ministry of the love of Christ is not circulating in your hearts. Hence the apostle says, "Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers". And lest there should be any doubt as to what he means, he speaks of righteousness and lawlessness; these two are diverse and must never be put together. Then he says, there are light and darkness -- and what fellowship has the one with the other? There are Christ and Beliar -- you cannot put these two together. The passage leaves no doubt at all as to what is meant. There is the believer and the unbeliever. Am I associating with an unbeliever? He may not be an open idolater or blasphemer, but is he an unbeliever? Then there is the temple of God of which I have spoken; if we have any knowledge of access to God, we know what that means; it is over against idols. The Lord leaves no doubt as to what He means. And it goes on to say, "*Ye* are the living God's temple". What a marvellous word! Then he says, "I will dwell among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people". You see what God proposes; He would not only dwell among us, He would walk among us -- would move about amongst us in His love. He loves us when together; He loves us in our homes; He loves us in our businesses; He would make His love known to us in every relation. But He shows there must be the avoidance of the unequal yoke. Then is added, "Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated ... and I will receive you; and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and
{234}
daughters, saith the Lord Almighty". Think of the way the Lord comes out to us to make His love known! "Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God's fear". Thus we shall not interfere with or hinder the outflow of His love into our hearts in every relation.

SPIRITUAL MATURITY
1 Corinthians 16: 13; 1 Samuel 2: 26; 3: 19 - 21; 7: 3 - 13
I have in my mind to speak about maturity amongst the people of God. It is aimed at as we know in the world: young people aim at it in order to succeed and shine in the world; they have to mature into manhood and womanhood. We have the idea of worldly sophistication in the term "son of hell", which the Lord alludes to in @Matthew 23: 15, and correspondingly in the sphere of the house of God it is of primary importance that there should be maturity -- *men*.
The word 'men' used in Scripture designates, not only members of our race, but also full development or growth. The Corinthians were lacking on this point; and where development according to God is not progressive, we may be assured of adverse inroads of other growths as at Corinth. They had not developed into manhood, so the apostle put it on them that they should quit themselves "like men". The epistle shows they were not doing this, that instead of having developed into manhood they had remained babes. Paul therefore reminds them, that for that reason they had been at great disadvantage in regard to his ministry, for he had been unable to present to them what belonged to full growth.
God had wonderful things for such; there was "that hidden wisdom which God predetermined before the ages for our glory" (@1 Corinthians 2: 7) -- for the glory of *men*, not of babes. "We speak wisdom among the perfect" (verse 6). Wisdom's thought is men, and the wisdom God had predetermined before the world was for such.
{236}
Eye has not seen, and ear not heard, nor had it entered into the heart of man what God had prepared for those that love Him. Those who love God are not lovers of themselves, they are not heady or high-minded; they are not naturally ambitious, or lovers of pleasure or of the things of this world.
It is a wonderful thing for young people to be marked off as lovers of God. God has prepared wonderful things for those who love Him, and all things work together for their good, and they know it. "We *do* know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose" (@Romans 8: 28). The Corinthians, not being thus marked off as lovers of God, were at an enormous disadvantage, and so the apostle, at the end of his first epistle to them, introduces elements calculated to lead them on from a state of childhood to manhood. As he approaches the great subject of the fellowship of the Lord's death, he says, "I speak as to intelligent persons;" not that they were that characteristically, but he was regarding them in the abstract in that light; they had the Spirit though they were babes. They were babes in Christ and had the Spirit. The apostle says later on, "in malice be babes". How many of us, alas, are skilled in the way of evil thoughts. In malice be babes -- that means that you have not even learnt the thought of malice, it is foreign to you. It is an awful thing to retain malice in one's heart for we shall soon become skilled in it: if you harbour it, you will soon find out ways of expressing it, whereas a christian should be a babe wholly unsophisticated in evil things. But in our minds we should be men, fully developed; so here it says, "quit yourselves like men".
I want to show briefly that it is men whom God employs. In all that God does, in the inauguration of any era, He begins with those who are mature; it is not His way to work up to something. He began
{237}
with Adam. Adam was not a development, he was a complete thought presented at the outset; Adam was never a boy, he was a man. God began with a man, and as if He would call attention to him and bring out the evidences of maturity and perfection, He caused the lower creation to pass by him to see what Adam would call them. When matters come up amongst us -- and we are tested by things as they arise -- can I call each thing by a name, can I give it a name that expresses what it is morally? How many of us misname things! We call black white ofttimes, and white black. Here is a creature coming up to Adam, what does he call it? Is he a babe? No, he is a man, who has just come from the hand of God with a spirit from God; "Jehovah Elohim ... breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul" (@Genesis 2: 7). Whatever name Adam called any creature -- each living soul of cattle or beast of the field -- God never altered the name; what Adam called it that was its name; God owned the intelligence of the man; Adam was a man. Thus God began the present creation -- as we know it -- with maturity, with an intelligent being at the head of it.
I might run through the Old Testament and point out many instances in which this same principle is enunciated, but the Lord Himself is pre-eminently the expression of it. Luke, especially, gives us His manhood, and he tells us, "Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old" (@Luke 3: 23). Why does the Spirit of God call attention to that? Note that it was after He is seen coming up out of the waters of baptism and praying, and after the heavens were opened on Him and a voice from heaven had said, "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", that the Holy Spirit tells us, "Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old". Attention is thus called to His perfect manhood; God waited for that. He was, we know, perfect at every stage of
{238}
His blessed growth in this world; but I am dwelling now on the one point, when the Holy Spirit says, "Jesus *himself"*. I believe that attention is thereby called to the Person, as if to say He was in the consciousness that He was a Man according to God. God begins with Him, there is no development beyond Him, whatever follows is to be according to that standard.
So on the day of Pentecost we have development according to that Man. Christianity did not begin with babes. The Lord Jesus began with babes, but He did not commit anything into their hands as babes, but He did to men -- to those who quitted themselves as men. We see men equal to the great obligation resting on them on that great day -- the day of Pentecost.
The males in Israel were wont to go up according to the law to Jerusalem on that day, but never had men appeared on the day of Pentecost like these. These were men, and as that day was accomplishing, they were equal to it. They were like those of whom the Lord said at the feast of tabernacles, "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (@John 7: 38). You see the magnitude of the thing; one believer in Christ was to become practically a vessel of living water in this world. "And when the day of Pentecost was accomplishing, they were all together in one place" (@Acts 2: 1). There were no bickerings, not one of the one hundred and twenty said, 'I of Peter', or 'I of John', or 'I of James': there was no party spirit in that company. Then it says, "parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit". There were no dwarfs, they were the handiwork of Christ, they were men; God began the dispensation with men. That is what may be called a cardinal principle in the ways of God, and I want to show from Samuel how it worked out in him.
What I have to say will, I hope, be intelligible and
{239}
applicable to the young ones here. If you are to have part in the assembly, you must be developed. You may have part in the house as of the family, but the assembly contemplates men. Think of the magnitude of those words of the Lord, "on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16: 18). What a wonderful thing it is to belong to that! If you are to have part in the assembly there must be development, growth, and maturity. In the house provision is made for the youngest babe to have part, but in the assembly one must be a man -- developed. So with Samuel we find he grew. We read in @chapter 2: 21 that he "grew before Jehovah", in verse 26 that he "grew on", and in @chapter 3: 19, "And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him". He appeared on the scene and his history is given, written down by the Holy Spirit for young people. He is spoken of as a boy several times: the word 'child' -- chapters 2 and 3 -- should be read 'boy', which is more accurate. A boy is in advance of a babe, but a boy is not a man.
"The boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli", and showed him respect. And as being led on toward maturity, he had light divinely given him as to the complete failure of the priesthood, and the judgment that would fall on Eli's house; yet he was not told to communicate this to Eli, for it would not be in keeping with the house of God that the boy Samuel should do so. Eli drew it out of him, but the overthrow of his house had already been announced to the aged priest by a man of God sent by God to tell him. See @chapter 2: 27. Samuel recognised him who as yet occupied the position of priest. We read also that he "ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod".
Now young believers are not naturally marked by sobriety, but as Samuel grew he wore a linen ephod -- he bore the marks of a priest, which in christian
{240}
language means that among other services he prayed. It was a *linen* ephod; he would be sober in his prayers, he would not attempt to be eloquent. We need not be eloquent to pray, we are speaking to God; to have in mind that we are speaking to God has a most sobering effect. Samuel wore a linen ephod. But then he "grew on", that is, Samuel was never stunted. Steady growth is an immense thing for young people. "The boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men". We see from these scriptures that as young brothers and sisters develop in their growth, God takes notice of it. I am assured that God is the first one to notice growth in any one of us. Growth is extremely slow even in natural things, but God knows how much growth there is in a tree or even in a blade of grass though no one else may notice it. Samuel grew on; who could notice that from day to day but God? It is most delightful to be conscious of being in favour with God; to know that He looks at you as His own plant, and that He waters you and watches your growth. It is true Samuel's mother took account of his growth but that was yearly.
People notice your growth, but not a day's growth yet growth is day by day, hour by hour, and minute by minute. His mother made him a coat from year to year, it was a yearly matter; she took account of his growth yearly. Hannah may represent the Lord's people, who watch the growth of the young ones and make little coats for them. We do not want to put on a boy what belongs to a man, "Him that is weak in the faith receive, not to the determining of questions" (@Romans 14: 1). Take account of his growth, and make the little coat according to his growth. That is our part. Many of us hinder the growth of the little ones by the size of the coats we make for them; we must not put on young people what they are not equal to. We must take account of their growth and see to it
{241}
that they are suitably clothed in the house of God.
Samuel grew on and was in favour with God and men, he was delightful to God; that is, the coats are neither too large nor too small. A young believer growing up is a plant of God's planting and God watches him. If God so clothe the grass, how much more does He watch over plants of His own planting? How He beautifies, waters and tends them, and notes the growth; it is delightful to Him. Samuel was in favour with men as with God, for the saints normally are quick to discern the growth and it is a pleasure to them, too. What a joy it is to see young people growing up, and to recognise the superiority of those formed with God! They grow *on* and are in favour with God and men. The elder brethren take notice of them and value them; they are plants of divine planting, and are looked upon with pleasure. Such are God's ways.
At the end of @chapter 3 it is Samuel, no longer the boy, but as having arrived at manhood, at maturity; "Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground". He has *words* now, and they are worth something. It says, God did not let one of them fall to the ground. It says of the sparrows, "and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father" (@Matthew 10: 29), but here it is did "let none of his words fall to the ground". Think of the power operating! Here is a young man come to maturity; he has words and says things, and God does not let one of them fall to the ground. That young man is wearing a linen ephod; he is not excited or carried away by prosperity or success in his service; he has words of importance. His words may not have been many; we are not told whether he made long speeches or wrote books; there may have been only five words with the understanding, but whatever they were they were Samuel's words, and none of them fell to the ground.
{242}
There are many such words at the present time -- held up by God and maintained in the power of the Spirit; they are living. How important for young people to maintain sobriety and to have their loins girt about with truth; the affections not allowed to flow loose, but girt about; every thought held in relation to the truth, and every word uttered in relation to the truth. Such words are gold, not one of them is allowed to fall to the ground. God reckons them of value. One loves to think of words flowing from those matured in a spiritual way; they are not forgotten but cherished, and made to live above the ground by the Spirit. It says "all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah".
It is now no longer *his* words, for a prophet speaks *God's* words, and Samuel was now known to be a prophet of the Lord. He had spoken many times before, and God had made his words to stand, they were helpful words, but now he had become known, not only in Shiloh, where he lived, but from Dan to Beer-sheba. Is not that something to have before you, to be known among the brethren as one who speaks the mind of God? Are these things beyond us? No, they are not beyond us; the apostle says, "Desire earnestly the greater gifts" (@1 Corinthians 12: 31). The best gift is prophecy -- "rather that ye may prophesy". May I not desire to prophesy? Was there ever a time when the word of God was more needed? Think of it being within my range, to prophesy -- to utter the mind of God! There is the more excellent way -- the way of love, and love is compatible with prophesying.
How important to grow up respecting those before you, wearing the linen ephod, growing up under the eye of God and finding your words of value among the saints. Then God takes you up, because if you are to be a prophet God must take you up, and He does; He is looking for such as you. "Desire
{243}
earnestly the greater gifts". God needs you, the need of the saints everywhere is distressing, and God would provide for it, but He must have vessels; and if He is to have vessels, they must be fashioned after Christ, they must be men not boys; in their understanding they are to be men and to quit themselves like men. They are to disdain rivalry, to think of the need of the brethren and to know the mind of God. So "desire earnestly the greater gifts", "but rather that ye may prophesy" -- that you may edify the assembly. It was known that Samuel was a prophet from Dan to Beer-sheba, his ministry was to cover the entire area of the land. He was not a prophet like Isaiah or Jeremiah; the point is he was ministering to his own generation. He was a man whom God raised up to lead on to the recovery of the ark and the establishment of the kingdom; and, as in other cases, he was a man by whom God inaugurated the thing -- one who had arrived at maturity.
Now in @chapter 7 we are in the presence of a crisis, and the manhood of Samuel is brought to light. If the Holy Spirit presents a thing, He presents it perfectly; so in this chapter it is not the boy Samuel but the prophet Samuel. The passage I read (chapter 7), shows that he spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, "If ye return to Jehovah with all your heart, put away the strange gods and the Ashtoreths from among you, and apply your hearts unto Jehovah, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines". I say to the young people here, note the speech of that man! How evident it is that he had God before him in what he says, and that he would have every rival or disputant of God dismissed from the minds of the people; he abominates idolatry. The apostle John in his epistle, writes: "Children, keep yourselves from idols;" the babe is apt to be carried away by idols, but a man -- a man in spiritual measure
{244}
-- is against idolatry, for idolatry disputes the rights of God. So we see after this beautiful appeal of Samuel that "the children of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtoreths and served Jehovah only". The ministry is effective at once; it is the ministry of a man matured spiritually, whom God is supporting; the people act on it; his words had moral weight. Ministry is sure to be effective as proceeding on these lines.
Then Samuel says, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah", and we read: "And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day". The ministry of a man who is a prophet and brings in the mind of God is sure to bring about the desired result. The wise woman of Tekoah (@2 Samuel 14: 14) said later, "we ... are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again", but she was only repeating words put into her mouth by Joab, but here they poured the water out *before Jehovah*. I dwell on this to show you how effective ministry is which flows from one whom God supports. It was effective, not only in leading them to put away the idols, but as bringing them to the consciousness of what they were in themselves. If I have gone after idols, it discloses what I am in myself. We have to come to what we are, and prophetic ministry discloses that to us; we are all vanity, we are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God will take it up again. They "poured it out before Jehovah". If God takes up that water, it must be an entirely new thing, and that is what christianity is, and prophecy brings it out. Samuel did not tell the people to do this but they did it; the point is his ministry is effective. Of what value is ministry if it is not effective? We want an effective ministry.
Still the Philistines come on, so the Holy Spirit
{245}
presents to us the manhood of Samuel. He takes a sucking-lamb. That was not water; the people had acknowledged what *they* were, and now we get what presents *Christ*. The lamb that was offered is a beautiful type of Christ. This new thing is in keeping with the water poured out and also in accord with the intrinsic excellence of Christ. A *man* -- a full-grown man -- delights in the perfections of Christ. Paul had such a sense of the superior excellence of Christ, that he says to the Corinthians at the end of his first epistle, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha" (@1 Corinthians 16: 22).
Well, Samuel takes this sucking-lamb -- it is one of the most beautiful pictures in Scripture -- the Philistines are coming on, and he offered it as a whole burnt-offering to Jehovah; it represents faith in Christ's perfection as He is, which is a perfect answer to the water poured out. If I have accepted what I am in my worthlessness, I come to see what Christ is in His infinite worth. That is presented to God, and what delight God has in that whole burnt-offering offered up to Him! And Jehovah answered and thundered, with a great thunder, on the Philistines on that day, and there was a complete victory for Israel, but complete discomfiture for them.
Then Samuel sets up his memorial; "Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, and said, Hitherto Jehovah has helped us". Only a man developed after Christ would put such a thing in a memorial. It is a question of what *God* can do, and it is for us to live in the light of that. However powerful a man may be -- and a spiritual man is powerful -- that is not the point. Eben-ezer does not mean that; it involves that *God* is powerful.
In every era of the history of God's people it stands, "Hitherto has the Lord helped us". That is the memorial which those who are matured have.
{246}
What may we not expect in our own times with such a memorial? What God can do; and He *is* working. There is a great deal more going on than we are aware of; He helps His people on every hand and will help them always and to the end. A man spiritually matured recognises that and sets up this memorial to God.
Then it says, "And the Philistines were subdued, and came no more into the borders of Israel; and the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel". What an immense deliverance to be delivered from these Philistines -- these big men all about us -- for that is what they are; some of them have always figured amongst us. But in the presence of men like Samuel -- men who are matured, who have outgrown babyhood, but in malice have remained babes -- the Philistines will never invade us. The hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel; that hand is with men who are developed after Christ, to preserve us from the attacks of the Philistines. While we have men -- those who are matured spiritually, who are no longer babes, and who quit themselves like men and are strong -- we are preserved. Paul adds to that exhortation, "Let all things ye do be done in love". What a remedy! There will be a sure solution of every difficulty if this principle be applied: Let all things be done in love.
{247}
FRUIT BEARING
@John 12: 20 - 24; Hosea 2: 23; 1: 10,11
It is laid on my mind, dear friends, on this occasion, to speak of fruitfulness. The idea, as you will all be aware appears early in Scripture; it appears on the third day of what we call the creation. There can be no doubt that the submerged condition of the earth occasioned its fruitfulness -- layer upon layer being laid on into which God in time would give the impulse of life, so that the earth, as the Lord says in the gospels, should bear fruit of itself. There was the latent power of fruitfulness there, placed there divinely; it was placed there of God. It was not simply the outcome of natural causes, as men speak, for the actual life or fruitfulness that issues therefrom is directly from God. The creation was not some-thing let go from the divine hand to operate itself -- such is not the divine way. God ever holds His hand over, and under, and about what He creates, so that as we read of a bare grain sown, "it may be of wheat, or some one of the rest: and God gives to it a body as he has pleased" @1 Corinthians 15: 37, 38.
The third day in @Genesis 1 was marked by the earth emerging from its submerged condition -- the dry land appeared; it came out fertile, it came out with latent life from God, so that it was to bring forth, as God said, "Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb producing seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, the seed of which is in them" @Genesis 1: 11. The botanist may trace it to what he calls nature, or natural development or evolution; but Scripture connects it with God; as I remarked, the grain is placed in the earth, the power of life is in the earth, but *God* gives it a body. We see, therefore, that God is behind everything -- even the
{248}
very blade of grass, as the Lord says, "if God so clothe the herbage of the field" @Matthew 6: 30.
There is a course that is called 'nature', which indeed is said to be a teacher in Scripture (@`1 Corinthians 11: 14), but God is behind *that*. It is not simply, as I said, that He commanded it and then let it work its way; He is in it. Thus the third day speaks particularly of fruitfulness and what the earth brought forth on that day -- the grass, the herb producing seed and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed is in itself, after its kind. God would have things as He intended them; He never intended that things should be crossed; He would have the thing as it is, according to its kind. But all was His own design; there is neither a flower, nor a tree, nor even a blade of grass that has not issued forth thus from the divine thought.
So the Lord refers back to that day in this remarkable passage that I read, when He said: "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone". The earth itself had gone through that in figure, for everything in the divine way must come through death. The earth itself had been in death figuratively, so that in principle it was life out of death. All material things -- that upon which men live every day, and depend upon for sustenance -- are really the issue of life out of death. How few know it, how few admit it! But it is a fact. And so the Lord says, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die". If the earth itself had to be submerged figuratively, how much more so man whose history Scripture records!
We read "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth;" He did not create the earth in a submerged condition, it became that, and if the material thing had thus to go down into death, I repeat, how much more so man? Certain Greeks had come up. They came up as Greeks, and said,
{249}
"We desire to see Jesus". What thoughts must have arisen in His holy mind, beloved brethren, as the representatives of the Greek world came up! They belonged to the race of which He had become one; in wonderful condescension He had become a Man; they stood out as the most renowned branch of it.
One can understood how in His holy mind the history of the Greek world would come up; He knew it well. Could He regard them as suitable? Would their renown, their literature, their oratory add to Him? You can understand how all this would come into His mind, for He was a Man and as such stood related to them. He would extend His mind, extend it further and further afield, for there were men and men, the different families of the race; but here were the representatives of the most renowned family; would He recognise them as suited to God? Nicodemus had come earlier -- the very best, religiously. One can understand too how the Lord would refer back to the history of those whom Nicodemus represented.
And now the Greeks come up. They represent the race -- not religiously, but as the very best the race can produce from the standpoint of human wisdom, and learning, and literature -- they stand out without a compeer in the minds of learned men at the present moment; the world never produced such men as those Greeks; their names fill the pages of history. Would the Lord take them up as such? Are they such as shall add to Him? Are they such as He can be head to? Let us hear Him speak. Are they the fruit that He had in mind? Do they represent what God had in His mind when He said to Adam and Eve, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth" (@Genesis 1: 28). Do they comport with the divine idea of a people for the earth? No, they did not. When Adam was formed, Christ was in the mind of God; Adam was but a figure of Him that was to come.
{250}
Even the posterity of Adam and Eve would not do.
And now we have the very One that was to come, the Son of man, and as these Greeks come up and desire to see Him He said, "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified". How glorified? Shall He find His glory in the Greek world? Shall He find it in the Latin world? Shall He find it if He looks eastward into the Semitic world? Shall He find it in Africa? All that came up in His mind. The hour had come that He should be glorified; but how glorified? What did the Greeks care for Jesus really? The very reproach of the cross in their account was but foolishness; the Lord knew that, and so He says, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die".
What a scene! These ancient worthies, as they are called, set up alongside the precious name of Jesus! One recoils at the very mention of it -- to set these men up alongside the peerless name of Jesus! He repudiates it; He says, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone". Not one of them, however renowned, has a place with Him. How sweeping! But then the divine thought remains, and the earth is to be peopled, for of wisdom it is said, "My delights were with the sons of men" @Proverbs 8: 31. The earth is to be peopled and so the Lord proposes to die.
Now, fruit depends on sowing. John does not give us the parables of our Lord in which He speaks of sowing, but he does give us this simple figure. It does not say that He was sown, for no one could sow Him. We may say He sowed Himself. The word is, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground". It fell into the ground. God would always protect the personal glory of our Lord. He fell into the ground; it was not accidental, it was deliberate. It was as though, having taken a survey of the race, and knowing perfectly what marked it, He deliberately
{251}
entered into the ground. Not only did He die, but He fell into the ground. He says to John later, "I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead" @Revelation 1: 17, 18. Think of it, dear brethren, He became dead!
He said, too, "Thus shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights" @Matthew 12: 40. Was there ever such latent power of fertility in the earth before? Never. Not only now the grass, and herbs, and fruit trees, but a race springing out of it, a race according to God's mind. It was the divine way. The divine way was that fruit should come out of the earth; He entered into it deliberately, hence, beloved, the fruit.
Notice with John the use of the word 'much'. He says "much fruit". John's ministry refers to our own time, and it is an encouraging feature that you have 'much'. Not only much as the result of Christ dying, but the fruit borne from every branch is to be much. "In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and ye shall become disciples of mine" @John 15: 8. And again, "Every branch in me not bearing fruit, he takes it away; and as to everyone bearing fruit, he purges it that it that it may bring forth more fruit" (@verse 2).
Well, that leads me to what I had particularly on my mind, and that is, the sowing of the saints. The saints are definitely sown. It is not a question with them of falling into the ground. In the parables of @Matthew 13, the Lord speaks about two kinds of seed, the first is the *word* of the kingdom, and the second is the *sons* of the kingdom. I wanted particularly to speak about the latter, because it is a time of fruit-bearing. The testimony, the word of the kingdom, is to be preached, but what God is developing now, I believe, through the ministry of John, is the *persons* of the saints. They are the sons of the kingdom, and that is really how the dispensation began. God
{252}
began with persons. Ere the Lord went to heaven He had prepared the persons, and having the persons the testimony went out; so that the one hundred and twenty refer to what was sown in the way of persons, and then their testimony was the word of the kingdom; the two things go together.
But I wish particularly to speak of the persons because God never intended that a testimony should be presented by those who are not the thing themselves. There was to be the fruit-tree bearing fruit whose seed is in itself. That was the divine idea, and so the Lord, as I said, first speaks in the parables in @Matthew 13 of the word of the kingdom, and: it is most interesting to note in that connection that He sat down to present that (see verse 2). The sower sowed the seed upon different soils, but He sat down and spake. I understand by that that He was doing it deliberately, and I understand further that there is an allusion to His present position.
This dispensation was set up most deliberately, and it is maintained with the greatest deliberation and discrimination so that you have, first the Sower sitting down and sowing, and then you have the fishermen sitting down and selecting the good fish -- discriminating. I mention that because God is looking for fruitfulness, but He expects in that connection the utmost deliberation and care so that the right seed is sown. I am speaking now of the word of the kingdom. There is much sown abroad, alas! that is not strictly the word of the kingdom; it may be partially so, but not strictly so, that is to say, it is not done with deliberation and discrimination.
But then there is, as I said, the seed, representing the sons of the kingdom, referred to in the second parable of @Matthew 13, and that I think is what is so important and perhaps some of us have not thought of it. There were the sons of the kingdom represented by the wheat which the Son of man sowed in
{253}
His field, and I understand that every one of us -- every single believer, every true believer -- is a son of the kingdom; that is, he is sown. It is not simply that I am a product of the testimony, but *I am sown, you are sown*, and alongside of us, the evil one sows his sons. I note the word 'sons', because it is a question of maturity, or full development. What God sows in this world in the way of persons are those who are developed spiritually and He intended that they should reproduce. I bring this before you, dear friends, because of its great importance. The divine intent is reproduction, and it is reproduction according to its kind; there is to be no admixture.
Now the enemy, as the Lord said, came and sowed tares. They were also persons, they were not principles. It is a mistake to make them principles, they are persons, and the enemy has developed them; and they are called his sons, the sons of the evil one. The wheat and the tares grow up together; such is the condition we find ourselves in, the sons of the kingdom, and the sons of the wicked one growing up together. The sons of the wicked one, alas! are reproducing; the world is being filled with them -- pernicious teachers, persons who are produced by the enemy, as the Lord says, "An enemy has done this". These men are all about us, beloved friends. But then what we are concerned about for the moment is the sons of the kingdom. God has set us here to bear fruit.
Now I turn to Hosea, because he develops this thought. The son born to the prophet, Jehovah said was to be called Jizreel, which, as many of you will be aware, means, 'God soweth'. If you look through chapter 2 you will find that God calls out the remnant and teaches her under the figure of Jizreel, and says: "I will sow her unto me in the land". The import of that is that God, having separated the remnant, intends in the last days that
{254}
they shall reproduce; they may be numerically few but they will be fruitful. God will work with them in patience. He says "Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart. And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth" (@Hosea 2: 14, 15).
He teaches her to call Him husband: He sets her up in relationship with Himself and He makes a covenant for her with the beasts of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens. Then we read "And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith Jehovah, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; and the earth shall hear the corn and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jizreel" (verses 21, 22). It is a question of fruitfulness -- of sowing. God intends to sow her in the earth, in the land: He intends to sever her wholly from the nations that she has been under, to set her up in relationship with Himself and in relationship with heaven, and to furnish her, and then He sows her to Himself.
Thus in that way the Jewish remnant will be sown. "I will sow her", He says, "unto me in the land". And what a seed! They will be like Jesus, for no other seed will God sow. Then it says in the end of chapter 1: "Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured or numbered". Note how in keeping this is with John; how God intends to enlarge His people, to multiply His people through themselves! Christ is the great seed both in regard to them and in regard to the gentile world -- all issue from the same grain of wheat which fell into the ground and died, but then every one that is the result of that is to continue to reproduce; so that the number of the children of Israel is to be as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered! Think of that result, dear
{255}
brethren, and all on the principle of divine sowing He sows her unto Himself.
Well, now to come back to the application. God would increase us; He would increase us through ourselves, so to speak. You will understand that the Lord Jesus, the great seed that fell into the ground, is the source of all: there can be no fruit apart from Him, nor can any of us bear fruit apart from abiding in Him; nevertheless, God would have reproduction, not only by what I say, but by kind -- what I am. Is it a mere accident that the apostle Paul refers to Timothy as his child? The truth is he was like Paul, he was of his kind. He could write to the Corinthians: "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child ... who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ" (@1 Corinthians 4: 17). Hence the importance of understanding what the original seed is -- the fruit-tree, as it says, bearing fruit whose seed is in itself. I want you to understand what the original seed is; it is Christ, but as characterising the believer. Thus fruit is borne as others are affected by him. The seed is in itself, so that what is reproduced is really what is according to Christ, but it is like myself; hence the importance of being like Christ, beloved. What I reproduce is to be like myself; but that supposes that I am like Christ.
Look at the malformation all around us religiously, because those who present the testimony are not *it;* they are not like Christ. God uses the greatest care that the remnant should be separated, and that they should be set up in relation to Himself, and furnished in every way from Himself; and then it is said she is sown: "I will sow her unto me" He says. Mark that! How serious a question this raises, for every one of us!
If God has set me up here and has sown me in that way, am I reproducing? God would multiply us,
{256}
as I said, through ourselves. He would multiply His people through themselves. The one hundred and twenty at the beginning refer to a seed; they are the outcome, as you might say, immediately of the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying. Take account of them; the Holy Spirit loves to dwell upon them. In @Acts 1 the Spirit of God gives an account of their character -- what they were -- each one bearing his own distinctive feature. "The crowd of names who were together was about a hundred and twenty" (@Acts 1: 15); one hundred and twenty varieties of life. These were together on the day of Pentecost as it was accomplishing, with one accord, in one place, and the Holy Spirit came and sat upon each of them. There was unity, but there was nevertheless distinction and individual recognition, for the Holy Spirit sat upon each of them. In that way each one of those one hundred and twenty persons was, as it were, sown unto God.
Now the first great addition to that number was by the testimony -- by the word of the kingdom. Peter preached the word and three thousand souls were added. Thus, the first great result was by the preaching of the word of the kingdom; but later on we find them being edified and multiplied; @Acts 9: 31. You must distinguish between being added to and being multiplied. God adds to us, but then there is the idea of multiplication, and that is through ourselves.
I beg of you to notice this distinction; first it says that the Lord added, and then later that they were multiplied. The two ideas are very different in meaning; the multiplication has reference to what we are ourselves, what God does through us, but it is not a question of preaching. In chapter 9 it is a question of what the saints were: they were edified and had the comfort of the Spirit and then they were multiplied; and that is what God is doing. There is the testimony, the word of the kingdom going forth, and the Lord adding as the result, but there is too
{257}
the multiplication, and the multiplication, the reproduction is not only a question of preaching, otherwise it would all depend on preaching, but of what we are personally, hence the idea of multiplication refers to every single christian, whether there is gift or otherwise. Thus we see what a field is open to us -- the word of the kingdom being sown, and the sons of the kingdom being sown.
{258}
THE ASSEMBLY AS THE ANOINTED VESSEL
@Luke 4: 16 - 22; @1 Corinthians 12: 12, 13
J.T. The expression in @1 Corinthians 12: 12, "so also is the Christ", evidently alludes to the assembly as anointed. It seems to convey what the apostle had in mind mainly in writing to them -- that they might arrive at the divine thought of spiritual dignity and power in the anointed vessel -- the assembly. The anointing involves sanctification. Much is said of it in the Old Testament in the types especially in Exodus and Leviticus, God thus intimating that the tabernacle and the priestly service connected with it should represent that holiness and moral dignity that are becoming to Himself. One feels that there is a great deal of light amongst the saints, and perhaps much enjoyment of it, but without that separation, and sanctification, and dignity which are becoming to the light. It is obvious in the first letter to the Corinthians that the divine intent was that there should be in Corinth a vessel answering in sanctification to the light within. I thought it would help us to see how important the anointing is as first presented in Christ in Luke. Luke makes much of it, because he is concerned as to that which is comely and dignified, and free from the natural and worldly elements that so often creep in amongst us.
Y.Y-l. Is the thought of holiness and that of sanctification the same idea?
J.T. Yes. Aaron is called the "saint of Jehovah" as officially representing the divine thought.
Y.Y-l. Is not the thought of holiness linked with the divine nature? Is sanctification identified with that in Scripture?
J.T. It is the same idea; we are set apart in holiness. "Be ye holy, for I am holy" (@1 Peter 1: 16). Sanctification
{259}
on our side corresponds with what God is in His nature. Man was perfectly presented in Christ even from the outset of His being; as born into this world He is spoken of as "the holy thing" (@Luke 1: 35), and as ascended into heaven, He is "holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners" (@Hebrews 7: 26). The divine idea is brought into manhood and developed in the Lord Jesus here, so that at His baptism it is seen that the vessel was morally suited to be anointed, and the Holy Spirit came down in bodily form as a dove upon Him. He identifies Himself with the vessel. What God is, is thus manifested in a Man. Now that is to become true in men, so that there may be a vessel here -- the assembly -- to which God can commit Himself. A vessel was there in the Lord as the Son; holiness was there inherently in Him, but it showed itself humanly, so to speak, in incarnation. The anointing is God committing Himself to men, and giving them such power as would enable them to truly represent Him.
Ques. Various people in Scripture are anointed: what is the underlying thought of anointing?
J.T. It is God committing Himself to men, I think, and dignifying them by conferring power by which they should rightly represent Him in testimony. Satan, according to @Ezekiel 28: 14, had been anointed -- "Thou wast the anointed covering cherub". He was in some measure in the secret of God's purpose, he stood in that place. So too in the Psalms, in reference to the covenant made with the patriarchs, God says, "Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm" (@Psalm 105:15). The idea of anointing is also connected with the priesthood and the prophets, then later with the king.
Rem. In the leper, too.
J.T. Quite; but these are the *official* features in which it is set out -- in the priest, in the prophet, and
{260}
in the king. But then there is the tabernacle, which suggests the thought of an entire system, representing the whole created system -- the moral system in which God is to shine out; that too was to be anointed.
L.D.M. Do you think Luke has the anointing specially in view when he says, "remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high" (@Luke 24: 49)?
J.T. Just so. They could not rightly represent God otherwise; so that the idea of representation enters into it, hence the moral qualifications must underlie the divine committal to us in the anointing. There must be a vessel fitted for anointing.
G.N. So it would be a serious thing if we stooped to act in the flesh instead of in the dignity of the anointing.
J.T. Yes, that was what I was thinking. One has to say it feelingly that generally the walk and conduct of the saints are below the divine thought. Luke presents the divine thought set out in the Lord: Paul, in the main, I think, is occupied to bring it about in the saints.
Ques. Is that due to lack of enjoyment?
J.T. I think so. The word in @1 Corinthians 12: 13, "For also in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit;" gives the thoughts that underlie the public position, that is to say, the baptism into one body merges the saints in a spiritual way, it merges us all in one another, and you accept the position, you are not restive, you are content in it; but in being given to drink of one Spirit, you enjoy it. Drinking is the practical enjoyment of the thing. It brings in the thought, too, of mutual enjoyment; whereas baptism, being the act of another, merges us all together, so that each has his place. The one is according to the divine will, and the other that I accept it and enjoy
{261}
the position given me, by drinking into the one Spirit.
A.H.C. In @Leviticus 8 Aaron and his sons are bathed with water, then clothed, then anointed: is that what you have in mind?
J.T. Yes. I think the truth stands in Leviticus thus: God is in the tabernacle and He speaks out of it, that is the position; then He invites the people to draw near according to their measure. It is the worshipper -- the man himself -- who draws near; he comes with an offering, a burnt-offering, a meat-offering, a peace-offering, a sin-offering, or a trespass-offering; it is his doing, and according to his own measure. These chapters therefore bring out the moral qualities of the saints, as built up for the divine pleasure; the worshippers show, by their voluntary action Godward, the measure in which they correspond with Christ, and how far they see what He was, as represented in these various offerings, in going into death. Their appreciation of Christ is measured by their offerings on whatever line they may approach. Then the law governing all these offerings was given to the *priests*, so that the standard might be maintained amongst the people of God. In chapter 8 God reverts to His own thought; so the high priest is anointed apart from death, and the tabernacle is anointed with him, setting forth the position of Christ as the inaugurator and maintainer of the divine system. Christ was anointed in manhood apart from any thought of death; the Spirit came down and identified Himself with Him at the outset of His service here for God. His death comes in on *our* account, so when we have learned the epistles, and they have had their place with us, we go back to the gospels to see the divine thought set forth perfectly in Christ -- it is seen in absolute perfection in Him -- His personal dignity and immunity from death. Then the saints -- typified in Aaron's sons -- are brought in through death in connection with Him.
{262}
G.N. So we see and learn the thing as presented in Christ as man.
J.T. Yes, I think that is how we believers learn it. We begin with Romans, we learn it first there; that gives us the Spirit individually; then in Corinthians we see the place of the Spirit in regard to the company, and as set up in the Spirit we go back to the gospels and learn the perfection of every quality in Christ personally. I apprehend the gospels were written later than any of the New Testament books, for they were given when they had become necessary to the saints as empowered in the Spirit. They were qualified in the Spirit to contemplate perfection in Christ. That is what gives the gospels their great importance; they stand alone. In @Leviticus 8 we have perfection in a man presented typically, and the whole system anointed with him.
E.R. In the end of chapter 8 we get the food of the priest; is not that an important point? It was not simply appropriation but assimilation. In partaking of it, we become like what we partake of.
J.T. Quite. That is what the gospels I think are for: they are strong meat to build up the priestly constitution. Aaron and his sons were to remain in the tabernacle throughout the whole period of their consecration. @Chapter 9 brings out Christ in relation to Israel, but chapter 8 sets out particularly the assembly position, and in a way may be said to be "the Christ". God has secured the system of things, which was prefigured in the tabernacle, and a priesthood in it sufficiently dignified to represent Him here. The thought of the priests as maintaining for God during the entire period of their consecration needs our special attention. The food of the priests is given in chapters 6 and 7; the skin of the burnt-offering went to the priest, setting forth complete correspondence to Christ in His devotedness to God.
Ques. Would you say that is brought about by
{263}
the Spirit? In Corinthians it says, "so also is the Christ". Would it refer you back to the gospels and show how by the Spirit the thing has been effected?
J.T. Yes, hence you have the thought of the Spirit and the drinking into it. The baptism into one body, and the drinking of one Spirit are both necessary to the divine thought of the anointed system.
Y.Y-l. You could hardly get the thought of "the Christ" in the gospels, could you?
J.T. I think "the Christ" means the anointed; obviously in Corinthians it refers to the saints.
Y.Y-l. That is why I asked whether "the Christ" covers more than Christ personally as presented in @Luke 4.
J.T. Yes, as in Corinthians; "so also is the Christ" refers to the saints, to the whole system -- the anointed system. But the nations are banded together against the Lord and His Christ, or His anointed, which is the same thought. Where you get God committing Himself to us -- to men -- the enemy seeks to attack. So when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed they attacked (@2 Samuel 5: 17); it is the same in @Psalm 2, they are against the Anointed. Even as to the Lord it is after He was anointed that He was carried of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted. The thing was put to the test; the greatest possible test was brought to bear upon Him, and He overcame. The dignity in which He overcame, the great moral power that marked Him, greatly affect one: no struggle, no effort, it was done in dignity. What power was there! He answers by the word of God and the enemy is powerless. Then he comes to Nazareth, and we do well to see how the anointed Vessel comports Himself in the place where He had been brought up. He comes into the synagogue, and as One anointed by the Spirit, He avails Himself of what was there. The Old
{264}
Testament was in the synagogue, and we see how such a One uses the Scriptures. Today we see how thousands misuse the Scriptures, for, alas! they are not anointed, with the result that the Bible is brought into discredit.
Rem. Philip knew how to use the Scriptures.
J.T. Quite: but look at the Lord here, and look at Paul in his handling of the Scriptures; but this is a unique passage; we see here what use can be made of the Scriptures by an anointed vessel. Here in Luke we learn how grace is presented to men, and what place the Scriptures have in that service; it is presented in this gospel to call attention to the anointing. In going among the heathen, one might not resort so much to them, because they are not accredited there: one would need a miracle, perhaps, a sign from God; but here in the synagogue of Nazareth, where the light of God was acknowledged, that was not needed: the Scriptures were already there, and the Lord's use of them is a guide for us now. We do not need signs in christendom: the Scriptures are already recognised, but we do need to know how to use them, otherwise we shall bring them into discredit.
Y.Y-l. It is remarkable in that connection how Peter is able to take up and apply the Scriptures after the Holy Spirit had been given.
J.T. It is remarkable. One is thankful that the Authorised Version is 'Appointed to be read in Churches', in synagogues, so to speak, but it is a serious responsibility for those who assume to discredit them. Many of them are not anointed and therefore are not qualified to handle them. The Lord went into the synagogue. The book of the prophet Isaiah was delivered Him -- that particular volume of the Scriptures had doubtless been read by others; the Lord knew what was in it, He took the roll from the attendant and stood up for to read,
{265}
and found the place where it was written. He knew where the text was which covered the light of the position at that moment.
G.N. That is continued in Peter in @Acts 2; he knew the text that would apply to the situation.
J.T. He stood up in the dignity of the anointing.
Y.Y-l. When you speak of the dignity of the anointing do you mean a man standing up in the power of the Spirit?
J.T. When it is a question of ministry, yes. I am thinking also of what is in 1 Corinthians, which is not a question of ministry, though that is included, but what the saints are collectively.
Y.Y-l. As the anointed vessel?
J.T. Yes. If one stands up to minister, not as relying on the energy of the flesh, nor as allowing natural ability or education, but as relying on the Spirit, he does so in spiritual dignity. There is a dignity about that man and he will not discredit the Scriptures; he will rather enhance them. So Luke gives us the details as to the Lord in the synagogue; he shows that the roll of the Scripture was handed to Him, and that He found the place where it was written (this is not merely an incident, it is in keeping with what Luke has before him), and He reads it, then He closed the book and gave it again to the attendant and sat down, as much as to say, This scripture covers the dispensation. It is a fixed thing; there is no uncertainty about it -- He sits down. Then He begins to speak, and He makes application of what He had read -- "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach", etc., saying, "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears".
H.H. He knew where to stop in the reading of it.
J.T. Quite so, and it is an important thing not to go too far.
{266}
Ques. Does Peter standing up with the eleven suggest the vessel?
J.T. That is a levitical touch: it shows he was not beneath his dignity as a Levite. In chapter 1 he stands up *in the midst of the brethren*, showing that he understood the assembly, but in chapter 2 he stands up *with the eleven*, showing he understood his levitical position.
Y.Y-l. If the ministry needs to be in the grace of the anointing, what about those who listen?
J.T. That, I think, comes out in the company. It is just the general thought that I would press; how the Lord handled the Scriptures and what an effect it had on His hearers, though the sequel shows there was no work of God in them, but the manner of the minister was such that they were all affected. If there had been a work of God there, they would have fallen down and owned that God was there.
G.N. Whatever the position calls for, there is that in the anointing that can meet it. Here it is a question of the expression of grace, is it not?
J.T. That is what Luke has before him, that the vessel is in keeping with the testimony -- the testimony is not discredited by the minister, for all was in the grace of the Spirit. So they marvelled at the words of grace that came out of *His mouth* -- attention is called to the Vessel. Although in result they opposed Him and would murder Him, nevertheless the testimony of grace was brought to them.
A.H.C. The chapter (@Luke 4) opens with mention of the Holy Spirit: is that important?
J.T. I think Luke emphasises that. John, in speaking of the Spirit, uses the word 'holy' occasionally, but Luke almost invariably so, and that because it is a question of holiness and dignity, and because he is emphasising the moral quality of holiness. The Lord is referred to as "the holy thing", indeed the early chapters of Luke impress you with holiness;
{267}
holiness marks the whole scene. Everything is marked by the grace of the Holy Spirit.
F.W.J. This was in humiliation too in Luke, so it involved being despised.
J.T. Yes, and I think that the holy anointing oil, with which the priests were anointed typified really the spirit of the lowly, dependent, suffering One. The leading ingredient was myrrh -- which means the spirit of a suffering Christ. As we understand the truth as to the Spirit according to Romans and Corinthians -- that is as given to us individually and collectively -- then we begin to see it is no less than the Spirit of Christ, and the spirit of a suffering Christ. Philippians answers to it; the Spirit of Christ in the saints involves suffering; and all priestly service involves suffering. Luke, when he records in the Acts the Lord appearing to them in resurrection, says, "after he had *suffered"*.
F.W.J. Will you say a little about the assembly as being the anointed vessel?
J.T. I think the apostle had that in his mind in writing to the Corinthians. The facts that come out in the epistle show that they were very far beneath the divine thought. He could say they came behind in no gift, which was true, and that God was faithful who had called them to the fellowship of His Son; but their practice was not marked by the holiness which priestly service calls for, so the apostle has to exhort them to self-judgment. I hear, he says, there are divisions among you; one says I am of Paul, another, I of Cephas, and another, I of Christ, that is to say, there was the revival of the old Greek method of hero-worship among them. This had marked the Greeks, and of course it marks man, but particularly where there is ability amongst men, and where there is ability there is sure to be party work men become leaders of a party. The assembly at Corinth had dropped from its dignity as having the
{268}
Spirit of God to the level of men. Paul says to them, "for ye are yet carnal ... are ye not men?" (@1 Corinthians 3: 3, 4). Then he immediately proceeds to point out to them the manner of his preaching, that it was not in human wisdom, or human learning; he did not go to the Greeks for any help at all in his preaching: he did not study their eloquence, or bring it into his ministry; he would know nothing among them "save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified ... and my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power" (@1 Corinthians 2: 2 - 4). He would own no power save the power of the Spirit. In chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4, he deals with the question of his ministry, what it was, and what ministry should be, a ministry which owed nothing to man.
Y.Y-l. There would be great spiritual gain amongst us if we gave more place to the Spirit.
J.T. Yes. Many of us, alas! have gone to the Greek schools for help, that is, we have relied on natural ability; Paul says deliberately, he had used none of these things. They had made him a leader, but he never intimated in the least degree that he wanted a following; he realised that he was anointed. His preaching was on the principle of the anointing.
Ques. Was the fact of the anointing the way to meet the situation -- that he should come in among them and know nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified?
J.T. Quite. In @Luke 4, immediately the Lord ministered on the line of the anointing, their natural minds began to work -- "Is not this the son of Joseph?" On another occasion they said "How knows this man letters, having never learned?" They could not see how a man without any training as far as they knew, could thus minister; they could not appreciate the anointing; they say virtually, how can *he* minister? And Paul, although he had polish,
{269}
and education, and ability too, determined these should not be seen; he would know nothing save Jesus Christ and Him crucified; in his ministry he would be marked by the anointing. Then when he wrote his letter to them, he sends Timothy with it so that he might bring them into remembrance of the apostle's ways -- "my ways as they are in Christ" as he says: having Timothy there would be like Paul in their midst.
Y.Y-l. As reflected in Timothy.
J.T. Exactly. His child in the faith.
A.H.C. The training for the ministry as men say, which we find in christendom, is practically a denial of the Spirit.
J.T. It is, and it leads, alas! to the discrediting of the Scriptures. It works out in that way, for they take up the Higher Criticism and other things, which undermine the authority of the Scriptures.
Y.Y-l. Chapter 2 speaks of the revelation being by the Spirit and the communications being made in words taught by the Spirit; and finally they are known only as being spiritually discerned; so there is a word for the listeners as well as for the minister.
F.W.J. Do you view the anointing as upon a man in service in distinction to the Holy Spirit indwelling?
J.T. Yes, I do. I think it shines there particularly, for in presenting the testimony the point is that it should not be discredited but rather enhanced by the vessel. We have to distinguish between the *indwelling* of the Spirit and the anointing of the vessel with a view to a true representation of God here. The princes of this world did not recognise the wisdom of God -- the hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory. The princes would, I suppose, be the great people -- the learned people, but none of them knew the "hidden wisdom;" for if they had, they "would
{270}
not have crucified the Lord of glory", for it was all there in Him.
Ques. Would you say the anointing gives the true christian character?
J.T. Well, it does. It enters into our walk and ways and it enters into our being taught in the truth; @1 John 2: 27, "The same unction teaches you of all things". But I think Corinthians has in view the ministry first, and then the vessel in which *God* is seen in this world -- "God is indeed amongst you" (@1 Corinthians 14: 25). It is not just the Spirit as given to an individual christian.
Rem. So that one should always be characterised by the anointing.
J.T. Always.
B.E.R. The anointing brings about unity. Would you say a word in regard to @Psalm 133 in this connection? There the company is in view.
J.T. That is the last of the Songs of Degrees except one. It is the culmination of the exercises of the remnant; they arrive at the thought of brethren, and brethren dwelling together in unity, and that is the result of the anointing. The psalmist says, It is "like the precious oil upon the head", because they have arrived at the thought of brethren as dignified by the anointing -- "the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard; that ran down to the hem of his garments". I think the psalm brings out in a beautiful way what we are speaking of, what brethren are as having come to the unity of spiritual affections; the dignity of Christ in heaven is seen descending on them.
Y.Y-l. So would it be right to think of the assembly as having the anointing, having the mind of Christ -- a competent vessel for the thoughts of Christ?
J.T. Certainly, and now God would bring about in every local company some correspondence with
{271}
that. What underlies it is "in the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body". It works out practically as we find ourselves baptised into one body and made to drink of one Spirit; that is, we are all merged: not in socialism, but in spiritual power. We lose our peculiarities in the merging. Water baptism means that I am submerged, but as baptised by the one Spirit, I become merged.
Y.Y-l. Baptism by water separates, it does not merge.
J.T. It takes you out of the world; but the baptism of the Spirit means that I am merged. One may have distinguishing features naturally, but it is not nature there; all is in the power of the one Spirit: that which made me distinguished after the flesh is laid aside, the baptism disposes of all that, so that one fits into the company, and answers to the divine thought as to the company as the vessel of the Spirit. Then further, it is not simply a question of being subject, but I am happy in it, so he says, we "have all been given to drink of one Spirit". If I have drunk of it, I have enjoyed it, and when this is so, it becomes true that the vessel of the glory of God is secured.
Y.Y-l. What marks me naturally goes, and Christ becomes prominent.
F.W.J. Then the anointed vessel becomes the witness of the moral glory.
J.T. Yes. So in @Exodus 29: 43, God says of the tabernacle, "It shall be hallowed by my glory", but the anointing underlies that. So the apostle says, in @1 Corinthians 14: 23 - 25, "If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place ... But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or simple person come in, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all ... and thus falling down upon his face he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you". The glory is there; it is God that is manifested.
{272}
B.E.R. Would you say the sanctification is the result of the anointing?
J.T. In that full way, it is. I think the element of sanctification begins as you apprehend Christ's death as closing up all that is of the flesh, and you desire to be true to His death; you see God is holy; but in that complete way, the sanctification of the vessel -- of the system -- is by the divine presence; God is there. So the man falls down on his face admitting it. It is a wonderful thing to come into a company and see such subjection and unity -- each one so fitting into his place, that there is room for prophecy; and the mind of God being thus brought in, a man coming in is affected: he says, 'God is there'. The assembly is the anointed vessel for the divine glory to shine in, and no one can resist that -- the man falls down and admits it. There were three companies in Corinth -- the Jew, the Gentile, and the assembly of God. All three might be in the same street, so to speak -- the synagogue, the Greek temple, and the christian assembly. If I go into the synagogue what do I find? Maybe I find the Scriptures there, and Jewish Rabbis there -- Rabbis who assume to minister from the Scriptures. There are traditions, musty effete things spoken of, and my soul is withered. I get nothing, nothing at all, death reigns there. Then suppose I go into the heathen temple. What I find there is satanic power; Greek wisdom and philosophy -- Greek learning, but satanic learning is represented there, and I recoil from it. I get out of that place. Then there is the assembly of God and I come into the christian assembly, where I find men and women sitting -- anointed persons, subject to God, and they have the Scriptures. A brother gets up, he is in the dignity of the anointing, and he reads the Scriptures with power, he speaks about them, he applies them, and my conscience is affected, I say, 'God is there'. The testimony is enhanced by the
{273}
vessel as the result of the anointing; that was what the apostle had in mind. The same thing applies now; in any locality where the saints are, there should be this moral dignity, so that souls are attracted; they find God there.
Ques. Is not that the real need amongst us -- being under the power of the Spirit so that souls are attracted?
J.T. I think that God has before Him at the present time to bring about that very thing -- that there should be something to attract souls, as they come into our meetings.
G.N. It is as we walk in moral dignity we have any influence with our brethren. It is said of David "he behaved wisely;" he had tremendous influence in Israel. We read he was anointed in the midst of his brethren -- what is the meaning of that?
J.T. It is a type of the Lord, I think; He was distinguished in that way; Christ is distinguished among us. The position in 1 Samuel is set out in Hannah. Her desire was for someone to meet the situation that had become so bad. Being the desire of a woman, Hannah represents the subjective state of the remnant, that, taking account of the situation according to God, would desire to have it met. Then, alongside that, there was the natural desire of the people to have a king like the nations, and they get their desire -- they get Saul. And yet again, alongside that, there is the desire of God, there is the thought of God, to bring in a man after His own heart. Outside Hannah's desires and outside the people's desires, God had His own desires -- "Jehovah has sought him a man after his own heart" (@1 Samuel 13: 14). It touches one to think of God's own heart, His own desires! Then Samuel is sent to Bethlehem to the house of Jesse, for God had said, "I have provided me a king among his sons" (@1 Samuel 16: 1). God Himself had taken account of the state of things and He had found a man
{274}
after His own heart. Samuel goes, and the proceedings went on: but David -- God's chosen king -- was not there when Jesse made his seven sons pass before Samuel, so he said to Jesse, "Jehovah has not chosen these". David had not entered into anyone's mind, and yet it was he who was in God's mind. So Samuel says, "Are these all the young men? And he said, There is yet the youngest remaining". Yes there was another, but one who had never been thought of by anyone, not even by those who were nearest and dearest to him, but he was the man God had chosen. Samuel says, "Send and fetch him; for we will not sit at table till he come hither". And as soon as he arrived, Jehovah said, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he" (@1 Samuel 16: 12). He is anointed in the midst of his brethren; he is distinguished in that way -- in contrast to Saul, who was anointed in a sort of private way -- and in the power of that anointing he went forth. Samuel was to take an heifer with him when he went to Bethlehem to anoint David, meaning that there would be a subjective answer to it -- the feminine animal gives a subjective thought. Saul sought to check that by bringing in Merab and Michal for David, but they did not conform to the anointing at all. David's spouse must be of a different family from Saul. See @1 Samuel 25. That is what Paul aimed at securing. He says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ" (@2 Corinthians 11: 2). The apostle knew well that Satan's effort would be to corrupt their thoughts.
F.W.J. Do you view the anointing rather as a question of the operations of the Spirit than of gift?
J.T. It is more a question of the operations of the Spirit in chapter 12. The chapter opens with the subject of spiritual manifestations, and, as the chapter proceeds, the apostle works the thing down to the truth of the body, and then he says, "God has set certain in the assembly" (verse 28), and he gives the
{275}
order -- first, apostles, etc. The truth of the body must be seen first, and when we understand that we are Christ's body and members in particular, then each christian has his place in the power of the Spirit; then there is room for the gifts.
F.W.J. Is it the capacity of the body as the anointed vessel rather than the resources that come from the Head?
J.T. Just so, but you can see how the exercise of gift in testimony is made to fit in with the idea of the assembly as the anointed vessel. Each saint should have his place, then there is room for gifts.
F.W.J. The vessel in the scripture you quoted is the vessel in a corporate position: "so also is the Christ", then "members in particular" gives the idea of all the members.
J.T. Yes: "*ye* are Christ's body".
{276}
THE FAMILY OF GOD IN RELATION TO THE SERVICE OF GOD
@Exodus 3: 12; 4: 22, 23; 28: 1 - 4
J.T. I thought that in looking at these scriptures we might see the relation which the family of God bears to the service of God. Genesis, I understand, speaking generally, presents the idea of the family; then Exodus takes up and develops the thought in connection with the service of God in the priesthood. Priesthood is connected with a certain family -- Levi (chapter 6). Genesis would, therefore, bear the same relation to Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers that John's gospel would bear to Paul's ministry. John finishes his gospel in chapter 20, presenting the brethren as receiving the Spirit in the form of the breath of Christ risen; "He breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit" (@John 20: 22). Thus we have a company -- the family of God -- introduced in which He develops His service. John does not give us the service of God in a formal way, Paul does that.
D.L.H. Does not John suggest it in chapter 20?
J.T. I think he brings in the foundation of it in the brethren being recognised as such by the Lord -- the ascending One, and in His breathing into them.
D.L.H. "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you" (verse 21).
J.T. Quite. It does not go beyond that, save that as thus constituted they are entrusted with the remission and retention of sins. But I think the outstanding feature is that they are recognised formally as the Lord's brethren and as receiving of His Spirit; "my brethren" corresponding to the sons of Aaron.
D.L.H. Then is your thought that the family
{277}
relationship underlies the thought of service and priesthood?
J.T. That is what I thought. If the service of God be taken up apart from the family relationship, we shall have a hard legal system, more or less perhaps governed by the word of God, but without the substance, without the affections underlying it, that suggest what God is. Christendom, I think, presents that -- a service, ostensibly the service of God -- without any idea of the family: men are not developed to be ministers apart from the family relationship. In Exodus we find that the great family development of Genesis is carried over under the paternal care of Joseph; he cherishes in a paternal way the thought of the family. So Exodus opens with the attempt of the enemy, seeing evidently what God had in His mind, to destroy that family in the males; but they were kept alive in the sovereignty of God. In @chapter 6 the Spirit of God chronicles the family of Jacob as far as Levi; they are all given earlier (@chapter 1), but the Holy Spirit returns to the family in chapter 6 and gives us the list until we come to Levi, then He stops there because, as is evident, He has in mind the ministerial side of priesthood, which is developed from the house of Levi; the ministers, the priests spring from the house of Levi. The family thought, therefore, ends up with Levi -- with the priests in @Exodus 6, so the passage closes with, "This is that Moses and Aaron" (verse 27), and you get no more, for that is what God has in His mind in these books. God had previously said to Moses, "this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain" (@Exodus 3: 12) -- -that is, at Horeb; it was there that the service of God was opened up and developed, and where He established the priesthood. But you will observe that before the thought of priesthood is developed, the Spirit of
{278}
God speaks of Israel as a son because, whilst the priesthood is developed from the family, it is really based on sonship (see @Exodus 4: 22, 23). Hence He says, "Israel is my son, my firstborn ... . Let my son go, that he may serve me". In moving about in different places one finds sometimes the family thought taken up apart from what is priestly, and then again we may see the priesthood assumed without any idea of the family affections underlying it. God would have us take in both ideas in connection with His service.
Ques. Have you any thought why Aaron comes first, in @Exodus 6 26, "This is that Aaron and Moses", and then, in verse 27, "this is that Moses and Aaron"?
J.T. Just because the priesthood is in view. Moses is essential in the setting up of the system, but the service has to be continued in Aaron -- in the priesthood.
Ques. Do you mean the sons were priests and we must know that relationship?
J.T. Yes, we must know the relationship of sons, and Hebrews shows that priesthood is based on sonship. "The word of the swearing of the oath ... a Son perfected for ever" (@Hebrews 7: 28).
E.J.McB. So that priesthood according to God is only carried out in the conscious sense of relationship.
J.T. If we have only the family idea it might tend to undue looseness, whereas the priests were charged with the law. The priests lips keep knowledge, so that there is a balance preserved in which the service of God is maintained -- the affection that belongs to the family on the one hand, and the requirements of the law on the other hand. The law would include whatever governs the house of God. The priesthood would be concerned about the light which governed the position.
Rem. You refer to holiness, I suppose.
{279}
J.T. Well, whatever governs the house of God -- as, for instance, @1st and 2nd Corinthians; the priest is concerned about that, there must be nothing of the law omitted; the "commandment of the Lord" must have full place.
D.L.H. Then your remarks, as I understand, have reference to the whole christian company in its priestly character. You are not thinking merely of those engaged in the Lord's service.
J.T. Not at all, for the priesthood applies to every member of the family. Every member of the family has his part in it. Peter, in his epistle, speaks of christians as new-born babes, those born of the incorruptible word of God; then he enjoins such to give up certain things and to desire earnestly the sincere milk of the word; they have their part in the family of God. But then they are to grow up to salvation, which is what the priests were clothed with according to @Psalm 132: 16 -- "I will clothe her priests with salvation". Then he says, "To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious, yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" (@1 Peter 2: 4, 5). Now, that includes every believer, but obviously the little ones require family attention first, those who take up the function of priesthood would be the sons -- those grown up to manhood -- those who have developed.
Ques. In speaking of the little ones there, are you referring to the new-born babes?
J.T. I was speaking in a more general way. John divides the family under three heads, the little children -- the babes, the young men, and the fathers. They are all in the family, and they are all priests, but you can understand that the question of growth enters into the exercise of priestly functions. Whilst the types speak of Aaron's house, and even his
{280}
daughters are mentioned, yet the priestly service belongs to his sons, whose names are given. Nevertheless the daughters had part in the priestly family, for they all belonged to the house of Aaron.
G.N. When you speak of the service of God in connection with priesthood, how do you connect it with sonship?
J.T. The epistle to Hebrews bases it on sonship.
D.L.H. You must be a son to be a priest.
G.N. But in the actual service, the priest comes first, does he not? Take christianity, does not the priest come before we enter into what stands connected with sonship?
J.T. Yes, but you are a son before you are a priest, for Galatians shows that all believers are sons. "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus" (@Galatians 3: 26). It is taken up in an objective way, we are marked out "that we might receive sonship" (@Galatians 4: 5).
Ques. Are the two thoughts involved in the declaration in @John 20: 17, "my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God"?
J.T. Yes, I think that is good. "My Father" would involve the family and is an eternal thought; sonship is an eternal thought; and "my God", the priesthood -- we are priests unto God.
N.L. Is the beginning that we are akin to Christ?
J.T. That is right. The relationship, I think, is seen in the breathing in @John 20 -- the intimate relationship in which we stand to Christ.
N.L. "All of one" it says in @Hebrews 2.
J.T. Quite; priesthood is a matter of very wide bearing, for it covers the whole of christendom at the present time, although, alas! many do not see that the service of God is connected with the family, nor that the family is seen in relation to the service.
Ques. Will you say a little more about the breathing, for in @John 20 it looks as though the breathing
{281}
is in view of their going into service -- manward perhaps.
J.T. No doubt, and that was part of the priest's office -- his lips were to keep knowledge, they were to hear the law at his mouth; @Malachi 2: 7. One great feature of priestly service is grace; not only is it established for things relating to God, but the priest was to exercise compassion on the erring and ignorant; so John begins with remission: "whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained" (@John 20: 23). We have the mandate connected with the assembly at the present time; the mandate to remit is a precious commission of Christ. In @Psalm 133 the relationship of brethren dwelling together in unity is likened to the precious oil on the head -- there is correspondence in the brethren with their Head. It flowed down upon his beard, and went down to the skirts of his garments. It suggests that the saints seen in the relationship of brethren dwelling together in unity, are qualified by the anointing to take up the service of God; God, as it were, commits it to them, and hence in the next psalm you have priests standing by night in the house of the Lord. They are standing; the idea of brethren is that you sit down and enjoy family relationships, but a priest is under a charge, and he stands and according to @Psalm 134: 1 "by night;" he has no easy time of it. He is prepared to sacrifice his bodily ease in view of the service of God.
Rem. So that what follows in @John 20 is the charge.
J.T. Exactly. Then in the book of Psalms, following on the Songs of Degrees, you find an increased and continuous outflow of worship to God. Every family is called up to praise God; and at the end of the book the whole creation is called upon to praise Jehovah. That is the principle, that is the order of God.
{282}
D.L.H. Is there not a connection between the thought of the family and the service in what the Lord said, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you"? (@John 20: 21).
J.T. Yes. The Son is at the Father's bidding; He delights to serve His Father. There is a very beautiful family link there. You are sent out in the consciousness of the relationship you enjoy within -- the relationship in which you stand to God and to Christ -- the family link; but when you look out on the world where you have to carry on your service, it is not then a question of family feeling, but of priestly feeling. In every place you exercise priestly vigilance, for in maintaining the service of God in a corrupt world you have to do with evil, hence the necessity for priestly watchfulness. In the early chapters of Exodus you get the service of God connected with the thought of sonship. "Let my son go". Then in chapters 28 and 29 you get the instructions which are to govern the priests so that they should be fully qualified; first you get much detail as to their dress, then their separation or consecration by the death of Christ, and then their service. The service is most onerous, and unless we see that and provide against it, we shall be unable to maintain the service of God in the midst of a corrupt world.
Ques. Would the family links maintain our souls in divine balance and the priestly links hold our minds in going forth?
J.T. Yes. The evil we have to contend with requires the greatest vigilance, and the only power than can meet that is the Holy Spirit; so the Lord says, "Receive the Holy Spirit". It is not merely the family enjoyment, but the element of holiness is needed.
{283}
D.L.H. Priesthood in the Old Testament had a special class in view; now the application is to the whole christian company.
Ques. But God's original thought was that the whole nation might be priestly; why the difference?
J.T. That was His thought, but in order to develop it He takes up the family of Aaron, because He has the family in mind. He would take up a special family to show that the thing hinged on the family, not on the nation. Priesthood is not really a national thought; it is a family thought, it develops out of the family. It is most important to see, as has just been remarked, that priesthood applies now to the whole christian company.
Ques. Does Peter pursue the thought in his epistle?
J.T. I think he does, but he develops the thought of priesthood in connection with the kingdom. Peter deals with the government of God, but he brings in the saints as a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices, and then as a kingly priesthood, to "set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light" (@1 Peter 2: 9) -- we are in the light.
Ques. When he says "obedient children" has he the family thought before him?
J.T. Quite. "Be ye holy, for I am holy. And if invoke as Father him who, without regard of persons, judges according to the work of each, pass your time of sojourn in fear" (@1 Peter 1: 15 - 17). Then he goes on to the thought of their being born again by the word of God, of their being clothed with salvation, and as living stones of their being built up a spiritual house, and then he brings in the thought of the priesthood; all was in view of priesthood, and Peter develops the subject in relation to the kingdom -- the government of God.
P.W. Is not the first thought connected with
{284}
priesthood a moral thought? "I will hallow Aaron and his sons, that they may serve me as priests" (@Exodus 29: 44). That was the first mention of it, before priesthood was instituted.
J.T. I am quite sure it is.
Ques. Would you say that in the vast extent of christendom they are not in the good of priesthood today?
J.T. Well, we do not want to say much on those lines lest it might appear that we are assuming to be that.
Rem. I was thinking of Levi.
J.T. Yes, the family of Levi was chosen of God. He said "thou shalt separate the Levites ... that the Levites may be mine" (@Numbers 8: 14). What the Songs of Degrees, which end in @Psalm 134, show in result is "brethren;" that thought is developed in these psalms. That is the first thing, and then following on that the priesthood -- not people claiming it, but being it. The priests stand by night in the house of Jehovah; they sacrifice their ease that they may serve God, they give up natural comforts so that the service of God may be maintained in spite of prevailing darkness.
G.N. Would you say that from the purpose side we are all viewed as belonging to the priesthood, but when it comes to actual service, we have to prove our genealogy?
J.T. Just so. Then we must have priests clothes and there are only certain clothes befitting the priests of Jehovah. If you desire to see the priests, you must look for those who by night stand in the house of Jehovah. These are the ones you want to look for. In the recovery, Nehemiah had so many priests garments, showing there was provision then for a certain number.
Rem. The outlook is universal in @Psalm 134.
J.T. Quite. If you look through the psalms from
{285}
133 onwards, you will see what the service of God yields to Jehovah. Much accrues to God from the service of the priesthood. So in @Psalm 135 the psalmist calls upon the house of Israel to bless Jehovah; he calls upon the house of Aaron to bless Jehovah; and he calls upon the house of Levi to bless Jehovah. That is the result of priesthood rightly exercised. He is concerned for God now, and he wants every one to bless Jehovah; that is what we are called to. We may know certain who are brethren and who have the Spirit, and whose privilege it is to draw near and to bless God, but people require a lead. One of the greatest things in Scripture is the principle of leading, of giving a lead, and it always means, I think, that you go forward and suffer; we have to be prepared to suffer in the service of God. The great leaders were the apostles, and Paul says, "God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death" (@1 Corinthians 4: 9). That is the thing -- God has done it; He has set them in the position in the field where they are exposed, and they accept it. If you stand by night in the house of Jehovah to bless Jehovah, you give people a lead -- you show that you have Jehovah before you, and you are prepared to suffer to maintain His service.
Ques. Is it that the conscious sense of the family relationship is sustained during night?
J.T. That is what underlies it. You know your eternal place is fixed. The priesthood is a provisional thought, sonship is an eternal thought, and hence the prominence of it in Genesis. But priesthood is a question of maintaining the service of God now whilst evil remains. The thought of priesthood will drop, when there will be no evil to contend against; the service will go on no doubt, but we need the priestly conditions and garments now, because evil is present.
Ques. What about @John 13, does the Lord give the lead there?
{286}
J.T. He certainly does. That is one of the instances in which you get a lead.
G.N. Will you say a little more as to the force of "by night" in its application to the present moment?
J.T. It is that you are energetic and prepared to suffer -- to suffer the loss of natural comfort and ease. You will remember that Eli, the priest, sat upon the seat by the doorpost of the temple of Jehovah; he was not standing -- he *sat* there, and it appears he slept in the temple, too. Samuel does, too, for that matter; instead of keeping the charge of Jehovah by night in His house, they went to bed there. We read, too, the lamp of God had not yet gone out, suggesting that the light was not being attended to. Eli lived to be an old man; he was fat and heavy and in the end he fell backwards from off the seat and his neck broke. A priest should not develop fatness nor heaviness; he should not be sitting by a doorpost of the house of God, he should be standing; there were no seats provided in the tabernacle; the idea is continual service for God; it goes on all the time. It says, "Samuel among them that call upon his name".
N.L. David says, "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eyelids, Until I find out a place for Jehovah" (@Psalm 132: 4, 5).
J.T. Yes, then it goes on, "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness" (verse 9). He would have the priests according to God.
N.L. Is not the education of the Songs of Degrees that we need to develop feelings and instincts that are according to Christ in regard to service manward? We do not feel enough.
J.T. I am sure that is right. In the first song he says, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech ... My soul hath long dwelt with them that hate peace. I am for peace; but ... *they* are for war" (@Psalm 120: 5 - 7). Then in the next psalm he lifts up his eyes to the hills and
{287}
his help comes from Jehovah. Then in the third song he speaks of his brethren and his companions; he had an outlook for all of them, and desires peace for them and would have them in Jerusalem.
Ques. Are there enough garments for such?
J.T. Well, I think the few that Nehemiah had is very suggestive. He did not expect a great many priests, but he *had* the garments -- that was the thing. He gave five hundred and thirty. I am afraid we are lacking in the garments; the rest of the people gave three score and seven, which shows that the people were in accord.
Ques. In @Psalm 132, two things are spoken of in regard of the priests clothing -- clothing with righteousness and clothing with salvation; then that the people shouted aloud for joy. What is the thought there?
J.T. It was very becoming that David should ask that the priests should be clothed with righteousness so that the saints should shout for joy. Anyone who understands the first book of Chronicles will see the bearing of this, for David intended the state of things at Jerusalem to be marked by priestly joy; but, before you can have that, you must have the righteousness. In connection with the ark being brought back according to the due order, the service of song was instituted. If you pretend to the joy without the righteousness, it is very poor -- "let thy saints shout for joy". Then God says, "I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy".
D.L.H. In the latter case it is "shout *aloud;*" it looks as if God goes, as we may say, one better -- He advances. Salvation is a little further on in a sense than righteousness.
Ques. Are the garments wrought out individually?
J.T. I suppose so. If you look at @Exodus 28 you will see what we require in the way of garments, and
{288}
the breastplate is the first thing -- love is the first feature.
Ques. How might we get a garment if we lack one?
J.T. We have to learn everything from Christ, for priesthood comes out in Christ and @John 13: 1 shows what the breastplate means -- Jesus "having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end". The first mark of priesthood is that I know and love the saints, and I am prepared to sacrifice myself to serve them. A priest is entirely free from the world; he is not held by any worldly consideration; he is free, too, of Satan and his power.
Ques. Will you say a little as to the material for the priests garments?
J.T. All the material for the tabernacle system really came from the people of God. It was a free-will offering. The material for the garments is wrought as the saints come to love God by the Spirit. It comes from God, of course, but it comes through the affections of the saints. It is a heave-offering, meaning that the saints, having come to love God, provide in a spiritual way all that is necessary for the service of God; but then, the pattern is ever to be before us; whatever you are making, it must be according to the pattern, and the pattern is Christ.
Rem. Chronicles speaks of a family who wrought in byssus -- the family of Ashbea; @1 Chronicles 4: 21. I was thinking such would make priests garments.
J.T. There were inner and outer garments for the priests. The inner garments were of linen. Those who work in fine linen are those who provide what would keep the saints sober: one of the greatest difficulties amongst us is the want of sobriety. We cannot have priesthood without sobriety, and we cannot be sober apart from the priestly linen garments; we are so apt to allow natural feeling and family considerations to influence us. The priest
{289}
was not to wear woollen garments; he was to wear linen garments next his body, because he was to be preserved in sobriety. It is not priestly to think more of your sister or your brother or your father or your son than of the saints, that is, as in the assembly (see @Leviticus 10). The priest, as in the sanctuary, is neither to drink wine nor to wear woollen garments; @Leviticus 10: 9; @Ezekiel 44: 17.
Rem. Mark speaks of the Lord's raiment in the transfiguration being exceeding white as snow, and he refers also to a young man clothed in a white robe at the sepulchre: is that a similar thought?
J.T. White suggests purity, but linen suggests sobriety. We are told to "be sober and hope to the end". To stand by night in the house of the Lord requires that.
P.W. In @Exodus 35, it is the principal men who contribute the onyx stones for the breastplate: I suppose they would represent those who have got most hold of the love of God; they gave also the stones for the ephod.
Ques. In the enumeration of the items, the breast-plate comes first; but in the details of construction, the shoulder pieces come first: why is that?
J.T. I do not know, but I am sure the breastplate is the greatest feature of priestly clothing, because it bore the names of the tribes of Israel. They were engraved there in precious stones; it is a question of the saints known in their intrinsic value. Then the shoulder pieces come next, and the saints are all there, for the names of the twelve tribes were engraven on those stones too; they are in two groups. In the shoulder pieces we have the thought of His power. The first sets forth the love of Christ, seen in His intimate knowledge of the saints; every name is there, and every one is the subject of His love; and the second is the support that goes with the love
{290}
of Christ. We can reckon on both -- on His love and on His power.
D.L.H. 'His love is as great as His power, and knows neither measure nor end'.
J.T. It is very interesting to see how the family thought is developed in Genesis. It is not spoken of as the family of God exactly, but the household thought is greatly emphasised there. Abraham is called out of his father's house to become the head and father of a family for God. Jacob, too, at the close blesses his sons as their father: "listen to Israel your father". Now it was not simply that he was their literal father, but he was representative of God. No father today could speak to his children in the same way, for these patriarchs were representative of God. Jacob was representative of God; he could only bless Pharaoh in that sense. He blesses his sons as their father. The family in that way is secured in blessing because, although there is much to deplore, which Jacob faithfully points out, nevertheless he blesses every one of them. They were blessed of God in a paternal way, Jacob being representative of God; the blessing is secured in the father -- it is there in the father.
Ques. Is that why you get the "sons of Israel" mentioned in the first verse in Exodus?
J.T. In @Genesis 50: 21 they came under Joseph's care; that is, the family is under the care of Christ, and the opening verses in Exodus give us the family -- the list of names of the sons of Israel; each of them comes with his household. @Genesis 46 gives us the full list of the seventy souls that came to Egypt, sons of Israel. The sons of Israel carried Jacob their father. That shows that the family is restored; it is a question of the faithfulness of God; every son is there. Jacob sacrificed we read (chapter 46) to the God of his father Isaac, indicating that he was in the light of Christ risen, and that every thought of
{291}
God is secured in Christ risen. Then you get the list of the names of Jacob's children, and every one is given, because the whole family is in mind; the wives and children are secured, too. Later they are blessed by their father Jacob, then they come under the care of Joseph, and their number is given in the first few verses in Exodus, but they are "sons of Israel" there. Then Joseph dies and another king arose who knew not Joseph, and that family is attacked. The enemy seeks to obliterate the family; the attack has succeeded in christendom, for they have lost the light of the family, it is not known, and yet there is an attempt to carry on the service without it. But as I said, Joseph dies, and then the family is attacked, but God comes in to secure His thought in the priestly family.
Ques. Is that why the Lord in John's gospel takes up the attitude of a Father to His disciples? He is concerned that the family should be preserved.
J.T. Quite. The gospel of John opens with the divine thought of the family of God -- that as many as received Christ "to them gave he the right to be children of God" (@John 1: 12). The family is secured in spite of the attack, for the purpose of God cannot fail. I believe that what God has done for His people at the present time is to bring them back to the divine thought of the family, and, unless we come to that, we shall drift into a hard legal system.
H.D'A.C. So the Lord says in @John 20: 21, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you". The Lord Jesus was here in the full sense of His relationship with the Father, and He served as none other ever served God.
J.T. Quite. I thought in that word, "as the Father sent me", you get the whole thing. The Lord Jesus served as no one ever served -- the link with the Father was never broken, He was always in His holy presence, and serving as no one
{292}
could serve, except in that way. It was the Son in service, so that the sanctuary was always there -- it was there in Him -- He was the sanctuary. "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father" (@John 1: 14).
E.R. Is it not important to remember that the Lord said to the disciples the second time, "Peace be unto you"? They had the value of all that in their service, so that they themselves were undisturbed.
R.S. Would you say a word as to the bearing of the Melchisedec priesthood? Why it is set down in Genesis?
J.T. I think to bring out the thought of divine resource as connected with priesthood. He brings forth bread and wine -- divine resource. Melchisedec is not said to have had sons, he himself is the prominent thought. It is a question of the personal dignity of Christ as representing divine resource; he was king and priest. Nimrod represents the power of man's kingdom; Melchisedec represents God's kingdom. I think it is important to keep before us that God would be served; we can see what was in the mind of God when He said to Moses, "this shall be the sign to thee ... ye shall serve God upon this mountain" (@Exodus 3: 12). God would have His service, but He would have it *there*. It is all under His own control. It is not as men might wish, but what He determines. But then if they are to serve Him it is as sons, "Let my son go, that he may serve me;" and then finally, if the son is to serve, he is to serve as a priest. I think that is the order: *where* they are to serve; in what family relationship they are to serve -- as sons, and in what official status they are to serve -- as anointed priests. All that is of divine determination; man is shut out altogether, it is a question of what God orders and provides.
Ques. Why Horeb?
{293}
J.T. That was where the burning bush was; it was there God revealed Himself to Moses. It has often been remarked that the approach must be in accord with the revelation, so that Moses and Aaron are brothers; the revelation was made to Moses, but in regard of service, Aaron comes first; in fact he is the elder of the two; he is called "the Levite" -- "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?" God says to Moses. There was something behind that; it showed the great place priesthood and the service of God had in the mind of God.
Rem. God says, "I know that he can speak well".
J.T. Yes. Aaron could speak. It is a great thing to know how to speak to God. "The priest's *lips* should keep knowledge, and at his *mouth* they seek the law" (@Malachi 2: 7).
Ques. We have always connected priesthood with speaking to God, but say a little more about the other side -- about going out into the world in priestly service.
J.T. The words of grace that came out of the Lord's mouth were wondered at; @Luke 4: 17. "The priest's lips should keep knowledge". The law was under his custody, and in administering it he was to be compassionate, he was to be gracious, and I think that was what marked the Lord in the gospel of Luke. We have to look at Christ to see the perfect carrying out of the priestly functions. He was compassionate in His service -- it was priestly service, holy service -- and the law was fully maintained in its holiness.
Rem. We should have thought that was levitical.
J.T. It may be, but it is treated as priestly service in Malachi.
Ques. Why there particularly?
J.T. I think because Israel had failed so completely, and the secret was that priesthood was given up. "And now, ye priests, this commandment is for you" (@Malachi 2: 1), Jehovah said: then He calls attention to
{294}
Levi -- what Levi had been, what he had been with God, he was faithful -- "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips" (verse 6). So God's covenant was with him, so that it was for them to conform to the original thought of God as seen in Levi. We have only to read Malachi to see how far away they had gone from the divine thought, but the return was to be to *that*. In Deuteronomy the two things are put together -- "the priests the Levites".
{295}
GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY SEEN IN GIFTS SET IN THE ASSEMBLY
1 Corinthians 12: 28; Matthew 10: 2; Acts 3: 1 - 11
I have in mind to say something about the sovereign pleasure of God as seen in His service and testimony. The very suggestion of it reminds each one that he, as a believer, is to hold himself for the divine disposal, and to see to it that he is qualified to have his part in keeping with the divine pleasure.
I conceive that in this first letter to the Corinthians the apostle had in mind that there should be in Corinth a vessel in which God would set out His service, in which He would set forth His testimony; indeed, I believe, the creation as we know it -- the physical creation -- was intended for this very purpose. It was to be a sphere in which God would make Himself known. I suppose also that the angelic creation or order was intended for the same thing, as a vehicle through which God could display Himself. Very little indeed is revealed to us as to the angelic hosts, but enough to show that it was a creation marked by order -- divine order, and that the idea of rank entered into it; we read of Michael the archangel. There can be no doubt that the Spirit of God in Ezekiel alludes to that order, when He speaks of the king of Tyre as "the anointed covering cherub" (@Ezekiel 28: 14). He is presented as one distinguished in rank and in service, for he is spoken of as "the anointed covering cherub".
Then again, he was adorned with every precious stone, for the idea of adornment necessarily enters into all that which God would use as a means by which to display Himself. A list of nine precious stones which appear in his covering is enumerated, but the number was short of the divine thought, it
{296}
was short of completeness; it was short even of the idea of responsibility -- of administration: but nevertheless these stones were ornamental. So, too, the material creation -- I mean the earth as we know it -- was wonderfully ornamented as it came from the hand of God and as it was completed. I might also speak of the heavens, but I speak particularly of the earth as that sphere in which God sets out His service and testimony. He planted a garden, we are told, eastward in Eden. It was for His sovereign pleasure; He indicated thus His sovereign right in that which He had created to have a special place for His own pleasure; and so it is *there*, in that garden, that He sets up him who was to be His representative here. The idea of representation is a great thought with God; so He creates man in His image after His likeness that he may represent Him. It was that he might be here for the representation of God that He made him in His likeness; he was thus morally qualified to be the representative of God, and as such he is placed in the sovereignty of God in the garden.
Well, that was broken in upon, as we know, but God, as we have often remarked, never relinquishes a thought -- never. The resources of God afford one of the most interesting studies in Scripture. So He acts to show that He can maintain and carry His thought into effect. He has resources by which He can carry out His thought, that His service and testimony may be maintained in the presence of evil -- evil having come in. Satan -- that anointed covering cherub -- who knew what God had in His mind to some extent, for he had unquestionably a great place in the divine service, had found a way into the creation and had wrought havoc, and brought in ruin, but God was not diverted in the least degree from His thought, and when the man fails to represent Him, He takes up a *family*.
"The God of glory", Stephen says, "appeared
{297}
to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia" @Acts 7: 2. It was not simply a question of light now, but of an *appearing*. An appearing signifies that God reveals Himself in some sense so that He may be apprehended in men's minds, and it is as the "God of glory" He appears, and that refers to the service of God, and that service carried out in a family. In appearing to Abraham, He had in mind to take up a family. God says, "I called him when he was alone, and blessed him" (@Isaiah 51: 2), for, in order to use us, we must be blessed. The glory was to find a resting-place, and God had designed that it should be in the family of the man to whom He had appeared. Abraham is the first person, according to Scripture, to whom God appeared. He had spoken to others, but an appearing means an impression conveyed as to the being, as to the nature of God. So on the basis of that, in that family -- the family of Abraham -- God develops a priestly service.
Now when we come down to Moses and Aaron we have a pattern shown on the mount -- the mount of God -- as to that in which He would display Himself, that in which He would be served, that in which He would set forth His testimony. I connect all that with 1 Corinthians, and I hope to be able to make it clear so that all may follow, because the divine thread runs right through. Corinthians contemplates the tabernacle in the wilderness, that is to say, it contemplates an order -- a system of things set up here in the presence of evil, and in spite of evil, in which God is to be served, in which His testimony is to be set out, and in which His testimony is to be enhanced, so that an unbeliever coming in is so impressed with the presence of God, and by His glory, that he falls down upon his face declaring, "God is indeed amongst you". Wonderful conception! There is that, as I said, set up in the presence of the evil, and in spite of the evil, in which God will set forth His glory -- that
{298}
which is sufficiently powerful as wrought of God for Him to set forth His service and His testimony, that in which His glory has a place; as He said of the tabernacle, "it shall be sanctified by my glory" -- nothing less than that. What a wonderful design has come to light, and how wonderful that we should be called to have part in that system!
So the epistle to Corinthians is intended to build up step by step, inch by inch, as I may say, the material of this structure, so that each part will be in its place in the divine organisation; "that there be no divisions among you", that there should be an organism "fitted together;" as he says, "so also is the Christ. For also in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, ... and have all been given to drink of one Spirit" (@1 Corinthians 12: 12, 13).
The vessel is there; now such is the divine thought. When the apostle says "so also is the Christ" the allusion is to the saints, that is, to the assembly, as set up, bit by bit, part by part, and anointed by the Spirit in a public way and designated as "the Christ" -- a vessel in which God would act and display His glory, in which He would present His service and His testimony in such wise that an unbeliever entering into that company would fall down as convicted of God, and acknowledge that God was there. It is not only that the light was there, not only that the Spirit was there, but that *God* was there. The Spirit *is*  God, to be sure, but God Himself was there and there to be blessing to men.
Well, now, I want to show how, having such a vessel, God would set out His sovereign choice of gifts. My appeal in this respect is to every one present, because each believer has part in that one body. Every member has its function, and everyone is under the anointing; the figure of the human body is employed to show this. Then the Spirit of God, through the apostle, changes from the thought of the
{299}
body to that of the assembly (see @chapter 12, verses 27 and 28). Now the body is an organism, but the assembly is constructed; it is composed of intelligent persons -- persons with a judgment, for the word suggests intelligence. Approaching this subject, the apostle says, "I speak as to intelligent persons: do *ye* judge what I say" (@1 Corinthians 10: 15). It is for the saints to judge in regard to what is said in the assembly. So we read, "God has set certain in the assembly". He has the vessel, He has that in which He can set out His sovereign choice, and what I want to show is, that this sovereign choice is set in the order of one, two, three; "first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers". God makes no room for man's will; that thought you will find throughout in His instructions here. "The stranger that cometh near shall be put to death" @Numbers 1: 51. How much, alas! there is of that character at the present time in relation to the things of God -- the stranger -- that which is not anointed intruding itself into divine things; whereas God, at every step in the detail of His instructions, rigidly refuses every such intrusion with the most relentless penalty attached.
What then is to become of the huge system around us? Is God to let His word fall to the ground? No, beloved; it has yet to come under His public disapproval and disavowal. It is a most serious consideration, and I speak of it now in a practical way, that God will not make any room for man's will; whatever man may design to bring into His house God will surely thwart it; nothing is suffered there but "the good pleasure of his will" (@Ephesians 1: 5). And so Ephesians, which gives the highest conception of these things, speaks of that; it speaks, too, of the counsel of His will, and of the mystery of His will. He is working out now the mystery of His will; nothing can stand in the way of the will of God; by and by it will be manifested; but we have to learn
{300}
it now, and we have to learn, too, that the smallest way in which we may introduce our wills into the assembly it will be brought down; God will thwart it. It is God's will only that has place there.
Now that will shows itself in the order of first, secondly, thirdly. It is no question of accident here, it is a question of the will of God; "*God* has *set* certain in the assembly" -- *He* has set them there for His will. In Ephesians it is a question of gift; Christ has gone far above all heavens as Man and He has received gifts as Man for men, and He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists and some shepherds and teachers -- it is a question of endowment. The church was wonderfully endowed by Christ; there it is a question of gift. But in Corinthians it is not exactly gift that is prominent, but the will of God. It is not that He *gave* the assembly apostles and prophets, but He *set* them there: just as He set the stars in the firmament of the heavens, so He has set certain in the assembly, as it has pleased Him -- according to His sovereign choice. I do not suppose that there is anything that man quarrels with more than the sovereignty of God, and yet the sovereignty of God provides for the love of God, for His love is sovereign, so in quarrelling with the sovereignty of God we quarrel with His love.
It provides, too, for the power of God, and the wisdom of God, so if we find fault with His sovereignty, we find fault with His power and with His wisdom. So in accordance with His sovereign will He has set certain in the assembly.
There is no such thought in Scripture as gifts being set in localities; bishops and elders are set in localities, but gifts are for the assembly -- the whole church of God. If there are too many gifts in a locality, the question is raised at once whether the will of God is allowed its full course, its full sway.
{301}
If I find myself in the way of another, depend upon it the will of God has not had its full sway, for there is room for all in the assembly. At one time it was quite evident there was too much gift in Jerusalem, and because they would not move out, God resorted to Stephen; He resorted too, to the deacon Philip and sent him to meet the Ethiopian eunuch. Then Paul is raised up and sent forth to the nations. The apostles had remained in Jerusalem, while others were scattered.
Sometimes in the government of God He has to scatter. It is a very solemn thing to come under the governmental dealings of God, and have to be scattered. Any clinging to national ideas or metropolitan ideas is sure to bring in the governmental dealings of God -- the scattering of God. Was the scattering for nothing? No, indeed, we see how the light reached the gentiles through the scattered ones. How humbling for the apostles! It was humbling that it should have come through the scattered ones, but such is the government of God.
Well, gifts, as I said, are set in the assembly, for the good of the assembly; where they may be geographically is another matter. My geographical position is a question of the government of God; the government of God is concurrent with the service of God, and it is intended to support the service of God, but one's gift is not a question of the government of God, but of His will. One is set definitely in the assembly and one's position is fixed by the sovereign will of God, and each one should know it. God intends that it should be known; He intends that each gift should be known, and that its position should be known, so it is set in the assembly, not in any locality; its domain of service is the assembly. But then I want to show that the order is one, two, three; "first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers". According to this passage, the evangelist
{302}
is omitted. There is no room, as I said, for the will of man. If God is pleased to give another a greater gift than He has given to you, you must bow, it is the will of God which is perfect. He knows His selection. So Matthew (who alone, I think, gives this) in giving the list of the apostles, says, "*first*, Simon, who was called Peter" -- was it an accident? Not at all. Peter was morally the first, and for this reason, amongst others, that God apparently had expended the greatest care on Peter. God whose sovereign will designed him to be the first, saw to it that he *was* the first. God works in us according to His sovereign will. If He selects Peter to be the first, He qualifies him to be the first, and hence the severity of his discipline.
Anyone who is to be the first in the service of God must be prepared for the severest discipline. Paul says, "I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death" @1 Corinthians 4: 9. He has set them that way, "first apostles". And why? Because they were first in suffering; they were the first morally, but they were the last outwardly in the sense of reproach and in the sense of suffering -- they were appointed to death. And so Peter presents the one man, I suppose, in the New Testament who underwent the greatest and most humiliating discipline, that he might be fitted for his place as first among the apostles. His discipline was extremely humiliating, but it was necessary if he were really to be conformed to the sovereign will of God for him; that is to say, that he was the first, as Matthew presents it. Matthew presents the apostles in pairs, and the first is Peter; Mark presents them singly. I suppose Matthew has in mind the service of God in the form it took in the early days; he had in mind that God intended to present His best to men in His service; and so I have read that passage in the Acts because I understand that
{303}
chapter (chapter 3) to be a question of sovereign selection.
Now what you will find in the Acts is not so much what *God* told the apostles to do as what *they* did. I am not denying that they were told to do the things, far from it; I am perfectly certain that Peter was constantly in prayer to God about every movement of his in His service, but the Holy Spirit does not tell us about that in the early chapters of the Acts, He presents to us Peter with John going up to the temple to pray; it was a public thing. What Peter was publicly was undoubtedly the result of what he was with God privately, but in the Acts, God is presenting the *public* side of the testimony; and that is what I am seeking to present to you tonight -- that what God is looking for in every locality in which the people of God are found is correspondence with the anointed vessel: that there should be that publicly to which God can commit Himself and which He can employ as dignified for the setting forth publicly of His service and of His testimony.
So in each locality He will have His way, and He will make His selection, and He will use whom He will. He works privately in their souls, He disciplines them and fits them by His work in them, and when they move publicly, their movements justify God in His selection.
Well, these are very simple thoughts that I think everyone should understand. "Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, which is the ninth hour" -- *they went up together*. It was the loveliest sight morally, I suppose, under the heavens. They were masterpieces of God's work, the greatest pains had been expended upon them. If you look at the gospel of Matthew, you will be interested to see the way in which Peter is introduced and the various connections in which he appears personally. Think of the introduction of Peter to
{304}
Jesus; He says to him, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men" (@Matthew 4: 19). He is to be a learner. See him again as he walks on the water. "Lord, if it be *thou*", he says, "command me to come to thee upon the waters" (@Matthew 14 28). What a lesson there is to be learned in that! He is a typical learner -- a disciple; he shows in that incident that he is learning, but he has not quite learnt, he is just a pupil, because he begins to sink. He will have to try again.
We all have to try again. The fact that we have to try again is humiliating, but it is wholesome, it is part of our education. Peter, in due course, learnt morally how to walk on the water, but he had to make a try, and he did. I say that for young ones; we have all to learn, and more, we have to learn how to learn. We learn by our very blunders, even as Peter did.
Peter's history is known to most of us. In @Matthew 18: 21 we get there another item in his education. He asks one of the finest questions a learner can ask. He says to the Lord, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times?" He is just a pupil at school, he is a learner; he asks questions.
We have to learn, and one of the greatest things in learning is to ask questions and to put them to the right person. The Lord's answer to his question is, as I may say, the finishing touch for Peter in relation to the assembly: "I say not to thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven". How Peter needed that instruction! To learn how to forgive is a great item in our instruction; we cannot be like God, beloved, unless we learn *how* to forgive -- we have to learn how to forgive, and the Lord taught Peter how to forgive; later on he himself had to be forgiven, for he denied the Lord. In what a wonderful way *he learnt the grace of forgiveness then*! To learn how to forgive is one of the greatest lessons to learn; I can never forgive according to God unless I learn
{305}
forgiveness from God. And so Luke, who would emphasise this feature -- the grace of forgiveness -- tells us that when the two disciples from Emmaus returned to Jerusalem, they found the eleven, and those with them gathered together, saying, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon" (@Luke 24: 34). I can understand them saying to one another, 'How remarkable that He should have appeared to Simon', for had he not just denied Him? Yes, not once, but thrice, but the Lord had appeared to Simon, for He would impress him indelibly with His grace, and we cannot, beloved, be in the assembly according to God save as impressed by His grace; we cannot convey grace unless we are the subjects of it. Simon was the recipient of this marvellous grace that would forgive even his denial of Christ. What a wonderful example of grace!
Well now, having said so much about Peter, in regard to his discipline that he might be morally 'first' among the apostles, I just want to finish by calling attention to him in this remarkable passage in the Acts. He and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, which was the ninth hour -- an hour, I suppose, that would be fresh in their hearts. What memories would arise of that hour! How fresh would be the remembrance of what took place in that hour! It was a moment of peculiar preciousness to them, and they went together at that hour to the temple. It was the hour when Jesus died. Doubtless they would recall His words on the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (@Luke 23: 34). As I said, these two men were, I apprehend, at that moment the most beautiful spectacle under heaven; they were the product of the grace of God, of the work of Christ, and they were together -- they were moving together in brotherly affection. God would enable us in our localities to move thus together in brotherly affection, in brotherly
{306}
intelligence, in brotherly understanding of grace, and of the dispensation of faith in which we have part. How attractive they were as they moved thus to the temple!
But, beloved, if we are the subjects of the work of God we ought to be attractive to souls. Is it so? Peter says with John to the lame man, "Look on us". Suppose in any of our localities we invited people in it to look on us, how humiliating a spectacle we should present! It is well to face the thing as it is, and to see how far away we are in present circumstances from what was at the outset. And Peter here says to the man, "In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean rise up and walk". He speaks in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean. We may claim to do that in principle in preaching the gospel, but speaking in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean involves complete identification with Jesus in His humiliation and rejection, and also the renunciation of all natural resources -- "Silver and gold I have not" -- there is nothing of that which men have to offer at all: what we have comes from heaven, or it is of no value. In the power of this, Peter took the lame man by the right hand and lifted him up; the man was helpless apparently, but he had a right hand -- there was something there with which Peter could link himself.
We see thus how the work of God is carried on, and how God is presented to men. God had thus that with which He could operate; He could commit Himself to what was there. "Look on us", Peter says. These men were not merely two Jews. Ah, there was much more there than two Jews; there was more there than there is to be presented in the archangel Michael. These two -- Peter and John -- were heaven's best, as the fruit of divine workmanship. They were the work of God, they were men who had been taken up by God and had been wrought
{307}
upon, disciplined, taught and brought into conformity with Jesus, they were like Him; they were heaven's best upon earth, and it was evident God can commit Himself to such. Peter lifted him up by the right hand, and the man never forgot that grip. He was brought into touch with Peter's hand and Peter was in touch with Jesus -- in touch with heaven, and the man was thus linked up with the divine system, with that which God had established; he was linked up livingly with it. Peter took him by the right hand.
Might I suggest, that to take needy ones by the right hand is a great service. Give them every advantage; whatever is latent there will come out as you take them by the right hand and lift them up; it is some touch of encouragement that sets them going. Of this man we read, "immediately his feet and ankle bones were made strong. And leaping up he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God". God was operating through His best, for Peter was first, then John. This man is a typical product of service rendered; there is a perfect result according to God in the service rendered through these vessels of grace.
Then we read he held Peter and John. While Peter had taken him by the right hand, and, as I may say, his right hand brought him into fellowship, yet the man himself would be identified with them. This is a specimen case indicating the kind of work carried on at the beginning by those whom God put forward -- Peter and John. Now they have got a man with them. "He held", it says, "Peter and John:" that is to say, he had light in his soul evidently as to the divine thought. Peter and John were representative of God, they were representative of Christ, and he would be linked on with them. How wonderful for him! to be linked on to that
{308}
which God was putting forward -- these two men! Their names will shine in the heavenly city, and they will have their place in the precious foundation of it.
There are twelve manner of precious stones in the heavenly city (not nine) -- the full, the complete divine thought is there, and these two great vessels will shine there; they represent, as I said, the sovereign choice of God. *He* was putting them forward: and so it is now, and everyone in the meeting in any locality has to recognise that God will put forward whom He will. It is a question of His will, and, if we are subject, we shall ratify what He does, we shall be with Him in what He does, we shall pray for those whom He puts forward. He is putting them forward for the good of the testimony, He is putting them forward for our good, He is putting them forward in His sovereign wisdom, and in His sovereign love, and we must not quarrel with it. He will carry on His ways with us, and we shall see the results in the future in the heavenly city, and it will be the perfect justification of His sovereign choice. He will then have the vessel in which His glory will be seen, for she will come down from God out of heaven, and her light will be like unto a stone most precious. Corinthians gives the assembly of God now, and God sets the gifts there as it pleases Him. He *sets* certain in the assembly -- it is a question of God: *He* sets.
May God bless the word.
{309}
GRACE AND SEPARATION; FEATURES OF THE DISPENSATION
@Luke 4: 16 - 22; @Matthew 12: 46 - 50; 13: 1 - 3
J.T. We see in the passage in Luke the grace which was intended to mark this time, seen in the Lord Jesus Christ as the vessel in whom that grace is set out; then in Matthew, how that involves separation from what had existed, and what had place and reputation as of God. I thought it would be of service to the brethren to look at the Lord as presented by these two evangelists in these aspects, so that we might understand on the one hand, the grace of the vessel, and on the other hand, that whilst this grace is maintained, it is maintained in separation from what is disqualified as being in the place of relationship with God.
@Matthew 12: 43 - 45 brings out the state of things in Israel, ending up by reference to the unclean spirit. "But when the unclean spirit has gone out of the man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and does not find it. Then he says, I will return to my house whence I came out; and having come, he finds it unoccupied, swept, and adorned. Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and entering in, they dwell there; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. Thus shall it be to this wicked generation also".
Dreadful announcement! "But while he was yet speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without". This brings out that He recognises those as His mother and brethren who do the will of God.
Then He leaves the house in the next chapter. He went out from the house and sat by the sea; that is the separation, and then the dispensation begins in
{310}
sowing. In Luke He does not separate in this way; He is in the synagogue, and having read the passage from Isaiah, it says, "he sat down". That is, He sat down on that text, as it were, which announces the pure, unalloyed grace of God. Sitting down involves deliberation and a fixed state of things. The more we examine the passage, the more we shall value the continuance of the dispensation.
A.H. Is the dispensation set forth in this day?
J.T. Yes. It is perhaps wholesome to be reminded at the end of the dispensation of what marked it at its inauguration in the blessed vessels in whom it was set out. One great thought of God is that there should be correspondence at the end with that which was at the beginning, hence the question of the vessels by whom the preaching is to go on is raised -- whether we correspond with this blessed Vessel. It is not only the message, the thing that is presented, but the *manner* in which it is presented. The Holy Spirit gives us the Lord's manner here purposely; He gives it in detail because it is designed to be a model for us.
J.H.T. When you speak of the preaching you include all the ministry.
J.T. Yes, certainly. All ministry should be on the principle of the anointing. "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me", the Lord says.
A.H. They wondered at the gracious words?
J.T. Yes, just so. How gracious they were! And they were coming out of His mouth. Attention is called to the Lord at the very beginning of Luke -- to the *manner* of His ministry. "And all bore witness to him, and wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth".
McM. What is the thought in the anointing?
J.T. The anointing is what God commits Himself to; it was the expression of God's approval of Christ.
{311}
The ministry was to be carried on in the power of the Spirit. The Lord does not undertake to minister until He is anointed.
Ques. Would you connect that in your mind with the previous chapter, when having been baptised the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and the voice came out of heaven, "*Thou* art my beloved Son"?
J.T. Yes. And both chapters 2 and 3 bring out the moral qualities of Christ. The Holy Spirit dwells on the Lord as a Boy, then as a Man. He dwells on Him as a Babe. We have Him in all three features, as a Babe, as a Boy, and as a Man in these chapters.
Ques. 'Why do you say dwells on Him'?
J.T. Luke opens out, and dwells on the theme; it was delightful to him as inspired to unveil and enlarge upon the moral qualities of Christ.
Ques. Does the anointing mark Him off as God's Man?
J.T. I think so. The psalmist says, "Against Jehovah and against his anointed" (@Psalm 2: 2). We have the type of Christ in David, in the first book of Samuel. First there is Hannah's desire to have a son; then the people's desire to have a king, which was granted. God gave them a king such as they desired; He gives us sometimes what we seek; God even allows it to test us, to expose to us just what our desires are. He gave them a king in His anger, a terrible thing! Their hearts wished it; they looked around on the nations who had kings and they wanted to have a king. God gave them a king; He told them what he would be like, what he would do. He would take their sons and their daughters and make them men-servants and maid-servants. It would be a question of *taking* from them, no *giving* at all. They got that king. "I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath".
But then there was the heart of God; Samuel brings out that. God raised up David to be their king,
{312}
and said, "I have found ... a man after mine own heart". Outside of what is in our hearts, right or wrong, there is what is in God's heart. "In thee I have found my delight". The earlier chapters show the ground for this. It refers to the moral qualities in Christ.
Rem. "Myrrh and aloes, cassia are all thy garments" (@Psalm 45: 8).
J.B.E. "Grace is poured into thy lips". In @Psalm 45 I thought you get a beautiful answer to this.
J.T. Quite so; it is not so much the king here, but it is the same Person. The thought is to bring before us the grace that should mark the vessel, the vessel of testimony. God is not going to be diverted from His thought. He may use us: He may use unanointed people even, even an ass, or a Balaam who was not converted at all. There are thousands of men preaching the gospel, but is the anointing there? Is the ministry carried on in the power of the anointing? That is what God looks for now; He does not change His mind; He intends His ministry to be set out in Christ, so He forms men after Christ.
J.McK. "How shall they preach unless they have been sent?" (@Romans 10: 15).
J.T. Quite: "and shod your feet with the preparation of the glad tidings of peace" (@Ephesians 6: 15); you may go on for years, and then God may take you up. It is a question of hearts; Samuel was not right, he thought Eliab was the anointed; God says, "man looketh upon the outward appearance". That was a sharp rebuke to Samuel. We have to see where the heart is before we commit ourselves.
Grace would seize opportunities; that is the principle of Luke, you do not ask people to come to you, you go to them. Paul in the Acts was marked by this. He goes into the synagogue at Antioch, he sits
{313}
down, he waits his opportunity, then he gets it, for they asked him to speak and he spoke.
Ques. What is the difference between the anointing of Saul and the anointing of David? Saul has his head anointed, and the word to him is, "Jehovah has anointed thee prince over his inheritance". One was man's choice. What have we to learn as to the difference between the two?
J.T. I think God undertook to make Saul as successful as it was possible. Seeing that the people would have a king, He would make him as successful as possible, but the detail of his course proved how lacking he was. Saul hid himself among the baggage; his father's asses were lost, and not only that, but as he drew near to where Samuel, the seer, was, his servant knew more than he did. The servant said, "Behold now, a man of God is in this city ... Let us now go thither" (@1 Samuel 9: 6). It did not interest Saul very much, but he said, "Well said;" as much as to say, that is a good remark. That is a poor thing. A man that is fit for the anointing ought to be *able to make* a good remark. Then he had nothing to bring to the man of God. He disqualifies himself at every step of the way; the servant had some money, Saul had none. The servant had what he could give to the prophet. Then as he draws near to the town there are some maidens coming out to draw water. They knew all about the prophet, they seemed to appreciate greatly the fact that he was in the town, and they told Saul where he would find him. They were further advanced in their souls, as we might say, than Saul was; they followed the movements of the man of God. But still, God would do all possible, and so Samuel acts for God, and takes Saul down, and gives him the best portion of meat at table. Then he anoints him, but in a private way -- between themselves, as it were; there was nothing to correspond with the anointing of David; Samuel
{314}
had a vial of oil and poured it upon his head; it was not a horn as he had with David. David, too, was anointed in the midst of his brethren. His beauty is called attention to by the Spirit of God -- his lovely countenance and his beautiful appearance. What comes out is that he was the man after God's heart. That is really the thing to have before us; it is a question of our hearts.
Ques. How do you understand the anointing in @Proverbs 8: 23? "Anointed from eternity".
J.T. It would be the same as what we are dealing with. It is wisdom there. Satan was anointed too; according to Ezekiel, he was the anointed cherub that covered. We can understand how great a place wisdom had with God in all His operations. Luke, I think, is presenting the Vessel of grace more as a pattern for us; the moral qualities that underlie the anointing are emphasised. In 1 Corinthians you find a correspondence with this in Paul. What he is aiming at in his letter to the Corinthians is that there should be a vessel wherever the saints are found, characterised by the anointing, in which God would set out the service of testimony. This chapter in Luke is the type, the model, and Paul is marked by that in his ministry at Corinth; he led up to the thought of the anointing; and he himself was as one anointed, for the word was in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
Ques. When he says, "Now he that ... has anointed us, is God", is he speaking of his calling simply?
J.T. He is speaking in an abstract way; it would include all who are anointed.
W.D. Is the thought of correspondence connected with the eyes of all being fastened on Him? Correspondence with the heart of God. The Spirit would always attract to Christ.
J.T. It does not appear that they were inwardly
{315}
affected in the synagogue at Nazareth; that makes the manner of the Lord all the more emphatic. How expressive of grace it must have been, for even though unrepentant, they wondered at the words of grace. It comes home to one if one is ministering, whether there is that; whether, not only is the truth presented in the terms of it, but is it presented in such wise that it affects people, so that the vessel enhances the testimony rendered, rather than detracts from it.
W.D. I suppose in that way the Lord was in correspondence with the heart of God before He speaks?
J.T. Yes, chapters 2 and 3 show that the moral qualities were there. It says, "I have found my delight". It showed what God had been looking for, and had found.
A.H. "Never man spake like this man".
T.E. Do you think we should be exponents of all we say?
J.T. That is the thing; that God should have at the end something to correspond with Christ, even in ministry. The Lord used the Scriptures in such wise as to accredit them. He says, "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears". He had just read what was enough to cover the position that marked that moment.
Ques. Is one feature of the anointing that God has been rightly represented in this world?
J.T. I think so; it is only thus that He can be. It involves committal to the person whom He has endowed with what is needed for the service to be rendered.
T.E. We have failed in not adorning the truth.
J.T. The thing may be presented in its terms, as it is by thousands of men in christendom, but is it enhanced by the vessel from whom it comes? Suppose you take the great example of Pentecost, Peter's preaching. He showed how thoroughly he had
{316}
learned to minister. In chapter 1 he is among the brethren; he stands up and speaks among the brethren, and brings in the scriptures that cover the position. In chapter 2 he stands up with the eleven, and announces the gospel, and in chapter 3 he, together with John, has gone up to the temple, and there he preaches again. Now I think if you look at those three chapters, and see how Peter served, you will see how one may learn how to be conformed to Christ in ministry, so that the ministry is enhanced by the vessel. God attaches great importance to the vessel.
R.C. What is in your mind as to the three ways in which Peter preached?
J.T. Take the first chapter. The names are given, there were a hundred and twenty names; and the Holy Spirit had not come, and there was a missing apostle. So Peter stands up among the brethren, it says -- a very suggestive thing -- and calls attention to the fact that Judas, having delivered up the Lord, had come to his bitter end, and there had to be another one appointed to take part of the ministry and apostleship; and he immediately quotes the Psalm that covers that position. He uses the Scriptures with spiritual intelligence even before the Holy Spirit came, showing that he was the product of the Lord's personal instruction. He had selected him, as it says, "he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would, ... that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach" (@Mark 3: 13, 14). @Matthew 10: 2 tells us that Peter was the first, and the Acts shows that he was first -- morally first -- that he was qualified to be it.
Peter quotes the Psalm and then he says, "It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he
{317}
was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection" (@Acts 1: 21, 22). That covered the whole period of the Lord's ministry; and if there is to be an apostle appointed, he must have that experience. That shows what a man Peter was, what intelligence he had as to what was becoming in a minister.
In the second chapter he stands up with the eleven. It does not say the eleven stood up with him. The point is to show what Peter is doing; he stands up with the eleven, and preaches, and quotes the Psalms again; he quotes them to cover the position of the Spirit being here sent down from heaven. Then it says, "Those then that had accepted his word" (@Acts 2: 41), the Holy Spirit thus emphasising Peter's ministry -- not 'the word' but "*his* word". We have been given a divinely inspired account of "his word", and it is a wonderful address. "Those then who had accepted word were baptised; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls". The point is to show the result of Peter's ministry. At the end of the chapter, the Lord added every day -- "daily", but that particular day there were added three thousand souls. That shows what a minister Peter was.
Then he advances on that in the next chapter. It says, "And Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, which is the ninth hour". There is a lame man at the Beautiful gate; he looked on Peter and John and asked for alms, but Peter says, "Silver and gold I have not", but "looking stedfastly on him with John, said, Look on us". The Holy Spirit mentions all this; Peter does not write the Acts, it is the Holy Spirit who records it all. He is calling attention to Peter. Peter and John were to be looked at. You preach the gospel here every Sunday night; suppose investigation is made as to those who preach, what would be found? Look on us, Peter could say. How solemn a consideration
{318}
this is in regard of those who preach, as to whether their lives, and ways, and associations are in accord with the anointing! It is that which puts us to the test.
God would call attention to this because He looks for the anointed vessel; He intends to have an anointed vessel for the preaching. So Peter says, "Silver and gold I have not". He attached no importance to what christendom attaches all importance to; without money they can do nothing. Peter says, "In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean rise up and walk". Then he takes the lame man by the right hand; he knew what to do. He takes him and raises him up. Then God acts with him, but Peter began the movement; "his feet and ankle bones were made strong. And leaping up he stood, and walked, ... praising God".
All that is intended to confirm what we have here, that the ministers the Lord took up were formed after Himself. The Holy Spirit came down to them; God was putting forth the best He had.
W.D. It is remarkable that when Philip went down to Samaria, Peter and John had to go down there.
J.T. The divine intent was that these two men should stamp everything at the beginning. You find Peter in every chapter up to chapter 5.
M.P. Peter standing up with the eleven is a guide for preachers.
J.T. I think so. The assembly does not preach nor teach; the preaching is by those who have gift. It is not by the saints; it does not say he stood up with the saints, though I doubt not they were there. No one should preach unless he is sent; preaching depends on gift.
Ques. Is not the anointing in view of doing something?
J.T. It is always in view of some service to be
{319}
rendered. If it be preaching or teaching, it is in the form of gift that God qualifies a man to do it. So that you observe, in the early part of chapter 2, those who receive d the Holy Spirit *spake* about the great works of God; it does not say 'preached', nor is a word said about any conversions; they all talked about the things of God. But as Peter stands up with the eleven and preaches then you have conversions; those who heard were pricked in their hearts.
Ques. Is it your thought that what came out in Peter is a continuation of what came out in the Lord in @Luke 4?
J.T. That is the thing; and it ought to be continued in the anointed vessel today. Now in Matthew you have separation emphasised. If you were to take this passage in Luke by itself, you would say, we could go into the churches around and preach, but you have to take all Scripture. Matthew would teach you to separate from what is disqualified. @Matthew 11 and 12 show what a condition of things there was in Israel, so bad that the Lord likens it to a wicked spirit going out of a man, and then coming back again, and finding it empty, swept, adorned, going and taking with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself. Christendom answers to the same description, swept and adorned by the gospel, and yet a wicked spirit comes back into it with seven others. Primarily it refers to Israel. While He was speaking His mother and His brethren came. Israel is still asserting its claims to the Messiah on the ground of nature, with this awful condition. The Lord disclaims it; He stretched forth His hand towards His disciples and said, "Behold my mother and my brethren;" His mother and His brethren are those who do the will of God.
Then He leaves the house; He goes out by the seaside and entered into a ship and sat down. That
{320}
is the dispensation from another point of view. In Luke He sits down in the synagogue; it is a dispensation of grace. The dispensation according to Matthew is based upon separation from what is evil. He sits down by the seaside and great crowds being gathered He went on board ship and sat down and began to talk about sowing. The two things run together, the preaching of Christ and the sowing.
J.H.T. So the position at the close of Matthew is Galilee, not Jerusalem.
J.T. Yes, the position in the end of Luke is Jerusalem.
McM. Would this indicate that their house was left to them at this point?
J.T. Yes, I think so; He goes out of the house and sits down by the sea. Later in the chapter we find that He goes into another house, where He unfolds the truth of the assembly to His disciples.
Ques. Would doing "the will of my Father who is in the heavens" enable you to be separate?
J.T. That is the great word; if you are doing the will of God you cannot go on with evil. The dispensation is marked by these two things. You maintain grace, and act in grace towards every one, rich and poor. Matthew supports you, because you have the assembly before you, and you cannot arrive at the assembly except on the principle of separation.
Ques. Do you get that in 2 Timothy -- a vessel to honour, sanctified?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Why would He separate from His mother and His brethren?
J.T. The conditions existing in Israel are depicted in chapter 12. They said the Lord was operating by the power of Beelzebub.
G.J.E. In preaching you want the eleven with you.
J.T. Yes, but the preaching is to be carried on by those who are fitted for it.
{321}
G.J.E. You would stand up alone if you had a message. Is there not a principle set out in the beginning of the Acts?
J.T. We may not have the eleven to stand up with us now, but we hold the thing in our minds. Sometimes you hear of a certain brother having charge of the gospel; maybe he has not any gift at all. He should not be chosen for the gospel if he has not gift. The gospel is committed to men who have gift.
G.J.E. He should be a preacher of the gospel himself.
J.T. That is it.
R.C. It is a privilege to be in fellowship with the gospel. The Philippians were in fellowship from the very beginning; it is a great encouragement to the one who preaches.
J.T. Certainly, you look for the support of the saints.
T.E. Would the eleven be able to judge as to the brother's gift?
J.T. No doubt. These eleven men had been called by the Lord; they were taken up to the mountain with Him, so that they might be sent out to preach.
Ques. Why is the test in the wilderness brought in between the anointing in Luke and the occasion when the Lord comes out in public testimony? Has that anything to do with the anointing?
J.T. One has to prove one's power in dependence, one has to learn to meet satanic power. We shall have to meet satanic power and we must learn how to meet it. That is why the temptations are brought in. The temptation brought out what was there. It is remarkable the Lord does not go into the wilderness of Himself, He was led by the Spirit. No servant would seek out evil; no one should touch it unless by the direction of the Holy Spirit. If you
{322}
have to deal with evil, the Holy Spirit will indicate it; but taking it up otherwise you are likely to be damaged. Very few men can meet the enemy in the way of attack. You must know what it is to overcome. It says of the young men in John's epistle, "ye have overcome the wicked one". One has to learn to do that. I think the Holy Spirit in Luke called special attention to the product of the Lord's own work in these men -- the apostles.
J.H.T. The preparation of the heart is a necessity before you have the speaking of the mouth. Ezra prepared his heart.
M.P. Have we not to see the necessity for separation before we can either walk or talk?
J.T. I think so; you have to learn to divide the hoof. I have no doubt Luke is more the mouth, and Matthew more the feet -- support. That is how the matter stands, the dispensation stands on those principles.
J.H.T. In Luke He goes to them, in Matthew they come to Him.
J.T. Yes, just so. He leaves the house and enters into a ship; there is some water between Him and the people. The principle of separation is really maintained in the ship. When you draw near the truth of the assembly in chapter 16, it says that the Pharisees and Sadducees asked Him for a sign, and He said, "A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas. And he left them and went away" (@Matthew 16: 4). It is not now the house that He left, but this particular people -- the orthodox people of the day, and the modernists; He left them both. The disciples also went to the other side; they followed His example; they were in fellowship, as we speak. Then the Lord says to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" (verse 11). You may separate outwardly and carry the *leaven* of
{323}
the thing with you. He warns them against that in chapter 16. You may leave the people but bring their principles with you.
R.C. In the Lord, separation is maintained, and grace is not narrowed.
J.T. Keep the two together, and you will be balanced. A man who recognises Luke holds himself responsible to preach the gospel to all. Matthew would teach him to do it in separation.
R.C. While He was in the ship He spoke to the multitudes. Grace was not narrowed.
J.T. Separated from the multitudes you can still preach to them.
{324}
BRETHREN
Matthew 23: 8 - 12; Psalm 133
I wanted to speak in referring to these scriptures about our place and relation as brethren -- a designation that is familiar, not only amongst the saints of God, but amongst men generally. I wish to speak of it as it applies to the people of God, and to seek to show how this great relation is to be maintained amongst us as divinely designed and intended.
It is worked out in the gospels; in the synoptic gospels, as we speak of them, on moral grounds, and in John's gospel on the ground of purpose; for it was a matter of purpose with God that He should have a family, and that that family should take the form of sons to Him, and of brethren to Christ. That is the standpoint from which this great matter is dealt with in John's gospel, whereas the other evangelists deal with it in moral grounds, and it can only be maintained whilst we are down here on moral grounds. The moral element will necessarily be dropped as we enter on the eternal thought for us; we shall then know and realise that what we enjoy is a matter of counsel, and is the outcome of the necessity of love, for love has its necessities, and the counsels of God are to meet those necessities. He has predestinated us unto sonship, by Jesus Christ to Himself.
And then, further, Christ is to be the Firstborn among many brethren. Thus the matter is treated from the standpoint of counsel; and as we enter on our eternal portion, dear brethren, we shall know, we shall be conscious of this great fact, that we are there for the satisfaction of love, to meet the necessities of love. The position that God has wrought for the necessity of His own love could not be greater, nor could it be more sure.
{325}
But then we are still here in the body, having to do with elements within ourselves and outside of ourselves, that tend to defile us; and so the great necessity for the synoptic gospels, for they deal with matters more on moral lines. John assures us of the permanency of the relation; he places it on the highest possible platform. The Lord said, as He was about to ascend into heaven, "go to my brethren", without the least reference to anything moral. "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God, and your God" (@John 20: 17) -- no qualifications, no reference to state, it is a question of counsel, it is the highest possible platform, and the surest, so that we start with that.
But then, as I said, the synoptic gospels deal with the subject on moral grounds, so that Matthew and Mark bring the brethren of Christ into view on the ground of doing the will of God, not as a question of counsel. They are brought to light here on earth in everyday circumstances where evil is, by doing the will of God. It is one of the greatest things morally there can be, that there should be those in this world who do the will of God. The Lord Jesus brought in that thought; He set it out perfectly. "Lo, I come ... to do O God, thy will" (@Hebrews 10: 7), He said.
The will of God runs into the future, I need not say. Ephesians perhaps brings that out as much as any epistle. We read there of the good pleasure of His will in relation to purpose; we read of the mystery of His will, and of the counsel of His will. He carries His will through, and will establish a world here where evil has been and is, in spite of that evil. There are no forces that can stand in the way of the will of God. That is Ephesians. Things are placed on that basis, but it works out in every believer, and he is marked off as one of the brethren of Christ by doing the will of God.
{326}
That is what Matthew states. Mark adds a thought which is suggestive of our own time. He adds the thought of a circle. As the mother and brethren of the Lord come to Him and desire to see Him, it says, "And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him" (@Mark 3: 34); there were those who were sitting around Christ and hearing what He said. They were not listening to what was going on in the world. They had none of those modern things in their houses through which the things of this world reach men's ears. They were sitting around Christ, that was what marked them. They were those marked off as sitting around Christ and listening to what He was saying, and He looked around on them in a circuit and said, "Behold my mother and my brethren". His brethren were those who did the will of God.
Luke adds a further thought, "my brethren are those who hear the word of God and do it" (@Luke 8: 21). That is not only the will, the divine authority, but the expression of the mind of God; God has a mind about things. He has things in His mind that He discloses by His word, and the brethren not only hear these things, but do them.
Now these three evangelists, as you will see, connect the subject with what is moral, and it is from that point of view I wish to speak of brethren, because there are forces against us to nullify the relationship, and the affections that belong to the relationship. Satan is against the idea, because it is a divine idea; it is one of the most exalted thoughts connected with us. It is a primary thought with God, and what is primary is eternal. Satan is against it, and there are elements in every one of us which can be employed against the divine thought, and elements outside of us, too. So that we have to take account of these moral features if we are to be preserved in the blessed relation and affections of it.
{327}
I have selected this passage from Matthew because this gospel has the assembly particularly in view, and the thought of brethren necessarily underlies the thought of the assembly. So in this remarkable chapter, in which the Lord denounces, in the most scathing terms, the scribes and Pharisees -- the leading educationalists and religionists of the day -- He says to His disciples, "be not ye called Rabbi;" and "call not any one your father upon the earth", and "Neither be called instructors, for one is your instructor, the Christ". "One is your instructor, and all *ye* are brethren". Peter was there doubtless, he who earlier in the gospel is said to be first in the apostolic list. He is to be one of the brethren. Were he not one of the brethren he could not be truly an apostle. Judas indeed was an apostle, but was not a brother, so his apostleship came to an end, and he fell by transgression. To be an apostle according to God, representing the authority of the Lord in the grace of the Lord, and in the love of the Lord, one has to be a brother first.
I refer for a moment, dear brethren, to the book of Genesis, because there we have worked out in type, and, to some extent in substance, the great thought of the family. No one who has read Genesis can fail to see that God is working out in one great stock, which He took up sovereignly, the thought of the family. It was all with design; the whole dispensation that He had in mind to set up in Israel was before Him in the book of Genesis, for God works according to plan always, and goes far back in order to prepare for what He brings out in service and in testimony. So you find Genesis full of reference to the family: children, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, and great-grandchildren; the great-grandfather nursing the great-grandchild. Is it there for nothing? Is it not written for our learning, that we
{328}
should know how to be in the family of God? The family of Jacob, which was broken up, is re-united and set up in Joseph, and there Jacob leaves the scene; he represents God in this connection. He was not an ordinary parent; the divine thought of a patriarch was seen in him, for he could bless Pharaoh, and he could bless the twelve tribes. He called Joseph and said to him, "I have given to thee one tract of land above thy brethren" (@Genesis 48: 22). You have the principle in that of one set up in pre-eminence, which is the case with ourselves. "I have given to thee one tract of land above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow".
We have to understand that spiritually. He sets Joseph above his brethren; he was morally above them, as the previous chapters show, but now he is formally set above them by his father. Then Jacob calls his sons to him, the twelve sons, and he blesses them. "Listen", he says, "to Israel your father" (@Genesis 49: 2). It is on spiritual lines he is blessing them, and he blesses them all. Every tribe is blessed; however much there was to reprove, and rebuke, and condemn, every tribe was blessed. They were set on a sure footing, for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance, and the tribes are set up in blessing. Then they are carried over under the supervision of Joseph; they are in Egypt under his care. Thus you see how the family thread is maintained throughout Genesis, and Exodus is on that basis.
So the great deliverer, Moses, typical of Christ, moved by instinct, as I may say, went out to see his *brethren*. It is a question of the family. It is well to note how the Spirit of God maintains the link in Exodus, and so the great superstructure of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers is built upon the thought of the family; the priesthood, the levitical service, and the tabernacle system hinge on that. So that Moses
{329}
went out to see his brethren, as Joseph had done earlier. He saw an Egyptian smiting one of them, and he slew the Egyptian. He thought they would understand that he was the deliverer. He *was* the deliverer, but they thrust him away from them. He went out a second day, and he finds two of his brethren quarrelling. Note that. All the difficulties amongst us, one may say, arise from that -- brethren quarrelling. It will never do, he says, it is quite inconsistent. But the one who did the wrong thrust him away, saying, "Dost thou intend to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?" (@Exodus 2: 14). He had wished to save them both.
I only mention that that you may see how the great deliverer and apostle Moses, who was charged later with the deliverance of the people, and the building of the tabernacle, thought of the brethren in his early days, and had them in his heart.
In @Exodus 6 the list of the tribes is given. There is a list given in chapter 1, and another in chapter 6. In the latter you have Reuben, Simeon and Levi, and when the Holy Spirit arrives at Levi He stops, for the reason that it was in that family that the divine idea of service was to be developed, so there was no need of going further; we have a priestly family. Now a priestly family belongs to the brethren, it is a development from among the brethren, and so no more are given. The Holy Spirit gives us the genealogy of Levi down to Moses and Aaron who were typically the apostle and high priest of our confession and they were developed out of the brethren. The family is linked up there, and from that family we have the priestly order inaugurated, and both the priestly service and the levitical service set up.
I want you to see how important it is that the thought of brethren should be maintained amongst us. If it is not maintained, if there be brethren who thrust away Moses, so to speak, and refuse to be reconciled, refusing to go down, we cannot have the
{330}
service of God nor the priesthood. How can one who will thrust away Moses have priestly garments on? Later on, the Israelites were glad to come under Moses. God brought them to it. When the tribes of Israel were assembled together, Moses was king in Jeshurun (@Deuteronomy 33); but they began by thrusting him away from them. Were it not that God brought them to it, there could not have been the inauguration of the priestly service. That was the great thought that God had in His mind. If He has brought us back to the family thought -- that of brethren, it is to build upon that a service for Himself -- a priestly service.
The passage in Matthew furnishes us with very practical instructions, by which we may be saved from any family derangements, and by which we may maintain the blessed relation of brethren. He says, "one is your instructor". Neither be called instructors, or masters; it is not that a brother is not to be an instructor, nor a brother not to be a father, surely; the point is, am I *called* that? Have I acquired that designation? Christendom is full of it, from the Pope downwards. It is not that they are fathers, the point is that they are *called* fathers; they are known by that designation. Why should a brother not be a father? John writes to the fathers; he does not write to those who are called fathers, in an official way, but to all brethren who have grown and become matured; brethren who have known Him that is from the beginning; those are fathers, and there is a great need of them. The father is rare, because he represents mature experience with God; he represents mature knowledge of Christ as from the beginning. A father will hold to what is from the beginning, he will test everything by what is from the beginning, and hold fast to what is of God. He will not reject a thing because he has not known it before, he will test it and see if it conforms to what is from
{331}
the beginning; if it does, he will hold it fast, and he will add to it his own mature thoughts, the thoughts of his own ripened experience in the knowledge of God and the knowledge of Christ. It is therefore an immense thing to have fathers, men of experience; but then we do not call them 'fathers', that is the point; "call not any one your father upon the earth".
What a sweeping rebuke we have here to all that exists in christendom at the present time! There is the great, ancient system that is marked by it -- popery; but then there are other systems marked by instructors, masters, guides; all the non-conformist bodies are marked by these instructors. The apostle Paul refers to ten thousand of them; there may be ten thousand instructors, and only one father. Fathers are rare in the true sense. So the Lord here foresaw that the relation of brethren would be marred, and deranged, and obliterated, if this principle were adopted of calling this one and that one 'father' -- maybe 'Revelation' So-and-so, or 'D.D'. All these things, if admitted in the principle of them amongst us, are sure to derange and render void the precious relationship of brethren and the affections that belong to it. So the Lord, as I said, foresaw what the disciples would have to face, and He warns them.
"The greatest of you shall be your servant. And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled, and whoever shall humble himself shall be exalted". You see what simple and yet what valuable instruction we have in these verses. However gifted, matured, or experienced I may be, my part is to be the least, to be the servant of all. Such is the divine way. One knows well enough what is in one's own heart, one is as prone as anyone else to assume to be something, to acquire a reputation in the service of the Lord, and to sit on it as a little throne. The Lord foresaw that, and He warns them against it. Exaltation
{332}
comes from heaven; it is the divine prerogative to give it, not mine, nor yours.
Now I just wanted to touch for a moment on the Psalm. There is hardly a psalm, perhaps, so well-known. The Holy Spirit dwells on the theme of it; it is the last but one of the Songs of Degrees. It conveys most beautiful thoughts. It is as if He said to us, I want to show you what it is for brethren to dwell together in unity; it is a lovely sight, a most exalted, a most precious thing. And so in describing it He goes back to the priestly system of which I have spoken; He goes back to that for an example to illustrate what He has in His mind; it is "Like the precious oil upon the head", He says, "that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard, that ran down to the hem of his garments;" that is to say, He likens it spiritually to Christ in His great personal distinction among the priests. It is not in the first instance a question of His exaltation to heaven, but of His great personal distinction.
From one point of view exaltation to heaven does not add to Christ -- nor can His glory be added to; that is from the personal point of view. The High Priest is the Son, consecrated for evermore; He is a divine Person; and He is elevated above us in that regard, so that He is the Head; it is the dignity of Christ, the great dignity of Christ personally as the priest that is spoken of. The anointing that ran down upon His beard denotes His beauty. You remember how the leper had to shave off all his hair, his head, his beard, and his eyebrows; all that in which I shine in any sense has to go. I am ashamed of it, I am an object of shame; the Lord alone is adorned; the believer has to be brought to that measure of growth. The leper had to be shaved completely and then he is brought to the door of the tabernacle, and set up afresh in the personal excellency of Christ, through the sacrifices. The allusion in @Psalm 133 is to the
{333}
Lord personally -- His dignity; the anointing oil is of course, spiritual. The oil refers to the Holy Spirit -- the Holy Spirit coming down from that Person in His personal dignity to the very skirts of His garments. That is like brethren dwelling together in unity.
In the second reference we have an allusion to the exaltation of the Lord into heaven; that is Ephesians. Colossians is the Person of the Lord; you cannot, as I said, add anything to Him by any office, He is personally great; that is Colossians. But Ephesians is the exalted Man; He has gone far above all heavens, so that the dew comes down from the top of Hermon, and descends to the mountains of Zion -- to the saints, viewed as taken up sovereignly. They love as brethren, they are together as brethren -- the brethren of John's gospel really. They are seen in relation to purpose, and they love, they are united and God takes account of it. The dew comes down upon the mountains of Zion -- the brethren are refreshed constantly; the blessing is commanded there -- life for evermore.
I think you will thus see the importance of brethren dwelling together in unity. I have no doubt you will agree it is well worth having it pressed home.
The Lord appeared to five hundred brethren at one time; and so now God has brought us back to the truth and blessedness of our relation as brethren. The point is to maintain it, but in order to do so, we must understand the synoptic gospels -- the moral side.
{334}
DIVINE FEELINGS
1 Samuel 30: 1 - 6; Luke 19: 41 - 44; John 11: 32 - 36
I hope to dwell this evening, dear brethren, on these scriptures as presenting to us something of the depths of divine feelings, for that which came out in our Lord Jesus Christ in this respect conveyed the feelings of God -- an expression that bears consideration, so that there should be corresponding feelings in His people.
It is said, "Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart" (@Genesis 6: 6) -- a brief remark by the Spirit in early times, but which became amplified later, when it found its full expression in Jesus. In the Son of God as become Man God had the means of expressing His feelings. Of course His love underlies all, but I would confine myself on this occasion to His feelings, so that there may be concern as to corresponding feelings with us, for one is conscious in oneself, and one observes it, too, in others, how extremely shallow our spiritual feelings are.
And so I wish to show how divine feelings express themselves, first in relation to man, generally, then in relation to God's chief interest on earth, and finally in relation to a brother. I think under these three heads we may hope to acquire some perception of divine feelings and compassions. There is particular aptness in the manner in which the gospel of John alludes to man. I refer to this because the gospel of John has such a direct bearing upon us. We owe to it, indeed, under God, the recovery of family affections and brotherly relations in life which we enjoy, and so, lest we should be unduly occupied with the family to the exclusion of the race as a whole, the gospel of John introduces man as primarily in the mind of God
{335}
in the incoming of His beloved Son, for immediately after we have the statement of His Person it is said: "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (@John 1: 4).
We are thus notified at once that men were in the mind of God, and, as this gospel applies peculiarly to the last days, we see that God has not overlooked or forgotten men; the race is before Him today, as it was when Jesus was born. Hence, you find men introduced almost immediately and throughout "There was a man sent from God, his name John" (@John 1: 6), and again: "The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man" (verse 9); "But there was a man from among the Pharisees ... he came to him by night" (@John 3: 1, 2); and so you find throughout in that gospel the prominence of men.
Co-relatively with that is the prominence given to the Son of man -- the title Son of man. Then the Samaritan woman is a further illustration, for she went into the city, and spoke to the men. The Lord Himself speaks of a woman when she gives birth to a child remembering no more the anguish, for joy that a *man* is born into the world -- not a child or a babe, but a man (chapter 16: 21); and then again, in chapter 17: 6, "the men whom thou gavest me out of the world". All these references remind us of the place that men, as such, have in the mind of God.
I have read from Samuel, because I apprehend that the passage alludes to what the Lord Jesus found in this world as coming into it. All was lost. It is not a question of man's responsibility, it is a question of the triumph, for the moment, of the enemy, as in another connection it is said, "A man that is an enemy has done this" (@Matthew 13: 28). What devastation met His eye! Not indeed that it was new to Him, but now, being in manhood, the Lord Jesus could weep, He could feel, and express divine feelings. What awful desolation
{336}
met His eye! He alone knew perfectly the divine mind as to man -- what counsel had been taken as to him, what forethought, what provision! The glory of God, indeed, is bound up with him.
But as I have said, the passage in Samuel contemplates the immediate triumph of the enemy; it seemed to be complete. It is only in a little measure that we are in the presence of such circumstances -- that which seems to be a complete triumph of the enemy, something irretrievably lost, and that the thing which is dearest to us, the thing which we most cherished wrested from us, and on which all our thoughts and counsels depended, and on which all our desires centred. But think of the infinite knowledge of Christ as become Man in regard of all these things! What man was to God, how He had come into the garden to walk with him, as it were, calling for him, what His thoughts were, what He intended to set out in that being, how He intended that His glory should shine there.
Everything was perfectly in the mind of Jesus; He saw everything as it was in the mind of God; He was in every respect the expression of the mind of God and the feelings of God; He understood everything, as Man, as it was in the mind of God, and thus He took account of the scene as coming into it, and now He could weep.
I need not say there is nothing said about weeping in @Genesis 6, but it is said that "Jehovah repented that he had made Man ... and it grieved him in his heart". But now we have, not only the grief, but the expression of the grief, not in words only, but in tears. And so here we have this remarkable statement that they "wept, until they had no more power to weep". Can we doubt for a moment that the very greatest disaster from the divine point of view is before us? Can we doubt that the picture represents something more than a mere city or a few hundred
{337}
men and women taken captive? It is surely the divine view of what Satan achieved in securing man and turning him away from God; but then we have also in man here those infinite depths of feeling expressed in such language that there was no more power to weep.
Although we have others with David, yet the Holy Spirit singles him out as peculiarly distressed, for added to the awful grief of the captivity of these people and the burning of the city, the men who were with him spoke of stoning him.
Let us dwell, for a little, on the feelings of our Lord Jesus Christ, when here upon earth, as He took a survey of things, as He alone could -- in going on to Gethsemane and the cross. We have to follow His footsteps; we have to follow Him into the garden and on to the cross to realise the depths of feeling in His mind -- those infinite depths of feeling in regard of the disaster; and in the picture in the chapter in Samuel we see that the people speak of stoning Him. It is only thus, I apprehend, that Gethsemane can be understood. There was there combined what words can never express -- His sense of the disaster, His sense of what it meant to God, and then what was before Him -- the awful desolation of the cross when all forsook Him and fled -- He alone, left to weep, as it were, left to express His feelings in regard of the general position, for He never was diverted for one moment from all that, He was with God in it -- infinitely so. He felt it as He alone could feel it; He felt is as a Man -- divine feelings expressed perfectly through a Man. He looked for comforters but found none. One would seek to direct the brethren to the narrative of His holy sufferings in Gethsemane and on the cross, so as to understand the depths of feeling that were there and how perfectly they were expressed.
Well now, what comes out -- and I want to enlist
{338}
your sympathy, dear brethren, if I can -- what comes out is that a note of victory is sounded from the outset. In humility David has recourse to God, as the Lord did. The Lord prayed three times in Gethsemane; the perfection of His manhood comes out as in His extremity He turns to God. It says, "he began to be amazed and oppressed in spirit" (@Mark 14: 33). Think of that, think of the feelings that were there! He prayed three times and then went resolutely to the cross.
And so with David, he strengthened himself in Jehovah his God; he had recourse to prayer and made enquiry, and the answer was that he would recover all. Now I would dwell on this particular feature although it is elementary; it is really the truth in Romans worked out in our souls. What you find in the chapter is that, having the mind of God, David proceeds, and a vessel is secured. One great feature of Romans is that it secures the body of the believer -- it secures him in newness of life, in newness of spirit, and with the renewal of his mind, so that he presents his body a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is his intelligent service, and in which he proves that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. And now what you find in this chapter is what corresponds with that -- a vessel who had not only been taken captive, but who had been employed by the enemy, and I may say that is what refers to every one of us. Our bodies have been instruments of our own wills, of sin, but they are now to be yielded up as instruments of righteousness to God.
The young man whom David found receives bread and water; he receives refreshment -- a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins, that is to say, he is made to live. If we understand how through the death, resurrection and ascension of Christ everything is secured for God, then we say our bodies are to be presented as living sacrifices, for we have come into
{339}
a living state of things. Romans teaches us that things are to be new, they are to be living, for the Spirit is life; so that, as being recovered, our bodies are available to God, to be employed in His service. I believe that the Lord would lay it upon us at the present moment to rise to the divine thought as to man, and that as in life we are to be available to God, so that men may be sought after as such, and that there may be men for God.
It is very beautiful to see in @Genesis 6, where it is said that Jehovah repented that He had made man and that it grieved Him in His heart, that it is immediately said, "But Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah". One man had found favour with God, and in that one man finding favour with God we have the gospel; we have a Head for men. And so the woman of Samaria, who represents what the truth in the epistle to the Romans can produce, as I understand it, understood that her body was to be a vessel for living water. She left her water-pot; she might have taken it back full and nothing been said about it, but the Holy Spirit says she left it, for He would call our attention to the fact that she understood the Lord's teaching -- that her body that had been so corrupt is now to be a vessel of living water, and so she speaks of Christ -- the Head. She says to the men, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?" (@John 4: 29). She presents a Man for God; she has found Him -- the Man in whom God could reveal His mind and through whom He will accomplish everything, and she presents Him to men.
Is it not within the reach of every believer here to do that? She was only a woman. It is not a question of gift, it is a question of the use you are making of your body. If the Lord has recovered you like that young man at Ziklag, and made you to live, then you are to be a vessel, a living vessel for the divine
{340}
use, and in that way the glad tidings become spread abroad in this world. I make every distinction for gift, I make every allowance for it, for the preaching necessitates gift, but the believer's body is to be available to God, whether he has gift in this sense or otherwise. The point in @John 4 is that the woman understood that her body was to be available for Christ, and so she went to the men and said to them -- not preached to them -- said to them, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?"
My exercise and desire are that we might be awakened in our sympathies to feel with God about men. I doubt whether we shall ever have an evangelical spirit without such feelings. You say, Is that love? No, not exactly, though love is behind it, but it is love that can express itself toward men: "when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared" (@Titus 3: 4) -- that is the idea of it, that is the kind of feeling, and I doubt whether you will ever find a truly evangelical spirit until the state of man is seen and we begin to feel with God about it.
If we move about the world, and see the awful darkness in which men are, we begin to feel things. One need not go away from this very country to see it, but think of two-thirds of the race in the grossest darkness in Asia! You may say, You are speaking of things beyond us; but the spirits of all these people have been given to them by God, they did not come into the world by accident; God thinks of them. It is not that we can undertake to evangelise the world now; it is a question of feeling with God, of being with God, and being with God we shall then find something to do in accordance with His feelings, and He will prosper us. And that is why I press the thought that John emphasises the idea of men, because God would not have us to be narrow, but to
{341}
have His thoughts before us, to think with Him in regard of the whole race; for it is out of the race in that sense that everything is being developed.
Then you find that after David had recovered all he sends blessings (as it may read), or presents out of the spoil, not only to the elders of Judah and his friends, but to all the places where he had been accustomed to visit in his rejection. You see there is the idea of results from men. With regard to our families we have the promise of God that they shall be saved, but what about men? The Egyptian was found in the field, and in that way represents the race. The divine idea is in reference to the race and every development of God is to come out of it; hence Jesus has become Man, and He has acquired right to the whole race. He has given Himself a ransom for all, He has therefore the right to all, and He is developing that which is for God out of the race.
I am only seeking to bring the light of the thing under our attention so that we may be with God as to the position. God is developing His thoughts out of the race, out of men, and hence the Lord Jesus became Man and gave Himself a ransom for all, and has a right to men. He has by Him, too, all that men need, so as to bring them in according to God. So, we read, in @Genesis 6, Noah found favour with God, and from that point God works out a new world, and that is what is going on at the present time.
Now I want to proceed to @Luke 19, because there you have the feelings of God, not in regard of the race of men, but in regard of His chief interest on earth. That is another thing. I have no doubt we have been rightly concerned about this -- about the assembly -- God's chief interest at the present time, but I am inclined to believe (I do not exclude myself) that we have forgotten man -- the race, and that man is the basis whence everything is developed, and that God adheres to that; He is adhering to it. Almost
{342}
the last word of Scripture is, "He that will, let him take the water of life freely" (@Revelation 22: 17). The water is there; he is to take it. @Luke 19 refers to the chief interest of God on earth -- at that time Jerusalem -- now the assembly. Was it nothing to Christ as He drew nigh to the city and beheld it? What holy thoughts came into His mind, what holy thoughts were there! He would revert with his own intelligence to all the ways and thoughts of God, to the mercies of God, the counsels of God in regard of that city. Think of His feelings! It was "the city of the great king" (@Psalm 48: 2), the city of David, of Solomon, the site of the temple, that which God had desired sovereignly (@Psalm 132: 13, 14) -- that which He loved: "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it;" "the mount Zion which he loved" (@Psalm 78: 68). Now in the Lord Jesus there is the expression of all this in *tears*. Does it not touch your heart? As I say, one is conscious of one's shallowness and superficiality of feeling in regard of these things.
Look at the assembly today as it is; no one who is with God will limit himself to the few christians he is walking with, but will look at the whole thing as it stands, and as you look at it, does it not bring tears to your eyes? Think of what it was! Think of the divine thoughts that lodged there and found their home there! Every divine thought found a home in the bosom of the assembly at the beginning; everything that God loved was cherished there. God Himself was loved and He dwelt there. The Lord Jesus Christ visited it: "I am coming to you". Think of all these things! What about it now?
Think of the birds of the air roosting in its branches! Think of the desolation that marks it, as you look abroad upon it! Can you not feel with Christ as to all this? "As he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it", we read. Things were hidden from their
{343}
eyes then (verse 42); but He loved Jerusalem, and He expressed the depths of His feelings as He looked and wept over it. Now as we look abroad and see the corrupting influences that are at work in the assembly -- in the public body, the fowls of the air -- these wicked men who oppose God, blaspheming the name of the Lord Jesus -- being recognised there, and honoured there, and He has no place in it, are we moved by it? Is it nothing to Him? It is everything to Him, and He feels it all, and so, in Revelation, He clothes Himself with habiliments that signify His feelings and He announces His mind to it in message after message which He sends. But think of the depth of feeling that underlay all that; as He said to one, "thou hast left thy first love" (@Revelation 2: 4).
Well, I cannot proceed further as, to that -- what it meant to Christ, but I desire that we may all be brought into sympathy with His feelings in regard of the public ruin of the assembly -- that which is His chief interest on earth, and be more exercised as to what we are doing in relation to it; whether we are taking sides wholly with Him, and having judged the thing we are overcomers. The assembly will yet be known universally as the object of His love, as He says, "and shall know that I have loved thee" (@Revelation 3: 9). There is that which Christ loves and which He will honour and which He will display and make all know that He loves it.
Now there is just the last thought and that is in @John 11 -- the depths of the Lord's feelings in regard of a brother. We come down now to very narrow limits, and God can come down to these limits. He can come down to the very weakest amongst us, to "the weak one, the brother for whose sake Christ died" (@1 Corinthians 8: 11) -- note the very narrow limit, to one individual, the weak brother. We know what His feelings are in regard of the weak brother, and I would ask myself, What are my feelings? One is
{344}
conscious of how little one loves the brethren, of how little one values them. Now in John 11 we have the Lord weeping, and we see the depths of His feelings in regard of a brother.
One has been impressed of late at the readiness with which a brother is given up, the readiness with which brethren pull away from one another as if they wished to be rid of each other. How sorrowful! Here, death has deprived a family circle of one of its members -- of a brother, for it was a question of the brother. And so the Lord arrives at Bethany. Martha meets Him; she, was, as we may say, the least of the three, the least in the assembly, for she is obviously the least spiritual of them, although the most active. But the least in the assembly is not to be despised. Martha went and met the Lord. He did not brush past her and say, Martha, you are not spiritual, I want to see Mary; that is not His way; but He remained where Martha met Him; not a step further did He go until Mary came. Mary had to come, but He would show His interest in the least.
Corinthians makes provision for the least -- the least esteemed in the assembly is to take the place of the magistrate in the city; instead of the magistrate, if a judgment of things pertaining to this life between brethren has to be decided, the apostle says those who are little esteemed in the assembly are to be set to judge. You cannot ignore the weak brother; he is to judge in such matters; he has more wisdom than the circuit judge (@1 Corinthians 6: 4). Though he may be little esteemed in the assembly, he has got some wisdom, and he is to decide in such matters.
So Martha hastens to meet the Lord and she has much to say, much that is orthodox, but unspiritual; nevertheless, she was a true lover of Jesus, and she was loved by Him, and He did not go past her, He honoured her; but He remained where she met Him.
{345}
She secretly goes and calls Mary, and Mary comes in haste. It is evident that she had more influence than Martha, for when she arose quickly to go to Jesus the Jews who were in the house followed her; they had not followed Martha. The more spiritual you are, the more influence you have, and the more valuable relatively you will be. Nevertheless, Martha was a member of the family, as was Mary, and as was Lazarus; but the mourners followed Mary, they did not follow Martha. You may depend upon it that the saints are ready to discern those who are more spiritual. It was when Mary arrived that the Lord Himself was moved. Martha did not move Him to weep; but when Mary came, and when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, He resented that which had affected the brother; He groaned in His spirit, and was troubled, or as it is rendered, 'shuddered'. There was depth of feeling there that words could not utter. Think of the groans of Jesus! We read of groaning in ourselves "with groanings which cannot be uttered" (@Romans 8: 26), but think of the infinite depths in His heart just uttered by groans! The groaning of Jesus was the indication to death that it should be robbed of its spoil. But then there was not only the groan, there were the tears.
How many tears have we shed in regard of the brethren who have left us, and are not available to us? We are speaking now of what is a question of feelings -- of how much I am moved, and whether I have shown it. In having a brother, am I on the line that inasmuch as in me lies I would remove that which hinders him, that which holds him and deprives the family of him? The Lord Jesus as a divine Person disposes of death and calls Lazarus out of the grave. We could never do that, but there are many things we can do. The Lord did not remove the grave clothes. How many are held by grave clothes! He
{346}
says, "Loose him, and let him go". Then again He says, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained" (@John 20: 23).
Note, remission comes first. May it not be that some brother is held in bondage for want of remission? You say, he has not confessed. The Lord does not say anything about confession in John 20, He leaves it with us. True enough we have to retain sins; thank God for the power! How could we get on without it? The mandate to retain sins is from Christ. There are those we are compelled to use that against; we have to do it in love to protect the Lord's name, and to maintain a place suitable for Him. But then how many there are whose sins we might remit and we have not done it, hence, the brother is lost for the moment; he is lost to the family.
The point that I would seek to emphasise is that the feelings here were family feelings. Mary wept, those that were present with her wept, and the Lord Jesus wept. His weeping is stated after the weeping of Mary, and this is remarkable. It shows, I think, how He comes in and confirms right feelings. You have the feelings, He would say, and I endorse them. Could He do it in a more forcible way? He felt with the members of the family. "Jesus wept". The Holy Spirit sets that down by itself; it stands there, Jesus wept, but it comes in after Mary's weeping and after the weeping of the Jews. They could do nothing, but they had the feelings, they felt the loss of the brother. The Lord could secure the brother, and He did.
May I not suggest, dear brethren, that if we have the feelings, the Lord will come in and secure the brother? He can do it; and I believe that according to our faith it will be. If we have the feelings He will gratify them; He will give the one back to the
{347}
family. And so He delivered back Lazarus to the family. The family is thus set up again on the principle of resurrection.
I need not proceed further, but the time of the cessation of all these feelings of sorrow is drawing nigh, when as John tells us, "God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes" (@Revelation 7: 17); and it is a precious thing that *He* does it. It is a beautiful thought that it is a divine operation to wipe away all tears from all eyes. Meanwhile every tear that is in correspondence with the tears of Jesus is precious, and is put into the divine bottle.
May God bless His word.
{348}
WISDOM'S WAY IN THE ASSEMBLY
Proverbs 9: 1, 2; 14: 1; 2 Samuel 20: 18 - 22
I wish to speak about wisdom in the manner in which it is presented in these scriptures, believing that they unfold to us what has come to light in the building of the assembly, and in the maintenance of it since it has been built.
The book of Proverbs, as you all know, speaks of wisdom, tracing it from the outset. Chapter 8 speaks of it by itself -- wisdom personified -- and connecting it with all God's operations, and conveying to us that it was daily His delight, the nursling of His love. Wisdom is thus presented in its true value in this book, the book being, no doubt, the product of him who is a type of Christ as wisdom. Solomon is a type of the Lord Jesus as wisdom, and so the apostle Paul in writing to the Corinthians, having in view the assembly in its public order, speaks of Christ as the wisdom of God; he says that Christ is of God made unto us wisdom (@1 Corinthians 1: 30); we are thus at the outset, as believers, lifted outside the realm of man's wisdom. Corinth was a Greek city; the Greeks sought after wisdom, they made it a point to seek after it, therefore the apostle brings in Christ at the outset as the wisdom of God, and that He of God is made unto us wisdom. Then, further, he speaks of hidden wisdom -- wisdom, I apprehend, of a superlative character, made known in Christ, but nevertheless a wisdom that was hidden -- wisdom which God had pre-determined before the world for our glory; something special, for none of the princes of this world knew it; it was outside their range, for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. It was all there hidden in Christ; as become Man He brought it in; in due course it was unfolded,
{349}
but the princes of this world did not know it; it was there in Christ the Lord of glory. It was in Simon's house, but he did not know it. The Lord had accepted his invitation to dine, and He lay at table; the wisdom of God was there. The Lord had just said that "wisdom is justified of all her children", but it was not justified in Simon for he did not know it, so the Lord calls attention to one who justified it -- a poor woman of the city, who stood behind Him weeping, who washed His feet with her tears, wiped them with her hair, kissed His feet, and anointed them with the myrrh. The Lord says to Simon, "Seest thou this woman?" There was one who justified wisdom, and wisdom was justified of her children. In a multitude of cases in the New Testament we have the justification of wisdom, for she is justified of all her children.
The apostle, as I said, in writing to the Corinthians, brings in this great subject, he brings it in in Christ in chapter 1; he also brings it in, in chapter 2, as hidden, pre-determined before the world for our glory, then in chapter 3: 10 he says, "as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation". He was not only a child of wisdom, he was a wise architect, he was the architect of the assembly -- a word that would be well understood by the Greeks, for they were famed for their architecture; but here was a man of no outward account, who came to their city in the guise of a tent-maker -- architecture and tent-making do not go together in this world -- but beneath the lowly guise of a workman -- a tent-maker -- was the great architect of the assembly. How much discipline had been gone through by this man so that he was prepared to shrink into the outward smallness of a mere mechanic, and yet in heart have the mind of God! He had the pattern of the assembly, of that in which the divine glory would shine, not only in time but in eternity. It comes in in time as the vessel of glory, but Ephesians
{350}
connects it with eternity: "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages" (@Ephesians 3: 21). Think, dear brethren, of the shrinkage in a man who had all that light and understanding and yet could work daily as a tent-maker in Corinth! But he laboured on, and he says, "I have laid the foundation" (@1 Corinthians 3: 10), and the foundation *was* laid, and there is no other, hence he says, "Let each see how he buildeth upon it" (verse 10). We need not all be architects, but we ought to be builders, but in order to build intelligently I must have the plan, and it is from that point of view that wise women come in. "The wisdom of women buildeth their house" (@Proverbs 14: 1). It is one house, and the wisdom of women builds it.
Now wisdom itself, as I have said, is presented in @Proverbs 8 in relation to the physical universe. Wisdom was there throughout. God built the universe; He is the Architect of it; He knows its extent; no mortal knows it. The believer rests in God as regards what is beyond him; he knows he is filled even to all the fulness of God, otherwise I apprehend he could not subsist in what is infinite, for he is incapable of taking in what is infinite. He is filled into all the fulness of God, and he rests there; and so it will be in eternity. God made the universe, He designed it, wisdom was with Him, but when we come to the house which wisdom built, in that God intends to show wisdom's masterpiece. The physical system is not that, it is wonderful and beyond the cleverest scientist; no mortal is capable of taking it in, but when we come to the house -- the moral system in other words -- it is said to be wisdom's house, for it is that in which wisdom in its highest character is seen displayed; indeed, the all-various wisdom of God, as we read in Ephesians, is seen through the assembly.
{351}
Well now, in @Proverbs 9: 1 - 3, we read, "Wisdom hath built her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars; she hath slaughtered her cattle, she hath mingled her wine, she hath also prepared her table; she hath sent forth her maidens;" that is to say, everything is done. What you find in the ministry of the apostle Paul is completeness; if he were unable to remain in a locality long enough to complete the thing, he left a Timothy or a Titus to complete it; it must be completed and it was completed. The foundation was laid, and the top stone was placed; the system was set up completely; there was nothing wanting in the assembly as set up by the apostle Paul; everything that was needed was provided, and then there were the wise women to keep that up. God "maketh the barren woman to keep house, as a joyful mother of sons" (@Psalm 113: 9). We must learn to keep house before the children come in, before converts are brought in, and so I apprehend in the seventh of Luke you have one of wisdom's children. Wisdom said she would "cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasuries" (@Proverbs 8: 21). I think the woman in @Luke 7 was furnished with substance. No believer is of any practical value in the house unless he has some substance; he may be counted amongst the number, but for house-keeping he must inherit substance, and wisdom causes those that love her to inherit substance and she fills their treasuries.
In @Luke 8 we find certain women with the Lord, who ministered to Him of their substance; they had substance and having substance they ministered to Him, and so it is in housekeeping. Now in @Proverbs 14: 1, "The wisdom of women buildeth their house;" the allusion is, I apprehend, to the saints as taking up their responsibility in that which wisdom has built, and it necessarily works out in the localities in which we are found; but in order to be effective
{352}
in my locality in housekeeping I must understand the great divine scheme. There is only one house, only one, and before you can have the house developed locally, there must be the understanding of the universal conception; in other words there can be no development of the house in any locality save as those in it apprehend the universal conception, and that is what 1 Corinthians insists on -- customs which were to govern the assembly were universal. There were to be no local customs; no company of christians was to take on local characteristics or customs, either religious or social -- the customs were to be universal. The apostle in proceeding in 1 Corinthians presents the idea of fellowship; in chapter 10 when he says the "bread which we break" he indicates that fellowship is general. He does not say the bread which *ye* break, it is the bread which *we* break, so that there must be the recognition of general fellowship before there can be the expression of it in any locality. In chapter 11 we have the assembly convened; "when ye come together in assembly". The locality is in view then, and so we get the bread which *ye* eat and the cup which *ye* drink, "For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come" (verse 26). That was local, but the local fellowship must be the outcome of the general fellowship; it is but the extension of what really exists, not something added; it is the idea of growth, of extension, not an addition.
Now, one could multiply instances in the New Testament of wisdom's children -- of wise women building their house. I particularly refer to Philippi, because it is the first assembly formed in Europe, and I apprehend its features were intended to characterise the testimony in Europe; and so we find the apostle consorted with certain women, outside the city by the river, in the place where prayer was wont to be made. Now I have mentioned this because
{353}
I believe that prayer has as much to do as any other item with the building of wise women; however limited one may be in one's circumstances or one's body, one can always pray, and I do not know of any service more effective than prayer; it is a priestly service and belongs to every brother and to every sister. I may not have gift or, through physical limitations, may not have opportunity to attend the meetings or even to hear what is said, but I can pray. This is how the work began in Europe, it began by a prayer meeting, and by women, and one, Lydia, had her heart opened by the Lord to attend to the things spoken by Paul. What were those things? Paul would speak of Christ to her, surely, but He would also speak to her of the assembly, for that was nearest to the heart of Christ, and her heart was opened to attend, not to listen simply, but to *attend* to the things. How much, dear brethren, have you attended to the things you have heard in ministry? She *attended* to the things. What did it mean? It meant she began to build; in so far as her life there was concerned, she was set to help in the work at Philippi. She was a potent factor in the work there; she invited the apostle into her house, with due respect and deference; it was not a mere act of civility with her, she invited him in the light of the things he had spoken to her, and that her heart had been opened to attend to. Wonderful things! she attended to them, the apostle was the vessel of light to her soul, she was honoured by his presence. She says, "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord;" (@Acts 16: 15); and it was by attending to the things that she put them into practice; she was associated with other women, who prayed with her. "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house". How delightful it must have been to the Lord's servant to be under such a roof! She was a wise woman and she builded. Presently, as they went
{354}
to prayer a slave having a spirit of Python met them -- the foolish woman. Satan through her would overthrow, would pluck down what had just begun, but the work went on in Philippi; one of the finest structures reared up in Europe spiritually was the assembly at Philippi -- the counterpart of Ephesus, her cross-water neighbour. Philippi was reared up in connection with wise women; it was a wonderful structure, for from the first day the apostle laboured there until now he speaks of their fellowship with him in the gospel. We may be sure Lydia did not fail to express her fellowship with Paul; she followed him daily in her prayers, I have no doubt, and followed him with her money also, for she was a *seller* of purple. She made sales and you can understand how she would use the proceeds for the support and service of the building up of these great things that had come into her heart through the ministry of Paul. After the apostle was released from prison, it says, he went to the house of Lydia, and when he had seen the brethren he departed. That is Philippi. One could multiply cases; the last chapter of Romans furnishes us with illustrations of this kind of service, this kind of building of wise women; it is within the reach of every woman here, of every sister and every brother. It refers to what is going on and what should go on in every locality -- the exercise of wisdom in what we do, so that we are working with God, and not plucking things down with our hands.
I want now to show you from 2 Samuel how this worked out in type in the Old Testament. The second book of Samuel emphasises wisdom as that by which the spirit and power of antichrist are met and overthrown. We have arrived at antichristian times, and what is given in Revelation in regard to antichrist is his number. "Here is wisdom. He that has understanding let him count the number of the beast" (@Revelation 13: 18), it says. And Daniel, who confirms John
{355}
in that way, says, "They that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse" (@Daniel 12: 3) -- they that are *wise*. We need wisdom, for we have arrived at the period of the antichristian revolt; it has not come to a head yet, but we have arrived at it, and christians need to be wise, for it is the wise only who stand in the presence of that. What is developed is a great counter-scheme of Satan; it is his great counter-scheme against wisdom's scheme. Almost from the time the assembly was set up, the mystery of iniquity began; it "already works", the apostle says. It is mystery, it has been working all these centuries and they that are wise see it, and they know how to meet it. Presently it will culminate in its fulness. It is a counter-scheme of the arch-enemy of God into which he puts all his wisdom and resources so that it behoves believers to be wise, and Daniel says the wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse. It can only be met in wisdom.
The second book of Samuel, in type, brings in antichrist in Absalom, and Absalom is met and overthrown on the principle of wisdom; even the wisdom of Ahithophel which would have secured the kingdom to Absalom and the overthrow of David, is overthrown by the wisdom of Hushai; @2 Samuel 17: 1 - 14. Then another antichrist arises in Sheba; he would have turned away the people from David and he had to be met. Joab would destroy him, but he would destroy the inheritance of the Lord in destroying the rebel, and that is what we have to guard against. Joab did not have divine wisdom, he had worldly wisdom, he was a murderer himself; he was an ambitious man and cared nothing for the inheritance of the Lord or for a mother in Israel, so he was preparing to destroy the city Abel where Sheba was. We have to guard against that in seeking to overthrow a Sheba; we must be careful not to overthrow the inheritance of the Lord; and so the wise woman
{356}
speaks to Joab from the wall; she calls upon him to judge; she is said to be a wise woman. The city was about to be overthrown and she knew it; she would save it and she did so by wisdom; as we read in Ecclesiastes, the poor wise man "by his wisdom delivered the city;" so she likewise, by her wisdom, delivered the city. Just note, dear brethren, how she did it. She went "to all the people in her wisdom", it says.
You will observe, she did not act by herself, she did not cut off Sheba's head by herself, she went to all the people in her wisdom. The great thing in assembly matters is to carry the saints with you. The woman could have contrived to do the deed herself, no doubt, but she did not, she went to the people. The assembly is composed of all saints, and each saint in the assembly has a responsibility, and whatever is done must be done with the full cognisance of all. One would like to have heard what she said to each one; she would know just what to say to each, and how to say it; therefore, she would get the support of each in what was so imperative, if the city was to be saved; she went in her wisdom "and *they* cut off the head of Sheba". Who could question the action? They were all committed to it, and it had to be accepted. There does not seem to have been a dissentient voice in this action, but she had previously called attention to what had been said in old time: "They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter". There is thus an end of the matter. If you bring in first principles -- the principles that governed wisdom's house at the beginning -- they must prevail. I would add that everyone who loves God bows to the voice of wisdom and wisdom is heard. The law that governed the house at the beginning must govern it now, and everyone who loves God bows to it. The matter is settled if you can bring in first principles, for if you can
{357}
show that you are governed by the universal customs of the assembly, the matter is ended; every one bows who loves God, and if anyone seem to be contentious, the apostle says, "we have no such custom". Subjection is to mark the assembly.
Well, the woman carries the people; she went to them in her wisdom and they cut off the head of Sheba, so the matter was settled, and there was not a word to be said. The point is to have things settled so that the consciences of all are carried and Satan cannot raise a voice against it. Jacob went up to Bethel on these principles and we read, "the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about". If we act in obedience to first principles the matter is settled. The head of Sheba was thrown over the wall and Joab departs, and that mother in Israel is saved, and the inheritance of Jehovah is saved. The city of Abel is saved for David, not for Sheba, but for David. We thus see how wisdom works, dear brethren; it is for the accomplishment of the will of God, and for the building up of what is for God.
{358}
THE ACCEPTANCE OF DEATH
Mark 16: 15, 16; Jeremiah 13: 1 - 11
We see in this passage in Mark, which is particularly the preachers gospel, the mandate that the eleven had from Christ to preach the gospel to every creature, or to all the creation, and that he that believed and was baptised should be saved. I wish to show from this latter statement that the Lord intended that those who believed the gospel should believe it in all its parts, and particularly that they should accept the necessity for death, of which baptism is a symbol. Baptism signifies that the believer accepts death; first that he accepts it as a penalty upon himself, and secondly, that he accepts the death of Jesus as bearing that penalty. There is therefore, in baptism, a definite acceptance of death, and I believe that the secret of the feeble realisation of salvation which many have, and consequently the small realisation of joy is due to the non-acceptance of death.
It may appear from these remarks as if I were emphasising baptism unduly, especially as Paul says that Christ sent him not to baptise but to preach the gospel, but we must not misconstrue the apostle's remark; he conveyed by it that he was not one like John the baptist -- sent to baptise; he was not a baptist in that sense. In saying that he was not sent to baptise but to preach the gospel, he did not mean that he did not preach baptism, for he did. It is true that in answering the enquiry of the Philippian jailer he said nothing about it; he said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house" (@Acts 16: 32). That is what he said; it was one of the most remarkable answers that a sinner could get, especially a sinner who had a household, but
{359}
then it adds "they spoke to him the word of the Lord", and the word of the Lord included what I have read, it included that men were to believe and to be baptised; and so the scripture says that the jailer was baptised, he and all his. It is quite obvious that he would not have suggested baptism as left to himself, but he learned from the apostle the significance of it, and he acted on it, and so it says he was baptised and all his straightway; that is to say, the word of the Lord spoken to him by the apostle conveyed to him the necessity of baptism, it conveyed to him the necessity of a definite acceptance, in a public way, of the death of Christ, and he acted upon it.
Now what I have said is in keeping with God's ways from the beginning, and wherever faith existed in man, death was accepted, and no one can come into salvation unless he accepts death -- unless he accepts it first as the penalty from God on account of sin, and secondly in the death of Christ as that which God recognises as meeting the penalty which lay upon him. So you find that the first believer in Scripture -- the first taken account of as a believer -- is Abel. I have no doubt that Adam believed, but Scripture begins with Abel as heading the list of faith, and it says his faith was evidenced in offering to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain. He brought a sacrifice which involved the recognition that death lay upon himself, and I would appeal to every one here at this time as to whether you have accepted death, whether you have realised that a direct penalty from God lies upon you, as it says, "In the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die" (@Genesis 2: 17). That was the penalty, and the first believer in Scripture accepted that, he said virtually, 'If I have to say to God I must accept that death is upon me and, in accepting that, I bring a sacrifice, I bring a creature that never sinned', and we see
{360}
God accepted it, and that he was accepted. He was the first on that line; his death was not that of penalty, it was that of martyrdom, he was honoured; nor will the death of a believer be a penalty, for the penalty, beloved friends, has been executed for the believer. So that whilst Abel was the first to die a literal death, he did not suffer death as a penalty from God, he suffered it as a martyr; he stood for the testimony of God, he stood for the testimony as it was then, and acted upon it, and he died on that line. His was a wonderful death, his blood cried to God from the ground; it was precious, it was the blood, beloved friends, of a believer, one who had been accepted through an offering, through a sacrifice. He had accepted death and right down in the history of faith, you find that wherever faith existed, it was marked by the acceptance of death.
Now you come to Seth; he was to take Abel's place; he was to be "instead of Abel". What you find in him is that when his son is born he calls his name "Enosh", meaning that the child was born to die; Enosh means man as *mortal*. What light there is in that for parents! Seth is the first parent who furnished light as to one's children; the first ray of light comes to the household through the farther of Enosh; he recognised that the child was born to die, so he called his name Enosh; in that name there was light, and so men then began to call on the name of the Lord. There was the acceptance of death, and right down the line of Enosh the Holy Spirit justifies Seth in so naming his son by telling us formally that each one of them died; not only Enosh, but Enosh's sons right down to the sixth generation from Adam died, the Holy Spirit thus confirming Seth's acceptance of death. No matter however long a man might have lived, eventually he died. We thus see how Scripture emphasises what I am speaking of in those who had faith.
{361}
When you come to Noah, he accepts it and rose to it, for he built an ark for the saving of his house; he raised no questions with God, he quarrelled not with the divine sentence, nor with the fact that death was about to be poured out on the world, that the world was to be engulfed in it. Noah accepted it. Have you, beloved friends, accepted the judgment of God? There is a present penalty resting upon every child of Adam, and that penalty cannot be lifted save through the death of Christ; there is also impending judgment that cannot be averted save through the death of Jesus. Have you as yet accepted this penalty? Noah raised no question. The testimony is he prepared an ark for the saving of his house; he accepted the word of God, and he prepared the ark and he went into the ark; such was his submission to the judgment of God, and to the word of God; he entered the ark and he went through the judgment. And so, as I said, we have it right down the line.
Israel accepted death in Egypt; they ate the roast lamb, they were sheltered from judgment, from the destroying angel; the paschal lamb was slain, and its blood sprinkled on the doorpost and lintel. The house was immune, whilst death was all around, but in all the houses of Israel there was a definite acceptance of death. Then we read, "By faith they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land; of which the Egyptians having made trial were swallowed up" (@Hebrews 11: 29), and as death was definitely accepted as the principle of faith, Moses and the children of Israel sang. It is the one act on the part of Israel that is said to be an act of faith; God, as it were, signalising that so that we might profit by it. The Egyptians were drowned; they did not accept death, but Israel entered the sea, they trod the bottom of the sea, according to the word of God, and reached the shore on the other side. God said, Speak to the people
{362}
that they go forward, and they went forward and they reached the other shore; there was the definite acceptance of death and hence the Holy Spirit tells us, "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song" (@Exodus 15: 1). That supports what I have remarked, that the secret of the little enjoyment of salvation that there is among the people of God, and the little consequent joy is due to the non-acceptance of death. You may shelter in your house, but then the whole area outside in which you are is under the judgment of God, under death, whereas when you cross over the Red Sea you are not only immune, but the whole area is; you have left behind the area to which death applies, to which judgment applies, and it says they then sang. How often have you sung, and joined with Christ in that song of triumph? There is very little real singing amongst the people of God in the sense of known triumph, of known salvation and of consequent known deliverance. Moses and the children of Israel sang this song: "I will sing unto Jehovah, for he is highly exalted" (verse 1). How much of that singing do we know, dear brethren? It is the portion of the christian to sing, and so Israel sang. When? When death was accepted; when it was definitely accepted by them, then they sang.
Well now, I could furnish other illustrations, from the Old Testament, but I want to dwell on the New Testament for a moment, so that you may see how in the early days believers accepted death in accord with what the Lord enjoins here. Peter is the first preacher of the gospel after Christ went to heaven, and he answers the question asked similar to that which the jailer asked; he had been telling his hearers, in language which the Holy Spirit has recorded, that God had raised Jesus and that He was exalted to His right hand, and that God had made Him both Lord and Christ; and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit He had
{363}
shed forth this which they now saw and heard. His hearers said to him, "What shall we do, brethren?" Is there one here tonight who asks such a question as that? Has the gospel, as presented to you -- that God raised Christ from the dead and made Him Lord and Christ in heaven -- raised this question with you? Do you ask what you are to do? Do you say, 'I would like to have part in that'? Well, we are here tonight that you should have part in it. We know something of it, we know that the Person of the Holy Spirit is really here, that the Holy Spirit is not some theoretical idea, we know that He is a living Person here on earth, and we would love to have you share in the Spirit, and in the joys which the Spirit brings -- the knowledge of forgiveness, the knowledge of salvation, and the joy of salvation. And then if you ask what you are to do I answer you in these words -- Peter's words: "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 2: 38). I call attention particularly to the use of baptism, how Peter brings it in, because it was of moment that his hearers should accept the death of Christ, not merely to believe in Messiah come in flesh, but to believe that He had died; as Paul says, "Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures" (@1 Corinthians 15: 3, 4). This death, this burial, this resurrection of Christ were to be accepted. So Peter says here, "Repent, and be baptised", answering to the Lord's command, for whilst baptism is a privilege, it is also a command it reduces you, it takes you out of the world. It is imperative that a believer should be baptised, not only as a mere outward form, but as a definite acceptance of the death of Christ. We find that those who heard and received Peter's word were baptised.
You see them there on that day in Jerusalem
{364}
what a day it was! How many questions arise in one's mind as to detail! Where did they get the water? Who administered the baptism? How many did Peter baptise? What formula did he use! All these enquiries are quite pertinent, but not answered in Scripture, they are unanswered in Scripture; we can well understand what the answers would be, but picture to yourself in that city three thousand persons baptised; it was not done in a corner, it was a public matter. These three thousand converts were believers in Christ, they accepted Him as their Messiah, but they accepted His death, and that is the point; it was a very real thing with them because the rest of the population in Jerusalem was against them. The hostility soon arose against them, but nevertheless they were baptised. The Holy Spirit tells us that one thing; He emphasises that those who received Peter's word were baptised. Have we all been baptised? and, as baptised, have we accepted it as the death of Christ? It *is* the death of Christ, it is no less than this. "The like figure", Peter says in speaking of it; there is the outward form, but there is reality in it, it is the death of Christ accepted for salvation, and so it says, "there were added in that day about three thousand souls" (verse 41). They were added; it does not say who added them, but they were added as baptised to what was already there. They took their places publicly in the presence of bitter opposition as followers of Jesus; they were baptised and they came into salvation, hence the Spirit of God goes on to say that they persevered in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and prayers. There was the christian company; they were brought into the sphere of salvation where the Holy Spirit was, where the authority of Christ was, where fellowship was, where prayers were made, and they were filled with joy praising
{365}
God. After this beautiful picture presented by the Spirit of God of the baptised ones, we read, "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved".
It was a day of salvation in Jerusalem, and these people were saved, they were obviously saved, saved publicly, they were free from the world, they were free from death as a penalty, they were living, they were in liberty, and in the enjoyment of salvation. What do you know about all this? The Holy Spirit gives us the thing as it was in the beginning on the day of Pentecost, and we are told what God brought about, and what those came into who accepted death. Throughout the Acts you find that where the gospel is received as in the case of the eunuch, death is accepted. The light of the gospel came into his soul through Philip's preaching, he desired to be baptised, he accepted death, and he went on his way rejoicing.
What a delightful spectacle to heaven these two men presented in the desert as they went down both into the water! Philip knew what baptism meant, that it meant the death of Christ, that it symbolised that. He and the eunuch went down together into the water; the eunuch wished to accept the thing, he wished to be known as a public accepter of the death of Christ. What I am speaking of is of the greatest possible value if accepted practically; a public acceptance of the death of Christ, a definite acceptance before God of it, means deliverance of soul. The eunuch went on his way rejoicing, and it is ever so -- there is joy in the soul as it is accepted.
I want now to show in Jeremiah that there were those who did not accept it. The prophet is told by the Lord to buy a linen girdle. "Thus said Jehovah unto me: Go and buy thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins; but dip it not in water", and Jeremiah got a girdle according, to the word of Jehovah and put it on his loins. Then the word of
{366}
Jehovah came to him a second time, saying, "Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock". But Jehovah had said, "dip it not in water;" it was specified at the outset that the girdle was not to be dipped in water, it was not to symbolise persons who accepted the death of Christ, it was to symbolise persons who had *not* accepted the death of Christ; it was to symbolise persons who were in outward nearness to God by whatever means or ceremony, who had not accepted death, of whom there are, alas! millions at the present time. It may be there are some here numbered amongst us, who have been brought up in a christian family, brought up in the light of the gospel; it may be you have been baptised as a child, and brought into outward relations with God as born of christian parents, and Scripture regards you as holy, as being in outward relations with God. There may be some near and some perhaps more distant, but in this case so near as to be symbolised as a girdle on a man's loins.
Think of that! Who is there here in a like case? You attend the meetings, it may be, you have the reputation of being a christian, and not only that, but you are specially connected with God and with Christ, and with the saints -- you are in outward nearness to God and have come into the benefits of that, for no one can be near to God with His people without being benefited in some sense, and so this girdle refers to you. But you have never been dipped in water, you have never accepted the death of Christ, you have been near-by. The prophet has to take a long journey to convey this thought of God to your soul; he was told to rise and go to Euphrates. You may think lightly of it, but God would send the archangel Michael from heaven to earth to enlighten your soul. What a God!
If you repent, there is joy in the presence of the
{367}
angels of God over you. Such is God, such is God's interest! And so here Jeremiah, who had much to do and much to suffer -- he is the weeping prophet -- is obliged to take a journey that would be long even by train today -- from Jerusalem to the Euphrates. How he did it I do not know; whether he walked it or went by camel I do not know; it is one of the many things that are unwritten, but he went. He had got the girdle and had put it on him, and then went and hid it in the rock, according to the word of Jehovah, all in order that you might be enlightened, that you might know what God thinks about you as in outward relation to Him without in reality belonging to it, without having accepted the death of Jesus for yourself. Think of Jeremiah wending his way across those deserts and rivers to reach the Euphrates, his one thought being to carry out the will of God! He was a servant of God and all the servants of God are yours. I mean, beloved friends, Jeremiah suffered for this -- for the light of God to come to us, for he is but a symbol of Jesus who came all the distance, not from Jerusalem to the Euphrates, but from heaven to earth. He came that way, He came by the way of the manger, by the way of Herod's judgment hall and by the way of Calvary. He came that way to bring the thoughts of God to us here, to bring the love of God to our hearts, to impress us with the fact that God cares for us and would have us. So this remarkable symbol is to convey to you tonight the mind of God about you -- that you have been content to be in outward relationship with Him without accepting the death of Christ for yourself, without judging yourself, without confessing your sins, without repenting. What are you? You say I am cultured, I can play and sing, I can earn my living. What does Scripture say? You are "good for nothing". The girdle when taken out of the hole of the rock was marred, it was good for nothing; in the sight of
{368}
God, you are good for nothing, your very position in relation to Him is but darkness, you are discrediting the truth, you are discrediting the gospel, you are discrediting your parents who believe in Jesus, you are discrediting the whole profession of christianity, you are good for nothing, you are of no value to God. I am not denying, as men say, that you may be a good father, mother, daughter, brother, sister or servant, but morally you are good for nothing in the sight of God. The question is, what are you for God? What use can God make of you? Men may make much of you, but what use can God make of you? Nothing, nothing -- it is very solemn. "For as a girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear". You see that was the divine intent, and that is the divine intent as to you, that you should be near to God, that you should be to Him for a people, and for a praise, and for a glory. How great are the divine thoughts! And, let me say to christians, these divine thoughts apply to every one of us -- we are to be to God for a people *now*, for a praise and for a glory.
But I am speaking more to those who are outwardly with us, who are in the same outward nearness to God and have not been dipped in water. Jehovah says, "dip it not in water". I have said enough about water to show you what it means here; it means the death of Christ, and one must accept it in one's soul. In being baptised I accept definitely that I have died with Christ. I have accepted His death as my own; the penalty no longer refers to me, it has been borne by Him, He has been delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification. "Therefore", as we read, "having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus
{369}
Christ" (@Romans 5: 1). We have accepted death -- His death as our death, His resurrection as ours -- as a testimony on God's behalf that our sins have been disposed of, that they will never come up again; in other words we have been dipped in water. This girdle does not refer to such, it refers to those who are content to remain in heart away from God whilst enjoying certain privileges and outward nearness to God. I beg of you tonight, in the Lord's name, to attend to the things that matter, and see to it that you have accepted the death of Christ definitely, as Paul says, "he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit" (@Titus 3: 5). There is no other way, there must be the dipping in water, the definite acceptance of death, first as the penalty upon me, and secondly as that which Jesus has endured, so that it never comes to me. When I come to that, then instead of being good for nothing, only to be consigned to eternal judgment, I am good for something, for every believer is taken up by God, with the definite intent to be for a people, for a name, for a praise, and for a glory. That is God's mind for us, and He takes us up for it, but if we refuse to accept the death of Christ we are good for nothing -- very solemn word. May it appeal to those who have not accepted the death of Christ!
{370}
PRIESTHOOD IN ROMANS AND CORINTHIANS
Romans 7: 6, 22 - 25; 8: 1 - 6; 1 Corinthians 14: 37
J.T. I have in mind in suggesting these verses of Scripture that we may consider them in the light of priesthood. We take up the term priesthood from the epistles written to the Jewish believers, and from the types, but we ought to understand what it signifies in our own language, that is, in the language applicable to gentile, believers; and I believe the thing itself which is designated by the word 'priest' is found in all the epistles. It refers to those who have the Spirit; all who have the Spirit of God are priests, and I thought perhaps we might be helped in looking at it in Romans and Corinthians; the first dealing with the individual believer from the outset of his history, his spiritual history; and then the second, in relation to the place he has in the assembly.
Young believers particularly ought to understand that they are priests as having the Spirit, and that the normal experience of the believer from the outset involves what is priestly -- particularly in the Roman epistle, when he, in the process of the early experience in his soul, comes to discern that the law is spiritual.
It will be observed that the speaker in @Romans 7 says he delights in the law of God after the inward man. It is there, I think, the foundation of priesthood is laid, for the priest is concerned with the law. He learns to value the law of God in its spiritual significance in his early experience, and thus becomes qualified to take up the law in the sense in which it is applicable to the assembly. So in the verse in Corinthians the man is tested as to whether he is spiritual by his recognising that the epistle is the commandment of the Lord intended to govern the assembly.
{371}
We are not without law in the sense in which it conveys the mind of God and the will of God, and the will of Christ in the assembly; as it says in @Ezekiel 43: 12, "This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain all its border round about is most holy". It is holy, the priests were to know that; they were to know the law, and to see to its enforcement. "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law" (@Malachi 2: 7). In order that we should be qualified for that, we have to learn in our own souls through experience with God to value His law. "I delight in the law of God according to the inward man;" that is in its spiritual import not in its literal bearing, because it says, "we are clear from the law, having died in that in which we were held, so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter".
Ques. Then have you in mind that the law in Romans has application to the individual, and in Corinthians to the house?
J.T. That is it exactly. The epistle to the Corinthians may be taken to be the law of the house.
Ques. And Romans, the law that should govern the individual. Will you say what is in your mind in regard of the law as applied to us; what is your thought?
J.T. I suppose the principle of law enters into everything, physical and moral. I do not think there is anything ungoverned by law save God Himself.
Ques. Are you going wider in your thought than what we usually speak of as law in the Old Testament?
J.T. Oh, yes, the apostle says to the Romans, you will observe, "I speak to those knowing law;" that is law in the abstract. If a man does not know law, he is defective, viewing him even as a creature of God, apart from faith. There is nothing material or moral that is not governed by law; without that
{372}
principle you could not have the universe as it is, nor could you have any moral system without it.
Rem. All would be disaster without law.
J.T. Quite. So the Roman christians are addressed as "knowing law", and as the apostle takes up the subject of law in chapter 7 he assumes that they knew, not what he was going to speak of, but that they knew law. They knew it in some sense in the abstract, they knew it in principle, and then the chapter shows that the believer goes through an experience in which he discerns the spirituality of God's law. When he says, "the law of God", I apprehend, he means the law given at Sinai; but the law in the first verse is general. Then he deals with what is specific. There are laws in the physical system which cannot be called spiritual, but God's law is spiritual; the believer has to discern that, and in the discovery of that he qualifies as priest. He discerns the spirit of the law, and then he delights in it; he says, "I delight in the law of God according to the inward man". In chapter 8 he has power to fulfil its righteous requirements. The thing you delight in you have power to apply, and chapter 8 shows you have the power to apply it.
Ques. Would you look at the whole book of Leviticus in that connection as applying to the priest, as governing the priest?
J.T. That is how I should understand it. @Leviticus 6 and 7 give the law governing the offerings. The believer in Romans is a qualified offerer, he has something to offer; he has his body, and whatever else he has, to offer to God, and the offering must be governed by the law. So Leviticus teaches me that God is now ready to accept my offering, according to what I am able to bring; it may be only a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons, but as soon as I arrive with my offering the priest is there. Now I am a priest myself; the priestly
{373}
element comes in as soon as I begin to offer. @Leviticus 2, 3 and 4 are instructions for the offerer, not for the priest; of course, the priest comes into it, but the instructions are for the offerer, that is for the believer, who has something to offer to God. @Chapters 6 and 7 are for the priest; they are spoken to Aaron and to his sons, meaning that the laws governing the offerings are specifically given into the hands of the priests.
Rem. In that book also we get very specific instructions for the clean and unclean.
J.T. That is a very important part of it. The cleansing of the leper was mainly in the hands of the priest; so we can see how the believer as still in Romans is intended to be an offerer, but as an offerer he has to know the law, and to be a priest himself, because he is the one who is to offer; there is no intermediary as in the Old Testament. The man that comes with the offering is the one to offer it; he is a priest himself.
Ques. Have you in mind to show the difference between the one who delights in the law of God, and the one who does not? What brings it about?
J.T. Deliverance. He delights in the law of God; he arrives at it by the exercise indicated in this chapter. The law of God is spiritual, but he has no power to carry it out. There is that in him which hinders him in carrying it out -- another law in his members, warring in opposition to the law of his mind. You see how much law is before his mind. Then he cries out, "who shall deliver me out of this body of death?" that is to say, from what hinders him from doing what he delights in, and the answer is, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord". He begins his liberty in giving thanks to God, which in itself is priestly. It is a priestly act to give thanks to God. I mention these details because young people are so apt to put these things past them,
{374}
as though they belonged to the elder brethren only, but they do not. You delight in the law of God, and even in giving thanks for your deliverance, you are already officiating as a priest. If you delight in the law of God you look for that principle wherever it is established. In 1 Corinthians you delight in its further development, especially in its application to the assembly.
Ques. Will you say what is involved in the law of God?
J.T. The Lord, I think, in His answer to the enquirer in the gospels puts the thing in a concise form, which should appeal to every believer. "Which is the first commandment of all?" The Lord, citing from Deuteronomy, says, "thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine understanding, and with all thy strength" (@Mark 12: 28 - 31). That should appeal to every believer, because @Romans 8 shows that the Holy Spirit in us makes us lovers of God, and lovers of God with all our hearts. "And the second like it is this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself". Matthew adds, "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets", that is to say, the Old Testament hangs on those two commandments.
Ques. What is in your mind in saying that?
J.T. It shows how important the Old Testament is, if it hangs on those two commandments. We see what is God's requirement, God's righteous requirement -- a most reasonable requirement -- the love of our hearts: surely that is reasonable.
Ques. Would the "law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" be on the line of response?
J.T. That is chapter 8, which really goes further; it leads on to the righteous fulfilment of the law, but it includes the other, as the greater includes the less.
Ques. Speaking again on love to God and love to one's neighbour, would you say that those two lines
{375}
are suggested in the holy priesthood and in the royal priesthood? What goes up to God, and what comes out to men.
J.T. That is very good indeed. The royal priesthood is that you show forth the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.
Ques. I was struck by the fact that the greater part of the book of Malachi is addressed to the priest; would that come in in connection with your thought?
J.T. It is very suggestive that the priesthood should be so emphasised in the last book of the Old Testament. "And now, ye priests, this commandment is for you" (@Malachi 2: 1). The covenant made with Levi is called attention to, a covenant of life and peace, which is the exact expression you get in @Romans 8, that is "life and peace", showing that Romans really brings in the priest.
Ques. Does the gospel of Luke in its teaching tend to bring about what you have before you?
J.T. It does; it sets out the priesthood as it came out in Christ here.
Rem. I was thinking of the word of Zacharias in @Luke 1: 74, "That, saved out of the hand of our enemies, we should serve him without fear in piety and righteousness before him all our days". Is there not a priestly thought in that?
J.T. That is excellent. It is the object in view.
Rem. I thought the whole gospel worked that out in result, so you have a priestly company in the last chapter brought into view, and praising God in the temple.
J.T. Yes; and Romans shows how we are brought into that. I think the gospel of Luke is to set out the gospel as we speak of it. Romans shows how the believer begins, how he comes experimentally to this point; he delights in the law of God. I doubt if any of us can take part in the assembly unless that
{376}
root principle be there. As the law of God is set out in the Old Testament in its spiritual significance, so the commandment of the Lord governs the assembly in Corinthians. As a priest, the believer's first great concern is that it should be applied.
Ques. Is that why obedience is enforced in Romans?
J.T. I think it is. The gospel is "for obedience of faith among all the nations" (@Romans 1: 5), and again it says, "ye ... have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed" (@Romans 6: 17). There is thus a remarkable correspondence with the features of the priest as seen in Malachi: "My covenant with him was of life and peace, and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and trembled before my name" (@Malachi 2: 5). That ought not to be beyond the youngest believer here, because if these things do not characterise us, our christianity is doubtful. It goes on to say, "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity. For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts" (verses 6, 7). I think you will see that Romans, the truth of which is intended to develop every one of us as believers, corresponds with these features, with this description of Levi in Malachi.
Ques. In @Romans 5 we get the covenant, do we not? God corn mends His love towards us.
J.T. Yes, quite. In chapter 8 it is confirmed in the Spirit. Chapter 5 is the unfolding from God's side; in chapter 8 it is confirmed in you; you have the Spirit, therefore you love God.
Ques. Referring to Levi's history, when God honoured him, was it not in connection with the golden calf?
{377}
J.T. Yes, when he rallied to Moses; he was on the Lord's side.
Ques. Would that show what governed him?
J.T. Quite. He was considering for God: "Who said to his father and to his mother, I see him not, And he acknowledged not his brethren, And knew not his own children" (@Deuteronomy 33: 9). There was the disallowance of natural claims. In any locality where a family is large, and natural links existing, it is most important that every one of us should be able to say to his father and mother, "I see him not". You begin to take the sword against your brother. That is what Levi did; every one used the sword against his brother. You must not consider natural feelings and affections when it is a question of what is due to God.
Rem. Then the thoughts of God become a law to me. I thought it showed they govern and become a law tome. It does not mean I am in bondage, but merely held in response.
Ques. Would you say how that delight is brought about?
J.T. I think it is the working out of the divine nature. The Lord Jesus sets it out perfectly when He says, "thy law is within my heart". He so regarded it that He put it in His heart; He magnified it and made it honourable. He was like the ark in the tabernacle, the law was in His heart, the whole law; so whenever a question was raised as to it, He brought it out. If you have it in your heart, you know what to say about it.
Rem. So this individual setting is very important to start with.
J.T. You see how it brings you into correspondence with Christ. You begin at the rock bottom. The Lord had it in His heart, and when questioned about it, He brought out the answer immediately. He put it into a small compass, the first and great
{378}
commandment is, "thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart", etc. Now you are brought into correspondence with the ark in this chapter, because you are like the Lord in that sense: He delighted in the law, all the law. We thus qualify as boards of the tabernacle on the one hand, and as priests on the other.
Rem. With regard to the distress in @Romans 7, is it because I am not able to carry out the thing I delight in?
J.T. But you have power to carry it out, as you see in the next chapter. What satisfaction there is in that, "that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit". The filling out of the nature in me is love. If I have it in my heart, the thing that comes out is love.
Ques. Would you say it is indicated in that way when He speaks at the beginning, "unto thousands of them that love me"?
J.T. Just so. I was thinking of young believers getting the thing right. We learn to respect the law that governs the assembly, because we are confronted with law at every step of the way. In the next chapter we have another law, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus;" note that. I have already settled one matter of law, that is the law of God, what He requires of me; but then there is the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus: that is not a question of code or requirement, but a principle, something that governs me as a principle, and in its effect it delivers me from the law of sin and death.
Ques. What did the apostle mean when he said, "So then I *myself* with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law"? That is sometimes a difficulty.
J.T. I think the inward man and the mind coalesce there. He has arrived by the process of
{379}
analysis to distinguish between the inward man and the flesh. In @2 Corinthians 4 it is the inward and the outward man. It is a great matter to arrive at that result by subjective analysis, and to see how God brought on that process of analysis by a perfect Object, and thus you arrive at a definite point where you have located the inward man, and know that he is absolutely for God. That shows God has been there, and has effected something in me. I have arrived at the point where that is located; that the nature that delights in the law of God is myself. The other I disown -- the sin that dwells in me; the flesh will never do anything but serve sin's law, and I disown it. Now I have arrived at myself: I identify myself with what God has effected in me, and I delight in the law of God.
Ques. Do you not think it is a great moment in the history of every soul when we arrive at that intelligence?
J.T. The next thing is my mind; the power I have got is in my mind. Even with an unconverted man, the mind is powerful; but now being a subject of the spiritual work of God, my power is in my mind; but then I need my hands, my body, because the fulfilment of it works out in my body.
Ques. Does not the apostle speak of the working of it out in chapter 12?
J.T. That involves the Spirit, "that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (@Romans 12: 2). The renewing of your mind involves the Spirit. But here it is in the mind, thus the Deliverer is before your soul. Then there is complete transference -- I am in Christ Jesus. You are set in another Man. "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death". The position is adopted. Then you have the explanation of it, "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent His
{380}
own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh". Having sent *His own Son* -- the deliverance is complete.
Ques. Would you mind saying a word on @Numbers 25 in connection with Phinehas and the everlasting priesthood promised him in connection with what he did as to Baal-Peor?
J.T. That is the carrying forward of what Levi did as recorded in @Exodus 32. There he was marked by taking sides with God against his brother. Now in Numbers the whole position of Israel is threatened in connection with a corrupting element. One man comes in; it shows how God carries forward a primary idea in one man here, so the everlasting priesthood was given to Phinehas.
Ques. Would you say that the power to distinguish and discern is one of the first characteristics of priesthood?
J.T. That is what this chapter teaches us, you have power to discern. You will find if men are not law-abiding, when it comes to other principles of law, this root principle has not been fostered.
Ques. What is the connection between this and being to Another? Does the new husband come in to support us on this line?
J.T. You arrive at the new husband at the end of the chapter; the Lord becomes your husband. The first part of the chapter is the end to be reached, and the chapter is the process as to how you reach it. If you were to jump the 7th and go from the 6th to the 8th, you would not be a priest in a practical sense.
Ques. What is the power to discover that? Would it be by faith?
J.T. Faith is there; it is the working out of new birth really.
Rem. You learn to love the law as seeing it set forth in Another, and the power to obey it is as seeing it set forth in Christ.
{381}
J.T. Just so. You can see how the true Aaron comes into the soul as you see the worth of Christ, how He has effected your deliverance, how He was raised from the dead, first by the Spirit of holiness, and then by the glory of the Father. The Lord thus comes into your soul, then He is your Deliverer.
Ques. Do you suggest that you have the true Aaron in Christ who "was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father"?
J.T. Quite. First He is declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead. That is how priesthood was established; it was established indisputably in the priest by resurrection. Aaron's staff budded, blossomed and bore almonds overnight.
Rem. "Raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father", gives us the thought of the true Aaron.
J.T. I think the two things go together: first, He is declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness by resurrection of the dead. That is what He is inherently; the staff of Aaron had life in it. Inherent life was in the Son of God. Then there is the Father's delight in Him, He is raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. I think Romans brings out Aaron, and brings out the priests, and those who thus go through Romans are fitted for Corinthians, because they have learnt law, and they have fulfilled its righteous obligations in themselves. Now, when you come to Corinthians, it is the law applied not only to myself but to the saints, to the assembly; because the commandments of the Lord in 1 Corinthians are not for the individual exactly, but set forth the principles of truth which are to govern the company. If I have learnt to carry out the law in its righteous requirements in myself in the way of love, then I shall be qualified to take part in the assembly.
{382}
Ques. Would you say the thought of priesthood is connected with the house?
J.T. It is in Peter. Do you mean "a spiritual house, a holy priesthood"?
Rem. Yes, it is connected with that aspect of the assembly, not only when the saints are convened, but it is something you can take up at all times.
J.T. I am thinking rather of local government and order. "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment". As soon as he does that, he shows himself to be a priest. These things must be maintained. As soon as a young believer sees that, he sees that these things must not be left in the hands of two or three old brothers.
Rem. Deliverance has that in view.
J.T. Certainly, that I should function as a priest. The word is to Aaron and to his sons -- to all the sons. Romans teaches me that I am a qualified priest. Other considerations come in when it comes to the government of the house -- eldership comes in then; there must be maturity, but every one is a priest. There are the commandments of the Lord to govern the assembly. I am prepared for this. There are two brothers at issue one with the other; who is to settle this matter? He who is least esteemed in the assembly; so you do not rule out anyone. The priests are all responsible.
Ques. Have you any thought as to why he says, "a prophet or spiritual"?
J.T. I think it is an allusion to their great wish to be distinguished by gift. They had written to him about spiritual manifestations, but he gives them a test as to how they would recognise a prophet. In their letter they made enquiry about many things, but they did not make enquiry about the root difficulty at Corinth, they left that out.
{383}
Rem. Things are maintained for God by priestly conditions.
Ques. What was the root difficulty?
J.T. I think I can read it to you, "Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion" (@1 Corinthians 1: 10). That was the root difficulty: "For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, ... that there are strifes among you" (verse 11); there were parties and rivals, rival teachers and leaders. They never said a word about that to him, and that is the *first* thing he exhorts them about.
Ques. Would you say that the same mind in the Corinthians would be arrived at by each one passing through what you have been suggesting in Romans?
J.T. I think where you love your neighbour as yourself there would be no rivalry. The Lord put the law in His heart. Paul says it is spiritual, and he delighted in it; it was something very important in his mind, and the fulfilment of it must mean no rivalry among the saints. There was serious sin at Corinth, which could be seen, and dealt with, but there was something working under the surface; there were divisions among them.
Ques. They turned to the apostle Paul; how would you suggest a thing like that is to be met today? Chloe turned to the apostle.
J.T. You would turn to the Lord; Paul as an apostle represented the Lord. The house of Chloe must have been a priestly house. If you want to find out the real state of things in any locality, find the spiritual person there; it might be a sister. Sisters have better instincts, they are safer. It does not say whether it was a sister or brother -- someone related to Chloe.
Rem. He exhorts by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
{384}
J.T. It was very serious.
Ques. How would you apply today the principle in @Deuteronomy 17: 8? If a matter of controversy and spiritual difficulty arose, they were to go to the place that Jehovah would choose, and come to the priests. Would that have any bearing on this which was found at Corinth? How would you carry out the thought of going to the priests?
J.T. Get the assembly together. The assembly today answers to the idea of the priesthood in that chapter in Deuteronomy. We have to make allowance not only for believers forming the local assembly, but for their spirituality too. "Ye who are spiritual;" you would have respect for their judgment. Thus going to the priests would answer to getting the assembly together to put the matter before them. It must not be put into the hands of a group, a few, to manage things, for that would be the denial of the truth of priesthood as belonging to every believer.
Ques. Are you speaking now of something specific, or the ordinary care of the meeting?
J.T. The ordinary care of the meeting.
Rem. There should be no leaving it in the hands of a few.
J.T. No, certainly not.
Rem. So at the care meeting you would expect to see the youngest priest set on that line.
J.T. You would not expect sisters to be at an enquiry meeting, but before anything is done or ratified, you must have all, because that is the point of being a priest. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus brings you into the priestly family, and then you are formed in it in the mind of the Spirit, which is life and peace. You are now morally great enough to handle matters according to God. You are not a babbler or tale-teller, you are restful. Then you see how a priest was marked: "The law of truth was in his mouth". Is there anything more
{385}
important in local matters than the law of truth?
Rem. That is, if some decision is given that is not according to the law, not according to divine principles, you would question whether those who gave it had a right to speak as priests.
J.T. Yes, you would. Everything has to be tested by law, but it is remarkable how the mind of God works out among the priests where the brethren are subject; but where there are conditions such as there were at Corinth, which the house of Chloe discerned, then there is room for Satan: so the root difficulty at Corinth was division -- parties following certain leaders.
Ques. Was there not something behind that? "Are ye not carnal, and walk as men"?
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. There would be no division if there were not a carnal state.
J.T. We were saying elsewhere that it is most noticeable, that where local difficulties arise, the spirit of lying is sure to appear. It is Satan engendering the spirit of lying, and things become distorted, as anyone feels who loves the law of truth. You may say true things, and yet leave *wrong impressions*.
Rem. In @John 14: 16, where for the first time the Lord speaks of the Comforter, He speaks of Him as the Spirit of truth.
Ques. Does not the apostle bring in the truth of the cross as the antidote to division?
J.T. He really brings in that as the basis of what he would develop. What were these local leaders doing? Were they suffering? Were they accepting the shame of the cross? "I think", he says, "that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death".
Ques. Would you think it is encouraging that recovery was brought about by the priestly activity of one house?
{386}
J.T. It *is* encouraging.
Ques. "The things that I write to you". Is the apostle referring to all the instructions he gives in the first epistle?
J.T. I think so.
Rem. All the principles laid down there would really be the law of the house.
J.T. So if one is spiritual he holds to that; he makes it his first concern, as in Ezekiel.
Ques. Would the great concern of the priest be what those laws were?
J.T. If he has to administer them, he must know them.
Ques. Would it fit in with Malachi 4: 4, "Remember the law of Moses my servant"?
J.T. Yes. To know the law of Moses was the priestly responsibility.
Ques. Do you think we often fail on priestly lines because we are not careful as to the law? You were saying t at we are boards, involving righteousness and holiness.
J.T. Just so. You see with Levi, how "the law of truth" was there; unrighteousness was not in him. The priests were to be clothed with righteousness; but I think it commends itself to you that the young believer should see to it that the great fundamental principle of priesthood is there -- that he delights in the law of God. So that when he comes into a more extended view in connection with the house of God, divine principles are maintained by him.
Rem. I thought it was very encouraging what you said about giving thanks for your deliverance. I thought it would encourage the young to take part.
J.T. I think many of the young put it past them, as being beyond them, whereas they are really exercising priesthood when they pray. I have to take up the wider matters of the assembly. I have to see that I am not one of a party in the assembly,
{387}
that I am not following any particular brother. If I am a partisan, as following any leader, I am fleshly, I have gone back to the flesh, for this marks the men in the world.
Rem. So if you are to administer those laws your great concern would be that you are according to them yourself.
J.T. Yes, I am maintaining them. The first concern of the priest is to minister the law, to be the exponent of the law. You hear young people say of others, *They* are doing this and that; but what are *you* doing? Are *you* seeking to maintain what is of God? "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me" (@John 14: 21).
Rem. There is great encouragement to take up these commandments. In @Deuteronomy 33: 12, after what is said of Levi, we get, "The beloved of Jehovah, -- he shall dwell in safety by him", and then all the wealth of Joseph comes in following upon it.
J.T. That is very good indeed.
Rem. The Lord would give a spiritual sense of support and love to that one.
J.T. Romans lays the basis of everything, and it is remarkable how it bears on what is collective as we see in @Romans 12: 5, "we, being many, are one body in Christ". You present your body to God a living sacrifice, others do the same; there is thus a basis for the "one body in Christ". 1 Corinthians is the law governing that body, governing all those units, and every one in it is responsible.
Ques. Does @1 Corinthians 13 give the power for all these things?
J.T. Yes, it does; so I have its fulfilment, that is, the filling out. You have it in your heart, and then the thing is filled out.
Ques. What about the royal priesthood?
J.T. That is what we are manward; we are the holy priesthood Godward, in offering to God. I
{388}
think the royal priesthood is what we are towards men to show forth the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvellous light; so that one sees in this world men like God, possessed of divine knowledge, and grace, and mercy towards men.
Ques. Is that more what we are?
J.T. What we should be: we are set up that way.
{389}
LEARNING IN THE DIVINE SCHOOL
Matthew 14: 22 - 32; 16: 13 - 23; 17: 1 - 5, 24 - 27; 18: 21, 22
I wish to speak this evening on educational lines, and I have selected these passages because they present to us incidents in Peter's education, so that he should be qualified to have part in the assembly, and in the administration of the kingdom of the heavens. These incidents are recorded in regard of Peter, because he is a model, or I should say, he represents a pupil believer. Everything in Scripture is written with design and forethought, and, I need not add, in wisdom, so that Peter is distinctly brought forward in this gospel -- in the others also, but particularly in this gospel -- in relation to divine administration. We are all to have part in that administration, and so it is well to go to school, so to speak, so as to qualify by divine education, by divine instruction, and discipline to come out in this administrative service.
Now, as I was remarking, we are put to school, for although one may educate oneself, speaking from an ordinary standpoint, as many do, yet the most effective way is to learn with others. We profit by their mistakes, for alas! as in ordinary, so in spiritual education, we all err; and then, too, we profit by the excellencies of the other pupils or learners. Great ability tends to quicken ability in others who possess it in a much less degree. Those who might not pass, so to speak, are at any rate stimulated by those who do; and so Peter is taken up by the Spirit, and set before us, particularly in this gospel, both in regard of that in which he excelled, and also of that in which he erred or failed.
Now there are scriptures that refer to Peter earlier in the gospel which I did not read, not wishing to
{390}
occupy too much time in reading, but I may refer to them so that you may see how his education began and how it developed. What is to be noted is that Peter, in company with many others of those who served with distinction, was called out of *his business*. We are reminded in this fact of what might not have been observed by some of us, that God takes account of our business occupation. It is not a matter of accident that Peter is first introduced to us in this gospel, not only as a man engaged in the fishing industry, but engaged in it actively (@Matthew 4: 18); as if the Holy Spirit would remind us that God looks for that, He looks for our best in that in which we may be legitimately engaged. And then another thing, mentioned by Luke, is that Peter and those engaged in the industry with him were washing their nets. In Matthew he is seen casting a net into the sea in company with his brother Andrew; that is to say, in his business relations he was evidently co-operating with his brother. If we are to go and qualify later for spiritual administration, we have to learn to co-operate with our brother or brethren. They were casting the net into the sea, the two were doing one thing: they were engaged in their work industriously, they were occupied in it. It was not merely their profession; but they were in the act of casting a net into the sea, for they could never secure a fish, if they did not do that.
Well now, I only just touch on that, and pass on to the next mention we have of Peter, but I would especially call attention to the business; for many assume that the things of God are one thing, as it were, and business another, whereas God would indicate in this way, that the men whom He used, and who were distinguished by intelligence and faithfulness, and by results in His work, were men who were marked by care, by cleanliness, by attention to their secular calling and particularly in the washing;
{391}
for in no relation are we more exposed to defilement than in our business relations.
We come in contact with the world in the transaction of these, and therefore we are peculiarly exposed to what is unclean, and we come under the influence of what is unclean in our spirits, so Luke emphasises that they were washing their nets. So the instrumentalities of our business, the ramifications of our business, must come under the washing, or we shall presently become unclean, and so unfit for divine partnership, and disqualified for divine administration. They are called from this in Luke, called from their most successful business: they left all and followed the Lord.
Now, the next reference to Peter is in regard of his house (@Matthew 8: 14); not that he himself required any particular service from the Lord in the incident recorded, when the Lord entered into his house. It was a relative by marriage, a mother-in-law; and the state of things in his house, which disqualified that house as a place of congeniality for the Lord was that it was a feverish house. We have had already today the thought of the house of Chloe, and that it was from her house -- whatever their relation to the meeting had been -- that the person came, who brought the tidings to Paul as to what existed at Corinth contrary to God. You see, therefore, how a man's relationships, the relatives in the house, may become useful even in the conveyance of important information. The second reference to Peter is in that connection, so that the Lord enters his house, and takes the hand of his mother-in-law, and the fever leaves her; that is to say, Peter had experience of the Lord not only in his business relations, but he had experience of the Lord also in his household relations. We must be right in both, and the Lord would put us right in both, if we are to be effective in the assembly, in the kingdom.
{392}
Now the next thing I will allude to is in @chapter 10: 2, where we see Peter designated the first of the apostles: "The first, Simon, who is called Peter". We see how he is selected sovereignly; the names are given, and it is said, "first, Simon". At this point in our histories we are reminded of divine selection, and one may then become the occasion of rivalry. If in my locality, God is pleased in His sovereign ways to put me forward, or to put you forward, to distinguish you, it is a test. I need grace in my business, and in my house, but now if I am signalised in relation to the ministry, and what God has given as distinguishing me locally or generally, I am tested in that. The sequel shows that Peter was equal to the position given him: he was morally qualified for it through divine education. But it is a supreme test to any one of us to be put forward in the sovereignty of God, and distinguished in His service. You will be exposed to rivalry. I need not enlarge on that. He that is first is to be last of all: that is how you get out of it, you will never get out of it otherwise. "If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all", for no one in his senses will quarrel with me if I am serving him. He is not only to be last of all, but servant of all. That is the third point.
I want now to show you in the first passage I read how Peter with the others was amenable to divine influence. If I am first, I am apt to assume that my will must rule, that my judgment must be right, and I have therefore to learn with others how to come under divine constraint. It says, "And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship;" He compelled them. Were they not constrainable they would have missed this experience. Now this, dear brethren, is an important lesson for every one of us in the school of God -- the lesson of being constrainable; for after all you may just err a little, assuming
{393}
that your standpoint is best. Even the great apostle Paul -- what is striking about him in the book of Acts is that he was amenable to advice from his brethren. I do not go into the details; but if you look through the Acts you will see that whilst he would go to Jerusalem and suffer, he was nevertheless amenable to advice. (See @Acts 17: 10, 14, 15; 19: 30). Unless I learn to give up an unbending will, I shall disqualify myself, both for the assembly and for the kingdom. The Lord constrained or compelled His disciples to go into the ship. Peter might have objected and said, Lord, You are not going with us, and I do not wish to go just now; it does not seem advisable; but He compelled them. How shall we get on in assembly matters unless we cultivate the habit of accepting, of bending under sound advice, under heavenly influence? He compelled His disciples, and they entered that boat; it was a boat full of men whose wills had given way to Christ.
What a fine picture that is morally! It is what the assembly is, a number of men and women who are brought into subjection to Christ, who have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching delivered them, who are amenable to divine restraint, to divine correction. That may work out through advice from one and another. We are to be subject one to another in the fear of Christ. I am not always right: it is quite possible I may err a little bit; why not think it over, and see the wisdom of divine compulsion? It is a remarkable picture, a number of men getting into a boat under divine compulsion.
Then the Lord sent away the multitudes, and "went up into the mountain apart to pray". It is those who are subject to Christ that come under the benefits of His intercession. Where should we be without His intercession? He is interceding for us continually, He ever liveth to make intercession for us, but it is intercession for those who are under His
{394}
compulsion, who bow to His will. Well, Peter has reached that point, and now the Lord is walking on the water, and they are all troubled. Peter shines, he exceeds the others, he is making more progress than the average. We read, "the disciples seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition. And they cried out through fear. But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is *I*: be not afraid". But now we see how the excess of Peter's progress shines; that is to say, he is an object lesson for us, he is set up as a pattern for us, he shines above the others. "And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be *thou*, command me to come to thee upon the waters". He is under divine constraint; he says, Lord, I am not going to move without Thy word; he is now to move at the word of Christ. He is a safe man to follow, a man who is ready to move, but ready to move only at the word of Christ. "If it be *thou*, command me to come to thee upon the waters. And he said, Come". The Lord said, "Come". Then it says, "And Peter, having descended from the ship, walked upon the waters to go to Jesus. But seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried, saying, Lord, save me". It is evident, dear brethren, Peter is learning faster than the others.
If I were in the boat by Peter, and saw him go out, and walk on the sea, I would say to myself, Why did I not do that? I am not learning as fast as Peter; and for that reason I am missing the privilege, otherwise why should I not have that great privilege of stepping out at the word of Christ, and walking on the water? So this man that progresses rapidly, as Peter did, has an experience that the others never had; nor shall we have it till we come up to the other. He is at school, but presently you see him sink; he is just a learner, a wonderful pupil, but nevertheless he has not graduated. Remarkable as
{395}
his progress was, yet he began to sink; he was not "perfect", to use language found elsewhere. I think you can see that he sets an example for us in the school of God. There is a point reached where I move at the bidding of Christ, and moving at His bidding, I find myself divinely supported. The fact is miracles are happening every day; if scientists only knew, they are all around them. There are those who are moving at the word of Christ outside the laws of nature. We understand something of the *law* of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, and that is outside the laws of the physical universe.
Now I want to go on to the next passage I read, because I think you will see how Peter is progressing: he is learning to be *spiritual*. It is only when I am subject that I can ever hope to know the realisation of the support of the Lord, and to taste the laws that govern the spiritual universe. In chapter 16 I come to *revelation*, and here again you see how wisely Peter is put forward as a model pupil in the school of God. The Lord says, "Who do ye say that I am?" He questions them *all*. It is the school, and the education is for all in it, and the questioning brings out the intelligence of those who answer. Many will not answer, because they are ashamed to be exposed; but it is better to be exposed than to be ignorant. "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge". Why then not go in for the knowledge that is available? You are at school, wonderful things are being taught; the Lord Himself is the teacher. He puts the question; they were all able to tell what *others* said.
Current religious books tell what people are saying about Christ. I need not say, terrible things are being said about Him at the present time, and we do not want to be in any doubt about Christ; we must be clear about the Person of Christ above all things; we must have our hearts and minds fully
{396}
established as to His deity, as to the truth of His Person -- who He is, so that if I am questioned, my answer will be immediate and definite. Hence Peter says, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God". If there is anything I would urge, it is definiteness in what we say. The better we know a thing, the more definite we can be in speaking of it. In reading Jeremiah one sees how definitely the word of God came out, no 'ifs', no 'I thinks'; hence we want to be definite. When the question is put to Peter his answer is definite, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God".
I cannot enlarge on this, but it is a wonderful subject: I only wanted to call attention to this particular stage in the believer's education; he has arrived at the point of revelation. You say, Are there revelations now? There are no revelations in the ordinary sense of the word, but there is the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, and in a sense that is greater than revelation, greater than spiritual communications, for it involves having the spirit of them; I am in the realm of revelation, as Paul speaks of being caught up into paradise, where there were revelations of the Lord, and where he "heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter" (@2 Corinthians 12: 4). I only allude to that for the principle. At this stage of the believer's education he understands revelation, he is in the realm of revelation; he has the spirit of it. So the Lord says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens". Thus you are outside the realm of flesh and blood, if you are in the realm of revelation, and if you understand what it is to be in that realm, where the Son of man is known to be the Christ, the Son of the living God, it will give character to you in every other relation.
Now I must refer to the incident that follows, which
{397}
is a sad one, as showing that Peter was still learning, that he was not yet perfect. The Lord speaks about suffering, about going to Jerusalem to suffer and to die. Peter says to Him, as it were, 'Pity thyself', spare thyself, do not go that length; he is not equal to the light he has, for he has wonderful light. What God would effect in us as His pupils is regularity of education: not only that I have light, but that I am in accord with the light -- that my whole moral being is in accord with it. That a man who is in the light of the revelation should be saying to the Lord, that He should pity Himself, spare Himself, shows that he is not in accord with it. If he is saying that to the Lord, what would he say to himself? Why, he would say, 'Peter, you cannot undertake that, it involves too much cost, it involves too much suffering, too much deprivation; you must spare yourself, let others do it'. If you let others do it, it will not be done. If you see things are to be done, see to it that *you* do them; the principle of sacrifice comes in with the believer. Have I learnt to sacrifice? The Lord Jesus sets out in the fullest way that He is going to sacrifice; He leads the way, He goes to the limit of sacrifice for the will of God. What comes out in Romans? I yield everything I have. There is the sacrifice of my body. That is what the compassion of God works out in my soul; He has spared nothing. "He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all" (@Romans 8: 32). God went to the full limit of sacrifice: what am I doing? Peter would have dissuaded the Lord from the way of sacrifice, and if he would have dissuaded the Lord from it, what would he have done himself? If the will of God is to be done in this world, it must be on the principle of sacrifice; so the Lord says to him, "Get away behind me, Satan".
You see how serious this is; it might be on a cold night, and you say, 'I will not go to the prayer
{398}
meeting tonight'. Pardon my bringing the thing down to such a limit. Suppose every one in the meeting resolves to stay in, what happens? There is no prayer meeting: the needs of the saints are not presented to God. How serious that is! So in many other connections, it is spare yourself, instead of seeing that sacrifice is the order of the day. You may say that it is a very little thing to stay in: but it is Satan keeping you in; he is acting on your selfishness, on your self-consideration. So the Lord names him here Satan. "Thou art an offence to me". Think of being an offence to the Lord in any action of mine! It might be in a very little thing; but I am an offence to heaven, to Christ, in considering for myself instead of considering for God. "Thy mind is not the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men".
Now the next two references are in chapter 17. Peter is now greatly honoured in being taken up to a high mountain by the Lord with James and John; it was a great opportunity. We have a great deal said about what we speak of as the 'morning meeting;' it is where we enter into privilege. Here are three men selected; I have no doubt they are the ones who had progressed most at school. The Lord takes them up into a high mountain, and it says, He "was transfigured before them".
Now I am tested on the high mountain, in the place of privilege. I have had revelation, and I have shown I am unequal to the light I have had, but the education goes on. Peter is rebuked. We may all thank the Lord for His faithfulness in rebuking the intrusion of the flesh, in giving place to Satan. No doubt Peter profited by the severe rebuke he had had, otherwise the Lord would not have taken him up to the mount; but he is taken up, and he is in presence of the transfiguration on high. The Lord is pleased to accord to us such privileges,
{399}
but how am I in the presence of them? As we are in the presence of the Lord together, we are put to the test as to how we regard Him, whether we can distinguish a divine Person. His face shines as the sun, and His clothing is white as the light, and presently we have Moses and Elijah speaking with Him.
Now, Peter, what about this education you have had? What about the revelation you had the other day? What about that confession you made? Where is it now? "Let us make here three tabernacles: for thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elias". Ah! he had missed it; he will have to learn it all over again. That is how the thing goes: it shows up his conduct in the supreme place of privilege. He has not learnt the lessons of the last few days, he has missed them. "Three tabernacles" -- one for Moses, and one for Elijah, and one for Christ. Did you confess that Moses was the Son of the living God? Was Elijah the Son of the living God? You see how inconsistent he is. As the apostle says, "Each of you says, *I* am of Paul, and *I* of Apollos; and *I* of Cephas and *I* of Christ" (@1 Corinthians 1: 12). "Has Paul been crucified for you?" he says. How utterly illogical we are, placing men on the same footing as God, as the Son of the living God. Now Peter is rebuked by heaven; but nevertheless the rebuke is for his education: he is to remember for ever that no one can be put on the same platform as Christ. You must never, Peter, have it in your mind again, that the Son of God is on the same footing as the others; and so this voice from heaven comes, "*This* is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him".
Well, now, dear brethren, it must be assumed that this lesson would be learnt by Peter, once for all, that he would never again err on this line; and I call attention to this point, because one is conscious
{400}
in oneself how we have to learn the same lesson over and over again; and in the patience of God, it is often taught us. If I do not learn it today, God will teach it to me tomorrow; so the Father's voice from heaven had rebuked Peter by proclaiming that He had found His delight in one Person alone, His beloved Son.
Now Peter is in Capernaum, and someone says, "Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?" The thing is sprung on him suddenly, as we may experience: we may be challenged in this way. I believe if Peter's soul had been full of what he had seen on the mount, of the revelation he had had, he would have said, My Master, my Master, why He is the Son of God. I have had a revelation in regard of Him; I have made a confession myself in regard of Him; I have heard a voice from heaven announcing Him as the Son of God. The Son of God does not pay tribute; He is not an ordinary man. Peter had not learnt these lessons; have we all learnt them? Are we in accord with the light that God has vouchsafed to us? If our hearts are full of the Son of God, if the question is put to us suddenly, we shall not be at a loss to answer. We certainly shall not say anything dishonouring to that Person. So Peter, forgetful of what had been said to him, says, "Yes". His confession to these men made manifest that his soul was not in the truth of the Person of Christ; he did not mean to deny it, but he was not equal to the light he had; it was not in his heart in any power, it was not in his soul. Whilst he did not answer to the test, the Lord says, Peter, you have to learn the lesson again; you have to know who I am, and moreover in learning this third time who I am, you will learn, too, that you also are a son. So it says, the Lord anticipated Peter; He knew what had happened.
Sometimes we dishonour Him, because we answer
{401}
according to what is in our heart. If Christ is in your heart, you will not say anything that would dishonour Him, you will guard His Person. So "when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What dost thou think, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers? Peter says to him, From strangers". He could answer that quickly enough, he knew what the kings of the earth did. That is it; you know what they do, but you do not know what God does. The assembly belongs to God: why should the sons have to pay tribute? The kings of the nations do not exact it from their sons; why should you say that God exacts it from His Son? You have not been learning. How we miss it through not learning what we are taught! So the narrative goes on, I cannot go into it further; but the point was, the sons are free. Take the piece of money, "and give unto them for me and thee". Now you see Peter lifted up in the school of God in his education to the platform of sonship, to the knowledge of the Son of God, whose face shone as the sun. Moses face did not shine as the sun, nor did Elijah's, only the face of Jesus. The infinite goodness of God, rising above the wickedness of this world was expressed in that Person, and Peter now knows it.
Now another point: the kingdom was composed of little children, so at the beginning of chapter 18 the Lord calls a little child unto Him, and sets him in the midst of them; setting forth that we are great enough to be small as we are divinely taught, we are great enough to be little. He called a little child; one would love to be within His call. Whenever troubles arise, the Lord would call, and point out one who is not pretentious.
Just one other thing: Peter did not know grace. The Lord had been wonderfully patient in teaching
{402}
him. Peter says, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times?" He asked the question, but in answering it, he disclosed what his idea of the answer was. Now he has failed again. It is a question of learning. The Lord would say, I never taught you that, you have not got the complete thought; if you are to be here for God it must be until seventy times seven.
The book of the Acts gives us the finished product from the divine school; so in chapter 3 Peter says, "Look on us;" Peter and John are there as the product of the work of God. You want to look at perfection, and if you have not arrived at that, keep on. It is seen in Christ. Peter has some idea of grace, but not a perfect one -- "until seven times". The Lord says in effect, 'I never said that'. "I say not to thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven;" that is really that the grace is to be without a limit. If we are to be in the kingdom, our countenances must be like the sun. His countenance was like the sun, supreme goodness rising above the wickedness of this world. So as like God, you maintain the spirit of grace under all circumstances, and you are never overcome. "Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" (@Romans 12: 21). That is a great triumph; that is where Peter erred at the last point.
I bring before you this thought of divine education, so that we may be exercised to learn our lessons, and thus know how to be in the assembly locally, and to administer in it, and also to be in the kingdom according to God.
