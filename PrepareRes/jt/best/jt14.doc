NOTES OF READINGS ON 2 SAMUEL
CHAPTER 3
J.T. There is a spiritual movement in mind here, David giving the main lead in it. Other elements that may be operative are allowed to show themselves. These elements are led, on the one hand by Abner and on the other by Joab, each leader having himself in mind. It would seem as if from verse 8 of chapter 2 to the end of chapter 4 we have the working out of these adverse elements during a spiritual movement.
Ques. Why is a character like Abner short-lived in contrast to Joab who continued through such a long period with the king?
J.T. I suppose one of the reasons for his continuance is to bring out the weakness in David. David acknowledges his weakness here, "I am this day weak". It is a poor thing to have to acknowledge that the position is beyond him, and this is in a condition where David is nominally supreme. Things are allowed to develop, even in chapter 5. If you link on the narrative with @1 Chronicles 11:6, he opens a further door to Joab to become chief of captains, which was David's own office. A spiritual man in any given spiritual movement may yield to partisan influence and in that way open the door to a condition that is beyond him.
Ques. Did Joab's actions warrant his removal here?
J.T. He was a murderer. It was wrong that a murderer should be allowed to continue. The assembly should never be in such a plight as this; the Lord has furnished us with means of dealing with the most serious matters. This whole book is stamped with this; it runs right through, and is a warning to us not to allow *partisan* feeling even in a small way.
{2}
Ques. Was David's attitude towards Abner commendable?
J.T. It was so far. David had to clear himself of course. It would look as if there might have been collusion in this matter, but the Lord enabled him to clear himself, which is the main thing. "Neither be partaker of other men's sins", @1 Timothy 5:22. The Lord gave him special grace to clear himself; it was understood that David had nothing to do with it. "All Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death". Spiritual men are often obliged to clear themselves of partisan results; partisan results are attributed to spiritual men who have had nothing to do with them, because they are spiritually linked with those in the party.
Rem. David became continually stronger in the main.
J.T. He dealt with them in *principle* but was not able to do so in *fact*. Rem. There was in Acts what is similar to what we get here, the opposition of the Jews and the Gentiles to the ministry of the apostles.
J.T. Quite so. I suppose that is how we should look at the first verse: "the war was long between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David became continually stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker". The war was long because of these partisan conditions. David became continually stronger -- it does not say, 'the house of David'.
Ques. Why is 'the house' left out here?
J.T. Well, it says later, his house was not right with God.
Ques. How do you regard David's reception of Abner?
J.T. He seems to be right so far. It was according to the mind of God that the kingdom should come to David. It says in verse 7 of chapter 2, "And now let
{3}
your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them", @2 Samuel 2:7. This is clearly a gesture to the house of Israel to accept David as king; so that if Abner came, as he did, as a leader of the house of Israel it seems to be in order for David to receive him.
Rem. What Abner did not accomplish, God was accomplishing behind the scenes.
J.T. Obstacles stood in the way. Really it was Abner who was in the way. He could sway the house of Israel either way because he could always make the position weak. Ishbosheth himself was removed so that the way was made clear for David, although it was not at all to the credit of these two. Abner had just a selfish party feeling; he knew all the time that David was to be king; he is condemning himself in what he says to Ishbosheth in verse 9 of chapter 3, "Jehovah has sworn to David"; and to the elders in verse 18, "and now do it, for Jehovah has spoken of David ...". So that he knew exactly the mind of God and he is fighting against it, he is condemning himself.
Ques. Do you think his slaying was governmental?
J.T. I do. It is a warning to us.
Ques. In each one of these men slain, the sword penetrates their lower affections. Was it the exposure of lack of love in the Spirit, a feature seen positively in the saints at Colosse (@Colossians 1:8)?
J.T. Judas¬ death is similar, he fell headlong and all his bowels gushed out. He was wanting in affection. These are remarkable chapters, I think, for the work of God to be seen in spiritual leadership. They show how partisan activities may work within the realm of spiritual leadership. David has to acknowledge he was not strong enough.
Ques. Was the same thing going on at Corinth?
J.T. Exactly, there were several parties there.
{4}
Ques. There seems to be a turn in the testimony today and a remarkable spiritual movement: are we in danger of partisanship and rivalry as seen in Abner and Joab?
J.T. That is what the enemy would seek to bring about. The thing is that there should be *no leadership that is not spiritual*.
Ques. Do these wives of David and the mother of these sons indicate weakness?
J.T. The king would multiply wives. In chapter 5 he continues on that line after he reaches Jerusalem.
Rem. You see it in the stipulation he made with Abner about Saul's daughter, Michal.
J.T. It indicates where his *mind* was, I think; see verse 14. Of course you might work out a type in it, an allusion to the assembly, but it is difficult to make it out. He was making self-gratification more than the kingdom, whereas the kingdom was the great thing with God.
Rem. All the children born in Hebron were sons. Would this be for the testimony?
J.T. That would fit. I think you might say that. We get their mothers in verses 2 to 5. At Jerusalem you get further sons and daughters without their mothers¬ names (chapter 5:13 - 16). The continuance of the testimony is in mind, but on the other hand it is an allusion to a certain *vein of weakness in David*, because the king was enjoined not to multiply wives.
Ques. What about David taking Ahinoam and Abigail to Hebron?
J.T. This seemed to be legitimate and right. Certainly Abigail is a type of the assembly. You can understand that the maternal side must be in line in the kingdom, so that it seems to be in order. He had lost them at Ziklag and now he has them again.
Rem. Some sons did not turn out very well.
J.T. One is a type of the antichrist; chapter 3:3. But there is the continuance of the testimony, and
{5}
the Psalms show what the children are and how they speak with the enemy in the gate. Generally speaking they are a blessing from God, but it is "thy wife", and not 'thy wives' in @Psalm 128. Deuteronomy expressly forbids the king to multiply wives.
Rem. At this time if Abner and Joab were giving a wrong lead David should have given a right one. They were adverse parties.
J.T. Saul was dead and David spoke well of him. He was anointed by the house of Judah, but then these two leaders are operating by themselves. In chapter 2 verse 14 they suggest that the young men should make sport before them. Where is David's power as king in all this?
Rem. There is an attempt by Ishbosheth to check what was evil; it is he who brings out what Abner is doing. Then Abner moves to transfer the kingdom to David.
J.T. It looks as if one element after another brought about this change in Abner's mind with no reference to David. Yet David is not in this evil.
He is outside it in spirit, but he has to acknowledge that he is weak in the thing. It is a remarkable warning to us that spiritual leadership is the only leadership. These two men were not thinking of the king, they were just two independent leaders. You can see how Joab would carry Israel with him on this line; this laid the basis for Absalom's revolt later.
The saving feature is that God gave David such attractiveness that all Israel loved him.
Ques. Did not David enunciate the principle of his kingdom in the first chapter in the song that he taught Judah? Does not the setting seem to be encouraging?
J.T. Yes, certainly the first chapter is magnificent as to the spirit of David, and right up to the end of verse 7 of the second chapter; and then we have these two men operating and making sport and
{6}
sacrificing their followers for sport. Where is David in this? It is significant that David is not mentioned in chapter 3 after verse 7.
Ques. What is your thought as to the length of time that is required for David to be brought into the kingdom? It is not till David has reigned seven and a half years in Hebron that all Israel is brought round to him.
J.T. I think the position at Hebron is intended for that, a stopping point, as much as to say the spiritual condition does not warrant any more. David is held up there, it is a testing time. I think there is some correspondence between that position and what we get in @Exodus 24. Great thoughts of God are opening up there; God says, so to speak, I want you to come up here, Moses, and Aaron and Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel. And then, Moses, you come up into the mountain and I will give you the book of the law, "for *their* instruction". All that would be with Moses above, the others were to stay below without Moses, they were to have Aaron and Hur if any matter arose and they would have to wait for Moses to come down forty days later. Well now, here we have an example set out in David in verse 1, of the kind of man suitable for the kingdom, an example to all Israel. He became stronger and stronger personally, and then we have Hebron. In view of all this these two men are brought to the front instead of David. So with Aaron and Hur, they are to look after the people while Moses is away. But the instruction is with Moses; the divine mind is with Moses. Why should David be hindered? Well, there is a *moral* condition in question and that moral condition is to be worked out before we can have the mind of God.
Rem. Joab would not have waited in Jerusalem for power from on high.
J.T. Certain conditions have to come about. The
{7}
Lord could have gone to heaven at once after He arose just as well as forty days later. It implies that there is a condition that is questionable, that is to he searched out. So in Colosse they were in danger of philosophy and vain deceit; that is to he worked out and judged. All these things are on one line. You have the mind of God opened up, but there is a moral condition of things to he dealt with before we can go on. These elements are at work in Israel here. David is not clear in this matter and these two men are active. In the government of God they come to their end.
Rem. They are not subject men. It would be a warning for us as Christians not to take on things without consulting Christ.
J.T. The point is, What is leadership? Is it Joab or Abner, or is it David? David is weak and the book brings out that he never really recovered the loss sustained here.
Ques. Would you say something as to Abner's end?
J.T. You just feel that God's government took him out of the way. David's attitude seems right under the circumstances. Abner knew that David was the man all along and yet he was insubject, and so he was disqualified.
Rem. He worked for self-advantage, which God will not support.
J.T. Yes. The Amalekite who slew Saul thought he would get a reward. How does this bear on ourselves? What is the divine idea? It is that God will not have mere natural ability. Natural ability may disqualify me. Leadership, if it is not spiritual is worse than nothing. In general David is over against all this. He has the divine idea, but he is missing it because he is not facing this thing in these two men. Applying it to ourselves, it is not enough for us to say that the Holy Spirit is amongst us, because He might be grieved. The point is. What is
{8}
the *effect* of having Him? It is the power that worketh in us. But there might be the taking on of something else as at Colosse. Some there were in danger of taking on something else such as philosophy, appealing to the natural mind, and ceremonialism. The work of God exposes that sort of thing.
Rem. Might that sort of thing become constitutional?
J.T. That is just the word to use, 'constitutional'. Hence the use of the word 'if' in Colossians.
Rem. "See that ... no one ... shall lead you astray", @Colossians 2:8. These two leaders were on that line.
J.T. That is just the point really. Hebron is Colossians and the saints are amenable to being led by that kind of man.
Ques. Is there sometimes a failure to recognise headship?
J.T. Yes, and a partial movement -- not going all the way in putting off the body of the flesh in circumcision. I believe that is the object in the letter to the Colossians, that they might face the evil and go on to the full thought. You do not need men like Joab and Abner, philosophers, they are men of natural ability but they are not spiritual leaders. The whole position is marred because of them, the whole of 2 Samuel is marked by David's weakness. Later Absalom is allowed to carry things. Why was that?
Rem. "There shall arise from among yourselves men", showing what has developed. Really it is the application of the truth of the Colossians, so that we might go the whole way.
J.T. That is the point. Colossians is therefore a critical epistle. It may mean that you have reached the divine end or missed the mark entirely.
Rem. One reason for being so slow to take on the ministry at the present time is that we are marked by philosophy and ceremonialism.
{9}
J.T. We get in @Colossians 1:23, "If indeed ye abide in the faith". It is an "if" of *uncertainty* ; their condition is questionable. "If indeed ye abide", as much as to say, I am doubting you. There is much prayer in this epistle by the apostle himself and also by Epaphras, because the saints were hankering after philosophy; and Paul combated for them so that they might be saved from this danger. The "ifs" of @Colossians 2:20 and chapter 3:1 are not the "ifs" of uncertainty but are hypothetical.
Ques. What is the difference between circumcision and baptism?
J.T. Circumcision deals with the flesh viewed in its *power*. Baptism refers to what is *outside you* ; you reckon yourselves dead indeed to sin. It is what is outside of you, but circumcision is what is *inside* you; the work of the flesh inside. The point is the totality of it. One of the most remarkable things in Scripture is that God sought to slay Moses. Why? Because he was not dealing with the flesh. He might have tried to lead the children of Israel out on fleshly lines -- clericalism -- what is developed in the flesh. Baptism, of course, is the public position, that I am dead to the world. Circumcision is to deal with the flesh, whatever power I may have in the flesh. David thinks he is clearing himself because he is pronouncing these judgments, but why could he not have dealt with Joab? If he had faced it, God would have helped him. Moses is a leader and God appoints him to lead His people and yet He is ready to slay him. God says in effect: I have not changed My mind in connection with the flesh; if it is coming up I will deal with it. Baptism would lose its power in a person who has not got the Spirit. It supposes the Spirit; it is a household matter, "thou and thy house" (@Acts 16:31); a saved man and his house. It is very important to see this in the jailer's case, "thou shalt be saved, thou, and thy house" (@Acts 16:31);
{10}
yourself first as a saved man, and then your house. Whether it is worked out in the Red Sea or the Jordan you get the same principle of baptism. The same thing applies to Jordan -- they went through householdly. Household baptism is proper Christian ground. No man is really qualified to be a father unless he brings his household on to that ground.
Ques. Is your thought that the whole book suffers from this weakness on David's part? This principle had been overlooked by David, "although my house be not so before God", @2 Samuel 23:5. There was not sufficient carrying out of the principle of baptism.
J.T. The weakness here runs right through the book. We shall see it in the last years of David. How can a man's house be right unless he brings in the truth of baptism?
Rem. Ittai and all his men and little ones passed over with David, the little ones could make the journey too.
J.T. That is a figure of baptism. The full thought of household baptism came in with Paul.
CHAPTER 4
J.T. This chapter follows on verse 8 of chapter 2. It contemplates, as we had last week, a transitional state of things. The crisis arising in the history of the testimony contemplated at the beginning of the book implies certain features which existed negatively and positively to be worked out. So that these two leaders, Abner and Joab figuring in this section are both party men. At the end of chapter 3 we have an exposure of Joab's murderous state and how Abner, in connection with that very state, came to his end; he was murdered. This brings out what partyism really is, and how far it will go.
Ques. Have you any thought about the lamentation
{11}
of David for Abner -- is there any suggestion in it of Christ?
J.T. It illustrates what a spiritual man will do. It was an awkward situation, he would make the best of it. David had to clear himself of the stain of guilt of something which took place in his kingdom, and he did what he could to clear himself; but then the book subsequently shows that the evil was there and caused weakness that was never overcome.
Adjustment had to be handed over to Solomon. The lesson would be for us in circumstances like these to face whatever there may be inimical to the testimony; party elements, opposing elements, are to be met and dealt with righteously, otherwise they become an incubus upon us to harass us later.
Ques. What is the meaning of verse 29 of chapter 3: "let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls by the sword, or that lacks bread", (@2 Samuel 3:29)?
J.T. It was just a curse. We have corresponding passages in the New Testament -- a curse put off, as this was, and a curse inflicted immediately or in principle as in Galatians; Paul says: "If anyone announce to you as glad tidings anything besides what ye have received, let him be accursed", @Galatians 1:9. The postponement of the curse in @1 Corinthians 16:22 was not because there was no power, but the dispensation, I suppose, required that it should be put off until the Lord should come. "Anathema Maranatha" is "until the Lord comes", which would be really Solomon taking the thing over.
Rem. It may drag on until Solomon comes to the throne; do you think that the more we realise sonship the more power there will be?
J.T. That is what would be learned, I suppose, in Solomon meeting the thing righteously in this case. He does not deal with the culprits all alike; he fixes retribution according to the crime. Sonship is brought
{12}
forward by the apostle in Galatians, and it is in Galatians that he pronounces the curse at once. It is not put off. Why should the saints be suffering to spare the man?
Ques. Is that why Paul withstood Peter to the face?
J.T. Quite so. He did not defer it or leave it because of Peter's distinction. There is a good deal in this of how things are to be met; God allows things in transitional periods to work out to their own exposure, good or evil. There must be authority. God has never left his people without the element of authority, and power to enforce it. David stands for that here but he is not equal to it, although he shows clearly that he has judged the murderer; but words are not enough, we want more than words.
Ques. Do you think it was because of natural relationship?
J.T. His explanation is that they were too strong for him. They are all his nephews, sons of Zeruiah; why should they be too strong for him? Possibly Joab's underhand influence entered into the matter; he had great power with the army and others.
Ques. How do you view the king doing what pleased the people, is that in his favour or otherwise?
J.T. I think it is to bring out his spiritual qualities. He was always loved by the people and it speaks well for the people that they regarded him. But the book does not let David off at all, it shows that the element of weakness is there, unjudged in the king. It worked out in Absalom and Adonijah later, a most distressing state of things. At times you marvel that it should be so. The teaching for us is *antitypically the history of the assembly as a whole or at any given time, that is, what is right in the main being unable to face what is left over in the way of contrary or opposing elements*. We cannot wait for unity in dealing with evil; we *must* do what is right.
{13}
Ques. The Lord said to Thyatira: "I have against thee that thou permittest that woman Jezebel", @Revelation 2:20. The Lord would hold against the saints that they are responsible for allowing certain things. Why is it addressed to the angel of Thyatira?
J.T. It is for the general body in Thyatira. The angel would be the responsible element, and, of course, we are all responsible. Anyone who takes himself out of that responsibility is not in fellowship. "I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself prophetess, and she teaches and leads astray", @Revelation 2:20. That charge stands out against that church ever since.
Rem. The letter written is to bring about through some person an assembly conscience or a local conscience. The locality should have a conscience as to the state of the saints.
J.T. Each letter would be to arouse the conscience in the whole body. Take Thyatira, "I have against thee"; however few or many were right, all are responsible. That is the thing that has to be faced, whatever the Lord is against.
Rem. Ahab humbled himself and the judgment was postponed.
J.T. I suppose that particular phase of the kingdom is one of the most striking as illustrative of grace, the wonderful patience that God had with Ahab. In type that corresponds with Thyatira: "against thee" would be responsible Ahab, he was responsible for Jezebel. The long patience that God exerted toward Ahab is very striking and shows the patience He has now in the history of the assembly. Jezebel survived Ahab, but God acted wonderfully to Ahab, wicked man that he was! He defeated the Syrians, God put him at the head of the army and gave him victory. He spared the king of the Syrians and God still had patience. He slew Naboth and
{14}
God still had patience when he humbled himself, showing how patient God is with those of us who are responsible in any given phase. In the long run he will exact every cent, every penny. The prophetic word is to bring to bear on the conscience what *may not* have been dealt with.
Ques. How do you regard David's sentiments relative to Abner? Abner was supporting the king for personal reasons.
J.T. Abner was nothing more than a party man at best, but he had more to his credit than Joab had. David, in a magnanimous way, in keeping with his attitude in regard to the death of Saul, refers to Abner as a prince. It is a spiritual man making the most of a bad matter. Sorrowful matters arise and we all have part in them. The spiritual would make the most of a matter in adjustment. There is spiritual adjustment in David's speech so that he could go on with a good conscience in the rule of the kingdom; but then, is the evil really met? or does the sequel not show that it was never met in David's time and that he suffered accordingly?
Rem. There is something to Abner's credit in that he took sides with David in spite of his motives.
J.T. He knew the truth. He knew David was God's choice. A man who knows the truth and is opposing it is in a serious position. The fact that he is opposing it may mean that other considerations hold him back. He knew all the time that David was the divine choice. Possibly God might give a man credit for arriving at a true judgment, but where is he morally when he knows the truth and is not standing by it?
Rem. He might have said, I will take sides with David because I am against Ishbosheth.
J.T. We cannot always be sure as to the underlying history. Every man has some history with God, perhaps something we do not know about.
{15}
We cannot be sure of anything that is not on the surface. Why did David speak so of Abner? There may be something that is not recorded about the man -- I think we ought to take David's judgment about him here. He may have had secret relations with God that David knew of. David might have said, 'Well, he was a true man at bottom'. We sometimes say of one or another, 'His wife hinders him' or 'His natural links keep him back'; and we say it rightly, because the man left by himself would be right; and God is infinitely fair in these things.
Ques. How could Abner be put down in the record as a prince?
J.T. Well, there are two ways of looking at it. There is secret history, known to God and perhaps to himself, but particularly to God, and God is infinitely fair and gives him credit for everything. If influences have swayed him from the course, God takes account of that. Jeroboam's son died because he was good. He is the only one God said there was any good in (@1 Kings 14:13), and he died. He was taken out of the evil. The public history may not vindicate a man, but the Judge of all the earth is right. For instance, Lot is called a righteous man, what are you going to make of that? You would hardly say that from Genesis. Peter says that and he has the government of God in his mind. If I am swayed from the right course which I would probably take, God gives me credit. How could He speak of these men save on that abstract line? God looks at the heart.
Rem. I was wondering if it corresponds with the public history at the present time of the assembly, how she is suffering, with believers in various organisations around.
J.T. And from divisions from the time of the revival of the truth of the assembly; the brethren are suffering.
{16}
Rem. In spite of what David says about Abner it says, "all Israel was troubled", chapter 4:1. Those that had been following this wrong leader are being affected by the death of Abner.
J.T. This chapter is to bring in the irretrievable weakness of Saul's house. It is a time of testing and these three chapters are to show how things are to be worked out as they happen of themselves. David is not doing anything except passing comments, passing judgments on guilty men. Ishbosheth is spoken of as "Saul's son", and then again Jonathan is "Saul's son"; they are all of Saul, all being weakened or destroyed, the whole house is dying out under the government of God. We must wait and see what God will do, it is the government of God. Things are happening of themselves in David's favour. Let time do its work, let elements that are existing do their work; this fourth chapter shows the complete destruction of Saul's house. Mephibosheth might have been a hope, but he is lame, so that even that little glimmer of hope fails; God made him lame when he was a child. I think what is in mind here is the extinction of the royal line of Saul. Ishbosheth is slain. Faith would say, There is no hope for the house of Saul, put your mind on David. God is doing that.
Ques. Do you think God is working behind the scenes in these matters?
J.T. Well, David is not doing it. It is the elements themselves destroying themselves, that is the idea; applying it to the world, it is gradually coming to that, the elements are destroying themselves.
Rem. All the public matters that are happening in rapid sequence bring that out.
J.T. The history of Europe including that of this country for 150 years past is all seen by the eye of faith to focus on the end, and what the end is going to be. Elements are nullifying each other to
{17}
make way for God. If God did not allow these things to operate against each other they would soon overwhelm us. They are operating against each other and the way is made for us to go through. Keep your mind on Christ if you love His appearing. God sees what is going on in your heart, and as you ask God about this and that you see that the one thing is nullifying the other and God is making the way through.
Rem. Baanah and Rechab were captains of bands, party men.
J.T. That is the rule of the day. That is exactly what this section is bringing out. Abner was a captain under Saul more distinguished and greater than they and so was Joab; but partyism is the principle. Ishbosheth's own men, captains, turn against him, David has nothing to do with it. David calls him a righteous man, it is the skill of a spiritual man in making the best of a matter.
Rem. Mephibosheth is nearest to the throne on Saul's line, after the death of Ishbosheth.
J.T. That is another thing, we meet him again but not to be heir to the throne. There is no evidence that he wanted the throne. The point in Mephibosheth would be that he has a spiritual element in him, he loves David; he is no rival of David.
Rem. He is a real Hebron man, judging the flesh in himself.
Rem. Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt, it has to do with a man that went out of the world. Mephibosheth did not seek the throne for himself.
J.T. He loved David. He is brought in here to show that the house of Saul is hopeless. We are often helped negatively as well as positively. We see every side of Saul cut off here, no available heir. The nearest was lame and unfit. God is showing that every support to this line of things seems to be
{18}
giving way. It shows too, that God has this man in His mind for grace. He has cut him off in spite of himself from aspiring to be successor; it is like the grace of God keeping us out of the world. This seems to be the lesson with Mephibosheth, he is cut off from the house of Saul by being disqualified. Many of us are saved from the world by being kept unfit for it. Lack of prosperity is sometimes an asset.
Rem. "He shall sit at my table continually";(@2 Samuel 9:11) it is not a temporary idea.
J.T. The lameness would be his badge. He is an object for grace here on account of another, Jonathan; so that we have a beautiful picture of the gospel, that God has made him lame to make him a subject for grace. It is much better to be at David's table than on Saul's throne, successor to a wilful king. God in His government prevents our success sometimes to keep us for another world.
Rem. The pressure that God has allowed in recent years has really worked greatly in our favour in that our young people are deprived of prospering to any extent financially; God has come in on the other side and blessed them in view of His world.
J.T. Yes; "he that is wise" may observe how God is saving the young brothers and sisters. If they were more prosperous they might not be in these things. I do not think I ever before saw it so clearly in connection with Mephibosheth, but that is just what happened. He is the king's son but he is not fit to rule a kingdom; he is going to be in Christ's realm typically. How infinitely better!
Ques. David began to reign at thirty. This man was made lame at five years; is that to emphasise the position of weakness?
J.T. David is fully fit for the office and God is making way for the man that is fit. He is removing all others so that "all Israel" came to David in chapter 5. It is very striking and I am sure there is
{19}
a lesson in it: first we see the government of God clearing a way for David, one element working against another to make way for the fulfilment of the counsels of God; but then incidentally this man is made lame at five years, he is taken out of the way of David's universal supremacy; being direct heir to the throne, but kept for grace, for David to show, as a type of Christ, on what a wide scale God operates! Thus God can accomplish several things at the same time.
Rem. A covenant had been made between David and Jonathan; Jonathan had said, "Go in peace", @1 Samuel 20:42.
J.T. It all goes with what we are saying, what God does governmentally to work out His counsels and make subjects of grace.
Rem. David was never marked by a spirit of rivalry.
J.T. I think it shows how God honours a man who acts according to His mind. David is honoured here in that the way is made clear. God is doing it, even in making Mephibosheth lame.
Rem. David never had to push himself; I suppose Joab thought *he* would effect the thing.
Ques. Does not Peter's address support that? -- "Let the whole house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ", @Acts 2:36.
J.T. "Whom ye have crucified"; so that as just remarked David leads in making the most of a person who might have been adverse to one. Go the limit in speaking well of him, that is the principle, God honours that. He said to Solomon You did not ask for the death of your enemies, you asked for wisdom; I will honour that.
Rem. Paul may have thought he had said too much adversely about the Corinthians, but the coming of Titus greatly encouraged him.
{20}
J.T. Of course in the first epistle he says what he can from the divine side -- it is what God has done for them. They could not say that God had not done His best, so that Paul says in effect, You have all the endowment you need. In the second letter he is speaking well of the brethren; how God honours that! Paul says, Whatever you say about me, I will speak well of you. I believe that is the secret of the wonderful light he had about the new covenant, one ray of glory after another, as if God would fill his soul, a man who could clothe the saints so beautifully. I think we ought to stop and think about the Corinthians. They were only about two and a half years old; think of a large number of brethren in a wicked city being converted so recently and yet forming the assembly of God! Is it not wonderful! The enemy was coming in and marring the work, but still it was there. And God was filling out Paul's soul with glory as he speaks well of the brethren.
Rem. The reference to Corinth is helpful. We know that it was to the Corinthians he spoke so definitely about the prophetic word, and that has certainly be emphasised of late, but lest there might be an over-bearing sense of fault finding left there, this spiritual man brings in this wonderful other side of his great appreciation of them. There might be a tendency perhaps in our prophetic ministry to undue fault finding; but that impression could not be left, if these feelings of the apostle were also emphasised.
Ques. Is ministry in the main God's way of helping us?
J.T. I think it is, especially the prophetic ministry. No scripture can establish that more clearly than chapter 19 of this book of Samuel. The prophetic ministry preserves David when all seemed hopeless.
Ques. Why is David partial? He slays these captains of Saul's son but he does not slay Joab.
J.T. I think it was weakness. He admits that
{21}
they are too hard for him. Sometimes when a case arises we are right inwardly and know the truth of who is wrong, but we have not the courage to face the thing. Joab was a very able man. You can see how God in a weak state of things will make a way for what is right. David represents what is right but there is weakness attached to him and God knows this and he is making a way for him. God did not deal with Joab yet and David has to say, "I am this day weak though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me; Jehovah reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness", @2 Samuel 3:39. God did, of course, but then it was David's responsibility.
Rem. There was something unjudged in David that did not come to light until later when Nathan had to judge him.
J.T. Yes; it may have been that Joab connived in this wickedness, and he also operated to bring Absalom forward. He is just a politician.
Rem. "Jehovah reward him": he is invoking Jehovah to do it, he acknowledged his weakness.
J.T. Quite so -- I am not able to do it, let Jehovah do it. Of course, God would listen to it, but then David has to acknowledge his weakness in the matter.
Rem. Joab was captain of the hosts; he knew how to use a sword well. David should have used a prophetic word which is sharper.
J.T. That is the application of it today. The prophetic word is sharper than the sword.
Rem. The chapter tells us of a dead man in Hebron, of two men slain in Hebron and also of a burial there.
J.T. It seems to be the grave of the whole matter, the end; and in the next chapter everyone wants David, God has cleared the whole field for him. Then we have this touch of grace with Mephibosheth and David.
{22}
Ques. Does sonship referred to in Mephibosheth set forth sonship by adoption as a far greater thing than sonship on natural lines?
J.T. Quite so. It is a type of the Christian as a subject of grace, not only that his sins are dealt with, as it were, but he is set up in sonship in the divine realm.
Ques. Do we get some indication here as to the right to discriminate between different persons? It is necessary to slay some but there are some to whom David's feelings would be called out, such as Abner. There are differences in cases that come before us. Where there is some possibility of recovery and right feelings should not our attitude toward them be different?
J.T. David's attitude toward Abner and Ishbosheth bears on the whole ten tribes. It would effect fellowship and right feeling in them. It is the secret I think of the next chapter, that all the tribes came to him.
Rem. His tribute was after the men were dead; in other words, his tribute was wisely placed when they could do no more harm and it was a safe time to speak well.
J.T. I think what ought to be borne in mind is Ishbosheth and the ten tribes. They would say, What a fair-minded man David is! He calls our king a righteous man; he must have said the truth. I suppose Ishbosheth was a harmless man; David calls him a righteous man slain in his own house on his bed, and he calls Abner a prince and a great man; that would affect the tribes. You must get the people and bring them along with you. I think that is fair.
Ques. Do you view those out of fellowship in different lights?
J.T. One has often thought that many of them have just been misled, you feel differently about them.
{23}
Rem. In this last section David had a man slain when he appeared to have a good message.
J.T. Yes, and he points that out to these two murderers; he is a true man in this matter; he is fair.
CHAPTER 5:6 - 25
J.T. We finished last week with the stress laid on David's *reigning* (verses 4, 5), having in the past three or four weeks been occupied with chapters 2 to 4 where there is much party feeling. The Holy Spirit now leaves us restfully accepting the reign of David. Peace and freedom exist, so that it is stated four times in verses 4 and 5 that David *reigned*. "David was thirty years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years. In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah". The word *reign* always peculiarly suggests Christ to us. Many were electing themselves outside the sphere of that reign in the earlier chapters, but now they are all in it. The Lord would have us there, subject to Him.
Rem. So all being subject, they can move now to a further position.
J.T. That is right. David's way has become universal, "all Israel and Judah", and we now have "the king and his men".
Ques. Why are you stressing the idea that he *reigned* ?
J.T. It is over against the squabbles in the earlier chapters. David speaks himself later of "the clear shining after rain";(@2 Samuel 23:4) that is the sort of thing you get here, a clear sky. The Spirit of God seems to rest in that in these two verses, and then there is the thought of "the king and his men".
Ques. Would it be right to connect this passage with the Lord's going to Jerusalem in @Matthew 21?
{24}
J.T. There certainly is a parallel; as He approached Jerusalem Matthew says "the whole city was moved", @Matthew 21:10. But then the question arises as to the *taking* of Jerusalem, whether this particular entry corresponds to David's capture of Jerusalem. We know the Lord was put to death.
Rem. I was thinking that there were those in sympathy with this triumphal entry who might suggest these men associated with David.
J.T. In the gospel of Matthew the initial features of Christianity are represented in children. The Lord is seen as a little Child, and Satan would get rid of the children in Matthew. *The* little Child went to Egypt and came back a Son. Then the Lord calls a little child to him and sets it in the midst, as if He had a place in that child's heart. He had already said to the Father, "thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes", @Luke 10:21. These remarks lead on to your suggestion, but in chapter 21 instead of the *leaders* in Jerusalem accepting the Lord, it is "the *children* crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David", @Matthew 21:15. Then the Lord justifies their action as if they are the ones; it is the infantile or child condition leading up to, "out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise", @Matthew 21:16. The blind and the lame came to Him in the temple and He healed them. The children seem to be the initial idea in Matthew as leading up to what we have in our chapter. If you want to get men you must have children. He finds an entry in Jerusalem, but in the *children*. Matthew would say, "Except ye ... become as little children";(@Matthew 18:3) thus the Lord finds an entry into our hearts. The main point here in Samuel is Christ finding an entry into the hearts of His own.
Rem. Reigning is not considered finality. "He must reign until he put all enemies under his feet", @1 Corinthians 15:25. It is a means to an end.
{25}
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Is there a difference between rule and reign?
J.T. A ruler might be a person who did not reign. Reigning involves royalty. Of course royalty is fast disappearing today but rule is not. I think the word *reign* here four times is to call attention to the kind of person that he was. He was a *king*, not simply a ruler; a deputy might rule.
Ques. Does the reigning of David suggest the supremacy of the person? He is supreme in every heart; you might say it is David's chapter.
J.T. Yes, as over against the others, Abner and Joab, who show a party spirit. It is now the clear shining after rain.
Ques. Is that why David does not ask if he should go to Jerusalem? Of Hebron he says, "Shall I go up?" (@2 Samuel 2:1).
J.T. He had asked about Hebron and God directed him to go up. I suppose here the thought is that we have reached the realm of *spirituality*, it is what David is doing himself now. He is a subject man earlier; of course he is still a subject man, but now he is anointed the second time. He is in supremacy.
Rem. Will you say something as to how Jerusalem is viewed here?
J.T. It is finality, I think.
Ques. Is Jerusalem especially in the mind of God from this point of view? In Joshua it was a city like other cities.
J.T. It seems to come into prominence in Joshua and Judges. In Judges they brought Adoni-Bezek to Jerusalem and he died there. They did not put him to death; @Judges 1:7. It represents a spiritual realm. Adoni-Bezek was a ruthless sort of man but he becomes amenable to the truth and is brought into that spiritual realm. It is good to get refractory brethren into the spiritual realm. Judges gives Jerusalem prominence in that way.
{26}
Rem. It was in the mind of God evidently in figure in Salem. According to Paul it is "Jerusalem above which is our mother", @Galatians 4:26. This really represents that idea.
J.T. Quite so. It is involved, I think, in Melchisedek.
Rem. You referred to it last week -- the city of the great king.
J.T. It has a great place. God Himself calls it that and it helps us here; it is in the mind of God and never will be out of it, it goes right into eternity.
Ques. When David acts on his own initiative here, is he reaching a state that might be regarded as spiritual mindedness?
J.T. It is a question of the point reached, where David reigns; it is not simply that Abner or others have brought the kingdom back to him; it is given to him according to divine purpose. All the people are with him. It seems to be a point reached experimentally in a spiritual sense. We have come into the realm of finality and know what to do.
Ques. Is Jerusalem here typical of the assembly?
J.T. Ziklag, Hebron and Jerusalem are the three points. Ziklag is recovery, Hebron is Colossians, and Jerusalem is Ephesians. David as a heavenly man is reigning, he knows what to do now. From Hebron you know what to do, you set your mind on things above and you travel in that direction. For the Lord it was a terrible thing to contemplate when they talked about His decease which He should accomplish at Jerusalem. How different His peaceful entrance into Jerusalem later on!
Rem. There were opposing elements here.
J.T. The Jebusites being in evidence suggests to us that we have spiritual wickedness in high places. There is no opposition at Hebron, it had been taken by Caleb before. Jerusalem is still the heavenly side and the last to be taken. In @Luke 10 the seventy
{27}
returned with joy saying that even the demons were subject to them, and the Lord immediately says, "I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven", @Luke 10:18. It is the final thought here, I think, spiritual wickedness in high places. It really refers to the saints viewed as the assembly, the heavenly Jerusalem, and the Lord finding an entrance into our hearts. The watercourse would mean, I think, that it is *correspondence*. He is aiming at, *those who have the Spirit*. Joab is not mentioned here, it is too elevated a thought, it is David only here, no deputy; it is the Lord seeking today to get into the hearts of His own in relation to heaven.
Rem. He is "carried up into heaven", (@Luke 24:51) the way is open for Him to take His place.
J.T. There is no opposition.
Ques. Would you say something about the men?
J.T. It is the thought of the king and his men; these are the ones to occupy Jerusalem; there is no longer a babe condition. Matthew contemplates a babe condition, but he also contemplates the full assembly condition.
Ques. What is the link with David taking the head of Goliath to Jerusalem?
J.T. That is another point of help before we come to this to show how the man of God is gradually taking form as to Jerusalem; it runs right down from Melchisedec, from the one who was "without father, without mother", (@Hebrews 7:3) "King of righteousness ... King of *Salem*, which is King of peace", @Hebrews 7:2. Of course, that is part of the meaning of Jerusalem, and undoubtedly it is an allusion to Jerusalem. The head of Goliath is taken there, the final thought is being reached. Now David is going there literally and he has men, and so he is the great king.
Ques. Is the order: *children* in Matthew, *young men* in Mark and *men* in John?
J.T. Yes, that is well linked together. I believe
{28}
John is more in view here than any of the other evangelists because David is building inward. It is pointed out here that David dwelt in the stronghold. This word 'Millo' is a striking sort of word: it is written in the original with the article. We might say, "The assembly", something that cannot be overcome, and it is built inward from that. The gates of hades shall not prevail against it. I think it has John's ministry in mind.
Colossians is Hebron as to doctrine; it means there had been a considerable work of God in the saints at Colosse but they were stopped, so that they are *very near* and yet very far. Whether they go on or stop now hinges on whether the epistle will clear the ground.
Ques. Is manhood sufficient to meet the wicked spirits in heavenly places?
J.T. David's men are military men. I believe Colossians is intended to effect that kind of manhood in us. Epaphras is the typical man in Colossians, he combated earnestly in prayer. A critical point had been reached, they were in danger of being turned aside; now will the prayers of this praying brother and of Paul prevail that they might enter into the purpose of God and the mystery? Will the letter clear away the difficulty? I believe that is the question in the letter, and one would believe they did go forward. What we are saying now is how it affects oneself. And so with the question of distance between Hebron and Jerusalem; it is very near and yet very far. As a matter of fact geographically and topographically Hebron was somewhat higher than Jerusalem. It is a remarkable thing that this is so. But then in spite of that there is danger of hindrance, David was kept out of Jerusalem seven and a half years because of want of unity. It had to be, not simply Judah but all the tribes to bring him in.
Ques. Would it be right to say that you get the thought of the king and his men in those who were
{29}
in evidence during the forty days after the Lord's resurrection; going on to Pentecost and then on to Paul's ministry?
J.T. Yes, the Lord certainly had men at Pentecost; but Jerusalem was not reached until Paul came along.
Rem. There were many obstacles in the Acts to keep the men from entering into it.
Ques. How far does @John 12 go in relation to @John 20?
J.T. I think @John 12 is perhaps the Hebron position; there is nothing in the way of opposition there save Judas¬ attack on Mary, otherwise the position is clear. There is nothing to hinder the saints from being in the heavenly point of view. It seems as if they are in the Lord's mind in this way, and from chapter 13 onward they are to be included in the assembly; it is the heavenly position. Bethany was the link, Bethany and the mount of Olives. Bethany would be the *Jewish remnant* and the mount of Olives was the *link with heaven* ; these two things have to coalesce in time with the Jew.
Ques. Why is there so much emphasis on the blind and lame?
J.T. To-day it would mean persons of that type who ought to have light and are refusing it, and they are lame consequently.
Rem. It is not only that the blind and lame need to come into blessing but they are prepared to keep David out.
J.T. It is a terrible reproach spiritually. "The inhabitants of the land ... spoke to David, saying, Thou shall not come in hither, but the blind and the lame will drive thee back". It seems to be a reproach to David by the inhabitants. It is modernism or some such thing that the enemy is using against Christ at the present time.
{30}
Rem. I suppose they thought the thing impregnable, really, a kind of falsity of self-assurance.
J.T. They did not consider themselves blind and lame. The Lord says in @John 9, "now ye say, We see, your sin remains", @John 9:41. The Pharisees did not think they were blind.
Rem. These people had not profited by the prophetic word.
J.T. You mean as applying the thought of lame and blind to present conditions today; I think it might be applied in that way. They are not assuming to be blind and lame themselves, they are Jebusites, occupying this great stronghold.
Rem. Blindness and lameness is generally of that nature, it speaks out and stands in opposition to what is of God, and is sure of its ground.
J.T. The Jebusites themselves talk about the blind and lame as if the poorest amongst them could be with David. It is a wretched thought hurled against the position today. What do such people think of our meetings, what do they think of us? It is a question of testimony all these years of rejection. David had Jerusalem in his mind and now he is realising the thing. We have the same kind of opposition today, they just ridicule the whole position that the Lord has brought to light.
Rem. The Lord has a right to say who is to come into the house, it is an exclusive principle.
J.T. I think it is the principle now that people should see clearly and not be lame.
Ques. In Nehemiah there is a reference to dwelling in Jerusalem: "and the rest of the people cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem", @Nehemiah 11:1. Would that suggest how difficult it is to occupy Jerusalem territorially in these remnant days?
J.T. I think the allusion would be to the spiritual weakness of the moment, and of course it is educational for us. Why should not Jerusalem be occupied?
{31}
Why should I not love the house of Jehovah? "Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem", @Psalm 122:2. Faith lays hold of that. In Nehemiah's time they would rather dwell in the country. I think the point for us here tonight is, Has David a place in our hearts? The idea is to get up to the watercourse, to get at the spiritual. To-day it is not so much evangelisation as in the beginning, it is to get at the people of God, to get them into the spiritual realm. A watercourse is a place of flowing water. David renders the same word 'cataract' in @Psalm 42:7. The point he makes is to get to the watercourse, to that side of the brethren. It is no question of religious feeling and that sort of thing, but of the spiritual side of the brethren if you are to make anything out of them.
Rem. Please say a little more about Jerusalem. It says he went up to Jerusalem, but it does not say he took Jerusalem, he took the stronghold of Zion.
J.T. That is the thing to get at. What are these words used for? At the present time the Lord is consolidating the truth, not simply getting converts. He has laid hold of the saints through ministry in the power of the Spirit in relation to the heavenly side of the truth, and that is the stronghold. When an attack comes up in this chapter David goes down to the stronghold. The Lord is putting the truth into our souls in such a way that we stand! Jerusalem is the *main* thought, but of the stronghold of Zion it is said, "So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from the Millo and inward", Verse 9.
Rem. You were speaking of Epaphras and of the apostle agonising in prayer, and that what was necessary was co-ordination among the saints; I wondered if there is just that need now, or rather that process going on.
J.T. Yes, it is consolidating the position, you are holding the position at all costs. I think that is
{32}
what is meant here by the word 'stronghold'. "David dwelt in the stronghold", as much as to say, This is my place. It was not Jerusalem, but the city of David; not so extensive as Jerusalem, but a stronghold where the Lord has something, and which He will hold at all costs.
Rem. @Psalm 48 would correspond.
J.T. Yes, the psalm corresponds very well because it is a question of support inward. David built round about; now it is not the stronghold, it is *inward* from the Millo -- a definite thing -- "round about from the Millo and inward". That is, if you get the brethren holding together the general principles of the truth, the Lord says, Now I can move on and work inward in the *service of God*. Where we are holding together in unity any divine principle the Lord has a stronghold and He builds from that.
Ques. Does @Matthew 16 show that the inward side is there? A revelation is something that cannot be overthrown, but the exterior in Peter shows weakness. Peter takes the Lord aside to advise Him.
J.T. That is the sort of thing that we are working against. This natural feeling, Be good to thyself, would deflect us from the full thought of self-judgment.
Ques. Is not the man in @John 9 in an impregnable position? He says, No matter what they say, I must stand my ground. The parents say, He is of age, ask him; and all his replies to the questionings show that the position is held. Is he not a counterpart of Peter in that way as showing the work of God?
J.T. Quite so; he did not get help from anybody, he was a man that could stand. He is a good illustration of what we are speaking about.
Rem. The man in @John 9 corresponds in being marked by smiting the Jebusites.
Rem. It says, "that the works of God might be manifested in him", @John 9:3. We want to see the works
{33}
*manifested*, not only there in an abstract way or hidden way.
J.T. The blind man smote them; the Pharisees and Jews were the Jebusites. All they could do was what they did to Stephen; they cast him out. Stephen went up to heaven, but the Lord found the man in @John 9. The Lord says, I can build now with a man like that. He is ready for the unfolding of who the Son of God is. I think that is the idea in the Lord revealing Himself as the Son of God; the word is that David built round about from the Millo and inward. It is the enemy's aim to get at the spiritual side of the brethren, the watercourse; and so we have the building inward.
Ques. Do we observe this consolidation at the present time or are you speaking abstractly?
J.T. I think God has been working on these lines for a long time. If the brethren can be encouraged to move together in a spiritual way in connection with the heavenly side of the truth -- the watercourse being the channel in which the Spirit works -- then the Lord can operate. He has something in His mind to do for God.
Rem. The man healed in @John 5 did not answer to this.
J.T. The Lord did not have confidence in the man in @John 5. He belonged to a state of things that was affected by angelic intervention; he did not seem to be ready for the Lord, he was not material for any spiritual structure. In fact he brought on persecution. The Lord found him as He did the man in chapter 9, but He could not do anything with him; the man went off immediately and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. The Lord has to work alone as it were in @John 5; He says the most wonderful things in that chapter about Himself, whereas in chapter 9 He has material to work on and hence He goes on to speak in chapter 10 of the flock. There is
{34}
a definite result reached in chapter 9, but not in chapter 5. That is the point now, what has the Lord got to work on? First He gets the saints all together, holding right things, then He builds round about from the Millo and inward; He has got some means of doing that now. There is a point from which He can operate inwardly, and what that involves is the *service of God*. "Let my son go that he may serve me", @Exodus 4:23. That is the main thing from Exodus onward. It says, "the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land". They are characteristically Canaanites, inhabitants of the land but they are dwelling in this place, meaning that strictly they belong to the nations that God had said should be exterminated. The heavenly side is the most difficult to get at. "Have ye received the Holy Spirit since ye believed?" (@Acts 19:2) was asked of the Ephesians. To reach the heavenly side you must get at the saints through the Holy Spirit; the watercourse is the place where you feel secure.
Ques. Building inward is that in relation to ourselves?
J.T. Inward would be Godward; taken up in the light of the tabernacle it would mean the inner place. It is what is Godward, what God began with in Exodus, "Let my son go that he may serve me" (@Exodus 4:23).
The tabernacle was set up, and anyone drawing near would have that in mind, what is Godward.
Ques. In the epistle to the Corinthians the apostle refers to what is inward. All the thoughts of divine Persons in connection with themselves and with the evil, etc., had been dealt with, and the apostle says, "I will come to ... revelations", @2 Corinthians 12:1. The inward is just touched on. Do you feel that the inside position is the eternal one, whereas the stronghold position is provisional?
J.T. Where the enemy can attack.
Rem. When you speak about what is inward, it
{35}
is really the sphere that was in the tabernacle system, though peculiarly restricted.
J.T. It was there. When anyone came with an offering that was in mind. The priest could go near. When you come to @John 17 it is all inward, and later the Lord says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father", @John 20:17. We are free of the enemy's attack and now the Lord, as Minister of the sanctuary, would take us in. It is all inward.
Ques. Would the Millo be somewhat like @John 20 when the doors were shut, so that the inward thing could go on?
J.T. The doors being shut you have all the Jewish element shut out and you can go on.
Rem. In @John 20 you get the ministry carried on relative to the Lord's ascension.
J.T. They were making progress in @John 20. When the Lord came in where the meeting was convened there was nothing to complain of; the doors were shut, they had seen to that.
Rem. It is difficult to keep things maintained on that heavenly level.
J.T. I think the greatest test in speaking to God is whether you speak to Him *historically* or whether you speak to Him about *what He is*.
Rem. You reach sonship through priestly conditions and this inward matter is certainly a great thing if we are going to reach sonship.
J.T. It is the son really who serves.
CHAPTER 6
J.T. It is important that we should see the import of the Philistine attack at the end of chapter 5 before we proceed into chapter 6. There are two great military operations in chapter 5, first the attack on Zion and then this attack by the Philistines (verse 17 to end). It affords us important military
{36}
instruction, first as to conflict with spiritual wickedness in high places -- that is particularly Zion, where it is a question of the Jebusites and second as to how the anointing is attacked. Christ is apprehended as anointed, having secured His place above. Even if we regard Him as the anointed One here below, this kind of attack is to be noted in persons typified by the Philistines, persons having a place in the land but being there other than through Jordan. The earlier operation alludes to His obtaining a place in our hearts. Zion is typically the place He has from the heavenly point of view.
Ques. Is there a spiritual suggestion in the fact that the Philistines went up and David went down?
J.T. David went down to the stronghold, I suppose so.
Rem. It indicated the height at which he was, and they rose to the attack.
J.T. "And David heard of it and went down to the stronghold", @2 Samuel 5:17. It is to be noted because it would allude in the antitype to a certain trustworthy position. I suppose when the Lord went on high in the Acts He had the twelve, and indeed the assembly down here, for the Spirit to come to. It was a trustworthy position in which to carry on His operations. In chapter 5 we have the stronghold in two ways, the stronghold and the Millo, which would allude to a trustworthy position.
Rem. He has his people in mind. In verse 17 of chapter 5 the Philistines heard that the people had anointed David -- the Philistines move in relation to the place that David has among the people.
J.T. Their position was jeopardised. They were big men, such for instance, as the leaders of Israel in the early part of the Acts, or earlier, as seen in the gospels. The anointing of Christ jeopardised their position; whether it be His future anointing or with God above, the position is the same. He is in the
{37}
stronghold and the Philistines are concerned as to His being anointed king over Israel. "*All* the Philistines" came, as if it were a universal matter. They saw their position jeopardised.
Rem. "So also is the Christ", (@1 Corinthians 12:12) as if that is the position the saints occupy.
J.T. It alludes to the assembly there, of course.
Rem. As Christ increases, this element is to be displaced but not without an immense struggle. The Philistines spread themselves.
J.T. They have to make a show. They are all involved in this. It is a critical matter in their minds, it means their whole position is jeopardised.
Rem. They would almost feel desperate.
J.T. They select their own battlefield, the valley of Rephaim.
Rem. I suppose the secret of David's success was that at the beginning he enquired of Jehovah.
J.T. The lesson for us is in all our conflicts to have recourse to the stronghold, whatever it be, as holding to divine principles; then God alone can give the victory. David says God taught him to fight: "Blessed be Jehovah my rock, who teacheth my hands to war, my fingers to fight", @Psalm 144:1.
Ques. Last week we referred to Isaac who became very great so that the Philistines envied him; do we see that coming out here?
J.T. They are the kind of enemy that begins in Genesis and runs down through. That obviously would denote something of their character and prowess, the kind of thing they would rely on, they spread themselves, making a show outwardly.
Rem. This military strategy of David involves going down to the stronghold which is over against the spreading out of the Philistines.
J.T. It is keeping out of sight. He says, "Shall I go up?" And Jehovah answers, "Go up; for I will certainly give the Philistines into thy hand,
{38}
And David come to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there", @2 Samuel 5:19,20. This name, Place of breaches, was given afterwards but it has this meaning here; and David smote them there, as if it were a sudden thing, not a slow matter. The suddenness was God's way. David was moving under the direction of the Lord.
Rem. The keeping out of sight is like Paul at Corinth; he would make the position clear before he came there. Writing the epistle would be keeping out of sight.
J.T. And putting a man like Timothy there so that they might have his spirit before them. It was not the Philistine spirit. Timothy was a timid retiring sort of man.
Rem. Paul's whole approach to the Corinthians was the opposite of what was Philistine in character. "Timothy my child", he says, will show you my ways. I suppose this is the element that operates in our own hearts as the Lord has His place there. The danger is lest the Philistine element should come into activity among us.
J.T. Well, it is bigness, what is giant-like. It would afford an opportunity for such men as they were, whereas here David's victory is all on the principle of hiding. The valley of Rephaim is the Philistine idea, as if they thought that would get the best results. The stronghold being emphasised would allude to what is trustworthy, what God can rely on in conflict, the trustworthiness of His system of things.
Ques. Does it give the heavenly side in verse 9 and our side in verses 17 and 18, that is, would the second be a reference to possibly "two of you" spoken of in Matthew 18?
J.T. I was thinking of that. It is just the way the subject is treated in this chapter. Verse 9 would be divine operations inward, and from the Millo, the point of trustworthiness it seems. Now he goes down without specifying what stronghold it was, it is
{39}
one to go down to; and then divine guidance in that connection seems to set out typically the whole Christian position from the military point of view.
Rem. In verse 17 it says "they" had anointed David king. It was what the people had done that attracted the attention of the Philistines. I was wondering if the suggestion is that the Lord would identify Himself with His people in meeting the Philistine attack?
J.T. I think that is how it is to be worked out. After the Lord was anointed He came in contact at once with these big men. His position and character and the power of His anointing jeopardised their position. Then when He went up on high, which this chapter really contemplates, I think, and the Spirit came, the conflict began again. The attack was immediate. It seems as if this 17th verse would also apply, for the Lord operated in relation to what was trustworthy at Jerusalem. The apostles stand out remarkably in the early chapters of Acts and the conflict was carried on in that connection.
Ques. In recent years where the truth of the Person of Christ has come before the hearts of the brethren in a practical way, that moment has been chosen by the enemy to attack. Will it not always be so?
J.T. I think the battlefield was ordered of the Lord. The Lord directed the point of attack, notwithstanding their having chosen the battlefield.
We have an example of it in @Acts 4. When Peter and John were released they prayed; they are very lowly in their attitude, they speak to Jehovah or God as a despot, in absolute subjection as bondmen, and they add, "thy holy servant Jesus". They are taking a lowly position and they talk about the persons who attack as the great ones, the leading men made the attack. "For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both
{40}
Herod and Pontius Pilate with the nations and peoples of Israel, *have been gathered together in this city* to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass", @Acts 4:27,28.
And the answer comes in overwhelmingly, so that the battle goes on, not in destruction, but in healing. The point for us is always to maintain the characteristics of the dispensation in the conflict. The great ones of the earth are alluded to, kings and rulers, as against *the anointed one*, Christ.
Peter and John tell the whole matter -- what the elders had said to them -- there was no danger of disclosing secrets there. The title they employ in addressing God is in keeping with what we are saying about going down. The word means "despot" in the original. "And they having heard it lifted up their voice with one accord to God and said, Lord", @Acts 4,24. There is a reference to it in the margin, "the master of a slave". That is how they spoke to God, so that they took a lowly place, but they are on sure ground.
Rem. The position of liberty that we are speaking of seems to be secured in @John 17 -- the Lord laid aside his garments.
J.T. You mean He had confidence to do it. The lesson for us lies there in conflict: if you take a lowly place you are in trustworthy circumstances. So that Matthew gives us the great general principle in the conflict in the Lord's remarks about the assembly, that "the gates of hades shall not prevail against it". (@Matthew 16:18) That is the place of confidence, the place of reliability the assembly. It is brought down to two or three, and "there am I".
Ques. Do you think that from @Acts 4 and 5 on, this offensive on the part of the Philistines continues until Paul goes into Europe? They are attacking all the time.
J.T. This thought of Baal-perazim, "Jehovah has broken in upon mine enemies before me", (@2 Samuel 5,20) is, I think,
{41}
to bring out the suddenness of divine warfare. It may be prolonged on account of the low state among us, but the state being ready there is a suddenness and unexpectedness in the way God acts in attacking the enemy.
Ques. Is it a place reached somewhat like the places reached in Mr. Darby's day and then in Mr. Raven's day?
J.T. The Philistines have their own men, leading men, here; and in those days, fifty years ago, an unknown man was used to break in, it was God's doing.
Rem. The matter of suddenness is perhaps confirmed in the way prayers are answered in the Acts. And our prayers will be answered.
Ques. Has there not been a movement somewhat like that, an impulse to break forth, recently?
J.T. It could not have been met were it not that there was confidence among the brethren.
Rem. And stronghold conditions too, in a general way.
J.T. The truth of the assembly has been developed more and more ever since. It all depends upon confidence among the brethren. We shall never have the truth of the stronghold worked out without confidence.
Rem. I was wondering whether the thought of the images (chapter 5:21) would indicate the presentation of other thoughts as detracting from the truth of Christ. There are interesting differences between these two attacks: images in the first, and evidently something more subtle in the second, in the thought of the mulberry trees. Then later we have another attack of the Philistines of more insidious character, with the new cart, quite a Philistine idea.
J.T. Yes, a cart would be a Philistine mode of doing things.
Rem. In the last conflict the breach was a little
{42}
closer than in Mr. Darby's or Mr. Raven's days, and it was really amongst so-called brethren.
J.T. I think the unity that God brought about among the brethren saved us. The trustworthiness is the centre and base of operations.
Rem. So that if there were two in a meeting of thirty that the Lord could rely upon, though there might be a great deal of feverish speaking the stronghold would be seen in those who are reliable, so that the position would be held and maintained.
Rem. The stronghold is not taken until you get unity.
Rem. Paul's conversion helped in the solidifying of the saints and the fulfilment of church ministry.
J.T. I think it was the great binding truth that was needed at the time. The twelve did not bring that out, but there was remarkable confidence among the twelve. The woman seen in @Revelation 12 has a crown of twelve stars: that would be some trait of the saints; besides the sun and the moon there are twelve stars. "Hold fast ... that no one take thy crown", (@Revelation 3:11) is said to Philadelphia. What is the crown at any given time? Let us assume that love is the great principle; what could we do without it? It never fails. It is a stronghold, and I believe that is the idea of the crown, it is what the saints cherish. I believe that is what comes out here, unity. The anointing was by *all the tribes*, suggestive of unity and affection, "they anointed David". So that I think in meeting the enemy, the crown of twelve stars is significant, the man-child would bring all these thoughts into concrete fulfilment; the enemy was there, but the crown was there. I think that is the secret that has met any threatened cleavage in a wide way. Thank God there was no cleavage.
Rem. Love was operative when Paul and Barnabas went forth.
{43}
J.T. The assembly had a great place in that proceeding. Paul and Barnabas were received by the assembly and later were sent out in relation to the assembly.
Ques. What is the difference in the character of these two conflicts? In the first place David is to go up and act, and in the second place he is to wait until he hears the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees: "when thou hearest a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees ... then thou shall bestir thyself", @2 Samuel 5:24. In the first place he is taking the initiative, and in the second he is waiting.
J.T. The first lesson I think, is the going down to the stronghold and the breaking forth as waters; it is the suddenness of divine attack. Then the second lesson would be that the enemy is not very far-sighted, he does not understand the spiritual. They are assuming something, as if to say, we know the mode of attack, this is the best valley for us and David will do the same thing again. *But he does not do the same thing again*, that is the secret of success. The Philistines think that we shall think as they do; but we shall do something different because Jehovah is a man of war. The issue would be between Jehovah and the Philistines: "It shall be, when thou hearest a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shall bestir thyself; for then will Jehovah have gone forth before thee", (2 Samuel 5:24). Who are the marchers? Whose army is that? Jehovah is doing the fighting. "Thou shall bestir thyself". That is not a very military term, but the idea is that you should not sit down, you must have a military ear for that sound. The Philistines say, He will do the same thing again; but that is where they are defeated. The enemy does not know the Spirit.
Ques. Would the thought of feeling come into this, in the mulberry trees? I was thinking of @Psalm 84.
J.T. I do not know. It is not a solved question
{44}
as to what the mulberry trees really mean, but anyway God is using them.
Rem. The element of spiritual discernment comes into view.
J.T. If they are ordinary mulberry trees, they are of low stature, they are not pretentious trees such as the olive or the cedar; God can move on the top of them. It is in keeping with the general thought of lowliness.
Rem. The truth is attacked first of all in an open way, which may be more readily discerned and met than another more insidious movement in regard to the same truth.
J.T. Another lesson is that David is not too sure. He enquired of Jehovah again and the answer was, "Thou shalt not go up"; "turn round behind them", @2 Samuel 5:23. They would not expect that.
Rem. One victory might tend to give you self- confidence. This matter of marching tends to bring about another victory; it is a suggestion of a forward movement among the saints.
J.T. Especially a military move. Marching is in military precision. A military step seems to be understood now; we are dealing with military matters, then let us be military men. It is the sound of marching; what kind of step is it?
Rem. God is in the matter in a military way.
J.T. Maybe David had to learn something about marching. Perhaps we have got to learn here tonight how to march together, not one saying this and one saying that; marching is military precision.
Ques. Would marching suggest a movement among the brethren?
J.T. "When thou hearest a *sound* of marching in the *tops* of the mulberry trees", @2 Samuel 5:23. Let us assume that the brethren are the mulberry trees; there are no pretentious persons. God says, Now I am going to move among the brethren, on the top of them. They
{45}
are ready for Him and you hear the sound of *that* . I think perhaps that is where the lesson lies.
Rem. We bestir ourselves, when we hear the sound of God moving amongst His people.
J.T. We have experience as to God's way in conflict. The stronghold must be there and then order and alertness in military movement. It taxes our sensibilities as to whether we can hear the sound of what God is doing.
Ques. Does Paul use these tactics in bringing the saints into line in @2 Corinthians 8:1 - 4? He refers to other localities and districts where the saints were marching, acting together.
J.T. That is good. There is a great deal made of order in that letter. Whether you get the marching I do not know. In the house of Chloe or of Stephanas there would be persons who are true, on whom the apostle could rely.
Rem. It is a well known thing that the sound of marching, the playing of martial music, is one of the most stimulating sounds.
J.T. I do not know whether we can be too sure about the marching, but it looks to me as if it is the thought of the *tops*, God has them, He can use them, for that is what is said, "the *tops* of the mulberry trees".
Rem. The way is made for another victory in chapter 5.
J.T. Quite so. I believe the sound of marching is to be followed right through, it is the way God has of carrying on His conflict at all times. The Acts has been called a book of precedents; you get there a great variety in God's doings. He moves through others, and I think the mulberry trees must allude to persons available for His purposes.
Rem. There is another difference between these two attacks: the first is a frontal attack, whereas the second is from behind.
{46}
J.T. Yes, you come in behind people who are in that way attacking the truth. They may make a good show; these Philistines spread themselves, they are prominent men opposing in these matters, men who use their titles and their university degrees; well you see behind that, you know it is weakness when they are trusting in that. They may make a good show in titles and books and learning, but when you come behind you see the weakness.
Rem. The apostle says in @2 Corinthians 2:11, "I also ... if I have forgiven anything it is for your sakes ... that we might not have Satan get an advantage against us". I was wondering whether we get the thought there of alertness in regard to the attacks of the enemy?
J.T. That fits in; "for we are not ignorant of his thoughts", (@2 Corinthians 2:11) is a great matter; it is a great matter to know the enemy's thoughts.
Rem. Paul approaches different cities as he preaches. He approaches Philippi, Thessalonica, Corinth and finally Ephesus by the upper districts and finds certain disciples.
J.T. That might allude to marching, one continuous battle. We read of "the ears of the church", (@Acts 11:22) suggesting that we have church ears and we know what is going on. Joshua did not recognise the sound in @Exodus 32:17, he had not a good ear; but this is the ear for war, the sound of marching.
Ques. Would you say that in this first battle God was with David and in the second David was with God?
J.T. It says, "then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then will Jehovah have gone forth before thee", @2 Samuel 5:24. God is in the lead, what could withstand God? Very beautiful and very instructive as to warfare, getting to God about anything to see what He will do, whether He will put it on you or whether He will say, "as captain of the army of Jehovah am *I* now
{47}
come", @Joshua 5:14. That is. He takes charge Himself; and if He does, well, there is only one end to that.
Rem. This might bring out criticism from certain ones that they are being attacked from behind.
J.T. That is where we ought to attack if it is a Philistine matter.
Rem. The whole organisation is smitten by God.
J.T. And then: "from Geba until thou comest to Gezer", (@2 Samuel 5:25) which I suppose would allude to a thorough decision of the matter, it is not left open, it is a settled matter.
Ques. Was this defensive?
J.T. It is defensive because they are attacked. In the early part of the chapter it is spiritual wickedness in high places, but here David is attacked by another set of warriors.
Rem. It really takes manhood to enter into this kind of conflict.
J.T. Quite so. As coming out of Egypt the children of Israel were led round another way because they were not mature.
Ques. Does @Acts 15 show men who are qualified to take up things and settle them for all?
J.T. The apostle and elders, is that what you mean?
Rem. During the Great War certain battlefields in France were known as the place where the thing was settled. The ground here is very suggestive.
J.T. Yes, Geba to Gezer, these are our military landmarks which we can refer back to in the history of the assembly as to how things were decided.
Rem. As we come there.
J.T. Quite so, "until thou comest". It would indicate that *we ought to come there and see how God's battles are fought and finished*.
Ques. When they went into the land in Joshua they had been through the Jordan and the Red Sea;
{48}
do we not have to see God's purposes of love in the death of Christ securing His counsels?
J.T. Quite so. The Philistines never went that way and they could not stand up against men that had come through Jordan.
Rem. Chapter 6 makes much of the military men and very little of the priesthood.
J.T. The next thing is that David approaches a great priestly matter on military lines. He is carrying the military too far, for chapter 6 concerns a great priesthood matter. He gathered "chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. And David arose and went with all the people that were with him from Baale-judah to bring up from thence the ark of God". He did not need so many as that to carry the ark.
Rem. David seems to have forgotten the breach made at Baal-perazim because God has to make a breach here, a breach upon Uzzah; the Philistine idea is working and God has to deal with it among His people.
Ques. Would it involve a change of clothing from the military to the priestly?
J.T. It is obviously a priestly matter. What does that cart refer to? It was a military matter before but why now? And why 30,000 men? It shows that David is not right in his soul in this matter.
Ques. Is there not always a danger of our moving on in the flush of victory on military lines, when we should be brought into priestly conditions?
J.T. We are so apt to go too far on any given line of things. In @1 Samuel 7:9 Samuel offered a sucking lamb and Jehovah discomfited the Philistines that day, and it says, "the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and smote them" (@1 Samuel 7:11).
They finished the matter, they went the whole way, but then that is enough. Now God is going to do something else; it is not now a military matter, it is a priestly matter. It is a question of God finding a
{49}
place for Himself. We need to be priestly if we are to carry the ark; it is a poor thing if we have to be always fighting.
Rem. Even with these 30,000 men they still require a cart.
J.T. There never was a question of carrying it in a cart before in Numbers or Deuteronomy, it was purely a Philistine idea; because they used it David is borrowing it.
Ques. And two brothers driving the cart, one going before it; it was all wrong. How does that apply?
J.T. It is a solemn passage, especially when the breach is made upon Uzzah. We may go too far on one line; this is another matter altogether, the military side should not be so prominent for it is a matter of God's rest. Having to do with the Philistines you are apt to get their way of doing things. They had never seen this thought of the cart before; make it as new as you like, it is still a cart.
Rem. I suppose we are far more influenced by what is around us in the world religiously than we have any idea of.
Rem. Once in a while we may make something new and sometimes it is accredited very quickly.
J.T. If it is new it is apt to "take on"; people say: I never heard that before; but that does not prove anything. We are to "prove all things",
David should have said, I have been looking through Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers and there is no word about a cart on which to carry the Ark.
Rem. There may be care for the Lord's interests among the brethren and one is thankful for it, but that does not qualify a brother or brothers to take hold of the Ark.
J.T. There is no word here as to David turning to God about this matter first. That is the secret of failure.
{50}
Ques. Do we not see this very thing working out in the world? The military side will possibly overbalance the political, economical, agricultural and other departments of the nation, and thus the very thing used for protection will be used for destruction in the end.
J.T. It was remarkable in Solomon's day that he had superintendents for every department; all was looked after. It is important that we do not carry on on one line too much. Why did not David pray about this matter also? They were having a good meeting! This was a fine time as far as outward appearances went, "and David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah on all manner of instruments"; but it is the underlying condition that God is dealing with.
CHAPTER 6:6 - 23
J.T. We just touched on this chapter last week. Attention was called to "David *again*" gathering all the chosen men of Israel, carrying on the military thought; whereas what governs this chapter is more *levitical* than military; hence the sorrow that arises from the human element entering into the movement, in that they set the ark of God upon a new cart. So in this verse with which we begin we are told that "Uzzah reached after the ark of God, and took hold of it, for the oxen had stumbled. And the anger of Jehovah was kindled". The incongruity of using a cart with no one apparently to object or to question it would show the underlying unspiritual, unlevitical condition.
Ques. Does the ark as recovered suggest typically that the Person of Christ would now be for the saints? There is a long history behind it when the ark was in Abinadab's house.
J.T. Although a long time in the house of Abinadab
{51}
on the hill, it would look as if the manner in which the ark had been regarded there was not priestly or levitical. The idea of elevation is there, but apparently a very poor sense of what was due to the Lord or to the ark, or they would not have used a cart. Had there been a good levitical atmosphere, as there would be in the house of Obed-Edom later, this error would not have taken place, showing that when a low state exists amongst us things might happen that are not according to right principles.
Ques. Was not the fact that Uzzah put forth his hand evidence of an unholy state?
J.T. He was driving the cart, which was no employment for a Levite. The Kohathites should have carried it; @Numbers 4:15.
Rem. I was wondering why there is such a short account in Samuel as compared with that in Chronicles.
J.T. Chronicles is more spiritual, I think.
Rem. "And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, with every prince ... . And all the congregation said that they should do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people", @1 Chronicles 13:1 - 4. David was subject to the captains of thousands and hundreds; but in @1 Chronicles 15:2, he says: "None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites", and then in verse 11 he calls for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, etc. It was these passages that made me refer to it in connection with what you were saying. Here he comes to it that none but the Levites should carry the ark.
J.T. Chronicles accredits him with more. The word 'again' is left out in Chronicles. The word 'again' in the chapter read would allude to chapter 5, which is military. But in Chronicles "David consulted". It is the consultation which is different, and as you say we have much more made there of the second attempt. The Philistine attack in chapter 14, and the names of the Levites that were employed
{52}
in chapter 15 are both mentioned as intervening between the error of the first attempt and the rightness of the second.
Rem. So that David deals with it in Samuel as a military matter, but in Chronicles as a priestly matter.
J.T. Quite so. And David said, "None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites". (@1 Chronicles 15:2) He had learned his lesson and he tells us so.
Ques. How do you view the house of Abinadab?
J.T. I do not think it is exactly a spiritual setting; I think it stands as a sort of mixed condition between the return of the ark from the Philistines and David taking it on. There is some care for it. An account is given in @1 Samuel, chapter 7: "And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Jehovah, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and hallowed Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah", @1 Samuel 7:1. There is nothing said about his being a priest or a Levite, he is made that apparently, it is a sort of improvised situation which may be found where unspiritual conditions exist.
Rem. I wonder whether the matter did not go better when the ark was drawn by the milch kine? That is to say, God providentially cared for the truth of the Person of the Lord then rather more than when the cart was driven.
J.T. Quite so. The milch kine represent the feminine thought, leaving their calves behind them. They represent spiritual instinct as over against Philistine intelligence, because the narrative shows that the Philistines did have some intelligence, like the clerics, but not instinct. The kine would connect with the levitical thought for as they reached Beth-shemesh the men. "clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine as a burnt offering to Jehovah", @1 Samuel 6:14. Both cart and kine were used for God. There was something there, but not in this instance. God would not accept this. It must allude
{53}
to the underlying spiritual condition. The milch kine left their young ones behind, nature did not control them, they went on the right way and as they reached the end they died. They are offered up as a sacrifice; it seems to answer to the death of Christ. Then also you have Levites in @1 Samuel 6, but not here.
Ques. God smote Uzzah. Would there be anything in that corresponding to Thyatira: "her children will I kill with death", @Revelation 2:23?
J.T. It perhaps does not go so far as that. It seems to be more like strange fire with the sons of Abinadab, that is the purely natural side which you often find in a low state amongst us. We act as ordinary men with good intentions, but God is resenting that here; they should have known better. The oxen are simply beasts of burden, a natural idea; the cart, just a common way of carrying things, and it says that the oxen stumbled. That was to bring out the underlying condition with which God would deal. If anything like this happens we deflect from the right order. We may say that it is not much out of the way, but it is the underlying condition that God has in mind. David became indignant instead of humbling himself, showing he was not right with God.
Rem. Uzzah was prepared to rectify a mistake on human lines.
J.T. Yes, it is just that. It is what is underlying. God deals with the state of our souls.
Rem. At Beth-shemesh the men looked into the ark, indicating that the Levites were not in control of the matter.
J.T. That seems to be so. They are recognised in @1 Samuel 6:15, "And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah", etc. So far so good, but then later on we are told that God smote the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark. All that would show that there was a wrong underlying
{54}
state all round, what was due to God was not in evidence.
Rem. God valued David's desire of heart to bring up the ark. He appreciated this.
J.T. "As many as I love I rebuke and chasten" (@Revelation 3:19).
David should have known better, he must learn this lesson, that is the point. There must be no diversion from what is right in our actions in the assembly.
Ques. Was this the household setting or the local assembly?
J.T. You might make it either one. You will notice great stress laid on Obed-Edom's house, so that I think it is the household thought primarily. "David carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite and Jehovah blessed Obed-Edom and all his household", v.10,11. It would look as if he were a real Levite from the way he is mentioned later and that his whole house comes into blessing, whereas the house of Abinadab does not. This must have been the second or third generation of Abinadab's household, but there is no education for them, no increase of holiness seen, no gain from having the ark.
Rem. I was thinking how interesting and helpful are various incidents concerning it: the men of Beth-shemesh looked into the ark; in the house of Abinadab there was evidently a little more consideration, but no spiritual thought, and that situation has to be exposed; and then David himself is characterised by unspirituality in thinking of its care as a military matter. Then the ark finds a resting place in the house of Obed-Edom and his house is blessed; and at last the Levites bring it up, as if there is an increase of spirituality in the whole proceeding.
J.T. We may have gone on a long time with Christ, but not in due order. How do they take care of the ark in Abinadab's house? There is no mention of any particular care. The fact that it is on a hill
{55}
is creditable, but if the Spirit of God could have shown that he was a man who loved Christ and would care with "due care" we should have heard about it. These two men are sons or grandsons and they do not seem to have gained anything by the stay of the ark all these years. What did their father tell them about this precious ark, how important it was and what the Scriptures said about it? Why did they not learn?
Rem. Abinadab might suggest conditions in a meeting where there appears to be great zeal without spirituality; and when a certain correction has to be made this feature might be found that existed with David. He was indignant because Jehovah made a breach upon Uzzah.
J.T. Apparently the only thing that recovered him was the fact that God was blessing the house of Obed-Edom, the man that had the ark. Why did he not know the value of the ark itself? Here is a manifest act of God and he is indignant. Then he sees that God is blessing the man who has the ark.
Rem. The thing may exist with us possibly in a more real way. There may be indignation in an unnoticed way, because of what God is doing.
J.T. That is what comes out here. The recovery of the ark is the salvation of David and of everybody, hence the importance of our houses being right. How important it is! It became a guide for David that "God blessed the house of Obed-Edom".
Ques. Was he an Israelite?
J.T. I think he was a Levite. Obed means 'worshipper'. The word 'Gittite' might mean from Gath, but not necessarily. There were cities in Israel of that name.
Rem. The thought of the household is very helpful. At a time of great exercise which might correspond with this present period, there is a household where
{56}
the truth concerning the Person of Christ can be held and cared for in the right way.
J.T. If it is not a baptised household it is a great disadvantage because that is the first great light that should come into the house. Christ had to die. Baptism is the testimony of the death of Jesus, there is no help for us apart from that. The Christian household is a great idea in the divine realm. The house of Stephanas was baptised; indeed they had addicted themselves to the ministry, and they got blessing as bringing in Christ in a baptismal way. The Lord went into death, otherwise there could be no blessing for any house.
Rem. If baptism does not characterise a Christian's household it is an Egyptian household. To leave Egypt and go through the Red Sea is a figure of baptism. We must identify the name of Christ with the house.
J.T. The ark is there in principle when baptism is owned.
Rem. Between these two households, those of Abinadab and Obed-Edom, there is a threshing floor, verse 6. I wondered if all the misapprehensions were ended there?
J.T. It would look as if there was not much wheat out of the house of Abinadab. These two men were representative of that house, and the threshing floor was a test that brought out where they were. The threshing floor of Atad is established near the Jordan that is where the wheat comes to light; @Genesis 50:10. With Gideon it was not simply a threshing floor but a winepress that the man had utilised. He was producing something and he had to hide it from the Midianites; @Judges 6:11.
Ques. What is the difference between the anger of God and the anger of Jehovah?
J.T. You are calling attention particularly to verse 7: "And the anger of Jehovah was kindled
{57}
against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God". God is judge of all the earth, that is what He is called in Egypt.
Ques. Is this service levitical? Only the priest could go inside.
J.T. The matter of going inside is not mentioned here. This is a question of putting out your hand to steady the ark. It is not a priestly hand. Why should it need such an effort? Why was the ark not carried on the shoulders of persons appointed to carry it? It suggests the use of human methods. Very often we take short cuts in a crisis, but God is more concerned about His own order than about the thing we have in mind. You can never reach the divine end by taking short cuts. They were misbehaving in @1 Corinthians and the apostle says, "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep", @1 Corinthians 11:30. This was because they were misbehaving in their use of the things of God, not distinguishing the body. They were unholy in the way they were acting.
Rem. It would appear that David's intentions were right at the beginning, but this matter apparently made him indifferent or afraid, because in verse 12 it says: "And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that is his, because of the ark of God".
J.T. If the house of Obed-Edom had been the same as that of Abinadab, apparently David would never have come for the ark; so that the fact that we have right principles is not enough, there must be the evidence of blessing or divine approval.
Ques. Does it not emphasise the immense value of a godly household at a time of pressure?
J.T. It is very remarkable that we are not told just why the blessing came, but the blessing being there denotes that there was something pleasing to
{58}
God; not only that things were being done right, but there was the evidence of the blessing of God. I believe John's ministry has that in mind. You get there: "Come and see". It is not simply right order but the blessing of God is there; that answers every question and difficulty.
Ques. Does David's indignation suggest the feelings we have in actions that God has taken which we do not like because we are governed by persons?
J.T. It was very gracious of God to bless the house of Obed-Edom, He knew that David would take notice of that. That is the great point, is there evidence of God's blessing? In the house of Abinadab there was apparently no living state of things at all.
Rem. God blessed *all* that was his.
Ques. Does the time element entering into each household show how long it takes sometimes for us to make a move locally? The ark was twenty years in one house and three months in the other?
J.T. That twenty years has a special meaning. It does not mean that the ark was there only twenty years, it alludes to what happened in chapter 7 of 1 Samuel. The ark really remained there during the reign of Saul, that is, forty years, and during the greater part of the reign of David; so that it must have been there over sixty years. Where is the result of all this? What is this man gaining with such a treasure in his house? Apparently nothing! These two men Uzzah and Ahio do not know what to do. One of them tries to steady the ark as he would anything else. The underlying condition is being dealt with. In the previous chapter seventy persons had been slain. This is quite a serious matter. Apparently Abinadab did not take it too seriously, and nothing happened in his house so far as we know, but the judgment comes on Uzzah. Now we have a man that has the ark only three months and God is
{59}
blessing him already, showing that he is ready for the thing.
Rem. It was a serious exercise and David got adjusted in three months. It is a word to us in local exercises.
J.T. The first letter to the Corinthians shows that some were getting blessing. The house of Chloe is on the alert for God to have things right, and obviously the house of Stephanas too. There is a sort of link there corresponding with the house of Obed-Edom. "How shall the ark of Jehovah come to me?" David says. What a thing that is, to refuse to take Christ home, home to yourself! "David carried it aside".
Rem. The nearer the ark is getting to Jerusalem the more blessing there is; and in view of the rapture God is indeed helping the saints not only in regard to principles but in regard to what is of Himself.
J.T. Very good. There is more value the nearer you get to Jerusalem. So it is with Christ. The colt was tied in a beautiful environment, Bethany, Bethphage, and the mount of Olives; and as Jesus is put upon the ass by the disciples everybody is in movement, "the whole city was moved". You would think He was going to be set up in Jerusalem. But it shows that the suggestion of Jerusalem and its environs answers to God. The loosing of the colt is important, it is not *any* colt, it is a colt that the Lord *Himself* wanted. The oxen would be like those in the system around us. Who selects the clerics? The nearer you get to Jerusalem the more the divine selection must come into evidence. The Lord knows that colt; he is tied, but as soon as Jesus is put upon him everybody is moved, and so He comes to Jerusalem. "Behold thy king cometh to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass", @Matthew 21:5. It represents the kind of person the Lord would have. The oxen were just
{60}
two beasts of burden for any purpose, to bring a load of hay perhaps; they were not "two of *you"*. David enquired of the Lord on the military side and in going up to Hebron, but not here. This was a priestly matter and the Lord would teach us lessons as to what is suitable in regard to Christ amongst us and how we are to do things.
Rem. David seems to be occupied with military matters and forgets.
J.T. I think the word 'again' helps, it links on with that with which he had been engaged. He is not asking Jehovah at all here. We forget to pray, forget to ask God what to do next, because after all, it is the next thing to be done. We may make a place for Christ, but omit to ask *how* it is to be done. The underlying condition was the cause of failure and we really should go back to @1 Samuel, chapter 4, to see the underlying condition in Israel in regard to the ark. They took the ark out into the camp thinking that it would give them victory over the Philistines and it was captured. Then God took care of it in the house of Abinadab. But were they learning from this? The milch kine went the right way and died in the end. Are Abinadab and his two sons on these lines? Are they so devoted to Christ that they can care for the ark in a right way? God had especially taken up David to use him. He stresses the fact that He found him, a man after His own heart that would do all His will, and he is called 'beloved'. But David is being deflected here, he is not in communication with God, he is doing things as man does them. 1 Chronicles gives us all the details as to how David went on from this point. He provided for the service of God as a result of all this. A brother's mistake may be the outcome of the general condition of the brethren, but he must learn from it. If the Lord is to use him, all this must be dealt with.
Rem. He hears what God is doing to the house of
{61}
Obed-Edom, and then he makes a right move and he has sacrifices made at six paces. Would you say that that agrees with the spiritual instincts that were seen in the milch kine?
J.T. The suggestion is, I suppose, that we must not fail again. He is now careful. Now he sacrifices the oxen after six paces; that shows he is careful about his steps.
Ques. I wanted to ask whether in a general way recovery might be a matter of months? If it were a matter of days it might not be genuine, but if it went into years it might become a fixed matter.
J.T. It might become a fixed matter. It seems as if Abinadab had not learned anything of that. David had learned. He observed what happened and was anxious that there should be no repetition of mistakes. God knew that, I am sure.
Rem. John is one who is recovered quickly. He says, "It is the Lord", whereas Peter apparently does not get on so well. I wondered if there is any suggestion in that?
J.T. Someone has said that it is not a question of how often a horse falls, but of how quickly he rises afterwards, how quickly he recovers himself. John immediately says, "It is the Lord".
Rem. There are evidences of David's recovery, his demeanour changes. May we have a practical word on that?
J.T. Let us compare. The first time David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand ... . "And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah on all manner of instruments made of cypress wood, with harps, and with lutes, and with tambours, and with sistra, and with cymbals", @2 Samuel 6:1 - 5. The second time "when they that bore the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatted beast", verse 13. And David *himself* danced before Jehovah. That is, there is less made
{62}
of the musical instruments than there is of David himself, and it is, I think, because he recognised the blessing; but he also recognised the danger of the seventh step, that something might happen. He fears God, and he is girded with a linen ephod. Michal calls attention to this, showing what is in the unspiritual mind, which corresponds to the cart; if David had kept on in correspondence with the cart she would not have despised him. She does so because he is taken up with the seventh step, and dances girded with a linen ephod, he is in the thing himself now. Michal said it was shameful, but what he is doing is right and sober. Paul said, "I speak words of truth", (@Acts 26:25) that is what I think the linen ephod means here.
Rem. First an indignant brother, now a humble brother.
J.T. I do not think Michal would have despised him as indignant, she would not have had any trouble about that, but she has about this action of David's that is spiritual, dancing with all his might. Linen is what keeps one sober and balanced. David is abasing himself according to her point of view, which is what the Lord Jesus did. He abased Himself and went down into the dust of death.
Ques. Is what is priestly greater than what is royal?
J.T. Here David is supremely priestly in the way he acts. He brings reproach upon himself and defends it.
Rem. Often we are afraid of the reproach of moving in a way that is not understood by the world. The window of the world is open and they look out and we fear the reproach.
J.T. Michal has no part in it at all. Why should she be inside? Like the bride in the Canticles in type the Lord is outside and she is inside, and all this is going on outside.
Ques. Is she a type of the professing church?
{63}
J.T. I think she is a type of the Church of England. She has no progeny, that is the termination of that order of things. It is not direct judgment, it is a sustained thing, to the day of her death she is not to be in the testimony. She is inside when David is under reproach and she is criticising.
Ques. Why do you think of her as a type of the Church of England?
J.T. I am referring to the first book more than to this. Merab was the first one, then Michal. They were both given to David to do him harm, although it is said that Michal loved David, which I venture to say the Church of England does in a certain way. Rome would be Merab. They are both given to David to do him harm. Saul intended to do David harm, but Merab was held back. These are human organisations taking on the name of Christ, assuming to be the bride of Christ. The true church is Abigail. Michal saved his life once, there is something for him, but this is the end of the whole matter. She represents something of Saul, of the flesh, and she comes under judgment. David says "thy father" here, he connects her with Saul. It is exactly the same thing in Simon's house; Judas complains and John pursues the thing to its full exposure; @John 12.
Ques. Would she represent what is official, the high priests, etc.? Jesus was setting aside what was official. Michal did not like David's action for the same reason.
J.T. If he had kept on on Saul's line, the new cart and that sort of thing, that would have suited her.
Rem. The recovery of the truth in the last hundred years has been under reproach from just this kind of thing. What Michal represents gives us a type of this.
J.T. The way to recovery is in judging ourselves. David judged himself and he is now able to judge her.
Rem. If we take account of ourselves in relation to the public profession we have to be prepared to be
{64}
more vile in the eyes of those who occupy prominent positions.
Rem. Merab was definitely given to another, so was Michal, only she is taken back. You feel it is an unholy matter. Take any association today, you might get reform, the bettering of things, the Reformation was to make things better, but in truth this woman was no fit companion for David.
J.T. I believe from the time of the Reformation the church had been given to another, that is the Romish system. Ever since, you hear of recovery and reformers, John Wesley, Moody and Sankey, and others. There is revival but ultimately these and all who have branched off in independency from those known as brethren have lapsed back into this position. It is the judgment of God spiritually.
Rem. What is living comes out of it.
J.T. Wherever there has been division since 1836 it has been a return to the old thing, only, of course, disguised because the persons carried impressions with them, but it is a gradual drifting back. That is what is meant here. David pronounces no judgment upon her, but the fact is stated that she had no child. That is the end of that, God has judged it all.
Rem. The official element did not like the little children praising the Lord in Jerusalem. No wonder the house was left to them.
Rem. "David returned to bless his household". Michal is cut off but others there really do come into blessing, see verses 18 and 19.
Rem. "They brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had spread for it", verse 17. Certain things are attributed to the ark as having been done by itself and certain things are done to the ark by persons.
J.T. There is a lot of food for the soul in all that. We know how the ark acted for itself in the Philistines¬ land, Dagon went down before it. Now we have to
{65}
distinguish between what Christ does and what we do with Him. They brought in the ark of Jehovah and set it in its place, so that it has now reached its place.
Rem. In the synoptic gospels the Lord is taken up to Jerusalem; in John He goes up alone.
Rem. Every eye would be upon the ark as it came into the city, they would not be thinking of those who carried it.
J.T. It is to accredit the great priestly condition: "They brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place". So that the service of God is now set up. David offered peace offerings and burnt offerings before Jehovah. This is provisional but it has its place, the idea of Zion. Here they have reached the point that is proper to Zion. The general state is not equal to what was there later when the temple was built.
Rem. David could go back now and deal with what was in his house.
J.T. He puts the service of God first. It is a great thought and the brethren ought to take it to heart. If we have a good morning meeting we need to see that our houses gain by it. The meetings should be a reflection of what we are going on with in our houses.
Rem. It works both ways, what we bring out of our houses and what we bring in to them.
CHAPTER 8
J.T. We had David's military prowess before us earlier and this chapter affords us a general view of it. The details of some of these conquests are given later in the book, but the great features of his military exploits are seen here, and the object in view, namely, subjugation of territory and of persons. In Joshua's time the conflict and battles were rather for extermination,
{66}
so that we have to consider the difference. The word 'subdue' is one of the key words of David's reign. It has a force bearing on ourselves as under grace, not for extermination, but for subjugation. "And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them".
Rem. I think you were saying previously that verse 1 of chapter 7 chronologically anticipates this chapter.
J.T. Just so, "from *all* his enemies". So that the chapters are not exactly chronological, they are in moral sequence, I suppose.
Ques. Is David a type of Christ here? "He must reign until he put all enemies under his feet", @1 Corinthians 15:25.
J.T. Subjugation is the thought. Extermination is the leading thought of Joshua's conquests because there enemies are typical of wicked spirits or principles, whereas here actual persons are in question, and God is not exterminating persons until they are wholly committed to evil principles.
Rem. Yet he takes the territory when he goes out after it. He apparently secures the persons for himself. "And David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus", verse 6: "And he put garrisons in Edom", verse 14.
J.T. Quite so. Territory is involved. He went to recover his dominion by the Euphrates; he was pushing his conquests to the utmost limits of the territory promised to Israel, but he was not clearing the territory of its inhabitants as in Joshua's time, he subdued them.
Rem. In Joshua's time the enemy would occupy divine territory.
J.T. They are wicked spirits in heavenly places. Iniquity had come to the full. Israel had in fact to wait for the iniquity of the Amorites to be full. With David it is subjugation of the territory and of the persons in it.
{67}
Ques. Is this the effect of the gospel on ourselves?
J.T. It is more than that because you have results. They brought gifts in verse 2, and then we have gifts again in verse 6. And then "David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer", verse 7; and in verse 10, "he brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze. Them also king David dedicated to Jehovah". So that it is one line of thought throughout the chapter, the result for God in the way of gifts or spoils.
Ques. Is it more in line with the epistle to the Romans?
J.T. I think it is subjugation and something accruing in subjugated persons; some give gifts and others have things taken from them, so that God has something "dedicated to Jehovah". Romans enters into it, but the first great thought is the power of the capital that David has taken out of the hand of the Philistines, the power to hold the saints in subjugation. "The power of the capital", verse I, is the great point to see in the chapter.
Ques. What is that?
J.T. The allusion is to organised power centred in the capital or metropolis.
Ques. Is it significant that David took the head of the giant there? He was of Gath!
J.T. It seems as if Gath was the leading town or city of the Philistine country. The king lived there in David's earlier time. It would therefore allude to an organisation of the enemy to hold the saints in captivity. The power of the capital would mean a combination, an organisation, as the most potent means of opposing God. But He has had recourse to organisation too. The world became organised, and that was when it became most powerful against God. Matthew has the idea of two, whether for good or for evil: it alludes to power or centralisation. I suppose the capital would mean centralisation. "... Let us
{68}
build ourselves a city and a tower", @Genesis 11:4, Babel, that was, and the people had to be scattered abroad.
Ques. How does the thought of extermination work out?
J.T. It works out in Joshua, the inhabitants were all to be exterminated. There it is a question of Satan's representation. It was a developed thing, there was no salvation for that at all. But under David it was not that. There was no thought of the iniquity of any of these countries becoming full, but of taking the territory and the people, taking them as subdued, so that it applies to ourselves. The gospel is for the obedience of faith among the nations; @Romans 1:5.
Ques. In regard to ourselves, does the thought of extermination also apply?
J.T. The application of extermination would be in putting to death the evil principles that are in us.
Ques. Is there different treatment of the Philistines? "He smote the Philistines, and subdued them"; and with Moab, "he smote the Moabites, and measured them".
J.T. It is a remarkable thing. He "measured them with a line, making them lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive". That seems to me to fit in with @Romans 7, two lines for death and one full line for life. I believe Romans develops these thoughts.
Rem. "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God", @Romans 3:23. That would suggest measure.
J.T. I think so. @Romans 3 brings in the law. Both Jew and Gentile are brought in under sin, a sort of line. Jew and Gentile had been tested and brought in guilty by measure. One of the two lines would be the law. There is a line which determines
{69}
their fate, whether for death or for life. The "much more", I think, in @Romans 5 is the "one full line".
Ques. Do the Philistines represent an organised body against the truth?
J.T. I think that is what is meant. There are two words used: "Metheg-ha-ammah", or the power of the key of the capital. It is one word in the Authorised Version, but there are two ideas, not only the capital, but the key to it. If it be the rule of heaven or of principalities or powers in the heavenlies the key implies the way to get to it. The Lord Jesus says that He has the key of David, and the keys of Hades and of death. The word 'power' would be the way of getting at the thing, the great power of it, to be exerted either for good or for evil. If David got it he would use it for good. Christ has taken the power of influencing men from the devil and He is using it for good.
Ques. Do the Philistines represent some aspect of this world?
J.T. It could easily be shown what the Philistines are, and the Moabites, and the Syrians, and the Ammonites, and so forth; but this point of the capital or metropolis is of the greatest importance for young Christians especially. It is not simply Satan personally, but the organisation he has, his allies, a regular coterie of powerful intelligencies under his control. Satan is said to be "the prince of this world", (@John 12:31) "the prince of the power of the air", (@Ephesians 2:2) and so forth, so that the idea of organisation enters into his mode of opposition to God.
Ques. Is Paul attacking that element in Corinthians from the outset, gifted, powerful persons in cliques?
J.T. Just so. You mean, I apprehend, that it begins with parties. Some say, "I am of Paul", etc. Paul used only his own name and that of Apollos to illustrate what was there. He was alluding to
{70}
local leaders. Satan would bring the saints into bondage through them.
Rem. In the end of Matthew the Lord says: "All power has been given me";(@Matthew 28:18) then He organises them and sends them out in relation to what is good, to make disciples.
J.T. Matthew deals with two, whether for good or evil; that is where the assembly comes in. What power there is!
Ques. Is the last paragraph of this chapter in moral sequence to the first?
J.T. You mean it is David's regime, David is governing. It is a complete system of government with departments, his cabinet, in modern language.
Rem. And supersedes what was holding control in the first paragraph: "... delivered us from the authority of darkness", @Colossians 1:13.
J.T. That is very good. It is remarkable how the saints may be brought into it as influencing for good.
Rem. Your suggestion about Satan's organisation is helpful. If this world is organised, its politics, its citizenship, etc., God will not bring us out of that to be left idle or to have nothing to do; there is a great regime in which to have part.
Ques. Were the gifts in this chapter brought willingly?
J.T. The thought of gift in the anti-type would be: "present your bodies a living sacrifice", @Romans 12:1. Those who were once enemies are now subdued. God has so become known to us in Christ that we yield ourselves to God. This matter of organisation is worth following up. God brings us into His system of things and puts us into office according to that for which we are fitted. "And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was chronicler; and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was scribe; and Benaiah the son of
{71}
Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers", verse 16 - 18. I think we have the suggestion of each believer being brought into the system that God has. According to Romans we yield ourselves to God as alive from among the dead, instruments to God. Each has his place so that God carries on with the same principle for deliverance as that with which Satan carries on for captivation.
Rem. In the beginning of the Acts you have the organisation working properly. The apostles respected Peter. If the apostles recognised Peter there was no difficulty about his preaching at Pentecost.
J.T. They recognised his place. These converts discerned that the apostles were something different. They said: "What shall we do, brethren?" (@Acts 2:37).
Rem. The apostle Paul speaking to Timothy says that he was appointed a preacher and an apostle. Would that be his position in this cabinet?
J.T. Quite so. He uses the word 'minister' in speaking to Agrippa, who would understand him, not simply 'bondman'. He was appointed a minister, a dignified office. God appointed him to be that.
Rem. That scripture in which Paul says: "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief", @1 Timothy 1:15, would be like a gift of a subdued Philistine; it enriches the assembly, does it not?
J.T. I think we ought to pursue that, that each of us might get into his mind the idea of being brought into a new system, and taken on according to what he is able to do. "Why stand ye here all the day idle?"(@Matthew 20:6) Satan does not allow *his* votaries to be idle.
Ques. Is not this idea of subjugation a certain process with me, until I arrive at the perfect and acceptable will of God?
{72}
J.T. Romans is the doctrinal development of all this so that the believer is subdued as "garrisoned". "Garrisoned" is another good word of the chapter, meaning there is power to hold things, like the Spirit in us, shedding abroad the love of God. We are held and then we present our bodies to be used in the system. @Romans 6 shows how the members are holy instruments of righteousness, and then in chapter 12 our bodies are presented, so that everyone is subdued, garrisoned, used, and gives gifts.
Ques. Is it not remarkable that Romans anticipates priesthood amongst us, whereas if we think about what is levitical we have to go to Corinthians? I was wondering whether the idea of priesthood understood by us would help us to be taken on for service, for work.
J.T. You will notice that there are two priests here. There is one military, man, one chronicler, one scribe, but there are two priests, showing that there are more priests needed than any other official.
That is one brother and one sister, so to speak. You could hardly get a sister to be military, but two priests would mean that more of these are needed. Sisters are brought into the priesthood. Generally speaking every bit of levitical service is clothed in priestly service. We have prayer at the beginning and ending of our meetings, two prayers for one sermon. And how many before the gospel! The two in the priestly office here is a suggestion. It is what is now needed, and these meetings for prayer in the houses before the gospel are used of God. I suppose those of us who preach know that. A brother is waiting on the Lord for a word and the brethren are praying downstairs; well he will get it more quickly. This is practised all over the world now, very largely, and God blesses it.
Rem. And it is generally more effective in the house, too, the volume is greater.
{73}
J.T. What you bring out of your house is a great thought in the Scriptures. It must be a *baptised* house, of course, that is, where the Lord's death is recognised; you cannot get anything save on that principle, the death of Christ.
Ques. I was wondering whether baptism must underlie all this.
J.T. Romans stresses that. The principle is in chapter 6. Corinthians is the collective thought.
Ques. What would you do in a mixed household where the head of the house is not with us?
J.T. That is an abnormal condition, but of course, if the head is ready to kneel down and pray you can do that. If he does not do that he is hardly a Christian at all.
Ques. Why are these two lines to be put to death?
J.T. It seems to be that God gives full testimony to His judgment, "... that *thou* shouldest be justified", @Romans 3:4. And there is one full line for life. @Romans 7 is a great line for inward state that has to be judged.
Rem. The thought of prayer in regard to Paul is significant, his whole service is built up on that preliminary priestly service.
J.T. Just so, following on the Lord in Luke. He was all night in prayer to God (@Luke 6:12), and He went up into the mount of transfiguration to pray, not to be transfigured. Think of a man going up that high mountain to *pray* ! And as He prayed His countenance was changed, showing what heaven thought of His praying.
Rem. Toi, king of Hamath, respects David. He is already subjugated, he sent his son to congratulate David on having smitten Hadadezer. Hadadezer must have been a very quarrelsome man.
Ques. Is it like a soul delivered from the power of the world, and in the sense of his liberation from it he yields something to the Lord?
{74}
J.T. He is released, from Hadadezer's quarrelsome power over him; many Christians are like that. "And Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him", verse 10. David is in his mind. He evidently has a sense of gratitude to David.
Rem. This man had territory to which he had no right; verse 12 speaks of "the spoil of Hadadezer". How like the enemy! He has taken over territory that does not belong to him. Toi had been affected by that.
Ques. These vessels are of silver and gold and bronze. Is that the idea today, as vessels of mercy we fit into this organisation?
J.T. I think so. That is Romans, each believer is constituted useful for the tabernacle. "Them also king David dedicated to Jehovah", vessels for His use. Metals, too, were evidently needed.
Rem. If we read Chronicles we should be impressed with the amount David gave to the house.
J.T. These would be included in the great abundance of @1 Chronicles 22, but then David had his own private gold that he gave besides.
Ques. Concerning prayer, the Lord went up into a mountain at one time and at another into the desert to pray. Would the place have something to do with it?
J.T. Quite so. In the desert you are away from all that would minister to the flesh. The mountain is moral elevation. And then the duration of His prayer is mentioned too, "all night".
Ques. All these nations have been enemies to Israel. They are all now subjugated to David and garrisons are put into these places. Would the local assembly in each place be garrisoned?
J.T. Take us here in New York tonight, for example. We are composed of brethren from Germany, Ireland, England, Scotland, and many other
{75}
nations. We were all "enemies in mind by wicked works", (@Colossians 1:21) every one of us, and the Lord has taken us on and He has put garrisons, the Holy Spirit, in us. We each bring and give material dedicated to God.
Ques. What does gold and silver metal as distinct from the vessels suggest?
J.T. I think that metals are generally material. Vessels, of course, are already made, ready for use, but metals would be potential material. God has to form us in view of use, it is material *for* something. Gold would be seen in any brother or sister whom God would use to set out Himself, what He is in holiness and righteousness in testimony. Silver, I
think, would mean that we are vessels of love, I believe silver carries with it the thought of love. Whatever the metal may be it is a potential thing.
Rem. The apostle seems to have been called a "vessel", @Acts 9:15.
J.T. That is a remarkable thing. He is the only one, I think, alluded to in that way. In general the metal would be potential material in the assembly. The work of God in a number of persons in a town as at Corinth would be potential to the position, and then God works in detail and forms vessels out of them.
Rem. It is "much people" rather than many people; @Acts 18:10.
Rem. The Lord said to Paul, "I have much people in this city", @Acts 18:10. I suppose the Lord had a garrison in mind, the houses of Stephanas, Chloe and others.
J.T. I think the "much people" is a question of a holding in a town or territory. A man owning an oil field has a holding of value, but the thing has to be worked. In Corinth the Lord had potentially a great holding, and He wanted to get out of it all possible. Of the household of Stephanas, the apostle looking backward says, "I baptised also the house of Stephanas", @1 Corinthians 1:16, as much as to say, That
{76}
house is going to be used in that way, as a sphere of operations in Corinth. It is useable, not any longer a potentiality, but useable. The house of Chloe was useable too. She had something that was of great service to the testimony.
Rem. The oil field of itself is not much good unless you have the machinery to get out the oil.
Rem. Vessels would suggest what is at hand and ready to be used. Timothy was ready to be used.
J.T. Quite so. Paul took him up at once because he was well reported of by the brethren in the district.
Ques. In view of there being "much people", would not Paul stay there until the material was useable?
J.T. Quite so. He stayed eighteen months, the longest period spent anywhere except for Ephesus. It is a question of potentiality in a place, what God can get out of it. What has He in your town? There must be one vessel with which to start.
Ques. Would this have any connection with @Jeremiah 18?
J.T. You might bring that in. The allusion there is to display. The potter was making a vessel and it was marred and he made another. That goes on, I suppose, in every meeting. A good many had to be made over again in Corinth. @Romans 6 shows how you dedicate yourself and @Romans 12 is a holy vessel dedicated on the principle of sacrifice.
Rem. I was thinking of that. The war was over with Hadadezer. I suppose when a war is over the spoils and the dedicated things begin to come forward.
J.T. You can see that with Toi, king of Hamath; he has the kind of spirit that suggests a volume of dedicated things: "Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him; for Hadadezer was continually at war with Toi. And he brought with him vessels of silver,
{77}
and vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze", verse 10. He has David in his mind in the sense of gratitude to him. He is already long subjugated and he brings with him the vessels. "Them also king David dedicated to Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he had dedicated of all the nations that he had subdued: of the Syrians, and of the Moabites, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of the Amalekites", etc. That is a great paragraph for this question of dedicated things.
Ques. Would Luke parallel this with the woman who was made straight?
J.T. Luke is full of this, full of the idea of glorifying God. She glorified God. Take the case of Peter's wife's mother, "standing up she served them", @Luke 4:39, the result was immediate.
Rem. Of the woman in @Luke 13 it says that she was a daughter of Abraham, as if she were a vessel. Satan had subjugated her for eighteen years, and now she is released.
Rem. Luke perhaps rises to a higher level than we realise. The idea of glorifying God is seen throughout the book, especially with the leper; @Luke 17:15.
J.T. There are immediate results for God in every case. It is very beautiful, the line of glory in Luke, "glorifying God".
CHAPTER 10
J.T. To see the bearing of this chapter we should hold in view what came out last week. The ninth chapter sets out grace. The eighth chapter is the epitome of David's military exploits, and the arrangement of the different departments in his kingdom.
In the ninth there is grace to show the character of the kingdom: "Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness?"(@2 Samuel 9:1)
{78}
Then *this* chapter records wars that have already been alluded to in chapter 8 only that they are brought in here in detail, evidently to show how men do despite to the spirit of grace, as manifested in chapter 9.
It is what the kingdom *is* here. It is followed up by the further expression of grace towards the children of Ammon, and the king of Ammon despises it.
Rem. The expression of grace is always a test to a man. Mephibosheth responded to it wonderfully.
Rem. The Ammonites were related to Israel. That would make it more serious.
J.T. It is a serious thing to despise grace. Mephibosheth appreciated it and carried his appreciation right through.
Ques. Did David show kindness here on account of kindness that had been shown to him?
J.T. It is not recorded anywhere else. It would show that he himself had a great appreciation of grace. There is no record of what this grace was, the kindness that the king of Ammon had shown. It would bring out that David had the good sense to reciprocate, showing what he was in that way, how he would remember. It may have been a small matter, possibly, when he was rejected and fleeing from Saul, but anyway he was a man who would bear in mind what good was shown him, a very important trait in any one of us.
Ques. Do you think the wells of grace were springing up in David's heart? Grace was always there ready. Mephibosheth had no title to it and yet he pours it out on him, and now it flows out toward this person.
J.T. It seems as though that is the point, to bring out a beautiful trait in David, what he was as representative of God. Grace acts of itself as in chapter 9, but it also acts reciprocally, which is an important thing, because we are likely to forget kindness shown
{79}
to us. So that these chapters, 9 and 10, are to bring out in detail what the kingdom was. We have the establishment of it and then what it was as represented in the king's overtures to Mephibosheth, an undeserved expression of grace. Here it is deserved, at least if Nahash the king of Ammon is taken to represent the Jews. Perhaps it suggests what Israel had been on the historical line, what the fathers had been and so forth. But now this young man is reigning, he had come to the throne recently; he had no sense of grace at all, but is rather imputing evil motives, so that we are in the presence of a very serious state of things. No doubt the anti-type is in the Acts where the overtures of God to Israel are reciprocated by some.
Rem. These evil motives are imputed by the princes of the children of Ammon. Are they representative of Christendom?
J.T. I suppose so. It is his kingdom over against David's kingdom. "I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Is it, in thine eyes, to honour thy father that David has sent comforters to thee? Is it not to search the city and to spy it out, and to overthrow it, that David has sent his servants to thee?" He takes their advice without question. It is a state of things that makes the rendering of help impossible. There is no ground for this suspicion, so that it seems an impossible state of things; and what ensues is very solemn and searching because it seems to be the most severe of David's contests, a very severe part of his military operations. We have to meet this kind of thing in brethren and the conflict is bound to be severe, because we are dealing with suspicion.
{80}
Rem. Perhaps these servants of David would represent some of our brethren who are on the line of shepherding.
J.T. It made the attitude of the king of Ammon all the more serious because they were there. Did they look like spies? That is the point. These men were representatives of David, and the Ammonites were imputing motives to them.
Rem. It is like the early chapters of Acts where they mistrusted the approach of God in grace. The religious leaders and princes were along these lines, throwing back the grace of God.
J.T. If we were to look for the antitype it would be, I suppose, as a response in the remnant, represented in Mephibosheth, who responded; and on the other hand as rejection in the Jews, represented by these Ammonites. They were distant relatives to Israel as the Jews were to the Christians, but instead of response to grace and the appreciation of it, there was suspicion and persecution.
Ques. Paul refers to the princes of this world having crucified the Lord of glory; (@1 Corinthians 2:8). Would it be something akin to this?
J.T. Quite so, they are princes of this world.
Ques. I wondered whether that would be the treatment John and Peter got from those men in the early part of Acts. It was very undignified treatment to give on the presentation of grace. They had cured the crippled man and done other acts that brought grace forward but they were imprisoned as a result.
J.T. And then there was Stephen, he went further. All that you speak of led up to him. Chapter 5 brings out perhaps the most ignominious attitude of the authorities, they "put them in the common prison", (@Acts 5:18) they evidently gave them no respect at all. They were not common felons, there was no charge to be sustained. Gamaliel's warning, "take heed to yourselves as regards these men what ye are going
{81}
to do", etc. (@Acts 5:35), was some evidence that they were representatives of God, yet they were put into the common prison.
Ques. Did David's move mean the overthrow of the cities? Does grace approach men like that to secure them for its kingdom?
J.T. By what they say about the city they apparently mean to convey that David's profession of favour is unreal. Their thought is merely political. Is it not unfair that people, when grace is proposed, should take up the attitude that you have some sinister motive in what you are doing? "These men utterly trouble our city", they say in @Acts 16:20.
One might have thought they were going to overthrow it! But in what sense could it be overthrown? To convert people in a city would do no harm. What could there be but goodness behind all this?
Ques. Does not their treatment of the servants of David mean emphatically that they wish to give a one-sided impression?
J.T. You mean that the very appearance of the servants of David would indicate that they had been one-sided?
Rem. Well, it would give that impression.
J.T. I suppose it was a form of indignity, a well- known method of heaping scorn and reproach on people. They were certainly most unsightly. It was designed. They "insulted the Spirit of grace",
(@Hebrews 10:29). It was really uncalled for, because the matter was not proved, it was all suspicion, anyway, a poignant thrust at David. They said in effect, That is what we think of your attitude. And of course it was readily understood by David, because they saw that they had become odious in his sight. "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish", @Acts 13:41. That sort of thing came out particularly against Paul; "for I work a work in your days, a
{82}
work which ye will in no wise believe if one declare it to you" (@Acts 13:41).
Ques. Do you think they were acting on what David had done to other kings, forgetting what Moses had written, that Israel should not take any of the land of the Ammonites?
J.T. Well, David was not taking it. He certainly was very gracious to them. There is not the slightest intention on his part of taking their land. He did ultimately, but this is the provocation. This chapter is to bring out how unfair they were and how they brought on their own judgment, and so it is a fine chapter for the gospel.
Rem. The servants of God have no thought of overthrowing the nations.
J.T. This was a very simple offer of grace, it just expressed kindness, or congratulations or sympathies.
Rem. They terribly misconstrued the feelings of David in his approach to them in the desire to show kindness, and the way in which they treat his servants shows that they wanted David to understand fully how they felt about it.
J.T. It is the reproach entering into it. If they had put them to death it would hardly have been so bad, as such an indignity!
Rem. The emissaries act like true servants of David, they did not contend. "He shall not strive", @Matthew 12:19. They just gave David's message.
Ques. Is the extension of the administration of the kingdom by ambassadorship?
J.T. That is what Paul calls himself, "We are ambassadors therefore for Christ", @2 Corinthians 5:20. I think it must mean the unfair, inexcusable attitude of the Jews. There was testimony in some of a response to this grace, some valued it, like Mephibosheth, but others did not, and professed to think there were sinister motives behind it. It comes out in the way they acted toward Paul.
{83}
Rem. These people hired the Syrians.
J.T. Quite so. David does not attack them at once, hut he sent to meet the messengers, "for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Abide at Jericho until your beards he grown, and then return". That is all it says. There is no evidence that David was preparing to attack the Ammonites, he was not revengeful. Grace is grace, and it reigns, it does not come down off the throne. David does not prepare to attack them until they prepare to attack him.
Ques. Is that conveyed in the idea of his telling the men to abide at Jericho. If reproach is put upon them they accept it.
J.T. Quite so, and they had the power of life to remedy the thing. They could grow their beards. As regards their clothes, that could easily he met, the clothes of gracious people can easily he replaced. "Let thy priests he clothed with righteousness", @Psalm 132:9. So that the whole position is remedied in the way they return to Jerusalem, the whole position is unimpaired. The attack is from the Ammonites¬ side, they followed up the indignity by preparing for war. Paul and Silas were unaffected by the sufferings of Philippi; @Acts 16.
Ques. Is there any suggestion of taking on Nazariteship?
J.T. It is not Nazariteship here, it is full-grown beards. I think the beards and proper dress represented David, ambassadors of David. Ammon did despite to David by disfiguring these men, but life would remedy all that. David would feel the shame of it and gain through it, so that what we ought to see here is that grace is on the throne unimpaired. David is not retaliating, he tells them to stay at Jericho until their beards are grown; the whole position is rectified. The insinuation of evil is in the Ammonites and it is their own judgment that
{84}
they were odious to him. Perhaps their judgment was right.
Rem. They had a guilty conscience.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. After persecutions in the Acts the assembly became stronger. Is not that important today? We grow under pressure.
J.T. We are told the number added in @Acts 4 and then in chapter 9 we are told that after the great pressure put upon them by Saul the assemblies were edified and increased; verse 31.
Rem. "In pressure thou hast enlarged me", @Psalm 4:1.
J.T. David did not lose the sense of grace, that is the great thing in dealing with these hard-hearted conditions. He retains his balance and these men come back to Jerusalem to hold the position as it was. That the Ammonites were odious to David we learn from themselves.
Rem. Now they realise that they have made a mistake.
J.T. And then they go to hire people. That is not a principle with God, to hire people to fight for you. Under these circumstances they have allies and pay them.
Rem. So that Christendom has its hirelings today.
J.T. Yes, these people finding they were odious could have made amends, but instead of that they proceeded to war. Where we resent grace we have to cast about to keep ourselves secure.
Ques. Does not the attitude of grace and the refusal of it work amongst ourselves as well as in the gospel?
J.T. You may be sure that if I refuse the overtures of grace and my conscience smites me I shall make it appear that I have been offended! Our eyes are so dim that these things come up and we think we are the wronged ones. How did they know that they
{85}
were odious? They are impugning the great system of grace that is set up. Then the next thing is that we link on with others, so that they hire these people, whereas they might have settled it all if they had humbled themselves and confessed to David. The lesson to be learned is that David is David still, and his servants are the same. There is no resentment, David just instructed them to go to Jericho and they went.
Rem. They expect sudden judgment, but the thing is pending, grace is on the throne. "For where we sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there ... remains ... a certain fearful expectation of judgment", @Hebrews 10:26, 27.
J.T. I think that is the passage that corresponds. David is maintaining his ground as on the throne of grace, and they are taking the initiative, they are hiring soldiers. David is not even marshalling his army until they do something against him.
Rem. That comes at the return of the year in the next chapter.
J.T. Yes, but here in verse 7, "David heard of it"; and then we are told in verse 15 that "when the Syrians saw that they were routed before Israel, they gathered themselves together. And Hadarezer sent, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river; and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them. And it was told David". They take the initiative and he hears this. Then comes the supreme moment. It says, "it was told David; and he gathered all Israel", as if it were a supreme matter. In fact it is; I do not know that you get such an impression as this before -- "all Israel".
Rem. David did not slay anyone, they fled before him, but in the last section you get certain ones slain.
J.T. I think we learn about the tremendous slaughter from verse 18. "David slew of the
{86}
Syrians seven hundred in chariots, and forty thousand horsemen".
Ques. Is it the spirit of the organised religions around us at the present time?
J.T. It seems so. This hiring soldiers under these circumstances is a most distressing feature; to reach out for aids and allies to meet conditions, where grace is despised, though in truth there is nothing to meet, it is pure grace.
Rem. Saul of Tarsus really did despite to the spirit of grace and yet in the ninth chapter of Acts we see grace still reigning. The Lord did not change at all.
J.T. Quite so. Chapter 9 is a wonderful chapter of grace: "why persecutest thou *me* ?", @Acts 9:4. And then there is this question of hiring; we are not sensible of the grace that would give us something for nothing. We think things have to be bought and paid for. It is the feeling that you serve me and I will serve you, I am indebted to you. These people go a long way with it, they get the Syrians from beyond the river.
Ques. Is this the situation when the ministry is refused?
Rem. We might get allies against the truth. It is a serious thing when we get allies against the servants of the Lord, combinations against certain ones.
Ques. Do we not come into the blessing of grace individually? Repentance is an individual affair.
Ques. Would you not say that where the government of God applies against an individual or a group, the tendency is to put the blame on someone else, as they did on David here?
J.T. They saw that they were odious in David's eyes, but he had not said so. That is a common sort of thing. One may say, See how that brother treats me now! Perhaps the trouble is with one's own judgment.
Rem. David does not recede from his original
{87}
attitude until they compel him to do so by their own action.
J.T. They make great preparations. It is really one of the most serious conflicts with which he had to do. Where grace is despised war of peculiar magnitude arises all the way through. "And the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David; and the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-Rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men" -- a big array! David is doing nothing, but when he heard of all this array of power he sends Joab and the mighty men. "And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind". This is a serious matter, the men mean war, and they are searching out all the allies they can get. It is a wide spiritual matter.
Ques. Do you look at Joab's strategy as commendable here? It is wonderful the way he manoeuvres his army in verse 11, so that it is working together. As far as we can see the Israelites¬ position is united, they can move this way or that way together. The others are separate, they are making a show of their allies. Joab says: "Be strong, and let us show ourselves valiant for our people and for the cities of our God".
J.T. Joab is thinking of the divine heritage that would be threatened by this attack.
Rem. The combination is broken.
Ques. Does the intervention of God on behalf of David cause the Syrians to realise their own mistake?
J.T. Quite so. The allies saw their mistake; but this is a remarkable conflict, I do not think there is a more severe one in the whole record.
Rem. The choice men are set against the Syrians. They apparently were stronger. The Ammonites
{88}
run off. They do not fight. They are just governed by others, and are not fighters at all.
Rem. The Syrians are dealt with in this chapter and the Ammonites in the next. The Syrians are dealt with summarily, whereas Ammon waits.
J.T. They seem to be very powerful. They represent the element among us which, if a deflection takes place, is always ready to be drawn into it. They are historical enemies of Israel.
Rem. In an earlier remark Joab said: "and Jehovah do what is good in his sight". It seems that the grace of David was really imparted to Joab.
J.T. One has often seen it where God is working in a meeting that brothers you might expect would be difficult are not so. They are brought under the power of grace.
Rem. Sometimes in a locality you find gracious feelings misconstrued. It might seem a very simple matter at the beginning, but Satan is there ready to augment the trouble, and a small matter develops into a warfare and a serious issue.
J.T. The way that David holds his ground in grace is a lesson for us, not to be drawn into the thing. Grace reigns in our dispensation and our attitude should not be warlike. David does nothing, they take the initiative in every case.
Rem. These ambassadors are like David. That spirit should be with us.
J.T. I suppose if you met them coming up from Jericho they would look better than when they left. They would have gained ground through that experience and would be ready for any enterprise like this and would do still better.
Rem. These men at Jericho would have grown morally. The Lord came into Jericho and passed through; what did He think? This is what they would learn, they would be greater men than before.
{89}
J.T. I am sure of it. They would augment David's position. Nothing brings out the moral power of the kingdom more than what is seen in Christ in @Matthew 26 and 27, and the corresponding chapters in the other gospels. How utterly unaffected He was by what happened! He is Himself. Even on the cross He is Himself: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do", @Luke 23:34. We get irritated when grace is refused and are likely to discredit what we represent, but with Christ it was never so. Even Paul and Silas, wonderful as they were, said when the time came for their release, "let them come themselves and bring us out", @Acts 16:37. It seems as if they dropped a little bit there, They said, as it were, We are Romans and they have imprisoned us unfairly. Well, Romans are not characteristically men of grace, heavenly men.
Rem. The Lord referred to the spirit, "Ye know not of what spirit ye are", @Luke 9:55.
Rem. The Lord in reading the Scriptures closed the book at the proper moment.
J.T. That shows how the Lord officially fixed the position, what is called the "acceptable year": "to preach the acceptable year of the Lord", @Luke 4:19. That year finished where He stopped.
Ques. How much judgment do you bring into gospel preaching?
J.T. Of course it has been revealed from heaven. Romans merely puts it that it is *revealed*, "in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God", @Romans 2:5. He is not saying it is operative, that is the position. It is grace to remind men that this is so. That is how it stands in Romans.
Rem. They are treasuring up wrath.
Rem. There was no judgment executed on Ammon until the return of the year. We see the extension there.
{90}
CHAPTER 11:14 - 27; 12:1 - 23
J.T. In chapter 9 we have the kingdom, seen in David, expressing grace toward Mephibosheth. In chapter 10, we have grace extended to the Ammonites, and despised. Now we are to consider the teaching of chapters 11 and 12, as to whether they are simply instruction for each individual as such, or whether they also teach us something further of the kingdom. If so, they must be regarded collectively as well as individually, bringing out the history of the public testimony particularly in its bearing towards man. They teach us the public breakdown and how it is met.
Ques. Would that side of it lead on to David's leaving Jerusalem?
J.T. The beginning of the 11th chapter shows, I think, the failure in the kingly side, though not in Christ, of course, for David does not represent Christ personally here, he represents the *authoritative side in the public body*.
Ques. I would like some more help on the collective setting. Would you say a little as to the cause of the breakdown? What was the root of the trouble?
J.T. In the history of the public body it would seem that the kingly or responsible side gave way. We are told in the book of Proverbs what a king should do and what he should avoid. Lemuel's mother enjoins him as to what would save him, and David represents that side in chapters 9 and 10. Grace is exhibited. In chapter 9 it is appreciated by Mephibosheth and in chapter 10 it is not appreciated, yet still the position is unimpaired; David retains his attitude of grace in spite of the unfair and inexcusable attitude of the king of Ammon. Now in chapter 11 it is "the time when kings go forth", "at the return of the year", and David fails. It is a changeover in the course of things, but a change implying that kings go forth. When there is a change we need
{91}
those in authority to hold the ground, and not to let it slip.
Rem. Perhaps a reference to the letter to Ephesus would fit, "To the angel of the assembly" (@Revelation 2:1).
J.T. It fits all the way through, there particularly. Here it would seem that the responsible element failed at a time when it was most needed. "When kings go forth", David was wanting. He committed things over into the hands of others. That is the secret of the whole position, he did not hold his ground.
Rem. The thought of slackness of outlook would mean that the authority of Christ has not the weight it should. It often happens with us that the first cause of deflection is slackness of spiritual outlook.
J.T. If we fail in that, the authority of Christ is no longer in evidence and we drop down to the level of men.
Ques. When that takes place does the prophetic word come in?
J.T. That is the next thing to see after the failure, how it is met. I think we shall see that it is a very extraordinary prophetic word.
Rem. According to @Psalm 51 the effect of David's self-judgment seems to be much wider than merely on himself personally, does it not?
J.T. You feel that it must go beyond the individual; it must be an allusion to the public history of the testimony, as this whole book is, David at times representing Christ and at times the responsible element in humiliating failure. In this latter aspect the authority of Christ is out of view, and Joab, an untrustworthy man, is conniving at wickedness.
According to @Deuteronomy 17 the king was not to multiply wives and horses.
Rem. Nor was he to go to the right hand or the left; verse 20.
Ques. Is there an allusion to the Nazarite in the
{92}
chapter referred to in Proverbs? The king was not to take wives or to drink wine; chapter 31:3, 4.
J.T. That is good. It is a question of what would excite.
Rem. The allusion in that chapter, "Give not thy strength unto women", (@Proverbs 31:3) applies to what we have here. It appears to refer back to the injunction to a Nazarite, @Numbers 6.
J.T. It seems to be a basis for authority in the assembly. All these allusions would seem to enter into this section for the instruction of the responsible or kingly element, represented in men, elder brothers.
"The shout of a king" ought to be amongst the brethren, but it is stifled here by the state of David; when he should have been standing out at the turn of the year, he failed.
Rem. Say more about the authority side. We are likely to look at the idea of a king as an abstract thought rather than as the authority in us by the Spirit.
J.T. "A king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment", @Isaiah 32:1. That feature is not in evidence here because David is sitting at home when he should go forth, and is handing the thing over to an untrustworthy man who ultimately connived at the wickedness that developed. Over against that the characters that come into view are: Urijah, the overcomer, who represents loyalty to the truth in the whole position, and Nathan, who comes in from God's side on the prophetic line to convict.
Rem. The turn of the year would correspond to every new phase in the testimony, and there is a danger with us of giving up the idea of warfare and succumbing to ease and the indulgence of the flesh. We must always quit ourselves like men and engage in the conflict. One feels how easy it is to get slack in one's spiritual outlook and really to forget that
{93}
the testimony is in conflict, and will be so long as we are here. It is not time to ease off because the Lord has given us a victory, but to be ready for the next phase, for there will always be a next phase.
J.T. So that in a crisis a brother may stay at home from a care meeting, but he is needed there. Kings are needed there. We are not to let the matter go and allow someone else to take the responsibility.
Rem. The leaders at Corinth were reigning as kings. I suppose those of the house of Chloe were more royal than the leaders at Corinth.
J.T. Quite so. The leaders were not princes, the princely element was missing.
Ques. In chapter 3, when Abner wanted to turn the kingdom over to David, David said, "Thou shall not see my face except thou first bring Michal, Saul's daughter", @2 Samuel 3:13. Does that also enter into this section?
J.T. You mean that a woman like Michal could not help the situation?
Rem. You said, when we were dwelling on that passage, that David's mind was running on those things.
J.T. Yes. Why did he want Michal there, a person who had so manifestly failed? The history here shows that she was a source of weakness throughout.
Rem. I suppose at Corinth Paul was a king going forth.
J.T. And some in the house of Chloe and the house of Stephanas were princely men, ready for things, not reigning but going forth.
Rem. Anything less than manhood is surrendering ground and would be disastrous.
J.T. In a crisis you will observe that a point is reached, a real victory is reached, but what then? As someone said of a great military leader, "What did he do the day after?" The enemy gets in
{94}
immediately because he is skilful in military affairs, so that the need is to keep on the line in which God has given us victory. There is always sure to be a reactionary spirit.
Rem. If, after a victory, we become slack, we often succumb to something much less.
Ques. Do you mean to convey that if we have had a victory today we need to put on our military uniform to-morrow?
J.T. 'Consolidate' is a good word, because there is sure to be a counter-attack. There is a reaction, and the position is weakened. Much had happened during the year, victories had been won and grace shown; now there is another year coming in and "David sent Joab, and his servants with him! And all Israel". You might say, "What more could he do?" But *the king* was not there! It is said of Josiah that "the king stood in his place", (@2 Chronicles 34:31) that is one of the great features of Josiah's revival. Everybody was in his place. Here the king is not in his place, strikingly so, because the year required that he should go forth.
Rem. A reference to the Song of Solomon would fit in: "Behold his couch, Solomon's own: three-score mighty men are about it, of the mighty of Israel. They all hold the sword, experts in war",
(@Song of Songs 3: 7, 8). Does this not show that the position, even while we are enjoying what is greatest, is to be held abstractly? We are not on the battlefield but still the military idea is there.
J.T. These expert men are there on the alert, "because of alarm in the nights". (@Song of Songs 3:8) As surely as possible there will be a counter-attack and the king is needed then more than ever. "Three-score mighty men are about it"; but then, there is a palanquin there, and that is most precious. The reference is to a portable chair as used in the east: "King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon.
{95}
Its pillars he made of silver, its support of gold, its seat of purple; the midst thereof was paved with love", @Song of Songs 3:9,10. That is a beautiful touch coming in after the military watchfulness. And the threescore mighty men are there, each having his sword upon his thigh, where it should be for alertness.
Ques. Whom did you say Urijah represents?
J.T. I think he is an overcomer. His speech is very beautiful. In the first paragraph David failed to carry out his kingship. The time had come for it, the turn of the year, but be fell into indolence. Then there is the effort to conceal his guilt by sending for Urijah, an effort that would have succeeded ordinarily, but God is meeting the thing in ambush unexpectedly. Urijah stands out as a man who has concern for the testimony, he speaks about the ark and Joab and Israel. Why should I be enjoying every comfort of life when all this is going on? he says in effect. That is what David was doing, and worse. Urijah's word was really a sword-thrust from God to the king, and therefore the king does his utmost to conceal his guilt; but this man is an overcomer, he stands out and dies. He is a martyr, like Antipas, he is against what David is doing and is slain for his faithfulness.
Ques. Why is David so slow in getting back to self-judgment about this matter?
J.T. That would show that it is a wider thought in the type than the mere person. And now we see the skilfully arranged prophetic approach to it. There is no escape for this man, he is too valuable a man, he must be compelled to judge himself; and through the skill of God, the prophetic skill of God, he is made to judge himself before he knows it. "Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man".
God had stirred up his anger against himself. He does not deny it. It is wonderful skill and it is really grace on God's part not to let the man escape but to help him to judge himself.
{96}
Ques. Do you think that where the kingly thought has been given up disaster always follows its trail? Where there is a lack of transparency the kingly thought has been given up, it is the natural sequence.
Rem. In Ecclesiastes the king and the preacher seem to go together, there is moral authority to go with the official side.
J.T. I think what has been said about Proverbs is good -- the last two chapters -- the words of Agur and King Lemuel. Universal conditions are brought to the surface in chapter 30, and then we have the kingly responsibility in chapter 31 which is so needed. The words of Lemuel which his mother taught him would suggest, I think, the general thought of the assembly being brought to bear by the Spirit's power on those who are in responsibility. We are on the alert at the turn of the year and we are not turned aside by the influence of self-indulgence. But then if failure does come in we see the wonderful plan of God, a designed matter. We do not get details as to how Nathan came to use this parable, but we may be sure he was with God about it. How are we going to secure this man? God would say, because he is a clever man and he may escape us. God is determined that he shall not escape. He loves him too well. The thing must be exposed. He is doing his utmost to conceal his guilt, but God makes him judge himself before he knows it. Many a time one may bring a man's guilt home to him in this way: if he does not think he is the one referred to he will condemn the wrong-doer, but if he knows he is being aimed at he will cover the matter up.
Rem. That is innate in us, that principle of covering up. The other side comes out when God takes the matter in hand. He makes His own work shine in us in self-judgment.
J.T. It is a wonderful victory for grace. David is the sinner and God has set Himself to get him. He
{97}
does not escape, he is not allowed to carry on his concealment, he is forced to expose himself. "Thou art the man".
Rem. Paul really uses strategy in writing to the Corinthians to get the saints judicially-minded. It was not just the man who had sinned so flagrantly that he had in mind, but to get the saints judicially- minded so that they could deal with more serious things.
Ques. Do you think that when we are not able to define and discern matters clearly and we find ourselves moving on wrong lines, it is due possibly to the fact that there is a background of immorality with us?
J.T. Well, some darkening influence. So that when the moral state of the brethren is right it brings about recovery. The general state of the saints clears the matter so that evil is exposed. The New Testament shows that the system set up in Christ in heaven involves intercession on behalf of the sinner and also of the whole assembly. The Lord institutes a means to bring about recovery. All the addresses to the assemblies have that in view, so that they might be overcomers. It is a wonderful system that God has established in Christ. As soon as sin occurs, whether it be the sin of a prince or of a common person or of the whole assembly in type, the High Priest is ready as Advocate. He is looking after our affairs, and He brings conviction into the heart of the sinner. The Advocate is here tonight, in this meeting, to bring about conviction if it is needed, so that there might be self-judgment.
Rem. Nathan must have been a well-qualified, well-furnished man, because it simply says, "Jehovah sent Nathan to David". What did Jehovah tell him to say? It does not mention that here. He just sent him.
J.T. We may be sure that Nathan took counsel
{98}
with God. What a sorrow the matter would be to Nathan! Samuel cried all night about Saul. This parable was a skilful matter. Where did Nathan get it? He got it from God.
Ques. With reference to the parable, is it an indication as to how matters should be handled among us? Grace is carried on by God through prophetic ministry. Is grace reigning in that sense?
J.T. It was reigning in David in chapters 9 and 10 and well maintained, but now God has to come in. When the leading brothers give way God has to come in and take the thing in hand Himself, and of course it is grace. The Lord's very last word to the churches is that He is still on His Father's throne. It is grace. It is in relation to the testimony that characterises our dispensation, the grace period. And here all is grace; what a beautiful word this is from Nathan! David listens to the prophet telling about the poor man with one little ewe lamb which he was nourishing, and about the man on the journey. How that would touch David! What one feels is the skill of Nathan, the prophetic skill that often comes in in the gospel to get at consciences. David must have had great confidence in Nathan.
Ques. Would there not be a wonderment in David's mind as to how Nathan knew about all this? When we come to our prophetic ministry meetings someone may come in from another locality, and the brethren say, "Why should he speak like this? How does he know about conditions in this locality?"
J.T. As a prophet God may have given him a message.
Ques. Would you say that one of the marks of the true prophetic word is that it leaves nothing to be said on the other side? True repentance never comes without true conviction. Is that not a reason why true repentance is not reached sometimes, because there has not been conviction?
{99}
J.T. Does it not strike you that this scheme designed in heaven and carried out through Nathan was masterful? -- as much as to say to David, You cannot go one way or the other. He might shuffle, as we often do, but he has already condemned this thing himself, the judgment is passed. David has pronounced the verdict himself.
Rem. He was caught off guard. When we are attacked personally we immediately defend ourselves.
Rem. "Considering thyself lest thou also be tempted", @Galatians 6:1. If that were followed out would not every case be a means of helping us to judge ourselves? I was thinking of matters that come up in a meeting about which we arrive at a judgment; we are apt to forget the side of "consider thyself", that the thing we have judged resides in ourselves. Each difficulty should be a means of house-cleaning.
J.T. Many in Corinth, guilty themselves, acquiesced in the judgment of the man, forgetting that there were many others that should be dealt with. David here has given a verdict against the culprit. The culprit is not named, he is called "a rich man". Nathan is pleading his cause and the judge passes sentence. To me it seems a wonderful scheme.
Rem. The result of the conviction was: "I have sinned against Jehovah", not against Urijah, but "against Jehovah". Is that going the whole way?
J.T. Nathan had said to him: "Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah?"
Rem. How wonderfully too God brings home to him afterwards that *he* was a rich man. It is very touching! I was thinking that the first thing we would have said would have been about Urijah or Urijah's wife or the person who suffered most. But true repentance is always linked with God. And so the whole attitude of David in connection with his repentance and the death of the child, his mourning
{100}
and subsequent rising up from the ground, is not what would be expected in the ordinary way; but it is true repentance.
J.T. He is worth getting -- this man -- because he is so skilful in concealing his guilt, but God is not baffled.
Rem. There is the assurance that God will take care of everything else. Urijah the Hittite was really an honoured man. God is really the only One with whom we have to do.
J.T. Urijah is honoured now, he is a martyr for what is right. His speech in answer to David's overtures is beautiful! "The ark, and Israel, and Judah abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields: shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing", chapter 11:11. I do not want to be in any way different from that, I want to be in thorough accord with that position. It does not mean that the ark was on the battlefield, but it was under curtains; David himself had said that it was not suitable. But Urijah holds to the circumstances under which the ark and the army were. He was an overcomer, a martyr, so that his glory is assured, he has got his crown.
Rem. Verse 13 is very conclusive: "I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said to David; Jehovah has also put away thy sin: thou shall not die". It is unconditional grace in so far as it went. Then afterward we come to discipline. God's way is perfect.
J.T. You see that Nathan was ready. He was fully furnished as if he were told. Now when confession is made, do not be behind in speaking about forgiveness, "thou shalt not die". The whole scene is grace, God doing the very best in the circumstances.
{101}
Rem. Urijah dies and the child dies, but David goes on living.
J.T. The responsible element goes on; we shall take it up again to see what the result is of all the pains God has taken to secure response.
Ques. Is that the idea of the last letter to the responsible church?
J.T. We have to see the result, how the Lord never leaves the throne of grace. He has not left that throne yet. He is acting in a disciplinary way but His attitude is grace. We have a worshipper in the chief sinner himself, and then we shall see how Solomon comes in at the end.
Rem. The governmental side goes through.
J.T. It is the position of Christendom, the actual history. Solomon coming in at the end here is very suggestive. The government of God goes on, it is one sorrowful history right through this book. It is the testimony, I think, in the hands of David and a type of the whole Christian history, but still the kingdom goes through. So that in the last chapter but one he tells what a king should be in spite of all the failure and Absalom's rebellion; thus the kingdom goes through. We have all this that would rob us of the idea of it but God is asserting the thought of the kingdom and of rule more and more, and He will bring us into accord with it.
CHAPTER 12:15 - 25; 13:23 - 39
J.T. From what came before us last week it seems that we should regard this history as wider than the actual persons involved, viewing it as having a bearing on the public history of the assembly. On the side of good, the results point in David to a worshipper, through contrition of heart; and in Solomon to Christ known typically as Son. On the side of evil we have in Absalom a type of the antichrist.
{102}
The birth of Solomon is over against the death of the previous child, the one representing the result of lawlessness and the other a divine result; so that it says, "Jehovah loved him", verse 24, and because of that he is called Jedidiah -- object of the Father's love even from infancy.
The general position is that it was the time when kings go forth, and David failed in kingship. This would synchronise with a certain period in the history of the assembly when the kingly thought failed, with consequent sin, and the government of God came in through the prophetic word as in Nathan. He represents the medium of recovery, showing to what great pains God goes to secure the conviction of David.
Ques. I would like to see a little more clearly where this failure of the king, and the prophetic word, and recovery fit into the history of the assembly.
J.T. The failure of the kingly side would be the failure of the authority of Christ in the assembly through the unfaithfulness of those He was using. That is what chapter 11 brings out. Sin having occurred, Nathan, representing the prophetic word, was used to bring conviction to David and in the conviction the thorough acceptance of the government of God, so that the child's death is discerned to be governmental. God goes a long way with David in this instance, sparing his life though He did not spare the child's life. That is, the idea of government is carried through, being effective in the death of the child. David formally states that "While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought. Who knows? perhaps Jehovah will be gracious to me, that the child may live. But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me", chapter 12:22, 23. There seems to be the entire acceptance of the government of God. Grace was there, sparing
{103}
David's life, as the prophet said, "Jehovah has also put away thy sin: thou shall not die", @2 Samuel 12:13, but the child died, showing that the idea of government must go through, and the sword should not depart from his house. This child has to die on David's account and David accepts that. Then we have Solomon, who is a type of Christ coming in in the last days.
Rem. With regard to God's government in chapter 12, one feature of it seems to be immediate and the other future.
J.T. You mean, "I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house" (@2 Samuel 12:11); that would be future. The remainder of the book shows how that was carried out. The death of the child was immediate, and David accepted it I think as the basis for another son, another product.
Ques. Do we see David gaining spiritually from the government of God in the intense exercise through which he goes?
J.T. In the acceptance of guilt he reaches worship. Then we have Solomon, one whom God loves as a child, which would point to the truth of the Person of Christ coming in in a *small* way -- only a Babe -- but God loved Him. It is not yet Christ as seen at the Jordan at thirty years of age, but the idea of sonship suggestively as drawing out the love of God.
Rem. Would you say that the seven days must be gone through? I was thinking of @Leviticus 14, the seven sprinklings of the leper.
J.T. I thought that. Seven days would be a complete period of exercise, the perfect exercise as reaching a point. Here it would be the experience that one has of the severe government of God in discipline, so that the full result is reached.
Rem. The eighth day follows.
J.T. I think that is one of the most interesting parts of our subject, Christ coming in even in a small
{104}
way, through exercise of this kind amongst us, and how it draws out divine affection.
Rem. The government of God on the whole ecclesiastical system was bowed to, and now it has resulted in sonship. Would you say it is the introduction of the greatest possible thing for God at the close?
J.T. I think it is. It is a sort of centre or basis for the development of all that is in the mind of God, drawing out His affections, so that we find Nathan brought into action with the prophetic word to tell us that God loves this child: "And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake", verse 25. The prophetic word brings out what he is, it clarifies the position and brings out what is existent as a result of all this exercise; something is secured which Jehovah loves.
Ques. Would this indicate depth of feeling in God over David's breakdown? The only answer seems to be that God reverts in His thoughts to Christ.
J.T. God's affection passes on, as it were, to the child, although He did love David; his very name means 'beloved', but of Solomon it says, "*Jehovah* loved him".
Rem. I suppose Satan would hinder our getting the good of this whole matter by casting our thoughts back to the indefinite past, whereas it is really a matter of looking forward.
J.T. The indefinite past is the fourth century, the period of the creeds. If anybody reads the Creed he will be amazed to find how language is employed to say 'yes' and 'no' at the same time. There is a sense that the Holy Spirit is not developing the truth; the human mind is endeavouring with good intent to put the truth rightly, but it has not the power to conceal the error. The Creed states that the Lord Jesus was begotten of His Father before all
{105}
worlds. That is not true. The creed-makers tried to cover that over by other statements to show what they really did believe in their hearts, whereas we come now to clear sunlight, that the Lord Jesus has become Man, a distinct Person eternally, yet ever God.
Ques. Do you think there is an inkling of this in @John 9:41, "but now ye say, We see, your sin remains"? Is that similar to what occurred in the early centuries in regard to the Person of Christ?
J.T. Yes. So that they are responsible as to what is put down on paper in the so-called creeds. Some of us have perhaps looked into this matter more than others. There is not only the Creed, but an exposition of the Creed, a very large volume in which every line of the Creed is taken out and developed. The "General Church Council", especially the Nicene, which was the leading one at which this Creed was inaugurated, assumed to "see", and, of course, in a certain way this protected the truth. But it was not maintained by the Spirit of God. The truth is to be *maintained by the Spirit of God* and not by creeds. The creed-makers were not satisfied with the language of Scripture. They were very clever in the use of words so as to encase the truth and protect it, whereas if we have the Spirit of God, He *is* the truth. The Creed has been the basic teaching of Christendom for sixteen centuries, but now the truth is all made plain. I believe the point here is Solomon. Jehovah "sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet: and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake", verse 25. That is, the prophetic word gives the name.
Rem. There is great need for such a son owing to what transpires in the next chapter.
J.T. The state of David's house is distressing, as chapter 13 brings out, but here is the bright luminary that is going to effect things for God. Solomon is mentioned only twice in this book; we must wait for Kings to see him in action.
{106}
Rem. Nathan served to open David's eyes that he might see himself.
J.T. I think these two parts of Nathan's ministry, his conviction of David and his naming of his son, are the foundation for all that follows. We have a true foundation and other things do not shake us. The first book of Kings will bring out how Solomon can deal with evil men, with Joab, for instance. But he is not doing anything in this book, he is just a babe; but Jehovah loves him, and that is for my soul.
Rem. "The beloved of Jehovah -- he shall dwell in safety by him", @Deuteronomy 33:12. I was wondering if Solomon corresponds in some way with Benjamin?
J.T. You mean that Solomon is the one that affords the dwelling between His shoulders, alluding to the position of the temple in Jerusalem, It was primarily the territory of Benjamin on the principle of love and preference, and there was brotherly recognition in Judah. It would mean that the temple was in his territory -- mount Zion. Kingship gave way in David, but David went down to the bottom in his repentance. We read of his lying on the earth and refusing all comfort. It is beautiful to see his contrition; he prays in effect to God: Come in and cleanse me; my confession is not enough, I want to be set up again. In @Psalm 51 it is a question of Zion, and of being able to teach sinners and transgressors. The great answer is Solomon. Things are carried on, but generally in a poor way throughout this book, and it finishes with David's account of what a king ought to be without saying *he* was such; chapter 23:3 - 5. I think this is true of our activities in the assembly, we finally have to come to it that only a Solomon succeeds. I realise in my spirit that only *that* man can succeed, especially in the government of the house; He abides a Son for ever. We must come to that in our souls, especially in our care meetings.
{107}
Ques. You mean we shall have no results except on the lines of Solomon?
J.T. We usually begin on what *I* can do. I am an old brother, I have had much experience, I have been breaking bread for so many years, etc., but the building of the house and the ruling of the house is in sonship, and I have to come to that in my own soul however old or experienced I may be.
Ques. Are you suggesting that Solomon is the public name and Jedidiah the secret name?
J.T. We do not get the name Jedidiah afterwards; it is given only here, and to bring out what he was to Jehovah. You hardly get a babe like this elsewhere, not even in John Baptist. It must be Jesus typically.
Ques. Is @Psalm 51 an indication of David's deep feeling in regard to the blight he had brought on the testimony? "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight; that thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, be clear when thou judgest", @Psalm 51:4. Do you think he would have an impression of having marred the testimony, and he would seek by the public record of @Psalm 51 to make the whole matter plain?
J.T. There is no reference to Urijah in @Psalm 51. "Against *thee*, thee only have I sinned"; that was a deeper thing in his soul than the sin against Urijah.
Ques. You referred to the care meeting. Do you think if we really moved this way to reach Solomon all the defects would disappear? Otherwise I suppose we get into the tangles of this political business with Absalom.
J.T. I think we see here that Solomon stands over against all the other sons. The next sorrow is in connection with Amnon, the outstanding one of the family, the firstborn. But a Solomon comes in before that, which is our salvation as we go through the matter. There must be removal of Amnon and
{108}
of Absalom, though in the most sorrowful ways. These two men must go.
Rem. With regard to the other child, they tell David, "He is dead", verse 19. Does that mean God's government has prevailed and we come to that conclusion ourselves, so that there is the rising up?
J.T. David says, I cannot bring him back, I have to go to him. That is a solemn statement of the action of the government of God, but now he is ready morally for a Solomon and he calls his name Solomon, son of peace; but Jedidiah is God's thought, and that comes in prophetically. It throws light on the prophetic ministry with which God is helping us now, the first word to convict of sin and the other to bring in the Son in Jesus as the Son of God.
Ques. Would @Romans 7 and 8 correspond to that: death in the 7th and God's pleasure in sons in the 8th? "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God", @Romans 8:14.
J.T. So that it says: "Sin revived and I died" (@Romans 7:9).
Rem. When you speak of sonship you are applying it not only to my knowledge of my relationship with God as a son, but also in relation to the saints working out sonship relatively, because it is the removal of the corrupt relationship and the establishment of the right one.
J.T. That is what it is, seen first in Christ, the prophetic word telling you that Jehovah loves him. There had been many babes before but this one is designated by the prophet, "Jedidiah", because of Jehovah. This child affects Jehovah; that is, of course, Jesus typically: "that holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God", @Luke 2:36. Jehovah calls Him "Son of God", "Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee", @Hebrews 1:5. It is 'Thou' and 'this', there is no doubt about it, it is what God is thinking as to that Person.
{109}
Rem. So that it is death governmentally to all my scheming and planning.
J.T. How the love of God comes into the development of the truth of the Son of God! The Father loves the Son and we come into that. David had accepted the death of the child; his own death is just deferred; I shall go that way too, he says. He clothes himself properly; it is cutting across the religious feelings of his servants; they did not understand, nor do the professing persons around us. But when you accept death you change your clothes and go into the house of God. God will respect that. The first 13 verses of John's gospel are a preface; it is a question of the truth of the deity of Christ, what He was in past eternity and how He has come into this world, and it results in bringing in the sons of God. "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only begotten with a father) full of grace and truth", @John 1:14. That is the position, the *only One* of a Father, full of grace and truth under the eyes of men here below. It is Christ in the fulness of His manhood; babyhood is not mentioned at all. They were able to contemplate His glory because they belonged to the family: "as many as received him, to them gave He the right to be children of God", @John 1:12. They are the ones who can contemplate the sonship of Christ.
Rem. There is no middle ground between the Son of God and Barabbas. The name means, 'son of a father', indicating the other line.
J.T. Yes; it is in that gospel that the Lord says: "Ye are of your father the devil", @John 8:44. They were sons of a father, the devil.
Ques. Does it suggest that the responsible element as recovered goes right through?
J.T. And morally displaces what was there. In 1 Kings David is a weak old man, hardly any life
{110}
left, but in 1 Chronicles he is in vigour. Chronicles is from the divine side, but Samuel and Kings are from the responsible side down here and so everything hinges on Solomon; otherwise there will be a usurper on the throne, Adonijah. It seems to me that the truth of the Person of Christ is the great thought now carrying us through to the end. Solomon is a son of peace, his name means that, and if we come into the care meeting with thoughts of war we are continuing on David's line. The other side is that God loves this kind of man, Solomon. This struggle for the throne goes on under David; he makes no effort to stop it and there is confusion. If Nathan had not come forward in the matter of Adonijah it would have meant disaster again; @1 Kings 1. It is Nathan who rescues the position from man's will through the prophetic ministry, and I believe that is what is to preserve us in the last days, the prophetic ministry and sonship. In all that passed with Amnon and Absalom and now with Adonijah, David had no power to meet the situation; it is the prophetic word that meets it. In 1 Chronicles David stands up and makes a wonderful speech, but that is from the divine side.
Rem. In the remainder of chapter 12 Joab is in the forefront and in chapter 13 Absalom. I suppose that is the responsible element manifesting itself in weakness.
J.T. David was very angry at what Amnon did. But it is not enough to say to a brother, You are worldly, or your conduct is reprehensible. We must go further than that and use discipline. It says in verse 21 that David was very angry, and that is all you get. Again with Absalom, he is a murderer, a fugitive from justice, and the sorrowful side in this particular chapter is David's inability to deal with the matter; a most terrible condition exists and he is unable to deal with it.
{111}
Rem. So that in all these church matters around us the assumption that everything is all right while evil exists unjudged will head up in this awful man that is coming, the antichrist.
J.T. It must be either withdrawing from iniquity or dealing with iniquity.
Ques. What would have been the right step for David to take in all this?
J.T. This great man, the man that overcame the world militarily, ought to have proceeded to deal with evil. Why could he not deal with wicked men like Amnon and Absalom? He is powerless.
Rem. Joab was a politician, a schemer. That influence corresponds with what is public today. We must await Solomon.
J.T. Here is the greatest man in the world and he could not rule his own house, he could not discipline his sons. Is it a mere account of David or does it apply to our own times, our inability to deal with the persons nearest to us?
Ques. Does it mean that nothing at all should pass in a man's house that is not right?
J.T. That is the lesson to be learned. It is David's *house* right through here, and his kingly authority is impaired; he is unable to deal with evil in the kingdom. From the first century they were unable to deal with evil, so that the Lord had to charge them about it as we see in His addresses to the seven assemblies in @Revelation 2 and 3.
Rem. The Lord may be instructing us in sonship and giving us power to work on other lines today in view of the closing of the church's history. The condition here is indicative of weakness, in which Solomon is not coming into prominence and activity; but since the Lord has helped us on the lines of His sonship there seems to be parallel with that power to deal with evil.
{112}
J.T. In 1908 the matter of discipline came out at Alnwick and from that day to this the Lord has been helping the saints on assembly lines, inclusive of dealing with evil amongst us. Of course, the matter goes back to Bethesda, but some of us here have had to do with it directly; it has happened in our own times. Local assembly matters must be left in the Lord's hands in the locality, that is the principle; a neighbouring assembly cannot rule another assembly, nor commend another assembly; each local assembly is on its own footing before God, having provision within itself for rule and discipline. That is what came out in 1908. It has been developed ever since, and collaterally with that the truths of the *Lord's Supper, local assembly prerogatives, sonship, prophetic ministry and the service of God*. It was the great issue, what the local assembly was and the Lord's authority there, the Lord's rights there. It is a primary thought that Paul and Barnabas went out and formed assemblies, "and having *chosen* them elders", @Acts 14:23. *They* did it. They were commissioned to go out in that service and appointed elders in each assembly and later in each city (@Titus 1:5). The idea was to set up local assemblies on their own feet. They had the means to govern and discipline *there*.
Ques. How would it work out when there is more than one meeting in a city?
J.T. The local assembly would cover all the meetings, as for instance here in New York, *one assembly* and sub-divisions. In these small meetings in Asia Minor it says they chose elders "in each assembly"; so that when Paul writes to the saints in Galatia he says, "to the assemblies of Galatia", @Galatians 1:2, not, 'to aggregate of the saints'.
Ques. Would "ye are Christ's body" in @1 Corinthians 12 show that the assembly was functioning in that city?
{113}
J.T. It was not an independent body, of course, so that the article "the" is not before the word "body". To "ordain elders" would mean to furnish all that is necessary in the way of government.
Rem. In this last short period just on the eve of our departure, church history is being lived over again.
J.T. I think these chapters forecast the failure of the assembly; it is wider than the sin of one man, it is the public position. David's failure in not going forth resulted on the good side in a worshipper in David and a son in Solomon; and on the side of evil in Amnon and Absalom. That is exactly the position now.
Ques. Should we be slow to oppose the judgment of the local assembly?
J.T. We should not do it. The Lord is there. It is not that we assume to be infallible, but still if the action has been taken in assembly it is a serious matter to interfere with it.
Rem. According to @Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord holds the responsible element answerable for every matter there.
J.T. Quite so. So that it is "the angel" he addresses, the responsible element.
Rem. Then there would be some element in all local companies that is holding on to these wonderful things that the Holy Spirit is reviving: the prophetic word, the service of God and sonship.
Rem. I suppose it is the whole assembly, the tabernacle, the great general thought of general fellowship worked out locally.
J.T. As 1 Corinthians shows, universal fellowship is recognised; indeed there is only *one* fellowship, but it works out locally.
{114}
CHAPTER 14
J.T. We seem to have had the mind of the Spirit in considering chapters 9 and 10 as the kingdom of God marked by grace; grace toward Mephibosheth in chapter 9, and toward the king of Ammon, although he despised it, in chapter 10. Chapter 11 brings out the decline, for "at the time when kings go forth ... David abode at Jerusalem", @2 Samuel 11:1. Then comes the great sin of David and the conviction of it, pointing to the history of Christendom since the breakdown. On the side of good we have in David a worshipper of God, and in Solomon a type of Christ viewed as Son coming into prominence, beloved of God; and on the side of evil we have Amnon and Absalom, the two evil features arising governmentally because of the failure of David. Chapter 14 begins with this state of affairs, the good and the bad moving together, as in @Matthew 13 the wheat and the tares grow together.
Chapter 14 brings out, in Joab, an element that has its correspondence today, a combination of evil seeking to conceal itself in an outline of right procedure and words but still culminating in Absalom being re-established in favour, although he was a murderer; so that the combination of evil is very strong as this chapter shows. David represents the responsible element in the system, the professing body; this chapter brings out the elements combined in Joab which have place today.
Ques. Is the enemy taking account of the disposition of the king's heart, a wrong disposition?
J.T. That seems to be the fact. It says: "And Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom". The king's heart was in the wrong direction.
Ques. Is this the same kind of sin as Adam's? He acted with his eyes open, not sinning in ignorance
{115}
but being influenced to do what he knew was not right.
J.T. That is right. You mean David knew Absalom was unrepentant.
Ques. Will you say something more about the responsible element being sympathetic towards this kind of man publicly today?
J.T. I think these are the facts that govern the history of the assembly from the time of the breakdown. There has been a right element; the responsible element called the orthodox party has been with us from the earliest days, from the third century. In the main they were holding the truth but they inclined to the wrong man, he that is shown to be wrong, a murderer, although he ingratiated himself with the public leaders; he was historically a murderer and here is shown to be just a diplomat, a politician, currying favour with those in charge. Those in responsibility publicly are in the main right as to their principles, but secretly they have the wrong man. Joab had no love at all for Absalom, but David had, and Joab worked on David's misplaced affection because David's heart was toward Absalom. It was *toward* him, not toward judging him, for justice was not in exercise as seeking to get him back to deal with judicially; that was not his thought at all. David longed to go forth to Absalom, Joab worked on that; Joab is a combination of evil, well covered, but still there.
Ques. Do you think that his heart being toward Absalom would indicate certain unjudged reservations such as we might have in regard to anything and which the enemy might kindle into flame at any time?
J.T. His reservations were evidently the outcome of his misplaced love for this murderer; it would have a correspondence in that way. Absalom was next in line to Amnon, and heir; but the sequel shows that he had a very undue place with David, for when
{116}
he was slain David was more moved on account of him than he had been on account of Amnon who was murdered.
Ques. Do you see this in the church's history publicly, that as time goes on what is political will be combined with what is responsible?
J.T. I think the past history of the assembly affords us the anti-type of all this. The leaders who ruled in the Councils and did their best to encase the truth in the creeds were not governed by the Spirit of God in what they were doing, but still they were seeking to maintain the truth of Christianity in their way. But they afforded an opportunity for these elements to work. These elements are combined, for Joab is a combination: a murderer, a clever man, a military man, orthodox generally, but a known murderer. Now he is glossing that over and ingratiating himself with the king at the expense of the rights of Christ, the rights of the whole position; a murderer is to be brought back and reinstated in affection as heir, because the wise woman's speech would imply that everything would hinge on this man, Absalom; everything hinged in her own mind on this son who murdered the other son; "they will quench my coal that is left", she says. It is an allusion to Absalom as if everything is to depend on him. It was a clever move but all tending to one thing, that is antichrist; not to the antichrist personally, but to the characteristics of antichrist.
Rem. That element is not dealt with finally until Christ Himself deals with it. If David had retained all his affections and right point of view in connection with the sonship of Solomon all would have been well.
J.T. Solomon was just a babe and Jehovah had signified that *He* loved him, and yet David seems to be moving toward Absalom. What a state of soul must have been there! It is seen in the history of the assembly, though in David personally here.
{117}
Rem. In church history the letting go of sonship in its right form really makes room for antichrist.
J.T. This brings us back to what we were saying of chapter 12, bringing out from the failure a worshipper, *and* Solomon. These are the two outstanding good things. In the history of the assembly there was a remnant preserved but the general position was that the Creeds dealt with the sonship of Christ unspiritually. With the best of intentions they brought in falsifying principles to establish the truth of sonship and resorted to language that is utterly foreign to the divine vocabulary. They endeavoured to maintain orthodoxy but did not bring down Solomon to us. They had clever men in their ranks; take this woman, she is a wise woman, but what she has to say is put into her mouth by a schemer. David is the responsible man, and owned of God so far, but sorrowfully mixed in his mind and affections so that you marvel at him. Here is Solomon born, and David himself had been into the house of God and worshipped, accepting the death of the other child. Solomon is called Jedidiah because Jehovah loved him; this child is Christ in type, but evidently David is deflected. There is not another word about Solomon in this book, yet after Absalom's death David mourns, "My son, my son!" overwhelmed with grief. So that you have in this woman a person available and amenable in the hands of a man like Joab.
Rem. Abraham's mind was on the wrong son but the woman in that case seemed to have the mind of God.
Rem. In chapter 3 David admits that the sons of Zeruiah are too much for him; subsequently the sons of David are too much for him.
J.T. He is just throwing up his hands; it is a sorrowful situation. It would look as if the antitype is in mind in the history of Christendom, men seeking
{118}
to maintain the truth and yet their mind is in this direction and they are capable of being influenced.
Rem. And the illustration employed to influence David is in many respects similar to the one used by Nathan.
J.T. It was probably copied, the idea was borrowed. As usual what is of God is imitated. No doubt Joab knew all about Nathan's parable and how successful he was; David never discerned what was in the parable until it was shown him. I have no doubt Joab saw that, and saw how David could be deceived and at the right time the truth brought home to him, for this woman breaks it to David as she proceeds. In verse 13 "the king is ... as one guilty", she says and then she goes back to her own story about her own son; so that it looks as if it were the kind of thing that has come down in history, the copying by unspiritual men of what God is doing.
Ques. When was David recovered from this state?
J.T. The book goes on to bring that out. You see him exiled from his capital, going up by the ascent of the Olives, weeping, barefoot, and worshipping on top of the mount; you can see how he must have recovered himself. But then, did he ever recover himself? He has to admit in chapter 23, "Although my house be not so before God", @2 Samuel 23:5. He tells what a king should be but he does not say, I am that king. God puts it into his heart, but as ever, we have to turn to Christ; He is the only One who answers to what a king should be.
Ques. Does the expression, "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ" (@Matthew 1:1) in Matthew indicate that although He is not (typically) brought forward here, behind this the true person was held by Bathsheba, that is Jedidiah?
J.T. You mean Solomon was held? That is true. But I think another thing that would help us greatly in this history is the place Nathan has; he
{119}
is the man who meets the whole issue, first in regard to building the house, that it must be built by a son; and then in regard to the kingship of Solomon when Adonijah was setting himself up. It was Nathan who met the issue. Bathsheba did not do it, she came in after Nathan. It is to bring out the importance of prophetic ministry; that is what God uses to meet all these issues.
Ques. Was not Bathsheba sympathetic? Her love is referred to by Solomon.
J.T. She was sympathetic and Nathan immediately brings her in, or rather, he goes to the king and reminds him of his oath to Bathsheba; but she did not take the initiative, and she failed again in connection with Adonijah. She interceded for him, she was a poor affair herself, so that the whole issue hinged on Nathan's ministry and that throws into prominence the importance of prophetic ministry today.
Rem. The first mention we get of Nathan is in chapter 7 where he failed a little himself; he said, "Go, do all that is in thy heart" (@2 Samuel 7:3).
Ques. Why is he not mentioned through this whole section and in the succeeding chapters?
J.T. Well, he has done his work. I think it stands in relation to the sonship of Solomon, the Christ; that was his main work. How it fits in now, the place the prophetic word has! Solomon is undoubtedly the true son, alongside of whom we have the other sons, Amnon and Absalom, reputable heirs to the throne. I believe these are typically the men who have been pushed forward in Christendom; but they are not the full thought, it is Solomon whom God loves.
Rem. The so-called orthodox church did not grasp the thought of sonship.
J.T. They really brought in the Word, the Logos, but parallel with that they brought in a son who was
{120}
"begotten of the Father before all worlds". It was a human idea introduced into the Creed and that is what we have had all these centuries. In chapter 11 Solomon is brought in as a babe, and God says, 'I love him, I will give him a name'. That is what they had at the beginning with the apostles, for really the thought of sonship was in Paul; but it was lost in the creeds, and the creeds are 1,700 years old. Let anyone read them and he will see it.
Ques. Matthew's gospel refers much to the prophets; for instance, "Out of Egypt have I called my son". (@Matthew 2:15) Would that be in line with the fact that the prophetic word is used to point the way to the sonship of Christ?
J.T. It would. You have it typically in Genesis, in Isaiah and in @Psalm 2. "Out of Egypt I called my son" was said by Hosea,(@Hosea 11:1) and how much is made of that in Matthew! Joseph is taken up to protect Him; "take to thee the little child and his mother", (@Matthew 2:13) the angel says. What an object of supreme interest He is to heaven! Solomon is presented first of all through Nathan's message and now he is an infant, called Jedidiah because Jehovah loved him. Matthew corresponds because the prophetic word is so stressed in Matthew.
Ques. Is that why the Lord stresses the idea, "Then are the sons free" (@Matthew 17:26)?
J.T. He is seen as the Son in chapter 16, and on the mount He is owned from heaven, and now He brings the sons into it at the end of chapter 17.
Ques. Did David know that the Lord had called Solomon "Jedidiah"?
J.T. I should think so; if it were your son you would know it. Heaven thinks a lot about our sons.
Ques. Why is the sonship of Christ stressed in Hebrews 1?
J.T. I suppose to deliver the Jewish Christians.
{121}
It is the great delivering thought; and so in Galatians, Judaism is legality but sonship is liberty.
Having spoken about the general thought of the chapter the next thing to look at is the character of this man Joab, because we shall find him in our own hearts, ingratiating himself with those in responsibility: "And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said to her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning garments, I pray, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead; and come to the king, and speak after this manner to him. And Joab put the words into her mouth". We have not far to go to see this kind of thing; "a long time mourned for the dead", an appeal to natural sentiment, a carefully designed appeal in the person herself to natural sentiment to arouse sympathy in David; and getting his sympathy aroused, gradually bringing in the thought behind it. The idea is to show that they are working with David according to what is in his heart; it is all to arouse natural feeling. That has been the public history of the assembly, natural feelings are appealed to in the kind of things brought forward; the very best of us is likely to be affected by this sort of thing, a carefully designed matter to affect the most spiritual. Look at the Romish system, how they dress themselves, these Joabs; they put on the kind of attire that appeals to natural sentiment. We have a picture here in which the leading elements are really murderers, a terrible situation. Think of the wonderful habiliments of the leaders of the great Romish system, and of the Greek church, and of the whole public body; they are all designed. Look at a nun, see her on the streets like a person mourning for the dead and there is not a ray of light in her countenance; it is all to appeal to natural sympathy and sentiment. We shall see how this woman flatters David. It is
{122}
well worth looking into. Joab has carefully designed this, the kind of person he is using is not an ordinary person, not a disreputable person at all, she is wise; and the organisations of which we have spoken certainly go in for wisdom and learning, not a stone left unturned to make their appeal.
Rem. This woman makes the matter commendable.
J.T. But she is serving a murderer and he is waiting to bring back a murderer; you see what David is contending with. The lesson is not to allow ourselves to be deceived by anything presented to our sentiments, philosophy and vain deceits, that sort of thing. It is "the mystery of iniquity", and it has been going on all these centuries and we can see in the present state of things in Christendom that it is all ready to be unfolded; as soon as God lifts His hand it will be there.
Ques. What about the beauty of Absalom?
J.T. That comes in too; it enabled him to steal the hearts of the men of Israel. But here it is a *son* ; David said, "my son", his heart is toward him. This woman's subject is well chosen. So far as I can see David's name is not mentioned in this chapter, it is "the king" right through, the person in authority So that she comes in in verse 4 and "fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance, and said, Save, O king!" and then she goes on and tells Joab's story. Undoubtedly Joab had studied Nathan's effort in his parable to reach David's conscience, but *he* is not reaching David's conscience, he is reaching only his natural sympathy and sentiment. This woman has no prophet's garb. Joab knew well how to appeal, just like Satan; he knows so well how to attack on the line of what is natural.
Rem. Jude speaks of those who creep in unawares, and I was thinking of the words about the plague of
{123}
our own hearts; these things are not only in Christendom, they exist with us.
J.T. Satan studies us; he considered Job. Joab had well considered David, but I think on the line of nature, his natural propensities.
Ques. Was Paul under these things a little in @Acts 21? They appealed to his natural sentiments.
J.T. I daresay. We have several allusions to his adopting legal things, vows and all that, so that the most spiritual of us is exposed, and that is the lesson for us. Satan studies each of us, especially those who are more prominent, and his design is to use what will affect you.
Rem. The second cry from the cross was the termination of the first man; entering into that would preserve us.
J.T. You feel that every morning, at least I do, particularly the *daily* taking up your cross. It is a solemn matter, the cross would save you from anything of this kind.
Ques. What is *your* cross?
J.T. I think it refers to the particular kind of thing that affects *you*, do not evade it, take it up, it is protection.
Ques. Of the two cries I suppose the first would be the judgment of sin and the second the judgment of self?
J.T. I think so; the first is sin in a general way, the full bearing of it, but the second is man dealt with judicially, set aside.
Ques. Is it right for the king to acquit a murderer?
J.T. That is the whole point, David's heart was toward a murderer. In the New Testament they chose a murderer instead of Christ. Here David is doing that. Why is he not content with the man God loves, Solomon the babe? He had named him Solomon, a man of peace, but it does not say that he loved him although undoubtedly he did. The type is
{124}
what we are dealing with here, his mind is toward Absalom, that type of man.
Ques. Would the constant reference to "the king" in this chapter in contrast to the earlier chapters suggest that God loves to see grace being dispensed righteously but that love is withheld when we dispense grace unrighteously?
J.T. You would rather be called by your name than by your official title. Personally I would rather be called by name.
Rem. The Lord Jesus was as much beloved by the Father when He was on the cross as when He came out of Jordan. There was no change.
J.T. "Therefore doth my Father love me *because*", @John 10:17. He was giving Him a fresh motive for love.
Rem. John's epistles help us in this direction. John has much to do with antichrist but he says, "And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true", @1 John 5:20.
J.T. That is the whole point in John's ministry, the Son of God, and that is what saves you from antichrist. John says: "these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God", @John 20:31. That is over against antichrist, that would save us.
Rem. The testimony of the centurion to the Son of God was as if another world had come into that man's thoughts.
J.T. This woman goes on to the idea of water poured on the ground; she rises in her remarks. In verse 12 she says: "Let thy bondmaid, I pray thee, speak a word to my lord the king". She is bringing the matter home to him now like Nathan, and she continues until the king says in verse 11, "As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth". She takes away the veil there,
{125}
she is really speaking to the king himself in verse 12, and then she comes back to her own affair. She can reach David, but not his conscience. Absalom was banished, rightly banished; he was a murderer. She is succeeding, and the lesson is that I should not be caught in that kind of snare, not to allow my natural feelings and sympathies to interfere with divine justice. She is insinuating to David, You are an old man, you are going to die, we are all like water spilt on the ground; you will need a man to rule this kingdom. That is what she inferred, and that David was not doing right to the people of God: "Why then hast thou thought such a thing against God's people?" verse 13. It is an attack against the son, against Solomon, as it was later with Adonijah. In saying that we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground which cannot be gathered up, she is saying what the orthodox Christians would say, but she has not got the thing right; the truth of resurrection is that water *can* be gathered up again. The water poured out and the sucking lamb pleased Jehovah, so that we have the thought of what pleases God. We are all to be raised up. This woman has in mind that we are all dying, but God "devises means", she says, "that the banished one be not expelled from him". Who is this banished one? I know this passage is often used in the gospel and you can use it in that way, for God does devise means, but if He brings a man back it is not without repentance. She had in her mind that a man should be brought back unrepentant, she does not hint at all that her own son should repent of his murder, she is blaming David.
Rem. And David allows it, too. It is said that Absalom had been three years in Geshur, as if time would clear up matters.
J.T. There is not a word about Absalom making any expression of contrition at all. You get servants
{126}
in the great denominations like this, truth mixed with error.
Rem. The woman taken in sin accepted the second writing on the ground.
J.T. You might say that because the Lord said: "Neither do I condemn thee", it was all right, but He adds, "Go, and sin no more", @John 8:11. He does not seem to have much confidence in her.
Rem. David does not interfere with this woman's subject, he gives her a lot of scope to go on with it.
J.T. Yes; what the ministers of the gospel are to preach is put into their mouths, that is the general idea.
Rem. Sometimes assembly matters might be handled this way by the unspiritual, glossed over, half-finished, but there is bound to be trouble sooner or later.
Ques. Would you say something about Absalom here?
J.T. That is the next thing. David discerned what was in mind, as it was designed that he should. Joab wanted to ingratiate himself with the man in authority, and that is the element that has come down to us.
Rem. When Absalom returns Joab is slow to bring him to the king, and Absalom says in self-defence, "if there be iniquity in me, let him slay me".
J.T. He knew well enough there was iniquity in him. He would probably say with the rest of them, "God have mercy on us, miserable sinners", but he would never confess his own matter. Joab intended that David should discern what the woman meant, he knew David wanted Absalom back and he wanted David to know that *he* wanted Absalom back, but he would resort to this artifice to tell him, and it worked perfectly. David sends for Joab at once (verse 21) and says, "Behold now, I have done this thing; so go, bring back the young man Absalom". That is a
{127}
knavish thing. He knew well enough the man was guilty, but there he is, caught by the flattery of Joab. And then we get the beauty of Absalom, as if it might be said, Why should he not be desired? Why should we be deprived of such a fine man? There was no one like him in the whole kingdom. See, too, what it says as to his hair. He was not a Nazarite; he shaved his hair each year, and it weighed two hundred shekels after the king's weight; it was an immense amount of hair, it would be about six pounds if you went by the ordinary weight of a shekel. I suppose he shaved it off because it was inconvenient. It is a young man in his beauty, with the attributes of the antichrist. These men that have risen suddenly into power are wonderful men: Napoleon, for example, was a superman; and so with all these men that are before us today; people marvel at them. That is the kind of thing noted here, his beauty and the weight of his hair; "But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him", verse 25. Why should such a man be kept away? it might be asked. Why should we be deprived of a man like that? Then we are told that he had "three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of a beautiful countenance". The whole position is very attractive. Where could there be a better man for the kingdom than this? that is the idea.
Rem. This position can work in Absalom's favour now he is in Jerusalem; he was relatively harmless in exile, but now he can work against David.
J.T. David is bringing Absalom back, but Solomon is to be used to displace him altogether. I believe the whole hierarchy of Christendom has worked on this line; they do not want to displace Christ exactly, nor do they want antichrist, but they have allowed the man that Absalom represents to have sway and
{128}
now they have no power to deal with things. The Church of England cannot control even its own bishops; they can say anything they like and they cannot be disciplined.
Rem. Absalom's next act is to burn up Joab's field of barley.
J.T. The allusion would be to the truth of Christ's Person as first-fruits. It is Joab's barley field, it is the way he would look at Christ; that is an allusion I think to the Church of England. I believe the framers of the Creed and the liturgy earnestly wanted to preserve the truth as they saw it. Joab was an orthodox man and he had a field of barley, but it was near Absalom's field, an orthodox man alongside of one who is a type of antichrist; there was no separation, so that the Romish Church and the Church of England and all the other churches are near each other. This man who represents antichrist burns up this field and they are not able to protect it. It is very solemn to see how this man when once brought back, though not yet recognised by the ruling authorities (David had not kissed him yet), is able to accomplish so much in lawlessness.
CHAPTER 15
J.T. It has come before us that these last few chapters of 2 Samuel foreshadow in a typical way the public history of the assembly. We have seen the evil that came in through David's sin and the sins of his two sons, particularly that of Absalom, pointing to history in the assembly which has culminated in room being made for antichristian principles, Absalom representing this. Chapter 14 brings out these features. There were orthodox ones, such as Joab, who paved the way for the return of Absalom, a banished murderer; now as returned he
{129}
has ingratiated himself with the king and is recognised by David. David is the man in authority so that this chapter would bring before us that feature, the antichristian element in control in a rebellious way. Absalom is not exactly *the* antichrist, typically, but *an* antichrist, representing the principles beforehand. He was not allowed to continue in his rebellion but he particularly paved the way for the apostasy of Christendom, the incoming of antichrist, for antichrist is perhaps more religiously than politically against Christ.
Ques. Is this more political here?
J.T. It would be. It is a question of the kingdom, of course. We shall notice as we go on how Absalom had recourse to everything that would make him great, make him attractive to the people. He prepared chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him, and rose early and stood before the gate; "and it was so, that when any man who had a controversy had to come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said. Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man to hear thee appointed by the king. And Absalom said. Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any controversy and cause might come to me, and I would do him justice! And it was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him. And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; and Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel!"
I think that paragraph is very striking. It would apply to the present time, great care to make those who represent antichrist very attractive to the natural mind; and then putting himself forward unfairly, saying that no one was appointed by the
{130}
king, as if government was ignored and he must take it on.
Ques. Would Adonijah be on the same footing?
J.T. Yes. Of course David had a double office, he had a ministerial office Godward in a spiritual way as well as a political office. Applying it as we are looking at it now it is more the religious side that is in mind, because in the history of the assembly it is the kingdom in a spiritual sense; that is the sense in which the kingdom is in us now, and following on that the service of God.
Ques. Is it a feature of antichrist that he had a previous link with what was right?
J.T. I think that is right. It is not a man coming in openly from heathendom, but one who has had a place amongst us.
Ques. Do you place this chapter in the early dispensations or in times of recovery?
J.T. It covers a long period. The first thing to observe is that David is still there, the right man. I think we have to take him as typical of what is of God, only exercised in a very weak way, wholly out of keeping with what he had been. One wonders at what happened within a generation, why he should have become so negligent, undiscerning and weak; but the picture is drawn of the typical man rather than as the mere history of David. You marvel how all this could happen before his eyes and he not discern it, a man with such a history as his was; so that it would be more the antitype we have to look at. The real David is still here so it might extend back to the early history of the assembly.
Ques. What about Absalom putting himself forward?
J.T. The way is made for him through Joab's shrewdness; not that he wished Absalom to be in power, because he did not join him in his rebellion; but he thought that David wished him back, and he
{131}
would ingratiate himself with David. Although Absalom remained two years without recognition he finally obtained it, and now he is free. So that this spirit of antichrist is allowed to be there as indicated in his making himself attractive to the religious mind; for he is David's son, he has that status. What would there be in this if it were a mere history of a monarch? It must point a lesson to us, for "whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our instruction" (@Romans 15:4).
Rem. It would stress the fact that there is nothing greater really in the whole range of time than the assembly. These various happenings all throw light on the glorious history of the church.
J.T. "Upon whom the ends of the ages are come", @1 Corinthians 10:11; that is, all the dispensations before throw light on us, the assembly. The apostles represented the authority of Christ, so that it would be the apostolic times and testimony carried down, only now things are weak, unaccountably so in the main, like David.
Rem. In @Acts 20 Paul speaks about what will transpire "after my departure". Did his presence hold evil forces back?
J.T. I should say apostolic power held them back. Paul speaks of certain ones creeping in and John sees them going out; John's ministry deals with them abstractly. "They went out from among us, but they were not of us", @1 John 2:19.
Rem. The word 'creeping' is significant, a word attached to that part of the creature kingdom that creeps, unnoticed possibly. I was wondering whether unjudged evil that may come in to a certain extent unnoticed does not eventually recoil on those who are set to go on with God? The allowance of Absalom's return, the demeanour of Joab in ingratiating himself with David, all that will eventually recoil on the real, on David, and overthrow him.
{132}
J.T. Each man has to see to his own heart. Absalom "stole the hearts of the men of Israel". "Keep thy heart with all diligence", (@Proverbs 4:23) we are told. If these people coming up to the gate had been true to the principles set out in David and to the spirit of David they would have discerned that this man did not represent that at all. We are carried away by not keeping our hearts with all diligence. Absalom is evidently making a way for himself. He says, Here is a man coming up with a good case, he is of one of the tribes of Israel and should be properly cared for; it is a discredit to David, why does David allow it? Could David not see what was happening? Of course, if you look back on the history of Christendom, the Council men were there with the best intentions, but then reading the history you can see that they were allowing this sort of thing in -- philosophy and vain deceit. The Creeds began to be formed under those circumstances. There were some who were right, like Athanasius, one could mention several, and yet this was allowed; it is the weakness of the responsible element in men.
Rem. When one important mistake has been made Satan knows judgment will be undermined. Really the judgment of the princes of the ecclesiastical system has been no good all down.
J.T. The so-called 'fathers' were godly men, but some of them missed their way; some were contemporary with John, perhaps a little later, but you marvel at the great deterioration in their writings, how quickly they changed after the apostles died! I think that is what is meant here in David's unaccountable weakness. Why did he allow this man liberty? It was easy to see that Absalom was aiming at the throne; why did David not see it? It is only accountable by applying it to antichrist. These men allowed philosophy and vain deceit, what the apostles decried. Certain of themselves
{133}
would arise and on the other hand there were those who would creep in unnoticed. We have to understand the features of the agencies the enemy uses; the serpent was the first creature of God that was used by the devil; at least, he appeared as a serpent himself. That sort of thing has to be watched.
Rem. To-day we are in the presence of the defeat of all Ahithophel's counsel; now things are transparent and the Spirit of God is helping us in the truth.
J.T. That is what marks the closing days, in which we clearly are. It is wonderful to he in the clear light. But you marvel at the murkiness that marked everything here, that this man should go forward and invite two hundred men only to pay a vow; how could that not be observed?
Ques. Do you think the 'Image of Jealousy' might be like Absalom here? Sitting in the gate it was as if he would dispute the rights of David; he would make gain of the interests of God in Jerusalem.
J.T. Quite so, it would arouse jealousy in any spiritual man. He was a murderer yesterday, and still a murderer, yet he is sitting in the gate, and not a word said about it. Why should it be written, if it be not the history of the assembly as we are speaking of it?
Rem. I suppose we are exposed more or less to the same thing. In @Acts 20 the Holy Spirit made them overseers; these godly ones watched.
J.T. We need the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ, the very opposite of Absalom's spirit, which is that of antichrist. John makes much of discerning spirits.
Rem. John discerns Diotrephes as loving to have the first place. He says, "If I come I will bring to remembrance his works", @3 John 10.
J.T. Quite so, John discerns. The apostles had keen discernment. Paul sees certain ones coming in and certain ones rising up, and John sees them going
{134}
out because "they were not of us", @1 John 2:19. He sees the power that deals with all this sort of thing at the root.
Rem. Watching seems to he essential. Paul speaks of watching day and night for the space of three years. There is the wall position and the gate position and we are to be the watchmen. This man is sitting quite openly in the gate.
J.T. Quite so. The prophet says "I have set watchmen upon thy walls, Jerusalem; all the day and all the night they shall never hold their peace; ye that put Jehovah in remembrance, keep not silence", @Isaiah 62:6. And the Lord said: "What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch", @Mark 13:37. There was a great absence of watchfulness here.
Ques. Do you think David was carried away by Absalom's desire to go to Hebron to fulfil a vow, probably one of his insidious ways?
J.T. There is a remarkable combination of elements. A handsome man to begin with, a wonderful head of hair, a head matter, a man of that kind. The head has a great place with these men. Then he would get down alongside people and kiss them, he would stoop to do that, and then he would say to them, There is nobody appointed by the king to attend to your matters. That is injecting poison into the men's minds. Then he would add, "Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any controversy and cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!" meaning, I would do what people need. All that is very insidious; he "stole" the hearts of men; that is a trait of the devil. Then he pretends that he had made a vow, that he was a religious man in Geshur, instead of coming back and confessing his sins. How could God accept a vow from a murderer? What kind of vow was that!
Rem. Verse 8 is really the bargain of a murderer.
{135}
I will come back into fellowship, I will skip over everything to get back.
J.T. There is not a word about contrition or self-judgment at all, it is foreign to this man.
Rem. David seems to have accepted the news without any investigation as to why it should come so suddenly upon him, and today people are accepting modernism, without any investigation.
J.T. And then too, where is Nathan in all this? Where are the priests, why are they not active? The whole position seems to point to something other than this actual situation, because ordinarily Nathan was a true and faithful man; he never missed his way so far as we know. It seems as if the prophetic ministry was not allowed a place under these circumstances, for Nathan and Gad were both available.
Rem. We should accept the challenge; it is one thing to have the heart stolen and another to have it won.
J.T. Solomon coming in after this should be a help to all of us, especially the young people, because he is son of David. He says, "Son, give me thine heart";(@Proverbs 23:26) and "Keep thine heart"; and, "Write it upon the tables of thine heart".
Rem. I suppose @Deuteronomy 24:7 is the same idea, "If a man be found who has stolen one of his brethren". Not that we can steal one another literally, applying it to ourselves, but on party lines we can.
J.T. In the chapters in Exodus that follow the account of the Hebrew bondman, who is unselfish and loves to the uttermost, the spirit of stealing is met. @Exodus 21, 22 and 23, the three chapters that follow, allude to what we are dealing with here, the history of the saints immediately following the full testimony of love in Christ. The spirit of stealing
{136}
comes in and it is remarkable how stealing is dealt with.
Rem. There was some lack in those that had their hearts stolen, because when Absalom approached them they did not investigate to see if what he said about their cases was really true. And yet Absalom was outside the gate as they came up to the city. Had they investigated further they would have found possibly that there *was* judgment.
J.T. Quite so. Why should I not go to the king? Why should I be stopped by a man like this? He has no appointment, he is self-constituted. Is not that the history of the clergy? They have no divine appointment at all.
Rem. So many things have had to be looked into because it has suited a great many very well to disregard the matter of judgment; they get along better without looking things in the face.
J.T. As they came up to the *gate of Jerusalem* here is a fine looking man; but he has no appointment from the king. Why did he not say, The king has appointed *me* ? He could not, he was self-constituted.
The whole clerical hierarchical system is self-constituted; it has taken on everything and has gradually shut out the true David and Absalom is allowed in. As a matter of fact, the emperor who presided over the Council of Nicaea was not even baptised! If I had been there with the present light I would have said, What about Paul's epistles? What about 1 and 2 Timothy? Is there no man such as Paul today, are there no deacons, no elders? No, the real David is left out and these men are self-constituted.
Rem. There is a man who reports to David in verse 13.
J.T. Yes, but where are true men? Is there no godly man in Hebron? Not a sound, not a voice is lifted up to challenge this conduct of Absalom! It is true the man brought word to David, but why did
{137}
the thing go on so long? That is why it seems to me that the whole setting must apply to something else.
Rem. And the boldness of it too, he really puts his hand on the throne, he is reaching right up to the throne.
J.T. It is my responsibility to check this evil at the roots. Where are these men who ought to be doing it? Even David does not lift a voice when Absalom speaks of going to Hebron, he says, "Go in peace". There seems no one to lift up a voice in warning, no one like the house of Chloe.
Rem. There were those who went in their simplicity, who "knew nothing", verse 11. They are not much good.
J.T. They had not their ears to the ground.
Ques. What do you think about pleading ignorance in the midst of difficult issues; what is the reason for it?
J.T. They are not pleading it here. The Spirit of God tells us what spiritual condition was there. Did none of the men notice the peculiar way Absalom was carrying on?
Rem. This is so different from David's activities in the previous book; it is a direct contrast to his activities in connection with Nabal; his servant then was moving on the lines of "tell it to the assembly", @Matthew 18:17. Abigail was brought in and the matter was adjusted.
J.T. The man who brought the news to Abigail was not behind the time; he prevented a catastrophe But this man was too late with his news. Why did he not bring it earlier?
Rem. Commit these things "to faithful men", the apostle says. He did not contemplate committing things to any official class.
J.T. This man undoubtedly would be one of the faithful ones, but what strikes you is that there was no voice lifted earlier. These two hundred that Absalom took must have been distinguished men or
{138}
he would not have invited them; they would be leading brothers, and they did not know anything. Why do we not know? If we have assembly ears we shall know what is going on.
Rem. Absalom lowered the standard. He would not ask, 'Is thy heart right with my heart?' He would merely kiss the man, there was no challenge for his heart.
J.T. Absalom is only concerned to ingratiate himself with these men. A good or bad conscience does not mean anything to him.
Rem. I think this should help in the matter of saluting people; it has caused a lot of concern. The motive behind must unquestionably be the thing to test us; if you are going to greet these people in a 'hail fellow, well met' manner, that is not Christian saluting at all.
J.T. And we must remember that whilst Absalom comes down to them and kisses them he is still a man who has fifty men to run before him; he is like a church dignitary, he may come down but he is still a great man.
Rem. After a capture like this you can understand why the reformers went to the other extreme and called the pope the antichrist.
J.T. That is a point, too, in the history of the church; John says there are many antichrists, but we know that *the* antichrist is yet to come. Whatever people may say about men living today, no one of them is *the* antichrist. But there are men with the spirit of antichrist. Rome has carried on that spirit for centuries. There is a revival now and some testimony to Christ. It says in verse 13: "And there came one to David who reported saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom". It is not a casual remark, it is a report; it must be some voice lifted up by God, like Antipas, for instance, that is against the general state of things.
{139}
We now come to the real David so that in verse 14 "David said to all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Rise up and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom. Be quick to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword". This is a wise move because there was no time to spare. His true military instincts are aroused at once. If he had remained in Jerusalem and mustered his, forces (because he had them) there would have been civil war, whereas time brought about the overthrow of Absalom. The more time you give, the more the real thing is brought to light. "It is universally reported", etc., @1 Corinthians 5:1. The report is instituted by God to bring the real state of things to light.
Absalom is at the bar of every conscience in Jerusalem now. That is what the report says, "The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom". He had appointed that there should be a trumpet sound: "When ye hear the sound of the trumpet, ye shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron. And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem that were invited; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew nothing". But here is a faithful man reporting the thing, reporting the actual state of things. This is the real issue, we are on safe ground now, it is a known issue now. The person who returned to David placed the information where it ought to be, just as in the case of Nabal's servant; he told Abigail about Nabal's actions and in doing so he told her what kind of man Nabal was. That is, the whole matter was now in the hands of the assembly. But it is not the assembly here, it is *the king* ; he is the only one to save the position because he is the real David yet. The real Christ yet has some place, and this report is brought about for good so that there is ground for the battle.
Rem. "In that day will Jehovah of hosts be ...
{140}
for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate", @Isaiah 28:5. Absalom and his gate have now been displaced.
J.T. Turning the battle to the gate is where the solution lies. David is equal to this report, he is no longer apathetic, the whole position is to be changed through him. I think David's move was wise; Jerusalem saved is the whole position in David's mind. This is a rebellion, but the position is not to be changed; it is Christ and the assembly still; the report brings that into evidence. These hearts must be recovered, so that David is ready for all this and I think his procedure is wise.
Rem. What appeared to be defeat is victory.
J.T. He would not allow the ark to be carried with him; the position is *Jerusalem* or *nothing*. It cannot be a party matter. It is Christ and the assembly in this dispensation, or nothing; let us never be diverted from that. That is what David has in mind. If *I* have to go let the ark be there; God will bring me back if He is pleased with me. The ark represents the whole mind of God, there is never any change in that; it was never larger or smaller or of any different shape. It is "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come",
(@Hebrews 13:8). We may have to view it in an abstract way but we must hold on to that and God will give us victory on these lines. Some might say, Why should we recognise Jerusalem? Let them come out here to Antioch and fight it out here. But it must be Jerusalem. Paul says, "I went up by revelation", @Galatians 2:2. God told him to go up. So that the battle ground is *there*, the ark is there. Stand by it!
Ques. Does that fit in today with the thought of moral rather than positional victory as attaching to Jerusalem? In holding to the idea of Jerusalem morally we accept the humiliation, and are regarded
{141}
as not holding to anything much; but in our hearts and minds and spirits we are holding to everything.
J.T. "David said to all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Rise up and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom. Be quick to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword", verse 14. Yet Jerusalem is the right position. Well, you say, you are leaving the position; but it is not so. This is the first move, it is a military move, and so it says, "We shall not else escape"; that is the first thing. God had given him that advantage. Take every advantage away from the enemy that is possible. What a change in David here! It is the real David now with his servants and they are ready to do what he bids them. "And the king went forth and all his household after him", verse 16. Then, "The king went forth, and all the people after him, and stayed at the remote house. And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed over before the king", verse 17, 18. See what a David we have now! And there is not a dissenting voice. We have the real issue now with the real David, and the sequel shows that God was in all this.
Rem. Why does David say, "If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again?"
J.T. I think in reading through this chapter it would show that it is the real David now and we have to wait for the sequel to see whether what has been done is right. Very often we have to do that in our troubles; the issue shows whether the course has been right. Here is one man who has just come yesterday, and he is willing to go up. We have now come to the pass of the brook Kidron as a symbol of death. It is a real test now as to where we are in this issue.
{142}
Rem. David crossed in verse 23, and he said, "But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him", verse 6.
J.T. I think that is very beautiful.
Rem. It is not a personal matter with David. No matter how great the issue he does not regard it as personal, it is a question of God's interests.
J.T. Yes, it was a question of God. He said to Zadok the priest in verse 27, "*Thou art the, seer"*. That is an important remark, he gives him his place. David never put anybody like this away from him. Gad was David's seer; it was his salvation that he would allow a man like that near him, a man who would rebuke him. And then he says, "return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. See, I will stop in the plains of the desert until there come word from you to inform me. And Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem; and they abode there", verse 27 - 29. David had said in verse 25, "If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me *it, and its habitation*". I think that is very remarkable too, in these circumstances. David sees the whole position; God's choice, Jerusalem and God's ark, are everything. And if God shall delight in David He will bring him back and show him *it* and *its habitation*. The ark is more than David. It is like the apostles taking the official side, Christ working in His people. "The same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come", @Hebrews 13:8; no change in that. That is what I think he has in mind when he says that if God delights in him He will show him *it* and *its* habitation. That is salvation in every crisis. I do not take up a party attitude, it is not worth it. There is only one issue, Christ; the *official Christ in rejection*, but working through His people -- that is Jerusalem; and the
{143}
*testimonial Christ* -- that is the Ark, the unchallengeable thing that cannot be altered.
Rem. David, is a man of real feeling, he would not cause unnecessary slaughter. If we were really men of God we would not want to see the saints divided.
Rem. In verse 30 he seems to be more with God than hitherto. He wept as he went up the mount of Olives, barefoot. Is not that an important point at this time, bringing in a spiritual element that provides David with necessary light for the moment?
J.T. I am sure there is light in that. It is one of the best sections of the chapter.
Rem. Could you say a little more about the testimony, what is here in testimony? Is that what is held in the hearts of the saints?
J.T. It is the ark and nothing else. It never changed. Things were put into it I know, but the size never changed. There can be no change in what is testified to, no addition and no subtraction in Christ.
CHAPTER 16
J.T. I think we considered chapter 15 as far as the end of verse 30. The brook Kidron alludes to the death of Christ, and Olivet to His ascension, involving the Supper. There is evidently a sense of how far David and his people are from the truth represented in the mount of Olives, but they are not disregarding it. It is important in failure not to recede from the point already reached, and so we find in verse 32: "And it came to pass, when David had come to the summit, where he worshipped God";(@2 Samuel 15:32) it is morally suitable. In verse 30: "But David went up by the ascent of the Olives, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot; and all the people that was with him covered every
{144}
man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up", @2 Samuel 15:30. But he worshipped at the top.
Ques. You say the summit suggests the thought of ascension?
J.T. I think Olivet would be that in view of the light we have as to it later. It seems as if the Spirit calls attention to it. These details could easily be passed over if the Spirit was telling us only of David's flight, but the details of the flight involve spiritual features, that if one falls he comes back to the highest point, he recognises it. Their attitude here would seem to indicate that they recognised there had been failure in relation to it.
Ques. Is that why David wept?
J.T. I think so. He wept and had his head covered -- it would be a token of humility.
Ques. Do you think that the height spiritually in verses 30 - 32 is equal to the height of the position in chapter 5?
J.T. Yes, I think that is about right.
Rem. So that he is reaching *spiritually* what he had gained *positionally* in the beginning.
J.T. He is coming back to it now. I think the external garb and the weeping and bare feet would indicate a sense of failure as to that, and God takes account of our acknowledgment of failure as to any point reached, either positionally or in our souls, if we have been untrue to it.
Ques. Would the position be held more definitely as reached through weeping?
J.T. It seems so. It was a suitable way to go up. Stress is laid on passing over the brook Kidron, which is the death of Christ; the passing over is fundamental. In addition to the death of Christ being accepted, there must be stress on the *passing over*. Ittai and his household passed over, and the king's household, and all the people. Now Olivet is spiritual elevation.
{145}
Ques. What phase of the death of Christ is the brook Kidron?
J.T. It stands in relation to the holy things of God, the death of Christ seen in proximity to the greatest thoughts of God.
Ques. Do you mean as represented in Jerusalem?
J.T. And in Olivet too. When the Lord came this way, the reverse way, into the city, the colt was held there; he was held in relation to the most precious thoughts of God, like a young man held in a Christian household. Now David is going in reverse order, but Kidron is stressed; it is called a torrent. It alludes to the death of Christ in this setting. Jordan does also, but not in the same relation to the precious thoughts of God. These are the most precious surroundings, a variety of precious thoughts of God standing in relation to it as to the Lord's supper.
Ques. Do you connect it with @John 18 coming after chapter 17, describing these wonderful things, the suffering side related to the greatest thoughts?
J.T. They did not go as far as Olivet there, the time had not come for it. It is His death in relation to the most precious things.
Ques. Do they come to Olivet in the beginning of Acts?
J.T. It would seem so in connection with Christ's death, resurrection and ascension.
Rem. In a previous reading you said something about the *official* Christ being outside, and the *testimonial* Christ inside the city; is that right?
J.T. I think that was said. The ark remains in the city although Christ is rejected; that is Christ going to heaven but leaving the testimony here.
Christ's interests have to be looked after, God sees to that. The testimonial side was left in Jerusalem where it belongs; it never leaves, we hold it by faith. So now the assembly is obscured, submerged outwardly,
{146}
but it exists abstractly, and in a concrete sense too; and faith holds the testimony in relation to *it*. Ittai in verse 22 passed over the brook with his household. David says: "Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him". (@2 Samuel 15:22) He passed over householdly to be with the king. That is personal, the position we occupy *personally* ; but Jerusalem is the centre of everything. Although abandoned for the moment, it stands. And Kidron stands, a testimony to the death of Christ nearby.
So that the ark must go back there; that is Christ in another way. The ark remains separate from David in the city, in Jerusalem, but David is outside personally and affection leads us to go with Him, ourselves and our houses; we take sides with Christ.
Rem. The ark had gone across the torrent and then was taken back.
J.T. It was someone else's thought, not David's, to take the ark: "And behold, Zadok also, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had passed completely out of the city", @2 Samuel 15:24. They thought that it should be taken with the king, but the king had other thoughts; he would leave the position as it was. The mind of God as represented in the ark is unaltered.
Rem. There may be those who are spiritually right who may for a short time participate in moving on party lines. This may be a *beginning to move* on party lines.
J.T. And assuming that you are taking everything with you. But the Lord in going up to heaven did not take everything with Him; He left Jerusalem as it was, and the Spirit comes back to the divine thought; not to *us*, but to *the divine thought*. We have to take up the truth abstractly first and the
{147}
truth abstractly implies Jerusalem and all that enters into it; even if Christ was put to death there, it is still Jerusalem. You begin with the mind of God, not with history.
Rem. In @John 18 we find that this place was known by the enemy; Judas knew that Jesus often resorted thither.
J.T. When they came to take Him they went backwards and fell to the ground; @John 18:6. David would understand that the ark would take care of itself, as it did in the land of the Philistines. And it is in this world yet, the antichrist will not force it out, God sees to that. It is the abstract idea that helps. *Persons* are the concrete thought, but the abstract idea stands.
Ques. "Why persecutest thou me?", @Acts 9:4. Is that the ark?
J.T. That would be the persons viewed as Christ; it would be the saints, involving the body, but the ark has to be taken account of abstractly. It is properly never anything but Christ. It is the divine thought and it holds its position; it cannot be overthrown. "The firm foundation of God stands", @2 Timothy 2:19. It is an abstract thought, it cannot be overthrown.
Ques. Is Jerusalem held still in the mind of God and in the minds of the saints?
J.T. It says it is above now, "Jerusalem above which is our mother", @Galatians 4:26; but the idea is there, and it comes out presently in Jerusalem on earth. I do not know if what is being said as to the abstract side is clear, but we shall never be settled in our souls until we see the fixity that is unalterable. No one can overthrow it.
Ques. "Wherefore also Jesus ... suffered without the gate", @Hebrews 13:12. Would that be like Ittai's position here?
J.T. Yes, it would -- going out. But it does not
{148}
alter the position of the testimony. The mind of God stands as it was. Going out to Christ is a personal matter. Our position outwardly in relation to Christ has to be taken up distinctly by itself; the foundation does not go with us, it stands. It is the abstract thought, it is what God has here by the Spirit as indicated in these scriptures. Of course, it is in persons, but the stability lies in holding the thing abstractly; that is, it stands.
Rem. So it is not a question as to whether the testimony is with us, it is whether we are with the testimony.
Ques. What did you mean when you said the ark could take care of itself?
J.T. I was alluding to it in the Philistine land; no Levite, no priest, and yet Dagon fell before it. It had to be sent back to its place. That is God's doing; God is God. "Be still and know that I am God", @Psalm 46:10. The ark is the great general thought and it has its own proper setting and place.
Rem. These five men who remain in Jerusalem are used in relation to the ark.
J.T. The ark is the great fundamental thought; these men are used in relation to it. They are mentioned in chapter 15: Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, and with them their two sons, Ahimaaz and Jonathan; that is four, and then Hushai; two priests, Hushai, and two young men. They are holding the ground, but the great central thought is the ark, as David says in verse 25, "Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again and show me it, and its habitation" (@2 Samuel 15:25).
Rem. Where it says in @Ephesians 1, "Blessed with all spiritual blessings", I suppose that is the abstract thought that we always keep in our minds.
J.T. The personal side is in those who go out
{149}
after David. These five men are sent back into the city. Although Jerusalem in our dispensation may have been destroyed, the thought is not destroyed, and the ark is in relation to that; "*it* and *its habitation"*, whatever that might be. The idea of Jerusalem is maintained in the assembly. Christ left all these things behind and the Spirit has come down to maintain them. These five are sent back to hold the ground.
Ques. Does Corinthians give the abstract idea as well as what was actually going on in connection with the whole position? The apostle clothed the saints there with the full light of what they were abstractly in Christ, and in chapter 5 he says, "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as *ye are unleavened*. For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth", @1 Corinthians 5:7,8. Is that the abstract thought?
J.T. That is it exactly. Parallel with the existing conditions, you carry on with these great abstract thoughts of God. They have come down from the Old Testament, as all testimonial ministry has *for us*. Even the prophets, we are told, did not know for whom they were speaking; all was coming down to us, and all was testified to and exemplified in Christ. But He left these things here. He taught His disciples about many things, about the kingdom, and many other things all exemplified by Him and left here; and they stay here and go right through to the millennium. David had the right thought: "If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me it and its habitation", @2 Samuel 15:25. I think that is a very intelligent and beautiful attitude in David. All the great thoughts of God are preserved. Christ is rejected and goes to heaven but
{150}
that does not leave a vacant place here. David did not take the ark away, it is still here.
Rem. What is recovered to us is exactly what they had at the beginning.
J.T. We were brought back a hundred years ago to something already existing.
Rem. David said in the Psalms that he would not give sleep to his eyes until he had found a habitation for the ark. He had that in his mind.
J.T. He had that in mind and he effected it. We have already seen that he brought the ark from the houses of Abinadab and Obed-Edom and put it in Jerusalem under a curtain; he carried out his thought, meaning that he carried out the divine thought, the divine thought underlying his thought. The idea of the tent originated with him. That had been reached by David here.
Rem. Assembly action would be on this basis in the abstract. What we do today is all in view of this same principle.
J.T. Certainly. The recovery of one hundred years ago was an abstract thought at first. God revealed it to a man, he got it in his mind; it was an abstract thought but it soon began to take form. It is what they had at Pentecost.
Rem. We favour the idea that we have reached the thing as it is in perfection whereas we may be a long way from that, but we are moving up to it, as David did.
J.T. We are gradually being brought to it. That is what David had in his mind here. It makes him a very great man. The ark went back in weakness, but there were five men in the city; it overthrew Absalom, and David came back.
Ques. Where does that apply historically?
J.T. It is only in testimony. The recovery implies that the Lord has, as it were, been brought back in testimony to the thought He began with.
{151}
Rem. This really fits in more with the present recovery.
J.T. Rome took everything, they laid claim to all features of the testimony and carried them off into Babylon; but the primary thought of God is not carried off, it stands, it cannot be overthrown; the *sure* foundation of God stands.
Ques. Where has David spiritual power in this connection?
J.T. I think you see it here when he says, "Carry back the ark of God into the city", @2 Samuel 15:25. That is the thing to get hold of, that the ark and its habitation stand; they are not captivated. The matter lies in divine thoughts and that is what we are brought back to.
Rem. It is this abstract thought that helps in working things out locally, for tangibly we do not have these things. We can only hold the city, the administrative side, or the temple as they are represented in Scripture, and seeing that as the pattern, we are working the thing out in persons.
J.T. Exactly. What was left at Jerusalem was not only the abstract thought -- these five men would maintain the concrete thought; and wherever you have any leader, any brother who has the thing in his soul, you can follow him. You have first two priests, and they have with them their two sons; they are subordinate, I may say; David is differentiating between priestly intelligence and youthful energy, both needed. Then you have another man, Hushai, the king's friend. He is loyal, you can trust that man, he will die for the king. You want your friend to be where you need him most. If the testimony of God is being attacked, the friends of Christ are to be where the attack it. "*Ye* are my friends if ye practise whatever *I* command you", @John 15:14. Friendship is loyalty.
Rem. David was exercised that the counsel of Ahithophel should be overthrown.
{152}
J.T. He prayed for that. He had in his mind that God would use Hushai. "There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother", @Proverbs 18:24. Christ's brethren are not so reliable as Christ's friends. It is a reproach on David that Ahithophel had such a place in the kingdom, "so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom",
verse 23. That seems to me a reproach on David, that the man he regarded so highly is regarded highly in the antichristian realm. He is not a true man, his history shows that, and he becomes a suicide. They have such men as this in the world, they cannot be trusted.
Ques. Why is there such interest in the mind of David as to what goes on in the city? "And it shall be, that whatsoever thing thou shall hear out of the king's house thou shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. Behold they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send to me everything that ye shall hear", @2 Samuel 15:37.
J.T. That would mean that the Lord is interested in everything that goes on, in the concrete working out of things. Alongside that there is this fundamental thought that is impregnable; the Holy Spirit being here it must stand. And now we see that Hushai, David's friend, came into the city just as Absalom came into Jerusalem; verse 37.
Ques. Does the priest look after the ark, whereas Hushai looks after what is personal in relation to David? I was thinking of verse 36.
J.T. That is the part of Jonathan and Ahimaaz, the priests¬ two sons, or whatever agency they had. Hushai seems to have had to face everything; he has to face Absalom, he has to take up the role of being Absalom's friend. That may raise a moral question as to why he should deceive, but we have to make allowance for the time; the antitype is
{153}
what we have to do with. The friend of Christ has to face the enemy in full strength.
Rem. "The mystery of the kingdom" is the solution for the difficulty in the New Testament, standing for the Lord and His rights against the whole political system; and in preaching the gospel we are preaching the overthrow of the world.
J.T. Whilst the profession of Christianity is recognised, the powers that be will make allowance for "religious beliefs". They may call them what they like so long as they allow us to go on with them.
Rem. Eventually it spells the overthrow of the world's system politically and otherwise.
J.T. Speaking as we are now, *we are not against the powers that be* ; it is well to keep that clear. "The powers that be" are in the abstract representatives of what is of God. These men are to overthrow what is *not* of God, seen in Absalom's kingdom. We are not against the powers that be and they should not so regard us. We are exhorted to pray for all in authority. What is seen will ultimately appear in the man of sin. We are not ashamed to say that we are against that, but we must be fair; as soon as a man gets into power he is not a politician, he is a ruler, representing law and order.
Rem. It is what can ally itself with this ecclesiastical system, that kind of thing, that we are against.
J.T. What represents this Absalom character; we are not ashamed to say that we are against that from the Pope down. The testimony is against all that, but the testimony is not against rule, it is for rule and authority.
Rem. When the beast comes up in Revelation the religious matter is inseparable from it.
Rem. We see in Hushai what brought Absalom down.
J.T. He counsels generally, but then these other men are important to keep in mind, too, because
{154}
they represent the concrete conditions that the Lord has ordained here in this world. Now we have Hushai coming into the city at the end of chapter 15, at the same time as Absalom, a remarkable co-incidence. Hushai had David in mind, and he would go the utmost limits in loyalty to David. Chapter 15 shows us the hidden system set up by God in great obscurity and reproach; it concealed itself, but it was there, and the ark was there. All these allusions hold thoughts: Jerusalem, the mount of Olives, Kidron, heaven is watching over all. Absalom came into all that and the issue is plain enough: Hushai stands for what is of David and Absalom is anti-David. Here is the enemy attacking David, but David is worshipping; that is the best position he has reached yet. Barefoot and humble, as he gets to the summit he worships.
In chapter 16 he is past the summit and Satan gets the advantage of him. Even a man like David Satan attacks. Acting professedly as a friend, Ziba slanders another brother, a good brother, too, as one could call Mephibosheth. He tells David lies about him and David listens.
Rem. The wise woman has one way of attack, Absalom another and Ziba another.
J.T. That is well to notice, the kind of tests that come up, subtle things said by persons who ought to be your friends. They are intended by the devil to discredit the brethren. Here Satan allied himself with persons and David fell under his power.
Rem. This man Ziba had a link with Saul.
J.T. Yes, David addresses him as Saul's servant, he is recognising him in that position; but he is professedly friendly to David, Shimei comes after, but Ziba is more dangerous because he is attacking him secretly. He is telling lies about a brother.
Rem. This happened when David was "a little past the summit".
{155}
J.T. Your highest point is the summit, your next step is the one to watch.
Rem. It is remarkable that these five men all work in unity in defending David.
J.T. These five men are directly appointed by David to be there; they represent the concrete working out of that of which the ark is the foundation. Everything hinges on what the ark is. David knew that; he looks on it as the centre of the testimony, and these men are the instruments to work this out and to bring down what is opposed to it. Ahithophel came into the city at the same time as Hushai. If Absalom is to dominate in Jerusalem the testimony would be affected, because Jerusalem is essential to the testimony, it is the abstract thought. Hushai being there means that Absalom is going to be overthrown. These other four persons are important also.
Rem. "Hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it", @Matthew 16:18. Hades¬ counsels are really overthrown by this man.
J.T. And then there are these other two groups, the priestly element and the two younger men entirely subservient to them to carry the tidings.
Ques. I want to ask if the spiritual discerns that this is slander, or whether in this case David might never get over the feelings he had towards Mephibosheth?
J.T. Suppose this should happen with us, especially with one who is prominent. Someone comes to him with a story about a brother. Let us examine it. Well now, David should say, it is Mephibosheth, he has been sitting at my table all these years and he has been faithful; how could he expect to be made king, or who would make him king? David should look at it in that way. If he thought over it he would say, That does not look right, that poor man could never be king, it is Absalom we have to fear. But instead he listens to the story and it would seem that he never got over it. It seems to me here that
{156}
the leading brothers, as we speak, brothers of prominence ought to be warned. A man comes with a story about another brother. If it is a Ziba, well, he is a servant of Saul. That is his history. Is there any possibility that he is a little jealous of Mephibosheth, that he wants to supplant him? Why could not David, discerning man that he was, see that? "And Ziba said. The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruits for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink", verse 2. What a fine story this is! He has thought it all out; he has just what the king needs, and the story is intended to catch him. It is so formed as to appeal to him and make him think, This man can help me. But it is a dangerous thing. David should have thought, I ought to sift the thing out that Mephibosheth has so changed his attitude toward me. David does not seem to have stopped to think of it in this way; he seems to feel, This is just what I need; I had better take it.
Ques. Does not every crisis supply opportunity for one with a partisan spirit to come forward?
J.T. Quite so, to make the best of the position. This was a great opportunity for Ziba to ingratiate himself with David.
Rem. There is need for spiritual discernment.
J.T. Yes. How Ziba slanders his brother! He has thought this story out well, even to caring for those who might be faint in the wilderness, and David would think him a very sympathetic man. Think of the poor faint brothers he is providing for! The king said, "Where is thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold he abides at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father". The king did not ask a word more but said to Ziba, "Behold, thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth" Just think of
{157}
taking one man's testimony in such a serious thing as this! David hands over all this property to this man. That is a solemn consideration to all those who minister, as to how easily we might be deceived by a story like this.
Rem. A real friend does not need to resort to any of this sort of approach; you cannot imagine Hushai giving David any such line as this.
J.T. "Thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth". That is just what I
want, says Ziba. He has deceived the king, and later the king tells him to divide this same property. That shows the king was not right about this matter even then.
Ques. Is David here a type of ourselves in our local relations?
J.T. He is particularly a type of any distinguished brother who listens to a story about somebody else. Why not get some other witness, sift the matter? Why not say, This seems peculiar: Mephibosheth has been loyal to me; and furthermore he is a lame man; he could never be king. David should have thought thus.
Rem. @Psalm 101 says, "Whoso secretly slandereth his neighbour, him will I destroy", @Psalm 101:5. How utterly that gift blinds David's eyes!
J.T. It is well thought out. "Asses for the king's household ... and the bread and summer fruits for the young men" -- that is a very thoughtful brother. But it was designed to deceive David.
Ques. Are these weaknesses constitutional with David?
J.T. Somewhat, I believe. I suppose they are recorded for those who are more prominent in service, lest we should be too confident in ourselves. We are amenable to influence, the most spiritual of us, and I believe that is the lesson to learn. Suppose we were in need and the thing is brought and laid out before
{158}
us, we might think. This man is for the saints, he is thinking of the faint ones.
Rem. These two priests in Jerusalem were persons who would be able to hear; something was to be conveyed to them and sent out to David. David was not hearing properly, he was not priestly. All of us, sisters and brothers, are likely to fail where news is concerned; news travels fast and becomes distorted. The question is whether we are *able to hear* rightly and to get the facts of the matter.
J.T. The Lord was called "the judge of Israel" when He was a prisoner at the bar. "Judge righteous judgment", He says.
CHAPTER 17
J.T. It would be helpful to keep in mind the secret system established by David in the city, of which we spoke; that is, two priests and their sons, and Hushai. This chapter reveals the wisdom of it and the success of it. The apparent deception that marked Hushai is to be allowed for because of the lack of intelligence in those days, corresponding with Rahab's case and others.
Ques. What have you to say about Ahithophel in the end of chapter 16? "And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had inquired of the word of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom" (@2 Samuel 16:23).
J.T. It was regarded, I suppose, as an oracle, the word 'oracle' alluding to a medium between God and man.
Ques. Is there not certainty, however, where the word of God is given to any of the prophets or men of God in the Old Testament? It was never accompanied by an 'if' or condition; it was "Jehovah
{159}
said", or a certain man enquired and "This is what Jehovah said".
J.T. I suppose "as if" here would mean that he was not really an oracle, but was regarded in that way.
Rem. Emphasis is laid upon the fact that David and Absalom so regarded his counsel.
J.T. I think to show that it was not rightly appraised; it was too highly appraised because it did not go beyond the wisdom of this world; it was foolishness. The wisdom of this world is said to be foolishness. It may have served well earlier when he was right with David, but now it is exposed.
Ques. Did it portend failure at the start for Absalom and his army?
J.T. I suppose from an ordinary military standpoint it was good advice, but God frustrated it; it became foolishness.
Rem. It is called "good" counsel in verse 14.
J.T. That is, 'good' in that sense, quite so.
Ques. Would you liken it to the wisdom of the unjust steward?
J.T. The man's lord commended him and then the Lord Himself says, "For the sons of this world are, for their own generation, more prudent than the sons of light", @Luke 16:8. That is, they do excel at times; but David had asked of Jehovah: "I pray thee turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness", @2 Samuel 15:31. That is, I think, how the wisdom of this world is capable of being turned into foolishness, by the wisdom that excelleth, the wisdom of God, which Hushai represented. The best that the world can afford, as you might say, in the way of wisdom, is capable of being thus defeated. The Greeks *sought* after it, but at best it is foolishness. God was not in it. There is no reference to God in what Ahithophel says.
Ques. Would you say there should have been, seeing the ark was there?
{160}
J.T. Quite so. There should have been; but so far as I can see there is not. David had said of the ark, "If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me it, and its habitation", @2 Samuel 15:25. Then he appealed to God to defeat the wisdom or counsel of Ahithophel. It was good from the human standpoint, but the best of that sort of wisdom is foolishness with God.
Rem. The princes of this world made a great display of wisdom when they crucified the Lord of glory, but the resurrection brought it all to naught.
J.T. It says so expressly. They did not understand the hidden wisdom that comes out with Hushai. Zoan represents the wisdom of the world. Isaiah speaks of it, "They are but fools, the princes of Zoan", @Isaiah 19:11, and they were foolish although they were skilled in this world's wisdom. We are told that Hebron was built seven years before that town. That is what is alluded to in @1 Corinthians 2, the "hidden wisdom" (verse 7), that was before the wisdom of Zoan and superior to it. So I think Ahithophel here is representative of the best that there is in human wisdom -- so near, that it was like an oracle. But then it failed, it is simply rejected, it does not accomplish the end in view.
Rem. According to the end of verse 14, God has His end in view.
J.T. That is the thing, there is no possibility of defeat of the hidden wisdom. Of course, God ordered this advice here, and it was good counsel from an ordinary point of view, but it is defeatable. Not so the hidden wisdom -- that goes through.
Ques. Is that the bearing you are giving this secret combination?
J.T. I think that is what comes out. Christ is the wisdom of God according to @1 Corinthians 1:24. The wisdom of God extends back before the creation, it was there as the creation began. Wisdom says
{161}
she was by Jehovah in what He was doing. The kind of wisdom that Ahithophel had was not there; it was excellent so far as it went, but it arose from human skill, man's wisdom. I think in 1 Corinthians we get the contrast to that, that is, what was before the world and what the princes of this world had. Zoan represents their headquarters.
Rem. As over against the secret side which succeeds there is this public side, which may have gone even further than Ahithophel intended. "They spread a tent for Absalom upon the roof", @2 Samuel 16:22. It was a public matter, as over against what was working in the city in a secret way.
J.T. Ahithophel's counsel was good, it is called good here, but only in a relative sense. It could not be said to be good over against the wisdom of God. The wisdom of God had designed this whole matter and Hushai was there, belonging to the secret service. There is a secret service and a public service. The public service in a country would be such things as the Cabinet and the President, but there is also a secret service in every country. So it is that the epistle to the Corinthians contemplates the secret service, the "hidden wisdom", as it says. The secret service is hidden in the mystery, that is, it is a mysterious thing; "in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge", @Colossians 2:3.
Rem. I suppose it must have looked at Colosse as if philosophy and vain deceit were really wonderful. There must have been danger of the saints being taken in by it.
J.T. That was the danger at Colosse. I suppose if we had been at this meeting with Ahithophel we would have said, It would be hard to overcome that counsel. But it is overcome and that is the point; the secret service of God will overcome the public service of man, however well ramified it is and however much education, experience and ability it may
{162}
display, for it is short of the real thing. This counsel was not an oracle of God.
Rem. If Ahithophel had been spiritually minded he would have detected that Hushai was giving counsel for his undoing.
J.T. That is really the case, the mystery of God is for the undoing of the world's system. There is nothing disloyal to the powers that be in saying that, because they are included in the Gentile monarchies and are part of the divine scheme. The thing came out in a secret way, Daniel read the secrets. It required him to make the thing clear that the *Gentile monarchies belonged to the secret service of God* -- the Babylonish, Persian, Grecian and Roman. Therefore any remarks we are making now are not in the least disloyal to the powers that be because they are just provisional; they abstractly do not belong to the world system, it is a great mistake to assume that they do. They are forced by God to exercise their power for the benefit of the testimony, so that this secret service is no disloyalty to *them* , it is aiming at the overthrow of the world in a *moral* sense, what is antichristian. The secret service of God and the mystery are opposed to all that.
Rem. It is a power that extends beyond the government of this world. This philosophy and vain deceit belonged to Satan's world, it came from there.
J.T. It did; that great system was really designed I am sure, to compete with the secret service of God that He intended to inaugurate.
Rem. I suppose if the government interfered with the religious affairs it would be a different matter.
J.T. God is directly against antichrist. The mystery is the mystery of the grace of God, and it is a secret state of things. If the government elects to attack what is of God, as Nebuchadnezzar and others that followed him did, then of course it comes
{163}
to issue with God. But the abstract government that they are exercising is of God.
Rem. Those of the captivity were enjoined to submit because these powers were just an instrumentality in the hands of God to effect discipline.
J.T. There is a remarkable illustration in @Jeremiah 24 showing that the first captivity under Nebuchadnezzar secured a constructive element: the king of Judah, the princes, the craftsmen and the smiths.
They were constructive. God says they are like good *figs* and His hand will be over them for good. They are subject to the government of God. As submitting we are regarded as good figs. Those who remained, refusing this discipline, were called bad figs.
Rem. When Daniel was giving the secret of the image with the head of gold he did not carry the history up to antichrist's time, only to the stone destroying the last kingdom.
J.T. That is not strictly antichristian, it is only a condition that government has come to; the kingdom is still there, the iron and clay.
Ques. Will the final action be the destruction of this monarchy?
J.T. They are all of one piece. "These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth", @Zechariah 6:5. The head of gold, breast and arms of silver, the brass, iron, and iron and clay, all these represent the mind of God until Christ comes.
Rem. Antichrist becomes political as well as military.
J.T. And God is openly against *him*. Absalom was antichristian in principle, but these four monarchies are not, they really belong to the secret service; God has them for His own purposes. Not everybody sees that, but when we are told to pray for them that is what is meant.
Rem. The stone cut out without hands will break
{164}
in pieces every other government; we carry that in our minds.
J.T. It is well for the brethren to ponder this line of things because it will help us in these critical times. Pilate is a good example, he said what was right in his official capacity, he found no fault in the Lord and he said, "Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and have authority to crucify thee?" (@John 19:10). He got his power from God.
Ques. Between the captivity and the return again to the official kingdom in the millennium, is the secret service operating in these four great monarchies?
J.T. Quite so, and the salvation of the original nation that had the kingdom and forfeited it by its wickedness, lay in submitting to the new provisional order made by God in Nebuchadnezzar which was seen secretly and interpreted by Daniel. Nebuchadnezzar was converted so as to enhance the whole position; he is the head of gold.
Rem. The antichrist becomes a usurper. Absalom takes the place belonging to another.
J.T. These Gentile monarchies began with Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar was converted and enjoined everybody to worship God. He knew that all power belonged to God, he was forced to learn that.
Ques. By extension, does that apply even today in conditions we see in certain countries?
J.T. The first thing to see is the abstract idea of *government* in every one of them. It is of God. In @Acts 5 there were three agencies employed. The first was the angel who opened the door of the prison and said, "Go ye and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life", @Acts 5:20. "*All* the words", of that life must be protected and made known in this world. The second time they were arrested *the people* were used to protect them and the officers could not do anything; and then thirdly
{165}
Gamaliel was used. So that the testimony is set free through these agencies. All these are of God.
Rem. Had the princes of this world known they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
J.T. "Had they known", but they would not be like you and me, for only true Christians know the wisdom of God.
Rem. From the standpoint of wisdom they would not have done it either, apart from conversion, for had they known it, they were thwarting their own ends.
J.T. It is a remarkable way of putting it. They are the princes of this world and are said to be fools. "The place of a skull" -- Golgotha was that. All the wisdom of this world was there and it was nothing but a skull. All the wisdom of God was in the One crucified, but they had nothing in their skulls.
Rem. Had Absalom known he would not have allowed the wisdom of Ahithophel to be defeated.
Ques. How do you view some of our brethren suffering at the hands of the government in other countries today?
J.T. It is hard to say. Of course, the Lord suffered at their hands. Take Pilate, viewing him abstractly he was right. He said, "I find no fault in him". How did he say that? He was under the right influence of what he represented. But presently other things came up and we see that he was a corrupt man personally; when these things were thrown into the scale against Christ he gave way; but abstractly as a governor he was right. His wife said, "I have suffered today many things in a dream because of him". (@Matthew 27:19) She must have been in some way affected by Christ Himself.
Ques. In this same connection is there a similarity in what the thief says: "Dost thou too not fear God?" and, "we indeed justly, for we receive the
{166}
just recompense of what we have done", @Luke 23:40,41. I was wondering if that enters into the abstract idea?
J.T. The kingdom is in his mind, "*Thy* kingdom". He belonged to the under-world and he suffered rightly; he did not justify himself.
Rem. He was accepting the rule of the powers that be, admitting he was suffering justly.
J.T. Yes, and he told the other man. He virtually said to the Lord, You have a kingdom: "Remember me when thou comest in *thy* kingdom", @Luke 23:42. "*In* it", that is, When You come and rule the world, remember me.
Rem. These two men on either side of Jesus were really there rightly in regard of God's government.
J.T. The government of God put them there. One man accepted it; he belonged to the under-world, and the under-world will not accept government if they can avoid it. He was accepting it, the rule of God's kingdom in the sense of the four monarchies; but he saw another kingdom and he says to the Lord, When You come *in Your* kingdom, remember me. He came round to the right thought. The real thing is the accepting of the government that is, and this man recognised that whatever government put him on that cross was right.
Rem. With regard to the discipline of the people of God, we were noticing recently how this worked out in connection with Hazael. Elisha tells him the king is going to die and that he is going to reign in his stead and do evil to the children of Israel (@2 Kings 8:12). He is going to do all this damage but there was a reason for it, it was God. Hazael was only the instrumentality.
J.T. Yes, because Hazael was anointed of God according to the instruction to Elisha.
Rem. So that in these matters it is not a dictator or a ruler, it is God, and the sooner the people of
{167}
God recognise that the more quickly the door will be opened.
J.T. We cannot be sure whether they have rejected the government of God. Do they see the abstract idea of government that the thief saw?
"We receive the just recompense of what we have done". (@Luke 23:41) He recognises the Roman government. But here is another king, who put Him there? The same power. *He*, was not suffering justly. Pilate failed, because he justified Jesus at the beginning, showing what this government is in the four monarchies. Even the watchmen at the grave are made to do what is right.
Rem. And then there was the inscription over the cross in three languages; it was Pilate who gave orders for this to be done.
J.T. God undoubtedly made him do it. These men in power are governed by bit and bridle. Pilate writes that Jesus is King of the Jews, there it is and he will not change it. God did that. The thief went further: he said, "When thou comest in *thy* kingdom", @Luke 23:42. He had light that that Man was a King and had a kingdom.
Ques. Was the Lord subject to Pilate as representative of the powers that be?
J.T. He suffered first of all vicariously. We must see clearly that there is no suffering attaching to Him save what is vicarious. He suffered for righteousness personally, but not from God; He suffered from God in a vicarious sense only.
Rem. So that suffering there is suffering for righteousness.
J.T. It is only when He is taking man's place on the cross, we cannot say anything else.
Rem. At the same time He was personally never more pleasurable to God.
Ques. As to the tendency of some of us to be National -- how would you balance the thought of the
{168}
powers that be in the abstract sense with the tendency towards nationalism?
J.T. That has, of course, to be watched, because the national feeling is just natural and objectionable; hence we are told to pray for *all* those that are *in authority*. The whole government of the world is our interest.
Rem. Then we are to respect the British power and the French and Italian and German too, as all one sort of thing, details of which are employed in the secret service system in order to work out God's plan.
J.T. And you pray for them *all*. I was thinking just this week what a place of dignity the saints have. Here are these powers appearing one after another, but here are the saints, and heaven is looking down on the saints; God is looking at the saints and paying attention to them. So that "the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, but he revealeth his secrets unto his servants the prophets", @Amos 3:7. That gives you the idea that He has His people here and He is looking toward us and listening to us. That is what turns the scales.
Ques. Would it be right to say that what God does in regard to the governments is not dependent upon the prayers of the saints, but rather that He is seeking that the prayers of the saints may be in accordance with His mind?
J.T. God intends that; but then, God can carry on His government by Himself. The living creatures and the elders in the midst of the throne are with God; but He looks towards us, and I think He has great pleasure in the meetings for prayer in all these matters.
Rem. God said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?" (@Genesis 18:17). This would seem to indicate that it was to be done whether Abraham knew or not, but that God would give the saints an
{169}
indication of what He is doing so that there might be sympathy.
J.T. Abraham really is a foreshadowing of this particular period in which we are, the period of the world's reconciliation. It is held on the principle of reconciliation, and Abraham prays for the king; that gives you the clue. God is on His way, as it were. He and the two men, three men it says, and they come by Abraham's tent. He is not the objective, because it is the time of government and God is appealed to as the Judge of all the earth. He is on His way somewhere and He comes by Abraham: that is the position, and then it is a question of what He finds. He will go on by Himself, because three would mean completeness. But what did He find? If He were to come by this city what would He find. He might not find anything He could use. We may be able to preach the gospel, but we may not be able to enter into these thoughts about the government of this world. If we are not equal to that He will have to go on. If He finds only intelligence enough for preachings and readings, etc., He will make the most of that. He did not say anything to Abraham about Sodom at first, it is a question of what He finds. Will He find Abraham at his tent door ready to do everything that was right? He asks for Sarah, as if to say, I will say something about her, and that is often what God does; He will tell us something about the church and pass on. He asks about Sarah and tells something about Sarah, that is, the church; and then about Isaac, that is, Christ, He says something about Him; but then He goes on. Abraham says, I will go with you. To go with Him, that is the secret of the disclosure as to what God is going to do. And Jehovah says, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?", @Genesis 18:17. Why did He not say that before? I think it is because Abraham went with Him and interceded for the world.
{170}
Rem. There was prayer for Peter but there is no reference to any for James.
J.T. That is a good illustration, but with Peter the assembly was not equal to the thing. It was a poor situation. You recall that when Peter came there was nobody to open the door; and the one that understands and would open comes in for persecution. But here is a striking case because @Genesis 18 is a record of the earth. "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing? Since Abraham shall indeed become a great and mighty nation; and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, in order that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what he hath spoken of him", @Genesis 18:17 - 19. So that God does not hide from Abraham what He is going to do; this man must be brought into the matter; he is worthy of it and he is equal to it.
Rem. Abraham is able to intercede for Sodom and Gomorrah but he does not succeed.
J.T. But destruction would have been deferred a long time if there had been only ten righteous men. There is hope that God will continue to intervene in matters today.
Rem. The prayer meeting really becomes a test. Certain brethren do not come. You wonder what the gospel really means to them.
J.T. They do not come to meetings like these either, where God gives light. They are not going with Him at all.
Rem. So it says here: "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grievous, I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know it", @Genesis 18:20,21. And then there is a long conversation there, as if
{171}
Jehovah does not move from the place until that prayer meeting is over. He is not going to move in regard to these national events until the prayer meeting is over. We are praying for fourteen hours, almost continuously, I suppose.
J.T. Yes, seventeen hours, the world round.
Ques. Would you say a little more about sonship? In this case that seems to be the test that Jehovah applied.
J.T. Yes, He enquires about Sarah and gives a promise about Isaac. Sarah is hardly equal to things, but she is there ready, within hearing. She does not bring the cakes and she laughs about Isaac, but Abraham still stood before Jehovah and Jehovah went on. Abraham has the place of intercessor for the whole world. And why not? He is heir of the world! Why should not we have that place? It is a question of the brethren seeing the position. The time of these four monarchies is under God. Daniel gets the mind of God and the first ruler becomes a converted man so as to enhance the position.
Rem. As over against the kind of rulers to whom the apostles had to say: "If it be righteous before God to listen to you rather than to God, judge ye", @Acts 4:19.
J.T. Yes; they are really dealing with the high priest and his family according to verses 6 and 7. The position of Annas and those with him was the authorised position, but they were really against the Roman Government, while the Roman representative was for Christ. Their position was untenable. They were under judgment and wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.
Ques. "Be in subjection therefore to every human institution for the Lord's sake", @1 Peter 2:13. How far does that go?
J.T. That would have to be read in the light of
{172}
the passage. The same passage tells us to honour the king as supreme.
Ques. I would like to ask about the prayers of three different classes: of the wicked, of nominal believers, and then of those whom these five men would represent, as to God hearing them. One noticed in the recent crisis how everybody seemed to be praying, and there were those who seemed to be intelligent about it. What do you think would be the effect of the prayers of these various persons?
J.T. I am not inclined to attach much importance to the prayers of persons who, in a crisis, turn to God and forget Him otherwise.
Rem. It says in Ezekiel that He does not hear them, these wicked people.
J.T. The prayer of the wicked is an abomination. It is almost entirely a matter of religious feeling, as the heathen would pray to their deity in a crisis. Abraham "is a prophet, and *he* will pray for thee", we get in @Genesis 20: 7.
Rem. The saints pray in view of God's interests.
J.T. That is it. Abraham represents the thing: "He is a prophet and he will pray for thee". @Psalm 105 opens up what such men were in those days: "Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm", @Psalm 105:15. They represented God, and that is the position now. It is the anointed priests and prophets, the saints viewed in that way, who have access to God. Abraham was the friend of God.
Rem. Perhaps more royalty enters into our prayer meetings than we are aware of. We are before God in kingly dignity and royalty.
J.T. We are said to be a royal priesthood.
Rem. The prayer of the righteous man has much power. It is in operation already.
Rem. In Revelation 5 it says, "Thou ... hast ... made them to our God kings and priests; and they shall reign over the earth", @Revelation 5:10.
{173}
J.T. Who are the speakers there? The living creatures and the elders. "And they sing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals; because thou hast been slain, and hast redeemed to God", @Revelation 5:9. That includes all of us here; the elders and the living creatures refer to the saints.
Ques. What about the expression, "a kingdom, priests to his God and Father", @Revelation 1:6?
J.T. That is another thought. The one we have just read is "kings and priests", but the other is "a kingdom", which, I suppose, would mean that the saints exercise rule in the kingdom. The kingdom is in the hands of the assembly now, our care meetings and all that are on kingdom lines; it is the government of God worked out among us.
Ques. Does @1 Timothy 2 include all that we have been saying about prayer, assembly prayer and household prayer?
J.T. I think so. "I exhort therefore, first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men", @1 Timothy 2:1. That is the assembly. But it is the *men* that do it audibly. "I will therefore that the men pray in every place" (@1 Timothy 2:8).
Rem. Intercession on high is for the saints, and we in turn pray and intercede for the powers that be.
J.T. Quite so. This passage is very important. You might say that the intercessory position of the assembly is seen in Timothy.
Ques. In the households where there are husband and wife, do both pray?
J.T. Not audibly. "I will therefore that the *men* pray in every place, lifting up pious hands", @1 Timothy 2:8. I take that to be in the house and out of it, wherever men are. Of course, women can pray secretly, and with the husband to a certain extent. But that passage in Timothy means that wherever prayer is openly made and brothers and sisters are there, the men do it.
{174}
Ques. That does not set aside the scripture, "that your prayers be not hindered", @1 Peter 3:7?
J.T. The wife is with the husband, of course. The idea is that men are to pray publicly.
Ques. What is the function of the kingly priesthood?
J.T. The holy priesthood is to offer up sacrifices, but the kingly is to "set forth the excellencies of him who has called you", @1 Peter 2:9. It is more our attitude towards men in blessing; we bless and curse not.
The priest blessed Israel.
Rem. Jacob blessed Pharaoh, the greater blesses the lesser.
J.T. That is what we are as representative of God.
Ques. Where does the wife pray?
J.T. She prays with her husband in spirit, and the whole family, but not audibly. That is the way I read that passage.
Rem. In these things there is always confirmation in Scripture; Hannah prayed, but there was no sound.
Ques. Do you think that the wisdom from above and the hidden wisdom are equivalent thoughts?
J.T. Quite so. James stresses the side that, "If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God", @James 1:5. The hidden wisdom is a very exalted thought, "that hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory", @1 Corinthians 2:7. We are to be enveloped in that, marked by that. I have been impressed with that this week. There are the powers that be, God has appointed them too, but we are the ones that He is attending to; He will listen to us.
Rem. "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed", @Genesis 12:3; that is a remarkable setting. Would that apply to ourselves?
J.T. We will suppose that you know that you are going to rule a country; well, everything in that country is of interest to you from that point onward.
{175}
And Abraham had the mind of God, he was heir to the world, he would think of the world from that standpoint; and that is what is meant by the world being in reconciliation.
Rem. Reconciliation in that sense can really only be understood by sons.
Ques. Is the kingdom of the heavens hidden?
J.T. You see how the Lord looks at the field as having purchased it in that way. That is how He is operating today in the world because the treasure is there.
Rem. The world held in reconciliation would mean that God is favourable to it.
Ques. Does James indicate that the title "friend of God" was earned, so to speak, through the exercise of faith in offering up Isaac?
J.T. I suppose that would come into it, but I think @Genesis 18 brings out the concrete position more than any other: "Shall I hide from Abraham", verse 17. You get the idea that he is equal to this as God's friend. I am sure that what we have had before us as to the secret service and the public service of God needs to be impressed upon our minds.
CHAPTER 17 (CONTINUED)
J.T. We closed last time with an allusion to the secret service of David seen in chapter 17. We scarcely got beyond verse 14, the counsels respectively of Ahithophel and Hushai. The counsel of Hushai is given from verse 7 to the end of verse 14 and the object is clearly to defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. Both counsels being given, verse 15 shows that the secret service began to operate in a more definite way. It had been operating in Hushai but now there is another added to the five we have mentioned in that service, that is, the maid in verse 17. They take on an unnamed person. Jonathan and Ahimaaz
{176}
were in En-rogel, the maid went and told them and they went and told king David. Then it says that a lad saw them and told Absalom. "Then they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there. And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn on it; and the thing was not known". As an outcome of all this, "By the morning light there was not one of them missing that had not gone over the Jordan". The secret service is operating and overcoming. Although it is discerned in its way by the agents of the world, the advice given is to pass over, that is, safety is in passing over Jordan, which I suppose applied spiritually would be a second experience of death. Kidron is the first and then Jordan.
Ques. Does the counsel rise to a high level in Hushai telling the priests what was taking place in order that the priests might pass on the information, the matter being handled in a priestly way?
J.T. That was what came before us a little. The names of all are mentioned, two priests, two sons and Hushai; and now we have a sixth, a nameless person, but doing good service, so that the service is on a high level. Spiritually it is the idea of the acceptance of death, passing over. How much is made of the words "pass over" in chapter 15! But now it is passing over the Jordan.
Ques. What is the difference between death at Kidron and death at Jordan?
J.T. I think as we were saying that Kidron is in the midst of great suggestions. Around it and in the vicinity are great thoughts; Jerusalem, the mount of Olives, the temple and the ark. There is one who crosses it in a special way; they all cross it to get out of Jerusalem, but the one whose crossing is strikingly emphasised is Ittai, a spiritual man;
{177}
he represents the idea. David was hindering him so as to bring out what was there. We have in him, I think, what gives understanding about Kidron. Ittai said, in answer to David's challenge: "As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life even there also will thy servant be ... . And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him", @2 Samuel 15:21, 22.
Rem. In the little ones passing over I suppose the idea of household baptism would be in view in this secret service. Perhaps that would account for the fact too that this maid is used.
J.T. You mean that she would be a household servant probably?
Rem. It might give an inspiring stimulus to household baptism. We need recruits for this secret service.
Ques. And is not the house brought in later at Bahurim?
J.T. Yes, and the woman and the well. The spiritual environment of Kidron is understood especially because of the spiritual depth of Ittai.
He makes a beautiful speech, and the acceptance of it unqualifiedly by the king is as much as to say, That is the thing; you qualify, Ittai. That must lend lustre to the whole position. The Jordan, however, is by itself. There is no temple nearby or anything of that kind suggestive of spirituality; but it is *history*. Jordan is history from the outset. It is the great division or barrier between Canaan and the wilderness. The ark is illustrated in its overthrow of the power of the Jordan, but there is no question of power in Kidron. It is a torrent, but the Jordan is satanic power concentrated, death in the hands of Satan; it seems to be the second great thought here, deliverance necessitates the passing over.
{178}
Ques. The Lord passed over Kidron with His disciples into the garden; is there any significance in that?
J.T. We were speaking about that, the correspondence between the two positions. It is this same brook, the same torrent; the true David is there and the traitor Judas, the son of perdition, answering to Absalom here. The Lord passed over into the garden to meet the enemy who was ahead of Him. Absalom was behind here. David was outside the city, but Satan and the great conflict with death was in the garden of Gethsemane. Jordan is the next thing, of course, "that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil",
(@Hebrews 2:14). It seems as if the passing over now by the tidings through the secret service is the only way of safety, and they were all over "by the morning light". If it applies to us spiritually, deliverance can only be on those lines. "Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan; by the morning light there was not one of them missing that had not gone over the Jordan", chapter 17:22. That is the idea, they are on new ground; it would be like the resurrection, the power of God operative. David would not be behind in understanding this.
Rem. You are not looking on this historically but rather as soul experience in view of recovery.
J.T. Yes, and in view of escaping the influence of Absalom. It really is antichristian influence rather than the antichrist himself; I think we saw that before. It is rather like what is current today generally, and the secret service, which is a spiritual thought, enables us at meetings like these and other meetings of a spiritual character to get light from one and another. We would point out in using this expression 'secret service' that there is no question of disloyalty to the powers that be. A secret agent
{179}
of any given government might think in hearing such an expression that we are disloyal to it; but as we have been noticing in Zechariah, these powers are the four spirits of the heavens, they belong to the secret service themselves. The men in government may not themselves understand this, but God is working for us through them.
Rem. "We are not ignorant of his devices", @2 Corinthians 2:11. Saints are fully acquainted with the enemy.
J.T. Our relations with one another and the fellowship are a mystery really and enable us to understand what is operating against us and what is for us. Even the powers that be are for us.
Rem. The example of this maid is good; youth should not work for the antichristian system.
J.T. That is the effort of the devil today, to get the youth on the antichristian side by teaching and influence.
Ques. Does Colossians suggest "the morning light"?
J.T. The power of God in resurrection you mean; we are "risen with Christ". It was really the escape out of the antichristian world, there was not one left.
Ques. Is it a priestly matter to go over Jordan? I notice the priest gives the word of command to go over.
J.T. By the two messengers, yes.
Ques. Would you say more about Zadok? Does not his priesthood extend over a long period?
J.T. You mean we find it in Ezekiel. I think he represents the priesthood 'par excellence', you might say, because of his place in the future house. He comes before Abiathar here although it would seem that Abiathar was before him spiritually. We know that Abiathar failed later, so that Zadok must be the great thought of the priesthood here.
Rem. In Ezekiel we find: "of the sons of Zadok who kept my charge and went not astray when the
{180}
children, of Israel went astray", @Ezekiel 48:11. Thus it would appear as if the link was maintained by them on priestly lines while everything publicly seemed to be gone, and that fits in with this section too, and helps on the line of priestly service from the secret point of view.
J.T. There are these five men to begin with and then two women added later without their names being given, as if to augment the position by the subjective conditions. This idea enters into all our relations with one another now, brothers and sisters alike, as apprehending the ministry. The powers that be belong to the system, they keep the peace of the world so that the saints may move about. There is no disloyalty with us at all to any person in authority, mayor, governor, president, king; it is the moral thing that we are dealing with.
Ques. How do you reconcile the actual recognition of the powers that be with what develops at the end -- the man of sin who "exalts himself on high against all called God ... showing himself that he is God",
(@2 Thessalonians 2:4)?
J.T. That is antichrist. We have not come to antichrist yet but we have come to antichristian influence. Revelation has to do with antichrist personally, he comes out with his armies to combat the Lord. In the meantime the four spirits of the heavens stand, they are part of the system, they stand before the God of all the earth, whatever they may be personally and their influence is for our benefit.
Rem. So that we support the powers that be until they declare themselves against Christ.
J.T. They are God's ministers for good.
Rem. So that we should not view certain acts of certain officials as really representative of the abstract view. There may be an official guilty of unrighteous acts or a judge doing violence to the actual laws of
{181}
the country, but what we are speaking of is the abstract view, not isolated circumstances.
J.T. Yes, in the abstract these powers are viewed as horses guided by external pressure, so that in spite of themselves they do things which are in our favour.
Ques. What is the thought in David marshalling all his hosts?
J.T. We are coming to what is open now. But this is very practical, the little ones going over and then these young men and women working successfully; the thing goes through successfully, a most important matter. There are five men and two women, so far as I see here; the first women is called "the maid" . Why the article is before the word I do not know, it must point to some known person; she represents something.
Rem. The functioning of the whole system depends for the moment upon her; Hushai is in the king's house and the priests are in the city; the message is conveyed to the priests¬ sons by her.
J.T. And the fact that the article is there would seem to indicate that she is an important element, that she is part of the thing; without her it would not have worked. Everyone should take it home to himself, that without him there is a missing link.
Rem. The link was not missing in Acts when the forty banded themselves together to kill Paul. A lad was there who came into the breach, and the whole thing changed.
J.T. And then there was Rhoda, a young girl, whatever her capacity was; she may have been a maid in the house but she was ready.
Rem. Such a slender sort of link would warrant any one of us putting ourselves into this position. The marvel is that God allowed things to be so sustained; at times they were held only by the merest link. Even with the preservation of the Scriptures
{182}
there were times when it looked as if they could not be preserved.
J.T. The burial of the Lord seemed to be a precarious matter. There was a grave dug for him "with the wicked"; but a rich man was used at that point. He steps in there and is the necessary link from the divine point of view. The Lord was "with the rich in his death" (@Isaiah 53:9).
Rem. The woman's activities in Bahurim are more pronounced than the man's, more developed, and were intelligent.
J.T. Quite so. *The maid* is an official allusion. It says that of the young men "they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there. And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn on it; and the thing was not known", @2 Samuel 17:19. Without anything more being said the woman is ready. The feminine side is secretive and she responds here.
Rem. The man does nothing; it almost looks questionable as to whether he was at home. When the husband is away the wife has ability to act in emergency.
J.T. That fits in here; she knew what to do; she had orders from nobody. The well is an important provision or accessory to the house and it would be in her department.
Rem. It is something like Rahab in the beginning of Joshua, the top of her house is used. The more you look at it the more it seems to be the Colossian position.
J.T. I think it is, and the woman is secretive in principle as a figure in the Scriptures. The thing is well done both in Rahab's case and here.
Ques. Would not the fact that the well is there
{183}
and the woman in the good of it accentuate the subjective side?
J.T. It would all be in her department. The woman is to "guide the house", showing that she has an official place which the husband has to observe to be right. So the woman "took and spread the covering over the well's mouth"; she knew where it was kept. Then she "spread ground corn on it", and the thing was successful.
Rem. If the husband is away someone must be at home.
J.T. That the house may function. The household is part of the thing. With Ittai, they *all* went over. If the household is functioning there ought to be all these things there, a furnished house that can be used. The wife is over it, she guides it.
Ques. The men go down into the well; what does that signify?
J.T. The thing was there and they knew of it. It is what this house provides. It is a part of the system of the believer's house.
Rem. If the husband is away it seems to be an important thing that she is at home. What good is a house if there is nobody there? These men might have been slain if she had not been there to receive them.
J.T. The house is functioning even if the husband is not there.
Ques. Is there also the suggestion that any one of us may be called into an important issue at any moment without warning? This woman is presumably engaged in her daily tasks and does not know of the crisis. Suddenly she is brought face to face with it and has to make a decision. None of us can be neutral.
J.T. I never saw this so plainly before, the matter of the house functioning in the testimony. The well is there and the woman does the rest, having the
{184}
needed things. Ground corn -- what a fine thought! It was all there. How does this come into her mind? It would indicate food, but it is the wisdom in concealing that strikes me. How well it succeeded! She had all this, but the well was not known to be there, it was covered over.
Ques. In a general way does this decision correspond with what John writes of in his epistle, the last times and the many antichrists? "Ye have the unction from the holy one and ye know all things", @1 John 2:20. Would that suggest the ability to understand what to do?
J.T. I think that is very good because in the official ministry in Christendom certain university training is necessary, whereas in meeting antichrist in that passage you allude to, "ye have the unction from the holy one and ye know all things", @1 John 2:20. It is proceeding *from* the Holy One (not 'of' ). It comes out, and "ye know all things". I was noticing an account of the so-called "Bampton lecturers" in a university, men who give a public lecture for Lent or Easter. The occasion was well furnished with money, but one provision was that the man who gives this lecture must be at least an M. A. That is not necessary with an unction from the Holy One. I mention it to show you what professing Christendom is; it is ignoring the unction from the Holy One. This woman knew what to do and she did it. You do not get an M. A. from the Holy One, not that one would say anything against education, but the Holy Spirit is ignored, especially in regard to antichristian activities.
Rem. The official side having broken down, the secret operations of God come to light connected with His own work.
J.T. The public would call John the baptist anything: a prophet, the Messiah, etc.; and when the Lord Himself went to Jerusalem many believed
{185}
on Him because of the signs, but the Spirit of God says that Jesus did not trust them. That is where new birth comes in, just there; you cannot tell what it is, it is the wind blowing where it lists; that is the Spirit. The point I think that enters into all this is that you know what to do in a crisis.
Rem. "They ... came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there". Think of them trusting themselves to this house! They might have been putting themselves into the hands of a traitor, the same as Sisera.
Ques. Does letting them down into the well correspond at all with the disciples when they let Paul down in a basket?
J.T. It does not say they let these men down: "they came", and "they went down", and "they came up out of the well"; it is all their own action, and the woman's action is to complete the position. In the concealment of these two men the thing is working perfectly and the Spirit of God shows it is successful.
Rem. The enemy cannot discern the working of the Spirit.
Ques. Does this develop into the overthrow of the whole system? We spoke last week about the counsel of the princes of Zoan, whose wisdom is foolishness.
J.T. We were speaking of the hidden wisdom; the world does not know that, it is at a disadvantage.
Rem. What seems to be developing is the extraordinary co-operation of these links. The men went down and the woman does just the thing to confirm what they have done.
Ques. Is all this teaching to indicate to David that things had not been right in his kingdom?
J.T. That is the sorrowful side; it would all come home to him, where did all this sorrow begin? That is the other side. The king himself is the
{186}
occasion of it, staying at home when kings go forth to battle, and sinning; but whatever the cause, the testimony is in jeopardy and the thing now is to protect it.
Rem. None of us need aspire to do something that we are not intended to do. We might have in our minds that we would like to be some prominent person who would be known everywhere. But this whole secret service at this point is dependent upon an unknown person doing this one thing and perhaps only taking a very short time to do it.
J.T. It is the Colossian position right through; the message they carry is so urgent: "pass quickly over the water", (verse 21), that they did not even mention Jordan at first. But then, David understood that this was meant.
Ques. Would going down into the well and coming up again indicate their faith?
J.T. There is some idea in their going down, they knew what to do. David left the ark in the city but the link must be kept with the ark. He is not a party man, he is moving in the light of the whole position. He is crossing over and the position is changing now. You can see how the position is endangered by those who have led or are supposed to lead not being in their places and functioning. "Love never fails". It is a question of what our hands find to do, but we are often not up to the mark and the enemy gets the advantage.
Rem. We need to go through the process of disappearance; none of us can give proper counsel otherwise.
J.T. I have no doubt this woman of Bahurim would cover her head in praying; that is the lesson in Christianity as to the woman's place. If she had not been ready here there would have been no success. I am not speaking of the literal thing, but subjection
{187}
in the woman enables her to function when her husband is not there.
Ques. Would it fit in with what we are saying about household baptism, the idea of covering or protecting that which is of the secret service?
J.T. The whole position is covered by baptism publicly, showing that we are on the Lord's side.
Ques. Do you think weakness is seen in the woman's reply to Absalom's servants?
J.T. I do not think so. Of course, when it comes to truthfulness you have to make allowance for the day in which they lived. But the idea here is that the world will not pass that way; there is a barrier and they go over the brook of water.
Rem. The well has a covering, verse 19.
J.T. It must have been there all the time, the well would not have been kept open. I suppose it was for protection; the woman uses it now and covers it with the corn.
Rem. Whatever you do in this secret service it is all a case of taking your life in your hands; she was really speaking to Absalom's servants in defence of the whole position.
J.T. These untruths have to be left. The Holy Spirit mentions them, and they are not to be justified, of course, but the time had not come for a right understanding of truth. It is what is done and the success of it that is emphasised here. This idea of covering is very important, because it refers to the feminine side of the position; *she* uses the cover. And then there is the fact that the husband is not mentioned: it is *his* house but she has the food. If we can follow spiritually we shall see what everything means.
Ques. Do you think that the corn would refer to some feature of Christ?
J.T. Yes. There is something which is hidden in the Colossian sense, that the world knows not.
{188}
Rem. This line of action means the death of Ahithophel.
J.T. In verse 21 we read of the message being sent to David and he goes beyond the Jordan; then in verse 23: "And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose and went to his house, to his city, and gave charge to his household, and hanged himself, and he died; and he was buried in the sepulchre of his father". Why is that put in here? It is the wisdom of this world coming to nought. Everything is in order according to the man, his house is set in order, but he hangs himself, that is the end of him.
Ques. Is passing over Jordan by the *morning light* a suggestion of resurrection?
J.T. Yes, the new day begins. David over Jordan is really the beginning of the end for Absalom; he went over but that was for destruction.
Rem. Wisdom hidden in the assembly would bring to nought such wisdom as Ahithophel's.
J.T. David acting in the light of the secret service brings this out. He is not assuming to know better than the messengers, he is subject; so we do well to pay attention to all that is going on in our meetings. It is a question of the Comforter: "He shall guide", it says; @John 16:13. I take this to mean that any number of brothers may speak, but the Spirit fills the matter out and we reach the desired end under His direction. The message of Ahimaaz and Jonathan is very direct: "they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, Arise and pass quickly over the water", verse 21. They did not bow down to him as the king at all, it is the secret service in mind; it is a question of the Spirit of God and everyone has to be subject to Him.
Rem. The close of the chapter indicates that God has blessed the whole position in that there is
{189}
an abundance of everything for the weary people. Instead of defeat there is this evidence of plenty.
J.T. "And David came to Mahanaim", verse 24. This is where the angels met Jacob, David would not forget that, either; and it was where grace had been resisted in the children of Ammon, a very striking matter. We have Absalom as the first one mentioned after this: "And Absalom passed over the Jordan", verse 24. It is very remarkable how the matter goes forward. It is where grace had been resisted and despised, but now it is operative in these men, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir and Barzillai.
Rem. This is like the commissariat, a very important department of the army. There is the *secret service* and the *civil service* and this would be like the *commissariat*.
Rem. Grace is very important too, because it shows that what appears to be impossible is now effected, by the fact that there is a secret work of God in the soul of Shobi.
J.T. That is the thought. This man who had been a despiser is subject; that is what is taking place today.
CHAPTER 18
J.T. David is in his own place here. He is functioning as a king and is head of his army throughout this chapter. Verse 1 says, "David marshalled the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them".
Rem. He is like a field marshal, head of a large army.
J.T. They are not conscripts or mercenary soldiers. They are with David. The position is very good so far. It is necessary, as conflict is before us, to recognise military principles. In the great military book,
{190}
that is the book of Joshua, the captain of Jehovah's host appears and Joshua says: "Art thou for us, or for our enemies?" (@Joshua 5:13). This is a false attitude to take up. The question is, Are we with Him? "And he said, No; for as captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come", @Joshua 5:14. Jehovah's hosts are with Jehovah's captain. The people were *with* David here.
Rem. Perhaps that explains why they are called more than once, "servants". "And the people of Israel were routed before the *servants* of David".
J.T. That is a good suggestion. It is said later too, that "Absalom found himself in the presence of David's *servants*".
Ques. What would be the force of their caring for David's life in this way so that he is not in danger?
J.T. I think it is a rather weak position. The people are changing positions with him, they are taking control now whereas it was *his* business. The people said in verse 3: "Thou shall not go forth, for if we should in any case flee, they will not care or us ... for thou art worth ten thousand of us; and now it is better that thou succour us out of the city. And the king said to them, I will do what is good in your sight". That does not seem right.
Rem. There was never a definite age limit for the military men.
J.T. Certainly not for a commander-in-chief. In Numbers it is said they were taken "from twenty years old and upward", @Numbers 1:3, and we are on military ground now. It is a question of Jehovah's hosts.
Rem. "And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands". He reviews the troops.
J.T. He reviewed them at the gate but did not go with them; he had let the army go once before without him and had got into trouble. He is the
{191}
man to lead now. The whole history of this matter brings into evidence certain weak features.
Rem. Divine leadership is necessary in military matters. The leader should go before, not the people.
J.T. These are the things that the Spirit of God makes prominent. Elsewhere other things would be put forward and these would be kept in the background, but the Spirit of God is here calling attention to certain conditions for our learning.
Rem. The responsible element failed in not going to the front in the battle.
J.T. Yes; David's weakness is set forth here and in 1 Kings. Chronicles gives us the bright side. The Holy Spirit gives us both sides. This was not written for David, nor is it written to make little of him in our eyes; it is written for our learning.
Rem. A man says to Joab: "I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth", and Joab says, "Why didst thou not smite him?" Then the man reminds Joab that David had said, "Deal gently ... with the young man Absalom".
J.T. The chapter brings out a combination of weaknesses. We have David starting right in marshalling his forces, that was his function, but having done that he left the matter. He appointed leaders and sat at the gate, but that was all. It was not right that the people should determine his position. And then we get this incident of the man you spoke of. What is he to do? He has the king's command. If there is a kingdom at all, and a king, the king must be obeyed. This man is right and Joab is wrong at this point. It is a remarkable thing that the Spirit of God gives us this man's speech at such length. He brings out the position in its principle, that *the king is the king*. In effect, he says, I am his servant -- why should I kill his son when he told me not to? That is quite obvious. Whereas Joab cares for neither the king nor anybody else, only for himself. In a
{192}
weak state of things let us keep by the divine principle. If we are dealing with a matter, an issue, under God, let us deal with that. You may say the king is wrong, but that is not the point. When a matter comes up people say, Look at this! and, Look at that! But that is not the point for the moment. Let us deal with the thing on hand. This man who makes a speech to Joab is saving the position from that point of view. He has done what is right. Paul said to the Corinthians, Even though you call us reprobates *you do what is right*. The enemy will stir up questions about this and that, but this is the point for the moment. He says, "In our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care, whoever it be of you, of the young man Absalom", verse 12. I am a witness to it, he says in effect, it is not hearsay, and I am going to abide by it. He obeyed the king. What right had Joab to say, "I would have given thee ten silver pieces and a girdle"? Was he the king? He is interfering with the king's rights. The one who brings the report is called a man: "A man saw it and told Joab". I think he *is* a man too; that is, in the principle of the thing; the king is the king whatever the side-issues may be. Pay attention to the king! He is dealing with a certain thing, and this man says, "Though I should receive a thousand silver pieces in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son; for *in our hearing* the king charged thee ... . Take care, whoever it be of you, of the young man Absalom".
Rem. This is helpful in dealing with a specific thing at a specific time, because after all, while Absalom deserved to die, Joab deserves to die too; but God is not dealing with everything at once.
J.T. If you had to deal with all these men at once the battle would go awry. The king is in command and this man is observing that fact. This is the lesson for us, otherwise the enemy gets the
{193}
advantage and we get nowhere. That David was not fulfilling his responsibility is no warrant for disobedience to his orders by one of his men. Paul says, Whatever we be, *you do what is right*.
Rem. Joab brought back Absalom because of the king's wish and then he is ready to kill him *against* the king's orders.
J.T. He is a lawless, murderous man; he is thinking of himself. He knew Absalom was disturbing the whole position; but what he did was not right. Many would say that he did what was right. This man was doing what was right, obeying the commandment of the king.
Rem. Hushai's counsel was really to bring about the death of Absalom.
J.T. But not by this man, nor by Joab either. The king is the king and we must follow his command or we shall all get astray in the forest of Ephraim.
Rem. This man would fit in in 1 Corinthians, not exactly as a leader but just as one of the persons who is able to judge rightly according to chapter 6.
J.T. Everyone in Corinth ought to have been able to judge aright: "Set those to judge who are little esteemed in the assembly". (@1 Corinthians 6:4) This man is one such, and in what he says he morally overcame Joab. Joab says, I will not stop to listen; but Joab was wrong, and I am sure he knew it, too.
Rem. The fact that Absalom was taken up in the terebinth shows that God had the matter in hand, and any interference was against the king's command.
J.T. No doubt Absalom would have died shortly. Even the mule did not help him, he was between heaven and earth. He is caught by his head and the mule went away. Really God had the matter in hand. Undoubtedly he would have died in the tree, but Joab must come with three spears and ten men; that is the kind of man he was.
Rem. The ass was really a help to Balaam. Is
{194}
there any suggestion, in the mule? In Balaam's case God used the ass to speak.
J.T. "And Absalom was riding upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of the great terebinth, and his head caught in the terebinth, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away", verse 9. Well, who is doing all this? As has been remarked, it was God taking him in his own craftiness. "He taketh the wise in their own craftiness", @Job 5:13.
Rem. It appears that Absalom did nothing.
J.T. Quite so. He found himself amongst David's servants, as if he was out of control. The whole position was out of control. Where is David's generalship and leadership? The marshalling was good, but the people's advice, it seems to me, was a mistake. He should not have taken the people's advice to stay behind.
Rem. There is no evidence of prayer entering into this position.
Rem. It is really a democratic thought.
J.T. The spirit of democracy runs through the chapter. This man that brought word to Joab is really saying what is right, observing the king's command. This is the means of preservation from democracy and radicalism, elements which you see as you run down the chapter. Joab slays Absalom in defiance of the king's orders, though as God was doing it he could not have survived in the position he was in. Then you see another man acting of himself; Ahimaaz wants to run. That is another democratic idea. He wants to do something and Joab says, No, but gives way. Again want of leadership! The Cushite had the command to go but Ahimaaz still says: "Let me, I pray thee, also run".
That is the idea, people doing what they *want* to do and there is confusion. And then at the end of the
{195}
chapter where is David? Crying about his son! Forgetting about the rights of God in this matter.
Ques. Absalom had to be buried. What is the thought in the heap of stones?
J.T. The allusion would be as in Achan's case. The stones would mean that he would never be allowed to rise up again.
Ques. How do you apply this scripture in regard to the recovery of the truth?
J.T. At the end of chapter 17 David and the people have passed over and have come to Mahanaim, and we see the principle of grace working in that different ones brought what he needed. David is right so far in his first efforts, but he is tested, I think, in allowing the people to govern him. If you apply it to the church historically it is in someone being put right and set up in his own place. We read of Josiah that "the king *stood*" in his place. He puts everybody where he should be. In that case everything goes well. But here David is not in his place; he misses it in taking the people's word. They said: "thou art worth ten thousand of us" (verse 3), but that is not the point, the function was the king's. Leadership fails in the history of the assembly.
Rem. It corresponds with the so-called princes in the ecclesiastical system.
J.T. "Like people, like priest"; in the long run the people have their way, especially in non-conformist bodies.
Rem. So that in not assuming proper leadership David really makes room for wrong leadership on the part of Joab.
J.T. The chapter brings out confusion although there is victory. The sequence shows that David was king. In truth what Joab said was substantially right, but he was wrong in disregarding the king. You cannot cover a wrong by a right. You must deal with each thing by itself.
{196}
Ques. What does the forest refer to here?
J.T. It is the forest of Ephraim. It alludes in some way perhaps to natural feelings, the right of the firstborn. It may be that sort of thing ruled the day. Ephraim had the first place earlier, but Judah had it by divine counsel, and David was not now moving on that line. It says of Judah, "Thy father's children will bow down to thee ... . The sceptre will not depart from Judah ... until Shiloh come, and to him will be the obedience of peoples", @Genesis 49:8,10. All that entered into this position. David represented it, but he is not acting in it. He is not up to the mark.
Ques. Has lack of leadership since the days of the recovery meant an unwieldy battlefront and possibly some loss in the wood which need not have been?
J.T. That is the lesson to be learned. Things are allowed to go to the ground. Things come up and we have more or less right thoughts, but then to carry them through requires right leadership. That is where the weakness was. David marshalled his forces, reviewed them and appointed captains, but *he* was not there, and consideration for Absalom may have entered into this.
Rem. David should have known that God worked through Hushai's counsel so that David had time to marshal his forces, showing how God was behind the scenes in his favour.
J.T. And if he had been in the spirit of Hushai's counsel he would have seen that time was graciously given to him of God to have an army. But an army needs a captain, a leader, and he should have been that leader. That is where the miss was, I think. He is allowing Joab to get in, a man who is disputing his rights. We are on military lines now; Hushai had done his part and saved time for David, and now the army is here and David leaves it to be led by
{197}
others. Then Joab comes in to challenge his rights.
Ques. Do you think David's sympathy for Absalom warped his mind?
J.T. I suppose he really did not want to go. The test was whether he would really go the whole length against Absalom. It is said in the world that, 'The voice of the people is the voice of God'. That is a lie. The people tell him, "thou art worth ten thousand of us"; that, although showing respectful appreciation of their king, tended to weaken the position.
Rem. Generally speaking, poor leadership is occasioned by disregarding the rights of God.
J.T. This man in verse 10 is dealing with *one thing*, the king's command. That is all that is in his mind. We should be saved from uncertainty and confusion if we kept on this line.
Ques. How do you apply the king's command in our local assembly matters?
J.T. In whatever is to be done that is according to God you take counsel together and decide that something should be done in the name of the Lord for the good of the saints and the honour of God.
The next thing is that leadership has its place in what is done.
Rem. And when the local assembly has acted we should adhere to whatever is done.
J.T. The trouble often is persons seen out of proportion. The man at Bethsaida saw men as trees walking. We have here one of these trees. It is an important tree. "And Absalom was riding upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of the great terebinth and ... he was taken up between the heaven and the earth". It is a remarkable thing, "*the* great terebinth". It must have had distinction; God put it there. The mule too was used in dealing with Absalom. Absalom was overthrown and the rebellion put down but the great
{198}
principles of God suffered. Also there was such unnecessary loss of life. We cannot but grieve over the loss of saints.
Rem. And now the people are all ready to run off, but Joab seems to detect all that.
J.T. No part of Scripture gives a better outline of Joab than this. Why had he brought Absalom back earlier in the history? Was it because he liked Absalom? No, but to ingratiate himself with the king. It was he that had put the words in the wise woman's mouth. Here again you can see that he is thinking of himself and disregarding the king. When he comes back and victory is complete he says: "Thou hast put to shame this day the faces of all thy servants who have this day saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines; in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest those that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that neither princes nor servants are anything to thee; for today I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died today, then it would have been right in thine eyes. But now arise, go forth, and speak consolingly to thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night", @2 Samuel 19:5 - 7. Now there is a rebellious man. That man is wrong at heart in spite of the fact that what he was saying is in a sense right. He is wrong at the very core; he is disregarding the king, the anointed of God!
Rem. Yet he was on the right side, but one would not like to be on the right side in the way Joab was on it.
J.T. Joab is a clever man, but cleverness relied on by itself aids the enemy; he sees in a way things that are to be seen, but here is a position that is testing him. He is already a murderer and there are other things against him, and now he is disregarding
{199}
David. What follows explains the force of all this. He is disregarding the man that *God has anointed* although that man is *now* marked by weakness. Joab knows he rebelled against the king in slaying Absalom; in spite of his cleverness he is really exposed. The man that stood up and spoke firmly to him is the man who is guarding the position, because rights entered into David's position; he is the king. Most people would say Joab was right, but David was God's man; you cannot be right by overthrowing God's man. Things may seem to go against one whom God puts forward in His service, but He will not allow anyone to displace him.
Ques. What is the meaning of David's position "between the two gates", verse 24?
J.T. I think we must keep before us that these chapters are dealing not so much with David as a type of Christ but rather as a type of His representatives in the church's history and their weaknesses. The Lord has put them there. There were those whom the Lord especially used, like Samuel and Joseph, who failed in detail, but God will never give up those whom He has anointed and who in the main are faithful to Him. He will stand by them. Joab is a clever, crafty man and he is using a position of weakness for his own aggrandisement. Joab is not fit to lead the people of God, clever as he is. He becomes a murderer again, according to the next chapter.
Ques. Would you say that Joab was acting in the light of the last chapters of Judges, when there was no king?
J.T. Yes, doing what was right in his own eyes. The Lord will not allow the king to be ignored even though his commandment may not be according to the truth. He must be maintained.
Rem. It would be a lesson to us as to this matter of rule. We must admit that there are times when
{200}
collectively we show a measure of weakness in doing something, but still, let no one take advantage of that as Joab would.
J.T. God sometimes allows a crisis on account of the truth amid great weakness; He is moving in His own way. If those whom He has fitted to serve are unfairly treated He is concerned about it. He will stop the whole proceedings to assert His rights in the matter. That is the point here. David is king, and if I am to do what is right I shall observe that.
Joab thinks that David is a weak old man who is thinking only of his son. But Joab is sinning. He goes off himself and ten of his men. He is a party leader who is taking advantage of his position.
Rem. And perhaps is a coward underneath.
J.T. Attention has been called to the fact that God is acting, because this "great terebinth" must mean something, the mule going away must mean something, and the fact that Absalom is caught by his head must mean something.
Rem. The man who brought the message to Joab did what was right. *He* would not take advantage of the position for his own ends.
J.T. I think this man has a place in the book of Jasher. He does what is right even though against natural wisdom. He is very like Urijah.
Ques. You mean that David suggested that Urijah could go to his house but he would not?
J.T. He had one *thing* before him. He said: "The ark, and Israel, and Judah abide in booths; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields", @2 Samuel 11:11. I am not going to be otherwise, that is what he says in effect. What we need is *men*.
Rem. In a crisis it might be easy to detect Absalom the usurper, but it may be hard to detect Joab, who is *apparently* faithful to the Lord and His interests, but has himself in mind.
{201}
Rem. We can read this chapter and get the lesson objectively before us and yet to-morrow fail in the practical thing.
J.T. It is something to be taken to heart by us all. Later on Joab slays Amasa, and we saw from chapter 20 that Joab is *before* David in the mind of Joab's young man, thus showing what is underneath. Later Joab takes sides against Solomon, showing that he is utterly exposed.
Ques. I suppose there are times when the saints are marshalled?
J.T. You will always see it as a conflict arises. You will see the host being marshalled if you are spiritual.
Rem. Ahimaaz served well in the secret service but in public service he failed.
J.T. Running was not his work. He belonged to the secret service but now he wants to do something else on his own account. Joab tells him, "there is no news suited to thee". He had no message.
Rem. He was thinking of David's feelings for he knew Absalom was dead.
J.T. The Cushite had no regard for that. He is another man to keep your eye on, his race is in mind. He has no great distinction at all; he is not concerned about David's feelings, he tells him the truth.
Ques. How would you help a brother who wants to preach and cannot preach?
J.T. Well, Ahimaaz is in measure adjusted here; the king says, "Turn aside". He is for the moment discarded, for the king has put him there and he has to wait until the other man comes. He was of another race, so that he would not have the same distinction in the minds of David and Joab. Joab says "my son" to Ahimaaz, but not to the Cushite.
But *he is the messenger* ; Ahimaaz is disgraced.
Ques. Do you think we ought to be able to say
{202}
this to a brother before he runs? Sometimes a brother wants to speak and he is not qualified.
J.T. Joab in this incident suggests one who is responsible in certain features of the service of God -- as Paul selected Silas instead of Mark (@Acts 15:40). One who has responsibility in asking brothers to preach somewhat corresponds. All such should be most careful against personal motives. The very important lessons here, I believe, are in the man who spoke to Joab about Absalom, and in this Cushite; these are the men to have your eye on in this chapter. Each in his service is a model.
Ques. Would Paul be an example of this?
J.T. The Lord told him to go to the city. At times the brethren must regulate you, which is a very important word for the young brothers. We must pay attention to the brethren! Do not be always saying, 'I have got something from the Lord'. The chapter is not to bring out the glories of David. It is to bring out what God does in spite of weakness in the leading man or men and how right principles are asserted in two *obscure persons*. One is called "a man" and the other "the Cushite". They have right thoughts. The book goes right through to bring out what a king ought to be and it finishes with that in chapter 23. David himself by the Spirit of God tells what a king should be, and that is very refreshing looking backward into the book here.
Rem. These inconspicuous men are in contrast to the monument Absalom had built for himself. Instead of having our eye on church buildings we want to have our eye on these men.
J.T. It is better to have sons as a memorial.
"I have no son", Absalom says. Paul had sons! Absalom had had sons but they must have died, that is, they did not come to anything.
Ques. Would Joab obscure the judgment of God on Absalom?
{203}
J.T. He interfered with what God was doing. Some glory would have come out of the battle if it had become manifest that God Himself slew Absalom. Absalom said he had no son, although we are told earlier that he had sons. Nothing for God came out of this man. This monument reared up by himself in the king's dale is but a testimony to his vanity.
Rem. Satan sought to have David slay Saul.
J.T. He was ignominiously slain by the Philistines. Antichrist will not be slain by man, God will destroy him. Absalom is a type of antichrist as he is known in Christendom now. He is a son of perdition. True Christians have Jerusalem *above* as their mother, that is, a *heavenly* system, not a mere human religious organisation, of which there are many in Christendom. Jezebel's children are killed *with death*. Morally she is left childless. The "male son", of @Revelation 12 is over against Jezebel and her children.
CHAPTER 19
J.T. The crisis is over now. It is an instructive period, and it challenges our hearts as to how we stand in a crisis; whether we prove loyal to Christ, or otherwise. We have Shimei coming in to make much of David now; but from the sequel he never really judged his disloyalty at the outset. Then we have Mephibosheth and Barzillai. Mephibosheth had been slandered. It is for us to see whether there is the evidence of his genuine loyalty in the facts given here. That is what we have to consider first of all, also whether his report of the matter bears the stamp of righteousness and truth, and whether there is the evidence of truth in the inward parts. There was not that with Shimei.
Ques. Does he represent the remnant that goes through? He is one of the household of Saul, a
{204}
Benjaminite; over against Shimei who was also a Benjaminite.
J.T. Quite so. It is a question of whether Mephibosheth bears the character of a subject of mercy. There is a definite suggestion of mercy; now it is a question of whether he bears that out. The Spirit of God gives us the thing just as it is. What can we see in it? I think we saw clearly enough what was in Shimei.
C.A.M. I suppose we can test our own ability to judge persons by the judgment we have of these cases. Do you not think after a conflict there is often lack of intelligent judgment of one another?
J.T. Quite so. One often says that one has a judgment about everybody he is acquainted with. I suppose everybody that knows me has a judgment about me. It is right we should have a judgment of one another; not in a jealous or critical way, but based on love as linked together and as obligated to serve each other.
A.F.M. Mephibosheth says Ziba deceived him.
J.T. The most spiritual man among us is liable to be deceived. I think Mephibosheth's personal appearance must have struck David. This man would not give the impression that he was attempting to steal the kingdom. David would say inwardly, I have been deceived about this man. That is one thing that stands out here. He does not go the whole way in his mind to justify Mephibosheth but his mind is changed?
Ques. Would his appearance be in his favour?
J.T. It was in his favour. It would help David in his judgment of him in this crisis. There is no evidence here that he is rivalling the king; nor does it look as if his appearance were gotten up for a purpose. It really reflects the state of his soul.
Rem. There was the evidence of fasting in his appearance.
{205}
J.T. He does not make any show while the king is rejected. Everything for him hinges on David. It applies to ourselves now while Christ is absent; we are not to make a show in this world. I think David must have been somewhat staggered when he saw Mephibosheth. When you get face to face with a true brother whom you have judged unfairly your mind changes instinctively. The impression produced is different from what you have heard.
Ques. Why does he still appear to be uncertain?
J.T. It does not seem as if he was really satisfied inwardly. I have always thought that. "Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?" verse 29. That is a poor thing to say. Was Ziba's story right or wrong? That should be the first thing for David to decide. David here represents any of us -- uncertain when we should be certain. David's weakness lay in listening to the story without another witness. He took one man's testimony against a man that deserved every consideration.
Rem. Mephibosheth raised an issue here.
J.T. He plainly states he was slandered. It is really David's matter now.
R.W.S. Mephibosheth apparently lives a day at a time. David is in rejection, and it says, "Now he had neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace", verse 24.
J.T. It is David's matter now. He had heard things about this man that were evidently untrue. Was he defective? He listened to a story and accepted it without adequate testimony, and now he is in a dilemma. But he is making the most of it; he is making a *compromise*. He says, "Thou and Ziba divide the land", verse 29. That is not a satisfactory state of things. Ziba is not fit for fellowship; he is a slanderer for personal gain. The injured man is typically a Christian, a believer, a spiritual man.
{206}
It is a serious thing to put those two on the same footing. The fault is with David. We have to go back to that to get the true position. He is the responsible man. He has misjudged Mephibosheth, who is now before him, and David is implying that he has made a mistake as to him. The Spirit of God leaves the facts before us for us to decide as to them.
Ques. Is objective knowledge intended to give us conscious knowledge?
J.T. It works that way. The Spirit works in us according to what is presented to us. As soon as I come in contact with a man who is right, he is sure to affect me if I am spiritual.
Ques. Do you think Mephibosheth caused David to feel somewhat reproachful of himself? He was not now acting in the beneficent way in which he had earlier dealt with him.
J.T. Mephibosheth throws him back on the mercy he had shown him in the past. He says in verse 28: "For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; and thou didst set thy servant among them that eat at thine own table. What further right therefore have I? and for what should I cry any more to the king?" He is throwing David back on that. It is manifest that Mephibosheth is in the full meaning of it. David is the one that had exercised the grace toward him; and now the king's mind is changed -- clearly through no proved good cause.
Rem. In verse 25 it says, "And as soon as Jerusalem came to meet the king, the king said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?"
J.T. His mind is evidently never clear as to this matter. In these cases of judgment, if I begin with a wrong principle and accept a charge without testimony, I may be damaged personally.
A.R. Suppose there are no witnesses?
J.T. It is a question of discernment as to the
{207}
person; but no charge should be received without full testimony.
A.R. The lack of witnesses would require more spirituality.
J.T. That is the case here. It is now for David to judge. He received a damaging report against this brother without adequate testimony. Did he ever recover from it?
Rem. Mephibosheth was not a party to it.
J.T. The onus was on Ziba; but it was on David, too. He has to face this matter.
A.N.W. Would it not appear that there is good material in Mephibosheth?
J.T. He is not affected by the remissness of David; but the whole position is beclouded. If I were there I might listen to the king; it looks as if the king did not become clear. Thus a brother is damaged, but not before God. David is damaged more than he.
A.B.P. Are there two features developed here, or indicated as being of vital value in the testimony: on the one hand, a consciousness of being shown mercy, and on the other hand, a readiness to be misunderstood and not to make personal matters an issue? Are those two features seen in Mephibosheth?
J.T. Quite so. It is not the time for him to take the matter up with Ziba. The point here is David coming up to his capital. It is a question of whether the fellowship is going to be affected permanently by what has happened. David is representative of the responsible element. He has made a mistake, as to this point he has started wrongly, and now he is suffering.
F.S.C. Does not David lack care in what he says? He says to Ziba, "Behold, thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth", @2 Samuel 16:4. Here he makes a compromise without investigation.
J.T. He is in the presence of a spiritual man. You can see Mephibosheth has not changed his mind
{208}
at all. He mentions the grace David had shown him; he has not changed his mind about David at all. "Let him even take all, since my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house", verse 30. There is morally a greater man before David than he is himself at the moment. It is the same man we get in chapter 9; he is affected by grace, and by David personally.
A.B.P. Does not the great end in view regulate everything? It is the day that David is brought back to his capital. And so today, if we have in mind what God is bringing in in view of the rapture, everything is regulated by that.
J.T. David is everything here; but morally Mephibosheth is greater. Mephibosheth has retained his primary impressions. He holds to them. You hold to your primary impressions; they give character to you. You never lose sight of them. He never lost sight of that, nor of David's grace to him and his greatness personally and officially.
A.R. If a matter comes up where there are no witnesses, would @Deuteronomy 19:17 help us, standing before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges? David is lacking in judgment.
J.T. Quite so. We must be very careful about making accusations without two or three witnesses. But then the priests and judges decide. No one should make an incriminating accusation without witnesses. You might make an accusation individually which is fully corroborated by something else; that would be valid, but no single accusation by one witness should be accepted. Mephibosheth comes down alone; he is not looking for any support from anybody.
F.S.C. Do you think David could have found witnesses had he wanted to?
J.T. Well, he raised the question "as soon as Jerusalem came to meet the king". Did he assume
{209}
that Ziba's charge was known to be true? There is no evidence that he made enquiry or that any information was furnished.
A.N.W. Say another word about individual evidence.
J.T. If you are a witness to a thing at a given time and I am a witness to it at another time, there are two witnesses.
C.A.M. Would not the fact that Mephibosheth takes his very lowly place serve to show us that in taking a low place in such circumstances we can leave the results in the Lord's hands?
J.T. The king could easily have said, Mephibosheth is right, but he did not say that. David began wrongly. The word 'down' is to be noted in this chapter.
J.T.Jr. "Down" is in verse 16, too. I suppose we might have the *appearance*, of going down to Gilgal, but with no inward contrition of heart.
T.N.W. Should not Mephibosheth have washed in view of the great occasion of presenting himself to the king?
J.T. I should not think so. I think the point is that up to this moment he had maintained this attitude.
A.P.T. Mephibosheth really intended to go with David. He says, "My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said, I will saddle me the ass, and ride thereon, and go with the king; for thy servant is lame. And he has slandered thy servant to my lord the king", verse 26.
J.T. He does not insist on anything. He just states the bare facts. You are struck with the simple way he states everything. He says, Ziba slandered me; and it was true.
A.B.P. David, because of his position, settles the thing one-sidedly; Mephibosheth being spiritual does not settle it.
{210}
J.T. It is settled in Scripture for the spiritual mind. The unspiritual might say, Well, maybe there is some good cause for what David did, he must have had a reason. But the Spirit puts the facts down that we might see that this is a real man. I believe David was checked when he saw him; he would think. This is not the man I was led to believe he was.
J.H. You mentioned the thought of wavering; it is distressing to see a man wavering in a crisis.
J.T. It is. Mephibosheth briefly lays the whole matter before David; there is nothing hidden in what he says. He is presented to us in chapter 4 and in chapter 9. He has a special place in this book. He is presented as a subject of grace -- one who valued it and who expressed it. The enemy would becloud him. He is now under a cloud in David's mind, but throughout the history of the testimony the spiritual, I believe, have regarded him as a true man. The man is not changed; had the spirit of ingratitude and rebellion been in Mephibosheth he would have possessed some marks of it, but the record indicates none.
J.T.Jr. He does not assert his own rights. "What further right therefore have I?" verse 28. When you see the assertion of one's rights you may be sure there is not self-judgment.
J.T. His answers to the king and his attitude generally betoken uprightness and fidelity to the king. Indeed the statement by the Spirit in verse 24 and his own statement in verse 30 plainly show his loyalty to David. The whole matter is false; that is the point. None of us ought to be affected by such testimony as that of Ziba against Mephibosheth.
The most spiritual are the ones the devil is particularly aiming at.
Rem. Mephibosheth would probably suffer for some time in his spirit on account of David's slight.
J.T. I think that whilst the person who is persecuted
{211}
suffers, the persecutor suffers more. It is a question, whether David really ever overcame the effect of this effort of Satan. He saves Mephibosheth later, but now he puts him on the same level as Ziba.
Ques. Mephibosheth says, "Let him even take all, since my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house". I was wondering if Mephibosheth was considering for God and was taking His anointing of David into account.
J.T. He was. How do you regard Christ? Christ was rejected, and He is coming back. We are on the eve of it now. What a great thing it will be when He comes back! Mephibosheth had been as a son at the king's table; he lived, in type, as we ought to live, that is in the assembly, not in mere external things.
R.W.S. Praying for the "secret service" to be successful!
A.B.P. Is not the truth of sonship really designed to liberate us from mere public positions? You were saying that the recent depression, under the hand of God, really served that purpose; but is not the truth of sonship also doing it?
J.T. Quite so. Everything for us now centres in the coming of the Lord. What does it matter about the public position, in that sense? Another feature is the inwardness of the position; he is a son at the king's table. He never loses sight of grace. Family relationship is coupled with grace in Ephesians.
A.M. Evidently Ziba never looked for David's return.
J.T. He did not wish it. He was a man like Joab; thinking of himself. Selfishness is often exposed by these crises.
Now we must look at verse 35. Here is another picture for us. I am afraid a great many of us would say that that was a fine speech that Barzillai made.
{212}
But there is the want of real spiritual inwardness in his speech.
Rem. He is governed by tradition. He wanted to be buried with his father and mother.
J.T. It is the constitution of the man, how he had been brought up. He will treat you well; but he is not concerned about the heavenly side of the truth. He will receive you and entertain you, but he will not go to Jerusalem to *be with the king there* -- and be maintained by the king.
C.A.M. He wears out. He confessed that he was worn out.
J.T. It is a testing period after a crisis. Can I see the thing just as it is now?
A.Pf. Would he be like Jonathan? Jonathan went back to the city.
J.T. Very much like him; he never left his father's house.
R.W.S. Can a constitutional defect be remedied?
J.T. I think so, but it is rare, especially in old age. God is seeking to set us all up for heaven. This is not an Ephesian saint. I think Mephibosheth is, he gets the sense of grace and sonship. Barzillai knows nothing about that; typically he does not go on to Colossians and Ephesians.
Rem. In verse 31 he seems to be moving in the right direction. But the king's words are too testing, "Pass thou over with me".
J.T. He makes what would be to many a reasonable excuse. But the desire of a spiritual man is to be with Christ where He is.
CHAPTER 20
J.T. The last paragraph of chapter 19 links on with our present chapter, because it calls attention to the friction that arose between Judah and the ten tribes. The man of Israel said, "Why have our
{213}
brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away? ... And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to me; and why then are ye angry for this matter? ... And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, I have ten parts in the king and I have also more right in David than thou; and why didst thou slight me? and was not my advice the first, to bring back my king? And the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel", @2 Samuel 19:41 - 43. The separation of the kingdom is strikingly asserted: first, Judah says, "the king is near of kin to me". They spoke in the *singular* ; and then the men of Israel said, "I have ten parts in the king". The division is strikingly marked off; they are both saying "I" or "me".
A.R. Do you mean they are partisan?
J.T. Clearly so. I think that is what underlies this chapter. It was very pronounced.
Rem. It is remarkable that in the outcome of the history of the tribes, these ten were first in the division against the house of David. Although they went through the reign of Solomon, the seed of discord was evidently already in their hearts.
J.T. Yes. It lay in the sovereign selection of God centering on Judah. Divine selection is sure to create rivalry unless we are subject and recognise God's rights in it.
Rem. Love should be in operation to meet it.
J.T. That should be the concern of all of us. We get in @Ezekiel 37, "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it. For Judah, and for the children of Israel, his companions. And take another stick, and write upon it. For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel, his companions. And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thy hand. And when the
{214}
children of my people speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not declare unto us what thou meanest by these? say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hands of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions, and will put them with this, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand. And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes. And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them from every side, and bring them into their own land; and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all", @Ezekiel 37:15 - 22. That is unity -- a fine result of the work of God.
C.A.M. There seems to be a very different principle working here.
J.T. Very lamentable conditions. I mean the result of David's weakness affording Joab a free hand is very sorrowful. It is not like what was read in Ezekiel; here it is a politician and murderer gaining the upper hand. There is not much hope. He represents the tribe of Judah, too. Judah had allied itself with Absalom in the rebellion and were slow in bringing the king back, and now they are making much of the fact that David is near of kin.
T.A. I suppose those in Corinth who said, "We are of Christ", would be the worst of the parties there.
J.T. They must have thought carefully in taking on the name of Christ for their party. It did not make them cease to be a party, but gave them more prestige.
A.B.P. Is the step from Romans to Colossians one which is definitely attacked by the enemy?
{215}
I had in mind that the epistle to the Corinthians seems to come in there. There may be the individual work pursued to a great extent in the saints, but the setting of that work together should function assembly-wise. It seems to be the crucial point here that the enemy attacks. This is the Jordan area.
J.T. Yes. It is a crucial position. It is to the credit of Judah that they clave to their king from the Jordan to Jerusalem. The test seems to come in just there.
Ques. Does chapter 19 expose a weak underlying state in the men of Israel?
J.T. Quite so. They had not behaved any worse than the tribes of Judah in the rebellion, with the exception of Shimei, perhaps. I think their state is shallow. I think the ten tribes represent a shallow position among the people as over against those who are the subjects of and recognise sovereignty.
Rem. They go after Sheba; chapter 20:2.
J.T. The last paragraph in chapter 19 lays the basis for this. The enemy had this man ready; it says he was there. "And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite"; he was there. It does not seem a premeditated thing, as was Absalom's revolt, but a sudden attempt of the devil through one man -- evidently a man that knew the shallowness of the ten tribes. He appeals to them. "He blew a trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to his tents, Israel", verse 1. He must have been a suitable agent of the devil at this juncture. He *happened* to be there. It does not seem to be premeditated, but as if Satan had his agent to make a sudden thrust against the position.
A.F.M. What would be the significance of his trumpet? He blew a trumpet. At the end of the
{216}
chapter *Joab* blew a trumpet. Is there any significance in that?
J.T. It somewhat characterised Joab to blow a trumpet. David had the trumpet blown in relation to the ark -- in relation to the service of God.
A.F.M. Was there supposed authority at the back of this?
J.T. That would be the aim of it. It would have influence where there was no moral influence. He could not have had any moral influence; the sequel shows he had not.
A.R. The enemy takes advantage of a state. A low state is existent in the people, so that they immediately follow a wrong lead. "Then all the men of Israel went up from after David, following Sheba the son of Bichri". They are prepared to give up David and follow a wrong lead.
J.T. Partisan conditions can always be affected in this way. Paul knew what to say to affect the Pharisees in the council. "I am a Pharisee, son of Pharisees", he says; (@Acts 23:6). They say, There is nothing wrong in that man. He appealed to their partisan sentiments.
Ques. Do you regard Sheba as a product of the state of the people?
J.T. He is an agent of the devil. He is said to be a man of Belial. He *happens* to be there, but from the devil's viewpoint, it was arranged. But he understands, evidently, the shallowness of the affection in the ten tribes for David. "I have ten parts in the king", @2 Samuel 19:43. You do not love a man in parts; you love the man himself. Paul says, "Is the Christ divided?" @1 Corinthians 1:13. They said they had ten parts in David. Could anyone love ten parts of David?
Rem. Of Judah it is said that David was their king.
J.T. Yes; and they clave to him. "But the
{217}
men of Judah clave to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem". It was a steady pace; no wavering. That was to their credit as over against the shallowness of the others.
J.T.Jr. Does that represent the element that would cleave to the authority of Christ -- the sceptre and law-giver in connection with Judah?
J.T. Yes. In this chapter one person after another comes before the mind; and now these harsh words. This is a serious situation. Not all the men of Judah were harsh; there were some godly men there, undoubtedly. One can understand some saying, This is a serious matter. We must cleave to the king at all cost, whatever our feelings are. I think the harsh words provoked this condition. Undoubtedly the condition was there; and this man happened to be there, and Satan is using him.
Rem. So that we should be balanced in relation to assembly investigation, the care meeting coming into the matter, a brother may not be himself; he may get angry, and we may misjudge the whole position by that act of harshness; whereas in this respect it is a question of what the brother is characteristically.
J.T. Yes. And if a brother is right generally but fails in some detail he would himself detect it at once. Some of us were speaking of the different sinners contemplated in @Leviticus 4. There is a list, inclusive of the high priest, the whole assembly, the princes and the common people. If the high priest sinned there is nothing said of the sin coming to his knowledge. Typically, he would be spiritual, and thus he would be sensitive and judge his sin at once. If a spiritual man makes an error, normally he corrects himself at once. Like Samuel: he erred in regard to Jesse's sons in the selection of a king; but he quickly recovered himself. The suggestion here is that Judah had more spiritual wealth than the ten tribes; and
{218}
the more we have in these circumstances, the more quickly we shall right ourselves. If something happens that is unexpected and might cause a cleavage amongst us, the man of spiritual wealth is likely to right himself more quickly than others. Although the men of Judah spoke harshly, they would say to themselves, The king is now the issue; we must not let side-issues come up. It is said, "the men of Judah clave to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem". That was the salvation of the position.
A.R. Chapter 19 might suggest following with the ten tribes, but chapter 20 indicates that those of Judah were adjusted quickly in regard to what was partisan.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. The king was the issue, not what they had said or done.
A.P.T. Is Paul an instance of that in @Acts 23? He says, "God will smite thee, whited wall", @Acts 23:3. But he quickly recovers himself.
J.T. Quite so. "I was not conscious, brethren, that he was high priest", (@Acts 23:5) was Paul's answer.
A.B.P. Are there two elements that appear in a crisis: those who accept the issue, and those who stay at home from the meetings? "every man to his tents, Israel".
J.T. Those who recognise the issue move in relation to it. Suppose the men of Judah had gathered themselves together and attacked Sheba at once: there would have been another civil war, which God was not immediately ordering, and a diversion from the great issue, which was *David coming back to his house*. He is on his way to his house: and this great event must not be thwarted. That is the great thing -- what Christ is doing: what He has in mind. Thus "the men of Judah clave to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem". Antitypically, the kingship of Christ, the headship of Christ and other offices He fills enter into all this;
{219}
also the Person, of Christ, and His return to His house. David filled the scene: he was going back to Jerusalem, steadily going there. Hence although Judah gave occasion for bitter feelings, they adjusted themselves. Instead of following up their harsh words with harsher ones, they clave to their king on the way to his great objective.
Ques. Is Gilgal in line with recovery here? They were recovered to David as king at Gilgal and the Jordan.
J.T. Quite so. Recovery ought to take place quickly if we are spiritual. This evidently happened in the neighbourhood of Gilgal. Can David be diverted and can confusion be thrown into the camp? That is the enemy's effort here. The men of Judah might have been harsher; there is good cause for it now. They simply clave to their king.
Ques. Do you think the ten tribes would be governed by feelings that are wrought upon; natural feelings?
J.T. There is no doubt that Satan knew what was there: there was a cleavage. It was manifest at the end of chapter 19; and now Satan, through this man, is taking advantage of it and he appeals to the idea of parts -- the party thought. That is, Christ divided. Every spiritual man would say, There is only one king. Christ is not divided; we shall cleave to Him.
Rem. These same statements are used again later on in Kings where the division of the tribes takes place. The same words are used: "What portion have we in David?" (@1 Kings 12:16).
J.T. This was designed by the devil, because there was a want of real affection for David.
Rem. You see the devil working through this whole section. Is the enemy energetically working to divide the saints?
J.T. Exactly. It is to bring out what the enemy is
{220}
doing through the bad state of the people and the poor resistance to him. There is want of power in David to meet all this. David does not do anything at the beginning of Sheba's revolt; he does not say anything. He goes on to Jerusalem; but the point is the men of Judah clave to him. They go through. When he gets to Jerusalem he does say something about Sheba; *but he is determined to deal with the manifest evil in Joab*. He calls Amasa and Abishai, but he is not reaching his end. So that I think the lack of moral weight and strength in us is shown up in such crises and the enemy gets a great advantage. The cabinet, as it is formed at the end of chapter 20, implies defeat, for Joab is over all the host of Israel. The whole position is in this respect defective.
A.R. Does not verse 11 show that one of Joab's young men was a partisan, too? He puts Joab ahead of the king: "He that favours Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab", and this murderer is at the head of the list.
J.T. Yes, Joab is now exposed as a wicked man and thus liable at any time to be the enemy's agent. In the final settlement of the kingdom we have a murderer at the head of the officers. That is a terrible thing after all this exercise. In a typical sense, this state of things bears on the history of the assembly.
A.N.W. Judah's act in cleaving to the king is good; but at the moment are you suggesting that the leader is at fault?
J.T. The king is weak. He has in his mind that Joab must be put out of the way, but he cannot do it. He is putting up a man that had not proved himself. Amasa had been a rebel; and Abishai is a regular Joab man; and Joab comes into the position again, a murderer twice.
Ques. Why do you think David is weak in dealing with Joab? Because he had not reached self-judgment in regard to Mephibosheth?
{221}
J.T. That is one item. But then the sword was not to depart from his house; the government of God comes in. We have had this matter up before -- that of David's weakness. Why is it that a man of such military skill and wisdom and ability should have allowed the reign of Absalom? The answer seems to be found in the antitype of this whole matter -- the history of the assembly. We have a crisis in any given place and the result is that after all the Lord has not had the whole matter in His hands. We have not been with Him in the thing, clear of ourselves. Undoubtedly there was some feeling in David against Joab because of the harsh way he had treated him. Perhaps there was resentment which made him determined to set aside Joab at this juncture. The result is the enemy gets an advantage. I may be so set on some particular thing that affects *me*. that I may open the door to the enemy.
Ques. Is the assembly referred to as setting forth this?
J.T. I think the history of the assembly is in mind. Joab was extremely harsh to David; inexcusably harsh, as seen in chapter 18. That was a personal matter really. In truth David provoked that. He was so weak in his conduct that he provoked Joab there. If he had judged that he would have been saved from any personal resentment, but he is so set on disciplining him in the army that he takes up Amasa and Abishai and they both fail him. Militarily, Joab is the man for the moment, but he maintained his place through murder. God would deal with that as He did through Solomon, not through David. In the meantime Joab puts down Sheba's rebellion and remains over the host of Israel.
A.R. You are speaking of Joab as a responsible element?
J.T. That is it. I may be concerned about something personal during a great crisis, something that
{222}
affects me personally. I believe David was so affected here. He was below his kingship. He is floundering about to discipline Joab and he is not succeeding.
Rem. Solomon says there is a time for everything.
J.T. Just so. You might have to leave a thing to another and God will give opportunity to deal with it. The time has not come. David was not dealing with Joab's case at all, because the result is Joab is over all the host of Israel. That is a poor thing for David.
C.A.M. Do you think that down through the various stages of church history the weak element of rule and all the consequent sorrows are really due to some kind of personal feeling, or some selfish end to be reached? And so the fact is stressed that being set for Christ, personally and only, is our safety.
J.T. That is the issue. The king was coming back to his house, and in this sense he is a type of Christ, but in many other features he represents weakness, as is evidenced in these chapters.
R.W.S. "They arranged that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others from amongst them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question", @Acts 15:2. Is that in line?
J.T. It is. Some might say that the matter could have been settled in Antioch. You can understand friends of Paul saying, Why must we go to Jerusalem? You know, people speak in that way. Why cannot we settle it here? We have spiritual men here. But God would not have it that way. Paul and Barnabas had to go to Jerusalem, seemingly at a disadvantage, but it was a success. God made it a success.
A.R. I suppose what you are saying helps us as to the defects at Corinth. The apostle has nothing to say to the leaders. He was promoting unity.
J.T. At the close of Paul's last letter he deals drastically with the men who were against the truth
{223}
and against him. At the beginning of the first letter he asks, "Is Christ divided?" (@1 Corinthians 1:13).
A.P.T. I was thinking that in a similar way the matter of circumcision was settled in the meeting spoken of in @Acts 15; but it still remained for Peter individually to be wholly right as to the matter in question. Paul could have said, We will look into persons first and see how they stand; but Peter's case was to come up later.
J.T. If it had come up at Jerusalem I do not think Paul would have rebuked him. We must avoid personal motives no matter how right we may feel ourselves to be. The issue is Christ, some feature of Christ, His kingship, sonship, headship -- keep to that. And if there is something wrong in some person in regard to me, God will bring about a battle-field for that.
CHAPTER 21
J.T. The Spirit of God keeps David before us in these chapters. Whether it be in his godliness, prowess, weakness, failures or feelings, the Spirit of God keeps him steadily before us right through the book, inclusive of his own compositions in the next two chapters. The incident of the famine calls attention to "the days of David". It occurred in his days. Then there are the Philistine conflicts recorded at the end of chapter 21, which would call attention to his prowess. We shall be instructed as we keep David in mind as the responsible element. This responsible element is owned of God in the assembly.
This first incident in verse 2 is formally linked up with earlier history by the Spirit of God. The Spirit intends us to view the history of the Gibeonites beginning with @Joshua 9. They were not of the children of Israel, "but of the remainder of the
{224}
Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them; and Saul sought to smite them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah". That parenthesis is put in to remind us of their history and that we should have a judgment as to them, not only as to Israel's history in relation to them, but as to their own history. It reminds us of the need of considering their whole history and judging for ourselves whether what they represent today has any intrinsic value before God, or whether they are preserved and avenged purely because they were under covenant without any regard to their virtue or otherwise. So far nothing has been said as to their quality. The Rechabites had a certain moral quality that God owned which is especially seen in their obedience in keeping the commandment of their father. The Gibeonites, so far, are viewed as protected by covenant. One of them was among David's mighty men. There may be a correspondence between them and the Nethinim in Israel.
A.R. One of the greatest days in Israel's history was perhaps in @Joshua 10, when God owned the covenant and the sun stood still on Gibeon.
J.T. Quite so. It is very remarkable that it should be so. It was no accident. I think it is well to mention that side of the matter because we are prone to stress the failure in Israel in allowing them in among them undetected. Was there, at that time or later, any evidence of virtue in them? It seems as if there may be something, at least, in an anti-typical sense. Our entrance into the place of privilege outwardly may be very irregular, and yet God may work in us taking account of us as in that position. Roman Catholics are industrious in missionary work in Africa and Asia. Their baptism would be irregular, although it would be valid. This is also true of other irregular baptisms. That is, they would entitle those baptised, even although they might not be converted,
{225}
to a certain recognition, by God. God might work in them on account of their position outwardly in the place of privilege and thus they would become of spiritual value.
A.N.W. Did you say you would link them with the Nethinim?
J.T. The word 'Nethinim' denotes 'given' or 'dedicated'. These Gibeonites were appointed under a curse to be hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation of the Lord. That is a remarkable thing, that people should be under a curse and yet their appointed service is related to the tabernacle where God dwells. Being in the outward place of privilege, they may have come under special sovereign divine consideration. In fact we know that some of the Canaanites did. Uriah was a Hittite; he was of the accursed race. The Canaanitish woman was of the accursed race too. And doubtless many others came into the place of privilege, maybe irregularly, but God wrought in them because of this.
R.W.S. Over against their craft and untruthfulness, in @Joshua 9:9 they say that they came "from a very far country ... . because of the name of Jehovah thy God; for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt, and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond Jordan". Does their fear of God offset their craft and untruthfulness in coming as they did?
J.T. Their speech is very like Rahab's. She was also of the accursed race. All that is worthy of our attention as to whether it has not an application antitypically.
W.B-w. It would depend upon the work of God in them.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. Our forefathers may have been in the Roman Catholic church or any other nominal Christian system of man. Baptism by them would be to the name of the Father, and of
{226}
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; and this was valid before God, and in a sense brought them under covenant, outwardly anyway. We know that in the history of Christendom all rites were administered irregularly from about the second century.
F.S.C. Would you say that the Gibeonites were believers?
J.T. It would seem that we should give them some credit, for their belief was very like Rahab's; although they dissembled and deceived Israel, what were their motives? They said to Joshua, "Because it was certainly told thy servants how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; and we feared greatly for our lives because of you", @Joshua 9:24.
Rem. They were not merely passive believers but energetic believers.
J.T. They were hewers of wood and drawers of water, not for domestic service, but for the congregation. Mr. Darby said that is what he was doing, hewing wood and drawing water, in making the New Translation of the Bible.
A.N.W. It says, "to this day, in the place which he should choose", @Joshua 9:27. It is not haphazardly done, but definitely done.
R.W.S. I would like some help on Gibeon: the sun stood still upon Gibeon.
J.T. Gibeon was attacked by five kings of other cities. These formed a league. "And it came to pass when all the kings who were on this side the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and along all the coast of the great sea as far as opposite to Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it, that they assembled together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel with one accord", @Joshua 9:1,2. Then the
{227}
history of Gibeon comes in. And chapter 10 says, "And it came to pass when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it, that he had done to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them, that they feared greatly; for Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty. And Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piream king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel ... . And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Withdraw not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered against us", @Joshua 10:1 - 4,6. So that the attack was on Gibeon; that is a very significant matter, and the great event comes in in relation to it. It directs our minds to that city. Hence Joshua says in verse 12, "Sun, stand still upon Gibeon", @Joshua 10:12; so that city has a great place in the war.
A.R. It is put on record; it is written in the book of Jasher. It is a special book; @Joshua 10:13.
J.T. Yes; it refers to uprightness. If Israel had been half-hearted about the Gibeonites they might have let their own people smite them and destroy them, but they defended them and God acted in that war in a most remarkable way.
W.B-w. All the people of Israel came to them in answer to their appeal in verse 6. There was almost a division about them according to chapter 9; but this was avoided. "And the children of Israel did not smite them, because the princes of the assembly had sworn unto them by Jehovah the God
{228}
of Israel", @Joshua 9:18. The issue was decided and Joshua let them live.
F.S.C. In what light does Joshua stand in taking them on?
J.T. He was deceived with the rest, but in the main acting for God. He and the princes made a covenant with them, and God in our present chapter shows that He maintained all Joshua did. These Gibeonites must have been of value in Israel; and that is the reason I mentioned the matter of possible virtue in them, not only the question of the covenant, but they were worth preserving. It was virtually God's covenant. Israel was committed to it. It was a covenant that Israel should have maintained, and God caused a famine because they did not. In Ezra's time Artaxerxes exempted the Nethinim from taxes; @Ezra 7:24.
F.S.C. Verse 19 says: "We have sworn unto them by Jehovah the God of Israel".
J.T. It was a covenant made in the name of Jehovah, and Israel was bound to keep it if they were to be loyal.
A.L. Why do you think there was not a famine in Saul's day? Why did God wait until David's day?
J.T. No doubt it is to keep David before us and to bring out what he is in the presence of such circumstances. It is "in the days of David", in *his* days. It must have been rather late in his years, but still we are not told what particular time it was. I think God would keep David before us whether in his good or evil qualities, that we should profit by his history.
A.R. It could hardly be historical. We were saying last week about Joab that David should have required the past. He did not, but God allowed it to remain until Solomon came; but here God requires what has taken place in the past.
A.N.W. Does God act governmentally without the purpose of it being known?
{229}
J.T. That may be. He is not obliged to give an account of His matters. But this chapter gives the information needed. David is brought out in a peculiar way. All these chapters bring David before us in a sort of mixed state; he is not what he used to be. He is brought before us in deterioration. Therefore it is a solemn matter, and applied to ourselves it is a matter of whether we are gaining quality or losing. We are told there was a famine "three years, year after year". It is a long period of discipline, severe discipline, and David does not inquire until late, which fact in itself seems to be wanting.
A.N.W. Three years is a long time.
J.T. Quite so. Then he inquires urgently; the Spirit of God gives us that. "And David inquired", or sought the face of Jehovah, evidently urgently. God answered immediately, and in strong language. Jehovah says, "It is for Saul, and for his house of blood, because he slew the Gibeonites". Did the king not know of this wrong? It seems that such an act of Saul against people sheltered by God should be known by David. There is no other inquiry from Jehovah in the whole chapter.
Ques. Later on it says, "And David was exhausted". Does that bring out the low-down condition of things?
J.T. He was getting weaker. God preserved him, but he was getting weaker.
R.W.S. Does God often indicate some disapproval of how things are going in our local meetings and if we are sensitive we catch the thought in His mind? But if we do not, He blows harder until there is a whirlwind?
J.T. Quite so. It must have been painful to God; He had no pleasure in a famine year after year.
W.B-w. Does it have any bearing on the close of the dispensation?
{230}
J.T. No doubt it appears from the very beginning of the history of the assembly. It comes out strongly now. The point is for those through whom God is owned and who are in any sort of way leaders or in responsible positions among the people of God, as to whether they are becoming weaker or growing stronger and stronger? David grew stronger and stronger, as stated earlier, in @2 Samuel 3, but now he is growing weaker and weaker.
W.B-w. At the close of the chapter there are four very strong men who are sons of the giant. Does that have some reference to the end of the dispensation? Four overcomers destroy the four sons of the giant. I thought David getting weaker might suggest the close of the dispensation.
J.T. I think so.
A.F.M. Verse 16 says, "And Ishbibenob, who was of the children of Raphah ... thought to smite David". That is on the aggressive side.
J.T. Yes. He "was girded with new armour". No doubt these giants would indicate the character of latter-day opposition. These four men mentioned are on the other side, and they overcome the giants.
W.B-w. They are victorious over the Philistines.
J.T. The Philistines are brought down by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. These four servants of David would be a universal spiritual production.
W.B-w. They would be holding things in the last days universally against the great opposition in organised religion.
A.R. Perhaps these men represent Philadelphia?
J.T. Quite so; "a little strength". They are acting with David. In the early part of his life he needed no personal support; you never hear of him having even an armour-bearer. Now he needs help, being exhausted. So that it is a weakened condition of things; which, of course, is very suggestive in our
{231}
own times as to whether any of us whom God may have used among His people is becoming weaker. Why not become stronger and stronger? Caleb was as strong at eighty-five as he was at forty.
Ques. Do we not see how severe the judgment of God is? It goes the full length, as it were. The judgment, of God is going on year after year.
J.T. Just so, year after year, as if God would say, Well I shall have to go on another year, and yet David is not doing anything. He is passive and the people are suffering. Why should it be so? Earlier David was quick to go to Jehovah, even asking what city he should attack; but here it takes years to seek the solution of a real difficulty.
R.W.S. Then he does not bring God into the settlement.
J.T. This is a serious matter. But he does not ask God anything more, he inquires from the Gibeonites. There would be a danger of undue feeling in them. In such circumstances we want a fair judgment.
A.B.P. Was there responsibility on the part of Israel? It is said of them earlier as to the Gibeonites, "they did not inquire at the mouth of Jehovah", @Joshua 9:14.
J.T. David should have had that before him. Surely he would look up @Joshua 9 (he ought to) as to this matter, and he would see there that relations with the Gibeonites were entered into by the people without asking counsel of Jehovah.
A.B.P. In a troublesome case we must not excuse ourselves when difficulty arises if we were neglectful at the time the person was allowed to break bread. So that door-keeping seems to enter into this matter.
J.T. Quite so. It is not very long since that God was calling attention to us as having had faulty door-keepers. We need to be careful in dealing with the persons who apply for fellowship. David had these
{232}
people on his hands. He should get the mind of God now as to what is to be done.
J.T.Jr. Are you suggesting that deception is often present? We might deceive the brethren. We are apt to have a good appearance when we come in among the brethren.
J.T. It is a question of how many of us tell the whole truth; but God works in spite of that.
J.T.Jr. Does the public history come out in Gibeon? It goes back to the Amorite.
J.T. They are called Amorites here; they were really Hivites. They are said to be Amorites here, which does not flatter them at all. It does not add anything to them spiritually to say they are Amorites. In spite of that God is standing by them. If a man establishes his right to come in by the gates, he can enter; it is *his* right. But it is the business of the door-keepers to see that he does establish his right, namely, by washing his robes. Take the case of Simon Magus: there was great joy in Samaria because so many had apparently been converted; and no doubt if the breaking of bread was started, Simon would be allowed to break bread. He was counted among the believers. The Holy Spirit had not come yet. It is a great object lesson for us, put down in that chapter. Here is one man reckoned in fellowship and he is not a Christian at all. Why is that? That is the question: why is it? What comes out is that they had not received the Spirit yet. It requires the Spirit actively in us to discern whether a person has a right to enter by the gates.
J.T.Jr. The Rechabites kept the commandment of their father; the keeping of the commandment is the test today.
J.T. That is just the thing. The authorised version says, "Blessed are they that do his commandments", @Revelation 22:14. We use the word 'reception'. It is not appropriate. We have no power to confer
{233}
rights on anyone. There are keepers at the gates and they inquire of your right, but they are not conferring anything. It is for each one to establish his right to enter. Have we looked into the matter in the power of the Holy Spirit? I believe that is what was the matter at Samaria. They had not as yet received the Holy Spirit. This man was there, owned among them. It is for us to see that in having the Spirit we examine people wishing to break bread with us. How many we have lost! Where were they? Had they the Spirit? There were the same number of singers according to @1 Chronicles 23 as there were door-keepers. That means that we are genuine Christians if we are characteristically singers. We have spiritual sentiment and feeling. That is the thing to inquire of persons that want to break bread with us -- can they truly take part in the song? That would be the test.
Ques. Would door-keeping go on in the household too, in connection with young people coming into fellowship? There ought to be a certain amount of door-keeping by the parents.
J.T. Yes; the parents ought to be the best judges.
A.R. There are a large number among us that are never heard taking part in song or in the prayer meeting. You wonder what the difficulty is.
J.T. The thought of adding to our numbers is usually too much present with us, instead of the thought of adding singers -- persons of *spiritual quality*.
A.R. The persons who are investigating have the Spirit and the applicant is to have the Spirit too. If a person has the Spirit it will not be long before he is *saying* something. Scripture says that the Lord added to the assembly such as should be saved.
J.T. That refers to the spared remnant of Israel, as you will observe, meaning that they are viewed
{234}
from the side of sovereign selection. They are saved sovereignly. The Lord had all these in His mind. He said, as it were, You are worthy of them so I will add them to you. We get the quality of the three thousand before the Lord adds the spared ones. So that Paul says, "For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory", @2 Timothy 2:10, showing that the sovereign side of the truth is peculiarly important to God.
Ques. Is it wrong to admit now a hewer of wood and a drawer of water?
J.T. Well, you would like to be one of those. We were just remarking that there are a great many who do not do even that. The great servant who translated the Bible called himself one of them. It is work of this kind; it is not exactly spiritual, but necessary work for the assembly; it includes such services as preparing refreshment at special meetings.
Ques. There is so much said about the singers -- where do the sisters come in?
J.T. They sing better than the brothers, usually; but the sisters do not take part as *speaking* in the assembly.
A.B.P. Is not a brother's thanksgiving sometimes more excellent because of the expression of the feelings of the sisters.
J.T. The sisters are like a reservoir of spirituality. They add to the service. There is increased power in the service because of them.
Rem. These are essential things -- hewing wood and drawing water. They are essential things to the assembly.
J.T. In Nehemiah there was a *wood* offering. These Gibeonites must have had to do with that.
R.W.S. They speak well here. They say, It is not for us to tell you what to do. David says, "What shall I do for you?" "And the Gibeonites said to
{235}
him, As to Saul and his house, it is with us no question of receiving silver or gold, neither is it for us to have any man put to death in Israel". That seems a good statement.
J.T. You can see they are equal to the position so far. But David put on them what should not have been put on them. You may put more on a person than he is equal to, and he may go too far. David put the whole matter on them. They should not have had the power of decision in the matter. They did not send the famine, God did that. He is the One to be inquired of. God was affected by Saul's conduct as well as the Gibeonites. Thus God's mind ought to have been sought.
J.T.Jr. Would Deuteronomy come in in the settlement of the matter? It says, "If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment ... thou shall come unto the priests ... and inquire", @Deuteronomy 17:8,9.
David put it on the Gibeonites instead of on the priests.
A.N.W. Is not the answer of the Gibeonites in accordance with the government of God?
J.T. Well, that is a question. It is a very sorrowful proposal. The Spirit of God goes on to give us the history. The bodies of these seven men were hanging there for months. We are told in Deuteronomy that Israel should not leave one hanged on a tree to remain there over night, but he should be buried.
Ques. Is that why it says, "And afterwards God was propitious to the land", verse 14?
J.T. That is after David began to have right feelings. Rizpah seemingly is the only one who has right feelings about the men who were hung. The point is, there was not right feeling. David was right in asking the Lord about the matter in the beginning. He then calls for the Gibeonites, and then the Spirit of God stops and tells us about the Gibeonites. Then
{236}
David says, "What shall I do for you?" Where is the governing principle in that? Where is God's mind in this matter? There is no inquiry from God. The only one spared is Mephibosheth, and that is not because of any good quality in him, it is because of David's oath with Jonathan. He is perhaps the most spiritual man in Israel, and he is saved only because of David's oath with Jonathan. Why is it not said that Mephibosheth was a lover of David? That is not here at all. And these men are handed over to the Gibeonites to hang up in mid-air. They are left there to rot; the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air can come and devour them. It is want of right feeling that the chapter expresses. That is very often the case with us, the want of right feeling. So that Rizpah seems to lead in the position. She has right affections. She suffers all these months, exposed to the elements, as you might say, to keep the beasts of the field and the birds of the air from those bodies. And now David, hearing of her care for those hanged, is moved to do what is right and buries them with the bones of Saul and Jonathan, and as they are buried God is propitious to the land.
W.B-w. It was in the first days of barley harvest that this happened. See what they were missing when they were carrying on with all these unspiritual things!
A.B.P. The whole thing seems to be brought back to the father, like the source. Kish is referred to. Would there be anything in that, in that Saul's and Jonathan's bones are brought up? The loose ends were drawn in and the whole matter was settled.
J.T. That is the way to look at it. The time was when God had His mind on Kish; and now his sons and grandsons are gathered up and buried in his sepulchre -- by David himself. "And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-Gilead, who had
{237}
stolen them from the open place of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged, them, the day the Philistines had smitten Saul in Gilboa; and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. And they buried them with the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father; and they did all that the king had commanded". Now notice we are brought back to the parent tribe, Benjamin, and to Kish and Saul and Jonathan. How often they had been mentioned! They had a place among the saints at one time. There is right feeling in David now. It is an important matter to have right feelings about everything. Love "does not behave in an unseemly manner", @1 Corinthians 13 5.
CHAPTER 22
J.T. This chapter is practically the same as @Psalm 18, except that the first verse of the Psalm is left out. The Psalm is "to the chief Musician. A Psalm of David, the servant of Jehovah, who spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of Saul. And he said, I will love thee, O Jehovah, my strength", @Psalm 18:1. He is recorded in the Psalm as a lover of Jehovah, which enriches the service of God. These are not merely words; they are outpourings by a lover of Jehovah. David omits the profession of love for Jehovah in this chapter. He has come before us in various ways; namely, as a type of Christ, as a type of a saint, and even as a type of a sinner; but it seems as if this chapter is inserted to give us the real David as viewed entirely in relation to God's work in him. Each of us is variable in his walk and ways, and mixed in his
{238}
motives and conduct, but there is a sense in which we are viewed abstractly; the flesh and the workings of the flesh are ignored.
A.R. Do you think that in spite of the chequered history he had, David acquired a knowledge of God through it all?
J.T. That is the point, to bring out his stature amid all his failures and variations. It is that abstractly which answers to God in the true believer.
A.N.W. Why did the book not close after this chapter?
J.T. The Spirit of God returns to the actual facts of history, and is particularly quick to bring out the governmental ways of God. It says in the last chapter, "And again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them saying, Go number Israel and Judah". (@2 Samuel 24:1) *He* moved David against Israel. That is a remarkable and solemn fact. In Chronicles it is Satan who "stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel", @1 Chronicles 21:1. The book of Samuel is to bring out the solemn government of God, how He Himself moved David against Israel, to bring out the state of the people.
A.F.M. It says in verse 1, "And David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song", and in verse 50 it says, "Therefore will I give thanks to thee, Jehovah, among the nations". There is emphasis laid on the fact that he *said* the thing and did not sing it. Is there a lack of exuberance about this?
J.T. "Therefore will I give thanks to thee, Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing psalms to thy name". That is a resolution. Evidently he is not losing ground as he proceeds. He closes on the top note here; he is gaining ground as he proceeds in this song.
Ques. Is it to cause all the people of God to join in the meaning of it that it is placed in the book of Psalms?
{239}
J.T. It is in the book of the service of God, and evidently enriched for that setting, because David says, "I will love thee, O Jehovah, my strength", (@Psalm 18:1) and he addresses the psalm to the chief Musician. He puts it on to the full height of what is due to God in service. You may say many things in meetings like this, but in assembly you omit what is not suitable. The Psalms are necessarily on a higher level because they are set particularly for the service of God, the chief Musician being recognised; and one who speaks to God says, "I will love thee, O Jehovah", @Psalm 18:1. The Psalm is finished and is suitable for the service of God. So Paul says, "For *we* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh", @Philippians 3:3. The idea there is the public worship of God. The book of Psalms would be for that, it has dignity attached to it. We worship by the Spirit.
A.R. The Lord in adjusting the two on the way to Emmaus spoke to them from the law and the prophets; but when the disciples were together He spoke to them from the law and the prophets and the Psalms. He had in view the service of God.
J.T. He includes the Psalms because they are on a higher level; they are experimental. In chapter 23 it is a question of David's last words, carrying with them all the experience of his days. The date of this song or psalm we cannot speak of definitely, save that it must have been late in his life because he was delivered from all his enemies; he particularly mentions Saul, a legal element.
R.W.S. Why is there not more ministry in relation to the Psalms?
J.T. I suppose we do not understand them. Maybe the Lord will help us now in regard to them. It is a question of whether one is able to say, "I will love thee, O Jehovah" (@Psalm 18:1).
A.N.W. There are certain epistles in which the
{240}
apostle is more given to praise than in others. Does he not exult a good deal more in Ephesians and Romans than in Colossians or Corinthians or Galatians?
J.T. That is very suggestive. The two normal epistles of Paul are Romans and Ephesians. Colossians, Corinthians and Galatians are corrective epistles and in these the apostle's spirit would be more bound in the thought of failure. The epistle to the Romans is very remarkable, full of a worshipful spirit, and so is Ephesians. So that this chapter is to be taken account of more as a testimony to the work of God in one man's soul, ignoring the variableness of his life, and also the sinfulness of it. We have no allusion to his sins; on the contrary he enlarges on his righteousness. It says in verse 20, "He delivered me, because he delighted in me. Jehovah hath rewarded one according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me". You are impressed with that. He is alluding by the Spirit of God to the effect of the work of God in him. Although he speaks of "mine iniquity", verse 24, he is not enlarging on that; he says he has kept himself from it, so that it seems to be an abstract view. That is, the saints are viewed by the Spirit of God entirely in relation to the work of God in them, which is really the only basis for the service of God. It is what we are.
A.F.M. Why does he apply it so personally?
J.T. It is the Spirit of God taking him up to express what he is in relation to the work of God in an abstract way. That is, abstract in the sense that he is not occupied with his sins or his sinful condition, but with the effect of the work of God. The man in @Romans 7 does not speak like this. David is delivered and is able to speak to God in this way about himself. It seems to be an important side of the truth for assembly service that we are enabled to take account
{241}
of ourselves abstractly; not in our mixed condition, but abstractly. Thus we are not intruding ourselves into the presence of God. It is unworthy to push ourselves in in assembly service. God wants us to abstract ourselves and be before Him in that relation.
E.A.C. So that this chapter would be an encouragement to us despite the sorrowful experiences David had had earlier. He is able to speak as he does from a high plane.
J.T. It is the Spirit of God enabling him to do this. We can speak of ourselves in a spiritual sense, "The spiritual discerns all things", @1 Corinthians 2:15. We can speak of ourselves abstractly: "Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin";(@1 John 3:9) and "even as he is, we also are in this world", @1 John 4:17. God has gone to great pains to have us from that point of view.
A.R. What you say requires great spirituality. If I abstract myself and take account of myself thus before God, I must clothe the saints with the same thoughts.
A.N.W. Perhaps we are too introspective. You are speaking apart from any unreality.
J.T. Quite so. It is only by the constant recognition of the Spirit that we are enabled to judge the flesh. "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day" (@Revelation 1:10) is a very suggestive word. How could John say that? He did not introduce any incongruities in himself; he was in a state that excludes all that.
C.A.M. And as in that state, there had been a solemn experience that had caused him to reach this point. What has been said about not being unreal seems to be very important.
J.T. It is most important, because God is looking into our hearts. He is not thinking simply of what we are able to say, but of what state we are in.
A.R. "My heart is welling forth with a good matter", @Psalm 45:1.
E.A.C. Are not verses 2 and 3 the basis for David's
{242}
ability to express himself as he does in the many experiences further on in the chapter? He speaks of Jehovah as "my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; God is my rock, in him will I trust". In his experiences he had evidently proved God in these wonderful ways.
J.T. You must get to the Rock. That is what he stresses here, using the designation several times. You must get down to the foundation. God is that, as seen here; God is underneath. The Lord says, "And *I* also, I say unto thee that *thou* art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it", @Matthew 16:18. You get to the bottom of things; that is the principle of this song. The psalm comes almost on to our own ground; and no doubt David's experiences as recorded in the Psalms account for this. He is able to abstract himself. Unless we come through @Romans 7 we shall not be able to do this, the lessons there enable us to abstract ourselves from all else but what is of God. It is due to God that we should do that in order that He might have us before Him as Christ is.
R.W.S. It would seem that is why the Lord brings in worship in @John 4. It is due to the Father but due to Him as having this other matter solved.
J.T. It lies in the Spirit. The Spirit deals with it in a very concrete sense, a fountain of water "springing up into eternal life", @John 4:14. That is the power of abstraction.
Rem. All David's personal failure is out of sight in this chapter.
J.T. When he comes to the end he is rising in power, so that he says, "Therefore will I give thanks to thee, Jehovah, among the nations, and will sing psalms to thy name. It is he who giveth great deliverances to his king, And showeth loving-kindness to his anointed, To David, and to his seed for evermore".
{243}
Note, it is not, to *the* king, but, to *His* king. David was divinely provided for Israel, but God has pleasure in him as in the office. He says he is Jehovah's king and Jehovah's anointed. That is attributing everything to God. Paul says to the Corinthians, "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts", @2 Corinthians 1:21, 22. He brings us down to rock bottom as to our state and He is entitled to have those thoughts about us. He has wrought for that purpose.
Rem. One's spiritual success is likely to carry one away.
J.T. Quite so. The idea of the "rock" is what God is. "Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; God is my rock, in him will I trust". "And who is a rock, save our God?"
J.T.Jr. The believer comes to see the great things he has as set free from Satan's power, and is able to boast in what God is to him.
J.T. And in what God has in him too: "But we *do* know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose", @Romans 8:28. It is getting down to rock bottom as to state. God has dealt with it on that principle in the death of Christ.
E.A.C. Will you say something more in connection with the rock bottom position? He speaks of other positions here where he was a man of conflict.
J.T. "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us", @1 John 1:8; and yet John says, "Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin", @1 John 3:9. That is the abstract thought. God allows David to speak of himself entirely in relation to His work, and what he is for God, and what God is to him; so that we are really spiritually, from the subjective side, on rock
{244}
bottom here. It is not a question of doctrines, but of what a man is himself and what God is to him.
A.R. Would the scriptures in @Ephesians 1:4 fit in: "that we should be holy and blameless before him in love"?
J.T. Yes. We are actually in a mixed condition, but we can reach this in assembly and God is entitled to it. It is an out-of-the-world condition of relationship and being.
A.N.W. Would @Psalm 51 underlie the service?
J.T. Yes, it belongs to the worship of God, and no doubt it would underlie what we have been speaking of, like @Romans 7. It is a question of intelligence as to what you would bring forward in the service of God. In Exodus an abundance of material was brought, but in Leviticus you must go to the priest as to how you shall use what you bring. You might own a horse or a mule, which in itself would be of value, but there is no tolerance for that in Leviticus. It is a question of priestly intelligence as to what to present in assembly. We must consider where we are. Leviticus is to show what is suitable under any given circumstances; I must recognise the law in regard of what I am offering.
R.W.S. Otherwise we could give thanks for the good weather, or similar mercies of God.
A.F.M. Why does "his seed" come in here, "To David, and to his seed for evermore"? Is that linked up with the brethren?
J.T. That would be the thought; the seed of such a man as this.
A.R. In @Leviticus 6 God says to Moses, "Command Aaron and his sons ...". Aaron and his sons are under authority; they cannot say or do just anything, there is a certain course to pursue.
J.T. That helps greatly, because Leviticus is perhaps not understood. It is a question of *wealth* and *regulation*. Wealth has to be controlled. In
{245}
our houses we can give thanks for the weather and the like; the sun in the heavens and the stars and the fruit of the earth and the heat and comfort of our houses. We would thus speak to God in wilderness conditions, but we cannot do that in assembly. The priest says, That will not do here. It is a question of the law that governs the thing. God rules out the responsible David that had been sinning and it is the David of divine counsel that speaks to Him in this chapter. Why should I not respect God in that light in the assembly and rule all else out of my mind for the moment, and in priestly power present to God just what He has effected in me?
C.A.M. Perhaps that is the great evidence of being a priest. It is a very remarkable thing that the priestly line has been opened up in Romans. In that epistle the apostle says at the outset: "First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world", @Romans 1:8. If he had not been a priest he could hardly have started this epistle like that.
J.T. There are many things in keeping with that in Romans, such as, "who shall deliver me out of this body of death? I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord", @Romans 7:24, 25. It is the priestly line running through the epistle. Again in Corinthians, "But of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption", @1 Corinthians 1:30. We are able to clothe ourselves with that.
A.M. In speaking of the kings that followed David, it says of them either that they followed as David their father, or they did not follow as David their father. David seems to be the standard by which they are measured.
J.T. Yes. Viewed abstractly, David is the standard both for royalty and priesthood. The thing is to
{246}
go on the abstract line, so that we are able, for a little while at least, to rule out all else.
Rem. The Lord is viewed as on the cross in @Psalm 22, and at that point He is able to praise. Praise flows out from the supper when we have remembered the Lord.
J.T. "And thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel", @Psalm 22:3. The praises were already there. "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", @Hebrews 2:12. When we come to that scripture, the assembly is viewed abstractly; there it is what we *are* : "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren", @Hebrews 2:11. He has us in that way. The prayer meeting is not like that for it is not an assembly meeting. The assembly meeting is where we should be abstracted in our minds and feelings, and we are often defective in this and miss the great import of the Lord's presence and service. When we come together in assembly on the first day of the week the Lord's supper is immediately before us, but having in view that we should go on to this place where we are all of one. We are to be on entirely abstract lines. I do not mean abstract in the sense that there is not something concrete, but in the sense that we are viewed thus in a certain relation. The concrete is there, but we are shutting out something else; we are not in relation to what we are in a mixed condition down here.
Rem. "*He* made as though he would go farther", @Luke 24:28. I suppose the Lord is always leading on to that position?
J.T. Exactly. In the endings of the gospels He is seen standing; in that particular setting at Emmaus He is sitting down; that was to take the housefather's place. The housefather would sit at the head of the table. But after He breaks the bread He vanishes. That means that it is now a spiritual
{247}
matter; the two went back to Jerusalem at that very moment. So that the endings of the gospels are intended to convey to us that the Lord is not sitting, He is on the way and we want to follow. If we follow we shall reach @John 20, and that is abstract. In that chapter there is no perturbation at all when He enters, everything is right, save the absence of Thomas. But his absence does not hinder what we are speaking of. Luke gives you the concrete, the mixed condition that was there; but John does not mention anything of that.
C.A.M. We need not be hindered because of the many absentees.
J.T. We are to be together in relation to the whole assembly on earth. We begin with @Romans 7: "So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law", @Romans 7:25. I am master of my mind. "God's law" here is not the ten commandments, it is whatever there is in the way of regulation. In the assembly I am to be equal to whatever direction there is.
A.R. In being master of your mind, what are the thoughts you would entertain in such circumstances?
J.T. There are many, of course. The assembly is a place of wealth where everything is regulated by God. Hence what is said about Leviticus is so important; it is the "law". You are to have a priestly mind and to know what is suitable.
Ques. Does the Lord have assembly service in mind when He says, "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established praise", @Psalm 8:2?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Does keeping the feast of unleavened bread help us to abstract ourselves?
J.T. It does. Paul says, "For this cause I also exercise myself", @Acts 24:16; that is the thing to get hold of. Paul had complete control of himself. He says, "But I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest after having preached to others I should be
{248}
myself rejected", (1 Corinthians 9:27). He kept himself under control, he was master of the whole inward position. The Holy Spirit is with us in that; if you take that line you will be supported. The assembly *is* the great thing in the mind of God from the beginning, and it will be so eternally.
R.W.S. How does it work out practically when something is presented that is unsuitable?
J.T. It is a question of priestly power to throw that off. The Lord supports us at such a moment when our priestly sensibilities are alert.
J.T.Jr. "Perfected praise" would be part taken that is suitable.
J.T. "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise", @Matthew 21:16. That would mean that my mind is not full of reminiscences. An old brother converted in later years is not apt to be much in the assembly. The Lord speaks of "babes and sucklings". The two blind men in @Matthew 20 say, "Have mercy on us. Lord, Son of David", @Matthew 20:30. They recognised the Son of David as He was about to enter Jerusalem. They were spiritual at the moment and said what was in keeping with the position. Again in the temple the children, the babes, say the same thing: "Hosanna to the Son of David", @Matthew 21:15. That is the line; the babes and sucklings are the kind in which the Lord can develop the truth. It is for us to take that attitude, "as newborn babes desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation", (1 @Peter 2:2). If a lead is given, the babes and sucklings will move in it.
R.W.S. The tone of the meeting should really increase as the younger brothers come in and take part.
J.T. The young brothers and sisters coming in from Christian households are, I believe, the best material for the Lord. Their minds are not filled up
{249}
with evil. The Lord had need of the colt, that is, a young person.
Ques. How is it possible to have this abstract thought on the Lord's day morning when we have had the sense of failure during the week?
J.T. It is possible in the Spirit: "the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life", @John 4:14. It is the power of the Spirit in you.
E.S. In @Leviticus 21 defects, such as flat noses, etc., are spoken of. Would these things hinder some of us from approaching the emblems?
J.T. That is the *law* again. If there are any of these defects you will know what to do, because the book tells you what to do. You may eat the bread of your God, but you do not present it. It is a question of "I myself with the mind serve God's law", (@Romans 7:25) whatever that is. It is largely 1 and 2 Corinthians. The spiritual discerns all things. If there is a constitutional defect I know that I should not take formal part at all; that is what is meant in @Leviticus 21.
A.F.M. Would it be a public matter?
J.T. Quite so. It is not simply what one has done, but what one is.
A.R. God showed Moses the whole land from "the top of Pisgah", @Deuteronomy 34:1. This would correspond with the abstract side that we have referred to.
J.T. That is a good suggestion. You have it also in Balaam's prophecy. Even in the wilderness it is possible. It is a question of exercise, "For this cause I also exercise myself", @Acts 24:16. If I attain any power it is on those lines, ruling all else out but what I know to be suitable for the moment. In a prayer meeting you may refer to your sick child, but not in an assembly meeting. The assembly is too august. Rule out all that is extraneous.
{250}
R.W.S. The emblems would help us to abstract ourselves.
J.T. We sit down with so many persons -- men and women -- as is contemplated in 1 Corinthians, and we are in a wilderness position. As we proceed the Lord comes in; He is in another condition. When He comes in the position is changed. Before He comes in we are by ourselves; the Spirit remains with us, of course, and we are in the assembly, but we are actually here as we have come out of our houses to break bread. As the Lord comes in, the more spiritual I am the more I begin to see that the ground is changed. It goes on on those lines until we apprehend Him as the Minister of the sanctuary, and we are His brethren.
A.F.M. That is where discernment is needed.
J.T. "I speak as to intelligent persons: do ye judge what I say", @1 Corinthians 10:15. That is how we begin and proceed. "I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding", @1 Corinthians 14:15. You feel happy and free and you are ready to give out a hymn, and then your understanding says that that hymn is not just suitable now and you desist.
Rem. "Yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 2:5.
Rem. Even legitimate thoughts that do not fit in are shut out for the moment. This would shut out the thought of responsibility.
J.T. We have been looking at this book in relation to the history of the assembly, and the public history of the assembly involves a great deal of lawlessness. In the midst of it God has been working, there has been something for God. This song represents that. All down the ages God has been working and there
{251}
has been some result and He has the real gold. It is a great triumph for God that there is anybody that can abstract himself so as to be before God according to His work in him. This is going to abide.
CHAPTER 23
J.T. This chapter presents David as a person who can speak on God's behalf. He is called a prophet in the New Testament. The word 'saith' here has an oracular meaning; it is an authoritative pronouncement. It is important that there is such a thing among God's people. So that I trust the Lord will help us on these last words of David. They are also poetic, as is chapter 22, and run on down to the end of verse 7.
A.R. When you say 'oracular', do you mean it is the same as God saying it Himself?
J.T. God Himself is the first to use the word in @Genesis 22: "And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from the heavens a second time, and said, By myself I swear, saith Jehovah", @Genesis 22:15,16. It seems to be a formal pronouncement by God Himself as to what He is saying.
Rem. It is the same word in Balaam's prophecy; @Numbers 24:23.
J.T. It is worth while taking notice of, because a certain amount of authority is in it, which is important to bear in mind amongst us. If the Spirit of God has His place, what is said is authoritative.
Rem. "If any man speak let him speak as the oracles of God", @1 Peter 4:11.
J.T. It is not what one thinks, but what is the truth.
C.A.M. It speaks in @Romans 3 of the Jews as having the oracles of God. Would it be right to connect authoritative speaking with what we call temple conditions?
{252}
J.T. The word 'oracle' in Genesis denotes an authoritative pronouncement. It is something to be sought out. In Corinthians it says, "Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you?" (@1 Corinthians 6:19). The thing is brought in very formally there.
W.B-w. Why is it connected in @Genesis 22 with the Angel speaking the second time out of heaven?
J.T. The first time is in verse 11: "And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens, and said, Abraham, Abraham!", @Genesis 22:11. The word is not used there, but it is in the second utterance by the Angel: "By myself I swear, saith Jehovah". (@Genesis 22:16) The oath with this remarkable word would give great assurance to the believer.
W.B-w. It is like @Hebrews 6:18: "that by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible that God should lie".
A.R. Hebrews makes much of faith in connection with the work of God. There is also a reference to Noah's being oracularly warned in @Hebrews 11:7.
J.T. He prepared an ark for the saving of his house. We ought to be listening for these peculiar pronouncements of God. They come in in ministry meetings and in readings. Things we often hear become peculiarly pronounced as the Spirit has His place.
A.R. Hence the importance of being at the meetings.
J.T. Yes. Moses went in to speak to Jehovah and God spoke to him; @Numbers 7:89. I suppose God knew that he would be ready to listen. God will speak if we are ready to listen.
A.B.P. David speaks to God in the previous chapter, but in this one he is speaking to men.
J.T. There is an oracular pronouncement which, I believe, belongs to a prophet; this is a prophetic word: "The ruler among men shall be just". David
{253}
shows that he is qualified in what he says about himself; "Now these are the last words of David: David the son of Jesse saith, And the man who was raised up on high, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel saith, The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me. And his word was on my tongue. The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me, The ruler among men shall be just". He certainly qualifies in all that he says here.
F.N.W. Is David's personality before us in verse 1?
J.T. It is first David and then the son of Jesse, then the man raised up on high, then the anointed of the God of Jacob, and then the sweet psalmist of Israel. He has titles to his name.
C.A.M. That emphasises that there will be personality at the end.
J.T. I think the whole chapter is full of that. When you come down to the mighty men in verse 8 it is all a question of personality. David is pre-eminently such. Heaven will be full of personalities. I think the idea is that we shall know each other as we are known.
C.A.M. Personality gives a tone to our meetings.
J.T. David is at his best here and his distinctive features stand out prominently as he speaks in the power of the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God calls attention to what is spiritual.
Ques. Do we get outstanding personalities in Moses and Elias when the Lord was transfigured?
J.T. Matthew brings that out. He speaks of the Son of man coming in His glory, which would call attention to what had been. It is the Person of the Son of man that is in mind; the greatest in the universe comes in His glory. Matthew also says He sits on the throne of His glory. Mark is not so pronounced about that, he speaks of how exceeding white His garments were. Matthew gives us the
{254}
names of the two great prophets; he does not tell us they were men, he says, "Moses and Elias". Luke says, "two men", and then tells us their names. Matthew's is the great account of the transfiguration that deals with personalities. The Spirit of God in @Matthew 17:26 goes on to tell us that the saints are free and have part with Christ. I think that is what we have here in this chapter; it is a question of personality at the end of the book, in David particularly, but also in the mighty men. We are carefully reminded of them in proper gradations, they are not all alike. God takes pleasure in differentiating because we are graded, and we shall be graded in heaven. But I believe everybody will be knowable there, we shall not need any introduction. Personality comes out at the end in men like Jacob and Moses, and now with David. These are his last words. It is a striking coincidence that in 1 Chronicles it tells us that among the last words of David were his instructions regarding the young brothers. He reduces the age for the beginning of the Levites¬ service to twenty years; @1 Chronicles 23:27.
A.Pf. Is personality acquired or is it a gift?
J.T. It is both, and it all hinges on new birth which brings us into the family and gives us status. All attainments and acquirements attach to that. Sonship is the thing and is the great binding thought, and all acquirements and attainments attach to that. David was in the light of sonship; that is where personality lies. The Lord immediately brings it in in @Matthew 17.
Ques. Does David give character to the mighty men? It is the men he *had*. Joab is left out.
J.T. But his armour-bearer is mentioned, showing how discriminating the Spirit of God is in this matter of personality. We do not want to be behind; we want to be knowable. "If any man love God the
{255}
same is known of him", @1 Corinthians 8:3. Lovers of God will be known and recognised.
T.A. Peter, James and John had a distinct place. The Lord selected them to go up the mountain with Him.
A.P.T. They were really the first three among the twelve.
W.B-w. Joab seemed to have a great personality in fighting the battles of Jehovah, and yet his name is not here.
J.T. There are personalities in the world too. In the book of Revelation we read of seven thousand names of men perishing.
A.N.W. If sonship is the key to it, it must evidently lie in what we *are*. rather than in what we *say*. All these men are mighty, and they are accredited with having done much.
J.T. David is alluded to as the son of Jesse, a man raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel. Those are distinguishing marks; but strictly the only *attainment* was in the fact that he was "the sweet psalmist of Israel". He had nothing to do with his sonship to Jesse; he was "raised up on high" by God; and as "the anointed of the God of Jacob", God did the anointing. But "the sweet psalmist of Israel" indicates an acquirement.
W.B-w. Is "the anointed" the official place he had as man?
J.T. Yes. That he was anointed *implied*, of course, that he had suitable qualifications.
C.A.M. Would it be right to say "the fathers" were prominent at the beginning, whereas sonship is what is prominent at the end? Sonship was not understood for a long time.
J.P. Paul and John and others spoke and acted as fathers, but there is a great lack of fathers today. Paul himself had to say that there were not many
{256}
fathers. The truth of sonship was always there, but it seems that it has been reserved for special emphasis in the last days, to give us tone before our exit.
A.R. Would you say it is more understood now?
J.T. Sonship may be more understood, but the exercise of a fatherly spirit is hardly known. Those that God is using are generally young men. The ability to serve and brotherly feeling are more prominent than fatherly qualities, which are not developed very much amongst us. The mutual side, however, has been stressed. This would correspond with "the last words of David", by which the serving age of the Levites was reduced to twenty to bring in the young men, making the most of them. I remember when the fatherly side, or what might be called the patriarchal position, was pronounced. Young men and women were kept down; care meetings were in the hands of a few elder brethren; the younger men were not recognised very much in the things of God. But I believe the Lord has brought in the other side and is stressing mutuality. So that you get a much better spirit and more energy, but a shortage of fathers.
C.A.M. Those elder brethren who shut the young men out were not looking for those who would carry on the testimony.
J.T. That is a good way to put it. It is weighing on many hearts today as to how things are to go on. The Lord is answering it by bringing forward the younger men. The Lord is helping the younger ones. Paul speaks of himself as "Paul, the aged". He calls for the elders of Ephesus; they are elders, but doubtless they would be younger than he; he puts responsibility on them. When he comes toward the end of his life he puts it largely on Timothy, as seen in the apostle's second letter to him.
Ques. Would you say that David's history here would be more connected with the wilderness side of
{257}
the truth? It was when he was under great stress.
J.T. Yes. It is interesting to note that Chronicles gives us the mighties as David was entering on his reign. Here we get them as he is finishing, showing that the idea of the mighty men is as much at the end as it is at the beginning.
R.W.S. The great men of the Philistines are smitten in the end of chapter 21. It says, "they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants", @2 Samuel 21:22. Is the ground thus cleared for the services of these men to come forward?
J.T. Quite so. Some of them had part with David in the overthrowing of these super-giants. It says that David was succoured (verse 17), whereas he begins by dealing with Goliath single-handed with no human support whatever; but as the kingdom went on he had support. The Lord when here dealt with the enemy by Himself, but in the kingdom He brings persons to His side. David is succoured. All these enemies are dealt with by David and his men. It is to bring out the development under David, what *he* and his mighty men accomplished; he was not doing everything by himself. The Lord loves to spread responsibility abroad: "Give ye them to eat", (@Matthew 14:16) He says to His disciples. They do not do it, but still He puts it on them. He would give us work to do as we are ready to do it. These mighties are the outcome of David's example and influence.
C.A.M. Would Paul and his company be similar to this? They must have all learned from him.
J.T. Quite so. Mark having that side in view tells us the Lord selected certain ones that they might be *with* Him. It is as being with David that these men became what they were. It is a question of being with the Lord.
J.T.Jr. In @1 Chronicles 27 there were twelve divisions of twenty-four thousand each and twelve of the mighties were over them. Would the idea be
{258}
to spread the character of David throughout Israel?
J.T. That is the thought. Any mighty man is an example for others. Mark gives you the clue: the Lord appointed twelve "that they might be with him", @Mark 3:14. As being with the Lord you get the idea of what He is. Mark is the book to keep in mind for mighty men, because it is the kingdom of God come in *power* ; it is not personality in that sense, but power. Power gives us personality. It necessitates being with the Lord and seeing how He does things. There is increase and it spreads.
T.A. Barnabas and Paul were men who risked their lives.
A.R. Why does Mark stress the idea of young men sitting?
J.T. I do not think a man will be much good unless he has learned to sit and be quiet and take things in. Mark tells us the Lord *sat at the right hand of God*. The allusion is to the place of *power*. The disciples went everywhere preaching, the Lord working with them, but *they* are doing it.
W.B-w. Is not that the point of these last words? It is Christ at the right hand of God in power, typified in David.
J.T. Quite so. One has often thought of Paul, how much is said of him by *himself*. What does that mean? "To me, less than the least of all saints", he says; (@Ephesians 3:8). The Spirit of God says, I can use that man to tell people of his own virtues and exploits. I want to bring those virtues prominently before the brethren, but if he is an egotistical kind of man I cannot use him. "Less than the least of all saints", (@Ephesians 3:6) the Spirit can use that man. Why should that man's qualities and works be lost? They are the kind that are needed as examples in the testimony. There is more said about Paul personally than about any other of the Lord's servants in the New Testament.
A.L. "I, Paul, say unto you", @Galatians 5:2. He uses such
{259}
phrases as that constantly. Why does the Spirit of God use him to say that?
J.T. It is because he is entirely free of himself. "Being such a one as Paul the aged" (@Philemon 9): the Spirit of God says that through his own mouth. Then David says here: "The anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel". The Spirit of God loves to say that; I think the sweet tones of David's voice resounded in heaven.
Ques. What is the difference between his personality and his qualifications? Would verse 1 be his personality and verses 2 and 3 his qualifications?
J.T. Verse 2 says, "The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me, and his word was on my tongue". The important thing is "the Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me", meaning he is a man that Jehovah had used. He is qualified to be used on a special occasion. Some of us might be used at any time; but there are some very special occasions, and God has regard to the experience of efficiency at such times.
W.B-w. "The sweet psalmist of Israel" must be special. Does that apply to the Lord Jesus singing praises in the midst of the assembly?
J.T. Quite so. You would like to have heard David sing. "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", (@Hebrews 2:12) are the Lord's words. It is the supreme idea of singing. You love to think of the Lord taking part in *that* way. So that it is what David is worthy of here; the Spirit of God indicates that He is using him because of these things. God uses us as we are available.
Ques. "The Rock of Israel spoke to me, The ruler among men shall be just". What would you say about that?
J.T. David said all that about himself. It says, "The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me, and his word was on my tongue". The word of God was on that tongue. "The God of Israel said, the Rock of
{260}
Israel spoke to me, the ruler among men shall be just".
W.B-w. There must be great honour in the idea of being spoken to. "The Rock of Israel spoke to me", I have to be prepared to be spoken to. It says in verse 2, "The Spirit of Jehovah spoke *by* me". There I am an instrument He can use.
J.T. That is it. As has been said, Moses went in to speak to God, but God says, in effect, I wish to speak to you. Oracular communications were to be heard. All these communications to Moses, so often alluded to, came out from between the cherubim; it is all on that principle. A man has to be spoken to first so that he may be able to speak to God or for God.
Rem. There would be harmony in the music of the sweet psalmist of Israel.
J.T. Quite so. The Spirit of God is teaching us that God has great occasions in view, and it is very important in His mind that there should be some able to take part in these occasions. David is being used by the Spirit of God to tell us what qualification she has. "The ruler among men shall be just, Ruling in the fear of God; and he shall be as the light of the morning, like the rising of the sun, a morning without clouds; when from the sunshine, after rain, the green grass springeth from the earth", verse 3, 4. That is the thing. God is going to have fruitfulness among His people.
W.B-w. It says, "The ruler *among* men shall be just". Does that apply to those who are rulers among the saints, not over them but among them?
J.T. Quite so. The word there might be 'over' but Mr. Darby prefers 'among'. The king was to be taken from among his brethren according to Deuteronomy, and the Lord says, "I am among you as he that serveth", @Luke 22:27. Ruling is largely by influence.
A.P.T. When Moses spoke to two of his brethren who were striving together, one said, "Who made
{261}
thee ruler and judge over us?" (@Exodus 2:14). No doubt he had much to learn as to rule.
J.T. He was refused. But "whom they refused ... him did God send to be a ruler and deliver with the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush", @Acts 7:35. He was "very meek above all men that were upon the face of the earth" (@Numbers 12:3).
R.W.S. Do you not think the point is to be influential? David here speaks of failure in relation to his house.
J.T. His house was not equal to his pronouncement. He says, "Although my house be not so before God, yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in every way and sure; for this is all my salvation, and every desire, although he make it not to grow". That is an acknowledgment. The first thing involves a pronouncement, the idea of ruling, and the result of it is as the green grass springing up from the earth.
Ques. Would @Psalm 45 fit in here? "My heart is welling forth with a good matter: I say what I have composed touching the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer" (@Psalm 45:1).
J.T. That is what developed in his own heart, but this is a pronouncement by God. It is really what the Rock of Israel said.
A.B.P. Would this be carried in David's soul right through his reign, and would his departure from it only serve to enhance his appreciation of God's standard?
J.T. That is right. He must have had a vision or an appearance from God as to kingship. God always appears to His servants if He intends to use them. But he says, "although my house be not so before God".
That is a humbling thing; I suppose every one of us would have to make an admission like that. But then God has made an everlasting covenant, "ordered in every way and sure". What blessing
{262}
there is in that! There is restfulness of soul in the covenant; it is an everlasting covenant, not said to be a new one, but *everlasting*.
A.N.W. "Although he make it not to grow". How do you regard that?
J.T. Judgment had to come in. The state of Israel had to be gone into and redemption had to be accomplished before God could make it grow.
Rem. Up to a certain point his house collapsed through Absalom and others; but the covenant would go through in Solomon.
J.T. The process of judgment, the prophetic ministry and the atonement have to be gone through before things grow, before the purposes of God could be accomplished. We are in the time of the growth. Things are growing now.
CHAPTER 23 (CONTINUED)
J.T. It will be noted that the account of the mighty men in @Samuel 23 comes in at the end of David's reign, whereas the account in Chronicles is at the beginning of his reign. It is said that they helped David in his kingdom at the beginning. They helped to make him king. So that Chronicles would typically refer to the early days of our dispensation, while Samuel would indicate that there may also be mighty or loyal men at the end similar to those at the beginning. Apparently they continued throughout David's reign, only many more are mentioned in Chronicles than in Samuel. It would seem to represent an element of special loyalty which normally carries power with it.
A.P.T. Joab has no place among the mighties.
J.T. So that those who had a place would imply that they were especially devoted to David. Joab cared little for David, but he appears again in chapter 24 where he is right and David is wrong.
{263}
Rem. "If I ... have not love, I am nothing", @1 Corinthians 13:2. Joab had no love.
J.T. Joab came under the judgment of God at the end; it applied to him.
W.R. Would the devotedness of the mighties be masculine love?
J.T. Yes, it would be that. You do not get any mighty women mentioned. The names of the mighty men are put here. Chronicles says, "These are the chief of the mighty men whom David had", @1 Chronicles 11:10. Here it is the renown they had acquired.
A.N.W. Would you say something about the three unnamed mighties in verse 13?
J.T. "And three of the thirty chiefs went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, when the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. And David was then in the stronghold; and the Philistines¬ garrison was then at Bethlehem. And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate! And the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; however he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah. And he said, Be it far from me, Jehovah, that I should do this thing! Is it not the blood of the men that went at the risk of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men". The name would be the renown or distinction the person has.
T.A. Would the first three allude to the apostles?
J.T. I should think they correspond. These first three are outstanding. Others did not attain to them, however great they may have been. The names being stressed here instead of the actual power of the men would point to Christianity, because that begins with the crowd of names without there being
{264}
distinguished brethren by name. We regard the persons of those that have served among us. The actual name borne by some of them may be very common, but it is the *person* designated that is in mind.
C.A.M. These three men hazarded their lives for David.
J.T. They were marked by loyalty, that is the leading thought. They would give character to the whole list as devoted to David. We have the names of the first three: "Joseb-Bassebeth, Tachkemonite the chief of the captains: he was Adino the Eznite ... . And after him, Eleazar the son of Dodo, the son of an Ahohite ... and after him Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite". These are named, and then comes the three unnamed ones, noted as "the three". It seems as if those three peculiarly devoted ones are left open as to their names to direct us to the character of them all. They seem to give character to the whole list.
There are said to be "thirty-seven in all". These three are peculiarly marked by devotedness; they afford David something to offer to God as a sacrifice; it is poured out as a libation.
C.A.M. There is instruction in that these men are called "the three"; it is mentioned three times. They acted together.
J.T. Love prompted them to go down to the cave of Adullam to David and then to gratify his desire for a drink of the water of Bethlehem. Such collective action could only come about through love for Christ.
C.A.M. It was so especially in connection with the setting out and maintenance of the testimony at the beginning of Christianity.
J.T. It was there in the twelve. Peter, James and John are frequently associated together.
A.N.W. The three mighties must have been very unified to have carried the thing out.
{265}
J.T. It was a very dangerous undertaking and required that they should be together.
A.B.P. There is a suggestion of this character of devotedness in @Matthew 18:19, 20. The "two or three" gathered together to the Lord's name would be together in heart.
J.T. That is good. "Two are better than one ... and a threefold cord is not quickly broken", @Ecclesiastes 4:9,12.
W.R. Why did David want a drink of this well of Bethlehem?
J.T. The account of it says that three of the thirty chiefs went down and came to David at the harvest time to the cave of Adullam. We are to bear in mind it is in the time of Christ's rejection, "when the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim ... . And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate! And the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate, and took it, and brought it to David". It is not that he asked them to do it, it is their discernment of his wish. They heard what he longed for. There must have been something in David's mind that they understood; for us it is a question of what would be in the Lord's mind in such circumstances. 'Bethlehem' means what it is among the saints that He would have, and in what sacrifice was it secured! You feel that it must have been Paul that discerned what the Lord really longed for. Much had preceded this; it was in the midst of a great display of power on the part of the Philistines; they had a garrison there. The devil was preventing the Lord from getting something that He sought.
G.M. Is that why it is called the Lord's supper? It is what He desires.
{266}
J.T. The Lord comes in in relation to it, but the Lord's supper is for us. It is a dominical thing, it implies His rule. But through it He gets something, through it He reaches our hearts.
Rem. The position at Jerusalem was not affording the Lord His true place.
J.T. It was not. The ministry enters into this; it is what the Lord would have and what the enemy would prevent Him from having. So that Paul speaks to the Colossians of combating earnestly, and in Ephesians too it is a combat. There is strong opposition.
C.A.M. The epistles of Paul in that way can be put together. The conflicts of those epistles and the drink offering in Philippians perhaps confirm this thought that it is Paul really that enters into the desires of the Lord in this special way.
J.T. The whole tenor of the scriptures in the New Testament would point to Paul as one who went to the full length of conflict and suffering to obtain what the Lord wanted. Here it is refreshment, what He would drink. Drink points to satisfaction. It is something that would satisfy. "Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it",
(@Ephesians 5:25). It was Paul's particular ministry; it was not simply a commission. There was in him a heart affording service like that, a heart that knew what the Lord would have.
W.B-w. Do you think that Shammah, in verse 11, would fit in with the early part of the Acts where the testimony was defended?
J.T. With the first of the mighty men, Joseb-Bassebeth, it is a question of the number of persons slain, eight hundred according to Samuel, but only three hundred according to Chronicles. The second mighty, Eleazar, is the man wielding his sword with such force and in such a protracted way that he arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary and
{267}
his hand clave to the sword. There would be complete identification of the ministry with the sword; the sword of the Spirit is the word of God.
W.B-w. It would work out in Peter and Stephen and others in the Acts.
J.T. The word of God in various forms is greatly pronounced throughout the early part of the Acts; the apostles say they will give themselves "to the ministry of the word".
Then the third of the mighties is Shammah. It says "the Philistines were gathered into a troop, and there was there a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people had fled before the Philistines; and he stood in the midst of the plot and delivered it, and smote the Philistines, and Jehovah wrought a great deliverance". The ministry is thus presented typically in a threefold way: first, the number of persons slain; second, how the word became, as it were, part of the minister; and third, the plot of lentils, something that was *growing*. We are told that the word of the Lord grew and spread itself; @Acts 12:24. It is an important thing to defend that. Then the three at Bethlehem represent a unified state in discernment of what the Lord longed for. We get this in Paul's ministry; not that you do not get the same kind of devotedness in others, but it is the intelligence and unity of it that is emphasised here. They secured what David wanted and brought it to him and it became an offering.
Rem. After David's longing desire was met he did not drink the water.
J.T. It became something to offer; "he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah. And he said, Be it far from me, Jehovah, that I should do this thing! is it not the blood of the men that went at the risk of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it". So that we are on a high level here;
{268}
typically it is a holy, co-ordinated, spiritual matter as marking the reign of David.
W.B-w. The point is to reach that high level in Paul's ministry.
J.T. Yes. It is a question at Bethlehem of *breaking through*. It is not so much an ordered battle -- it is not said that they killed anybody -- it is just that they went and got what David wished to have.
A.R. Would the pouring out suggest the drink-offering?
J.T. It became a drink-offering for God.
A.R. The recovery of the truth of the assembly in our day is not only affording satisfaction to Christ but is providing something for God Himself.
J.T. Quite so.
A.P.T. Does Paul get the thought as to the longings of the heart of Christ from Christ Himself inasmuch as even the Lord's supper is delivered to him?
J.T. You can see he was in very close touch with the Lord. The Lord says to him, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?" and Paul says, "Who art thou, Lord? And he said, *I* am Jesus, whom *thou* persecutest", @Acts 9:4,5. He tells us later that the Lord had said he should testify "both of what thou hast seen, and of what I shall appear to thee in", @Acts 26:16. So that he was very near to the Lord. He says in another place, "The Lord said to me";(@Acts 22:10) and again, we are told, "the Lord stood by him", @Acts 23:11. It would seem that he was in very close intimacy with the Lord.
F.S.C. Would Paul's sufferings amount to his laying down his life, or would they be governmental?
J.T. It was *given* to him to suffer for the Lord. The Lord had said He would show him how great things he must suffer for Him. One of the things which marked his ministry was suffering. Of course
{269}
there must have been governmental sufferings in his going up to Jerusalem, but he makes it plain that he was filling out the sufferings of Christ for *His body's sake which is the assembly*. Of no one else is this said. Paul was animated by the love of Christ.
C.A.M. It is like the breaking through here.
J.T. Quite so. Paul did break through, overcoming immense odds against himself.
G.M. These mighty men must have had a great place with David.
J.T. It is comforting that Samuel gives the account almost at the close of David's life, after his last words are spoken. That is the effect of the lesson, that we might have part in the kind of devotedness that was so marked at the beginning.
Ques. Would John suggest this?
J.T. He runs on to the end; it is that sort of thing. You see how John in Revelation stands out singly. What a man he is! He is seen there as taken up by the Lord. The Lord says of him, "and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw", @Revelation 1:1, 2. He was in Patmos for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. He must have been very near to the Lord as alone in Patmos. "I became in Spirit on the Lord's day", he says (@Revelation 1:10). He makes more in his gospel of the first day of the week than any of the other evangelists do. The Lord says of him to Peter, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?" (@John 21:22). The spirit of John coming down to us is what would produce something of loyalty to Christ in us; he is the brother of the saints when the assembly has failed. The book of Revelation contemplates the failure of the assembly; the first company addressed had left her first love. John is in that setting of things.
{270}
G.M. It speaks in Revelation of the overcomer without mentioning any special names.
J.T. Quite so. John makes a great deal of the overcomer. The Lord speaking through him says, "I also overcame". It really does work out in that way, overcomers breaking through great difficulties. The overcomer in Philadelphia is singled out for great honour.
A.N.W. Brotherly love must have marked these three men.
J.T. That is good. John's line would be to bring that about and would encourage us to move together in service. There is not a great deal of this amongst us.
W.B-w. What would the well of Bethlehem in the gate suggest?
J.T. It must be the idea of administration, and this comes to us in John's ministry. In spite of the breakdown the administration goes on.
F.S.C. Would the keeping of the Lord's name be like this water?
J.T. Quite so. It is remarkable that John in Revelation brings in David. We have been speaking of it lately, the use of David's name in remnant times. The prophets too speak much of him. It is a question of spiritual *quality*. The Lord says He has the key of David (@Revelation 3:7), and that "I am the root and offspring of David", @Revelation 22:16. These three men are intended to convey to us the quality of the dispensation as seen in the mighties, especially the three who broke through to secure the water for David.
Ques. Is there any significance in the fact that the Philistines are mentioned again and again as a people these men had to do with?
J.T. It is remarkable. They are the kind of people we have to do with now. They are on the same outward ground as ourselves. They are able to investigate the Scriptures in the original and look
{271}
into the whole outward history of the testimony of God. You cannot tell them anything and yet they are the line of the flesh -- uncircumcised. That is the sort of thing that has to be contended with. I suppose the Jews were the Philistines at the beginning. We have to do with the Jews but under the name of Christians: "Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that *I* have loved thee", @Revelation 3:9. It was religionists at the beginning as regards the Jews, and now it is religionists again.
W.B-w. There was a garrison blocking the way to this well; they were hindering the flow of the water in the well. The enemy attempts to do this in our localities.
J.T. The gate of Bethlehem would suggest the administration of the Spirit which is typified in the water. It is what marked the beginning of things and it has come out now at the end.
C.A.M. The Philistines of our time claim priority rights over the Lord's interests.
J.T. Yes. Take any of the great religious books of today, you hardly ever find an allusion to the great work of God through Mr. Darby. They would not give him any status at all. They assume to be in possession of the whole matter and those who rely on the Spirit are ignored.
C.A.M. The announcement of the coming in of Christ was to the shepherds. They had no official status.
A.P.T. Is the Lord getting this drink now in localities where the truth of the assembly is understood?
J.T. That is what seems to be in His mind, the place He has given His supper these many years back and the order of the assembly service. And if
{272}
He gets something He, as it were, pours it out; He has God in His mind, the Father. What He gets He secures in the midst of the assembly, but all that is through the saints. And Paul corresponds with David in that sense, as to quality and refinement spiritually, answering to what the Lord has in His mind. You understand what the will of the Lord is.
Rem. Paul prescribed the way the saints ought to do things in the assembly.
J.T. The great point is the order and the directions. He had given them some; he had written some; and he said he would give them more. In writing to the Corinthians Paul says they were not behind in any gift, but they were in danger of being corrupted. Something had damaged the thing that the Lord was seeking.
Rem. "For the arms of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful according to God to the overthrow of strongholds", @2 Corinthians 10:4.
J.T. How thoroughly Paul broke through! What sufferings he endured! But the Lord delivered him out of them all. He went through.
A.R. How do you understand (@Colossians 1:24): "Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind"?
J.T. I think the body should not be lacking. The measure should be filled up in correspondence with Christ. There were those in Colosse who were behind; they were not filling out their measure, and Paul was doing it.
C.A.M. Paul was not going to be behind and he would be exemplary in that way.
J.T. Quite so. His coming in late might be regarded as if he had not suffered so much as the twelve. But this scripture says, "Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly", @Colossians 1:24. Although he came in late,
{273}
he was not behind in sufferings. Indeed he had in mind the full complement of Christ's sufferings.
Rem. The Lord has left some behind for us to fill in.
J.T. It would be the sufferings of Christ as brought out in the assembly; it is His counterpart.
A.B.P. Was Demas one who was not taking on the sufferings? Paul says, "for Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age", @2 Timothy 4:10.
J.T. Quite so. The constant tendency is to avoid sufferings. So he says to the Philippians, a very spiritual people, that it was given to them to suffer for Christ; and to Timothy, "Take thy share in suffering", @2 Timothy 2:3. There is a share attaching to us.
Rem. David had completed his part here in the matter of suffering, and these men were now doing something for him.
J.T. Yes. He did not ask them to do it; but he let them hear his desire and they took it on. I think it is on a high level. Paul is taking it on too. It is for His body's sake, in order that the assembly should be entirely in accord with Christ. Think of the immensity of his share in suffering! He tells us about it in 2 Corinthians. He gives a list there, but that is only a part; that was comparatively early in his ministry.
Rem. So that we are to lay down our lives.
C.A.M. Would it be right to say that suffering will come to an end unless we come under the love of Christ for His assembly?
J.T. Quite so. You can see throughout Paul's whole life that that is what was affecting him.
A.R. "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready", @Revelation 19:7.
J.T. She is the Lamb's wife. The Lamb is the sufferer; she corresponds with Him.
F.S.C. Would the Lord's sufferings be physical or spiritual?
{274}
J.T. Both. Look at what He encountered from the Jews! Look at what the apostle encountered from them! They made the physical sufferings as severe as they could; but the mental or spiritual suffering was there all the time; the Lord had no respite from it, the whole air was charged with it.
A.B.P. "O unbelieving and perverted generation ... how long shall I bear with you?", @Matthew 17:17. That indicates the sufferings He had.
Rem. "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?" (@Acts 9:4).
J.T. There it was. He endured the same suffering from Saul. It is that sort of thing today. It may not be so much physical, but it is there, the whole air is charged with it. You feel it tonight outside, the air is charged with opposition.
C.A.M. Epaphras combated in prayer that the Colossians might stand complete in all the will of God; @Colossians 4:12. The subtle character of Satan's opposition comes out in this epistle.
J.T. So that you have Paul combating for them in the beginning of chapter 2: "I would have you know what combat I have for you, and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in flesh" (that would be for us too); "to the end that their hearts may be encouraged, being united together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God; in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge". (@Colossians 2:1 - 3) He has the assembly in mind, and he goes on to show the kind of thing the devil would bring in to prevent what he was so set for according to this epistle: "but the body is of Christ. Let no one fraudulently deprive you of your prize, doing his own will in humility and worship of angels, entering into things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh, and not holding fast the head, from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands,
{275}
increases with the increase of God", @Colossians 2:17 - 19. That is the sort of thing that the enemy is using -- this ceremonialism as well as philosophy to rob Christ of the assembly in character. If we are to get to it, we have to break through all this. And if we have not done it, we had better do it.
J.T.Jr. The first mighty in verse 8 was of the children of Pharez, according to Chronicles. Pharez broke through, according to @Genesis 38:29.
A.P.T. The desire to be with the brethren all the time would necessitate that we break through natural claims.
J.T. Yes. Every meeting in a spiritual sense is aiming at this thing. The Lord is attaining what He will have and each one of us should be there.
C.A.M. We should be each in his place and alert in mind and heart.
J.T. Just so. You want to get this one thought, that the Lord is seeking something in the assembly, and that every Christian is essential to it.
W.B-w. Pharez had a twin brother.
J.T. Those twins were spiritual. I do not know that Thomas and his brother were typically spiritual twins. It must have been because he had a natural link that Thomas was absent when the Lord came amongst His own.
A.B.P. He did not break through.
W.B-w. Referring to Benaiah, it says he smote two lions of Moab, and he smote a lion in a pit on a snowy day; he also smote an Egyptian. The Egyptians represent another element.
J.T. They do. They represent people who are nearer to us. The word 'lions' would be merely a symbol of men. The Egyptian would be a man who lived in the flesh; he would make too much of the creatures of God.
A.R. Benaiah would be a brother that would be
{276}
at the meetings under adverse circumstances. He smote a lion in a pit on a snowy day.
J.T. He had a good excuse for not taking on the conflict. It was on a snowy day. What can he do now? He faced the snow and triumphed. Think of going over Jordan too, when it overflowed its banks! What great exploits these are! They come down the line in the history of the assembly to our dispensation. Then the account finishes with Uriah the Hittite.
C.A.M. The Spirit of God seems to have great delight in bringing his name into the genealogy in @Matthew 1: "And David begat Solomon, of her that had been the wife of Urias", @Matthew 1:6. That name adorns the genealogy. He seems to make an extra one. He is the thirty-seventh.
J.T. It is an indivisible number. Thirty-six could be divided, but not thirty seven.
Rem. These men were by themselves, according to verse 23. It says of Benaiah, "He was honoured above the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three". They stand by themselves.
T.A. Do you not think it is morally right that Uriah should be brought in?
J.T. Quite so. David may have made this list out; but he did not write this book. The Spirit of God used somebody else to write this book. According to Chronicles there were a good many more names. Uriah was under great pressure of temptation. He overcame temptation, holding to right principles.
W.B-w. Why is he mentioned last?
J.T. I think it is to fix our minds on him.
CHAPTER 24
J.T. The numbering of the mighty men in chapter 23 would be, as it were, by the Spirit of God. God writes up His people, as is said in @Psalm 87:6: "Jehovah will count, when he inscribeth
{277}
the peoples". There is a great deal made of God's counting in Scripture; it seems to be an exigency of love that the saints should be countable. Our dispensation began with a divine numbering. It is another thing to count the saints so that we might be able to speak of the size of our meetings or the number of meetings in a country or in the world. The almanacs give us the statistics of the denominations in Christendom, but that is just relying on mere numbers or human strength. David, according to the facts of this chapter as compared with those in @1 Chronicles 21, may have had political motives in the counting. "And the king said to Joab the captain of the host"; that would be military. 1 Chronicles says, "And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people", @1 Chronicles 21:2. It seems as if the military thought is dominant in this chapter in the reference to "the captain of the host", in verse 2 and "the captains of the army", in verse 4. The princes are mentioned in Chronicles. Here it would be what David could reckon on in a military way, so we have the number given here, and, although variant, in Chronicles too: "eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men", verse 9. The motive must have been to establish the military strength of the nation.
A.P.T. Is there any suggestion of the state of the people in it?
J.T. That is what is in God's mind. The chapter says, "And again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against *Israel"*, not David, but Israel.
R.W.S. How do you view Jehovah moving David in Samuel and Satan moving him in Chronicles?
J.T. It would be the same thought, only that according to Chronicles God used Satan. God uses Satan; after all he is only a servant. He moved Jehovah to afflict Job, and Jehovah did it knowing
{278}
what was in Job; the defeat of the devil was intended. It would look as if 2 Samuel is typical of our own dispensation and God is bringing out what is in the dispensation, whether for good or evil. He is bringing out the fact that what is of Himself survives in spite of the evil. He knew what was in David. I think it is a great point in the history of our dispensation that there is that which can recover itself; of course, under God and by His help. Otherwise all would have been lost centuries ago. There is latent power, because of the Spirit's presence here, for recovery. I think this chapter is to bring that out, and it is in accord with all we have had. The power of recovery is seen in David. We are told here that his heart smote him; whereas in Chronicles it is said that God was displeased on account of this thing and He smote Israel. But David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. There is latent power in Christianity, as there was in David, for recovery without God's interfering. It is a tribute to the presence of the Spirit and the work of God; otherwise all would have been lost.
W.R. Would David be like one who has a new heart and a new spirit in him?
J.T. That is what the work of God implies. New birth implies the elements of cleansing introduced into man and along with that a new heart and a new spirit. That is what alone God can rely on. But God had *already* wrought in David, and this chapter shows that the work in him was revived; he judged himself for his sin. "David said to Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in what I have done ... . I have done very foolishly".
A.R. David recovers himself speedily here, whereas the government of God deals with seventy thousand men. God knew the underlying state of the people.
J.T. That is good. The low state was universal in the nation: "from Dan even to Beer-sheba".
{279}
A.F.M. Joab is not a man of faith but he seems to have an insight as to the actual conditions which prompted this movement.
J.T. Yes. He was superficial; but he could see that David was wrong, that is all you can say. He was obviously wrong; it did not require the cleansing element in mind and a new heart and spirit to discern that such a course was wrong. Men naturally are able to judge a thing like this; @Romans 2:3 says "and thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest those that do such things, and practisest them thyself, that *thou* shalt escape the judgment of God?" He is not capable of discerning all things, but "the spiritual discerns all things". (@1 Corinthians 2:15) The natural man, however, is capable of judging mere political things.
Rem. Earlier in bringing up the ark, David inquired of the captains of the host. It would seem as if it was a similar movement here. He again spoke to Joab instead of to the priests; the priesthood was not taken into the matter.
J.T. Just so, it was military. The power of recovery is not in Joab; he is a clever man but without conscience. The element of recovery in the believer is a, matter of great importance. But to have it is, of course, no reason for anyone to sin. Joab sinned as grievously as David, but there was no power of recovery in him, whereas there was in David, as is manifest here.
Rem. This matter extended over a protracted period: nine months and twenty days. There was time for David to reconsider it. Dispensationally, people have had time to reconsider the failure that has come in in Christendom.
J.T. The work of God in us leads to discernment as to sin. David had more than nine months to think it over, but it was *after* the people were numbered that his heart smote him. When the sin is completed the renewed heart operates; for it was in the mind
{280}
of God that it should go to the limit. Joab was not dealing with records but God was and the divine records are accurate and thus give a true account of matters. David was slow in judging himself and hence the sin was consummated. On this principle sin becomes "exceeding sinful" and this justifies God in dealing severely with it. In the wisdom of God, He judges this to be necessary at times.
J.T.Jr. Do you think that a spiritual element such as is in David might be allowed to go a certain distance by God to expose a latent condition?
J.T. Yes. It is remarkable that he should be allowed to sin so grievously. In other instances in the book we can see there are a number of weaknesses in David, unaccountably so; but throughout you observe the ability to recover himself. The only hope for us is in our ability to recover ourselves, because sin is so subtle. It comes up amongst us in some form or another; something happens to bring it to light. If there is not power of recovery there will be complete collapse. Right up to the end there is power of recovery in the leading man and the book closes with worship to God at the altar.
A.N.W. We should really take great heed to the smiting of the heart; otherwise discipline will be for naught, the heart will get harder.
J.T. Quite so. Joab's words must have pricked David's heart during the nine months, but his will was strongly in the matter. His word prevailed over Joab and over the captains. He had nobody on his side. He was a man of tender conscience, but it shows how will, when allowed unjudged, overwhelms everything.
A.R. In spite of the failure that might appear on the surface, and the low state, God brings out from this failure the great spoil seen in 2 Chronicles. David begins to build here. He built an altar to Jehovah and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings.
{281}
The site is that on which Solomon built the house of God.
J.T. Quite so. David says, "This *is* the house of Jehovah Elohim" (@1 Chronicles 22:1) before a stone was put there. This book finishes with David's recovery -- his altar and his offerings. It is a great moral triumph. The song in chapter 22 is also a moral and spiritual triumph, it is a man able to go over the ground and see what God has been to him during all his life. Chapter 23 is the record of his last words; that is a triumph too. It is the abstract view of David; God would bring out the very best. Then we have the thirty-seven mighty men, another triumph. And now this great failure coming after all that! Is there going to be a cleavage? No! There is power of recovery. That is in type, practical Christianity: the power of recovery. We noticed that @Ezekiel 36 is constructive, and indeed the whole book is constructive right up to chapter 36. The basis is in new birth; there is something that God can trust at bottom. So in 2 Samuel we see that in spite of all the failures of David throughout the book there is recovery; there is in the latent moral element in David the power of overcoming the worst evil. "And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people". There are thirteen hundred thousand men! A large army like this would naturally make David feel important and independent; but instead his heart smote him. We should always maintain a good conscience. Paul says, "I have walked in all good conscience with God unto this day", @Acts 23:1. That is the secret. We may fail or turn aside or be influenced -- not that there is any licence to sin -- but the work of God in the believer overcomes all. It is marked by self-judgment.
Rem. So that when Paul stood and witnessed the martyring of Stephen God saw him; afterwards though witnessing that, he became more wicked
{282}
than ever, but in that wicked state God arrested him.
J.T. There was something in the man all the time, hidden or restrained. His will was active, but his conscience was active too. It says of him, "Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into the houses one after another, and dragging off both men and women delivered them up to prison", @Acts 8:3. You could hardly conceive of a man more wicked than he. He was "breathing" it out.
A.P.T. Is not the man that owns his sin the man God accepts?
J.T. Quite so. How do I recover myself? Peter went out and wept bitterly. That was not the completion of the recovery; the latter comes in @John 21; but note, he wept *bitterly*.
A.P.T. I was thinking in regard to Saul the king that his error was disobedience, whereas in David's case it was adultery and murder; and now this sin in numbering the people. God did not use Saul because he did not judge his sin, but David judged and confessed his guilt. Is there not something for us in that now? We are all failing, but if we judge ourselves and own our sins God will help us. Some do not do it, and God is *not* helping them.
J.T. The power of preservation lies in maintaining a good conscience; this will lead to the confession of sin if it takes place. We are told that David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people, and then he tells Jehovah that he is the guilty one; he said he was the one that had sinned. "And David spoke to Jehovah when he saw the angel that smote among the people, and said, Behold, it is I that have sinned, and it is I that have committed iniquity; but these sheep, what have they done?" True shepherd that he was at heart, he says, "Behold, it is I that have sinned". That is the secret of recovery and coming back to the place of service.
Rem. This first confession seems to have been
{283}
made during the night, according to verse 11. It says, "And when David arose in the morning", as if it was a night matter with him.
J.T. The night season would afford time for reflection. Things are brought to bear upon us forcibly by God during times of wakefulness.
A.N.W. Should we look for the prophetic word to come after confession is made?
J.T. That is the next thing. Gad is called *David's* seer here.
E.S. I was wondering why Gad's message was so severe after David had admitted his sin in verse 10.
J.T. Gad is called David's seer; he is really God's seer. Why should he be David's? I think the thought is that David always wished to face the truth. "He that practices the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God", @John 3:2. David is like a brother that *would* confess his sin. Gad would be able to tell him the truth; whereas it is said of Ahab, with whom Jehoshaphat allied himself to go to war, that he hated Micah, the reason being that Micah always convicted him in telling him the truth. But there is no such thing with David. Gad is *his* seer; this failing man is maintaining a man near him that will tell him the truth. That attitude is our safeguard. He is not God's seer here, he is David's; David is keeping him on.
A.N.W. After Paul's rebuke of Peter, Peter says, "our beloved brother Paul".
J.T. I am sure he would often say, That was a faithful word of Paul's. He would probably tell his young converts about Paul. When David arose his heart had already smitten him. There had doubtless been some exercise through the night, and he said to Jehovah, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done; and now, I beseech thee, Jehovah, put away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very
{284}
foolishly". That may have been during the night. He tells us in the Psalms about "night seasons". He must have gone through things seriously. Here the word is, "David arose"; there must have been something in David's arising that pleased God. "And when David arose in the morning, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, go and say to David, Thus saith Jehovah: I impose on thee three things; choose one of them that I may do it unto thee. And Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine adversaries while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days¬ pestilence in thy land? Now be aware and consider what word I shall bring again to him that sent me". Our brother asked why this penalty should be inflicted. I think it is the people that are in mind. The whole matter had relation to the state of the people. So that while sin may be confessed in the leading individual. God has deeper things to deal with in others.
E.S. Do we have to suffer governmentally for what, in this sense, we have part in?
J.T. Quite so. We might have to suffer even on account of the state of others. If sin exists among the saints in a locality we all have to share in the consequences.
Rem. Do you think that typically this is an assembly matter? David confesses his sin; that is a great help in assembly matters.
J.T. Yes. It becomes very difficult when there is no confession, no voluntary confession; when the sin is confessed only when it is discovered. But here David evidently discovered it first. God did not have to convict him.
Ques. Would he be already eating the sin-offering?
J.T. I think so; especially as seen in verse 17:
{285}
"Behold, it is I that have sinned, and it is I that have committed iniquity; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be on me, and on my father's house!" He is not only eating the sin-offering, but he is ready to be penalised, to suffer for his own sin.
R.W.S. No doubt Nathan's word to him in the matter of Bath-sheba would be recalled. Now he gets the prophetic word from Gad; he is more sensitive to this condition.
J.T. That seems to be the case: the place the prophets have is indicated. The question is, Have we any prophets? Is the prophetic spirit tolerated? Is my conscience ready for anything that may come?
It seems to be the element that runs right through in Samuel, collateral with the power of recovery. Have we anyone in our meeting that has prophetic power? You want the truth. "Faithful are the wounds of a friend". (@Proverbs 27:6) You want to have someone to tell you if you sin. If there is a brother that tells me truth in grace he will be a help to me if I get into a bad state. Gad is called a seer, that is, a man that *sees* things. It is not so dignified a title as prophet. But by seeing things and conveying the mind of God, he would become more and more dignified. The first book of Samuel brings that out. Gad is a prophet, but he used to be called a seer; the one now called 'prophet', it is said, used to be called a seer. The idea of a prophet is progressive.
Prophecy is a gift. The title 'seer' simply denotes the power you have; it is not the commission, but the power you have -- you have eyes to see. I suppose David knew Gad's ability. The first time we meet with Gad is in @1 Samuel 22:5: "And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah". I think that is his first service. He was with David from the very beginning of his rejection. David must have known
{286}
what a faithful man he was; David regarded him as *his* seer.
Rem. Judah was willing to take the full blame in connection with Joseph.
J.T. Quite so. The point here is that David was the one that sinned; although Judah had sinned too, but he had not sinned so grievously as the others. But here David is directly responsible for this act of sin. There were three things offered David. He chooses one. He would fall into the hands of the Lord. He sees that the judgment must go through and he would not have it fall on the sheep; it was to bring out that God was pleased with the shepherd heart.
A.R. It was the spirit of Christ. I was wondering if there was some suggestion of the death of Christ in it? You would not have the house built except for the death of Christ.
J.T. Quite so, we have an altar and sacrifices. These are evidences of the power of recovery; there is a right spirit in the man. I suppose in @Psalm 51 his having a right spirit sustained him, that Psalm shows what he is at the roots. What he says here to Jehovah is in keeping with all that; he has already said he is a sinner, and now he uses the word 'sheep'; he is the great shepherd. Now we are coming on to the point where we get the sacrifices.
A.R. Does the threshing-floor suggest how God operated to remove the chaff?
J.T. Quite so; like the threshing-floor of Atad.
Ques. What would the fifty shekels of silver represent?
J.T. I think they would be the recognition of the rights of God. In Chronicles gold is employed in the purchase -- a relatively large amount, six hundred shekels. Evidently a larger area than that mentioned in Samuel was involved; it is designated "the place".
David is in keeping with the altar now and God
{287}
closes the matter and says, "Go up, rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite". You must have the altar.
Ques. Why does it say David's *heart* smote him rather than his *conscience* ?
J.T. The word 'conscience' is not, as far as I know, used in the Old Testament. It is the inner man that is in mind in the use of the word 'heart'. From our point of view it would be 'conscience'. The word 'conscience' is derived from the idea of subjective or conscious knowledge; through it I know things inwardly in a moral sense.
Ques. His heart would represent the feelings he had in connection with the matter.
J.T. Quite so. We are composed of spirit, soul and body. The spirit and soul are distinct. The heart is another term; it is, of course, taken from the material heart, but it refers to the very centre of the man morally. So that we sometimes have the heart taken up as including the soul and all right feelings; and as a figure of intelligence too.
Rem. "For grief according to God works repentance to salvation", @2 Corinthians 7:10. The Corinthians proved themselves clear in every way in the matter.
J.T. That shows the apostle's first letter had operated upon them. The next verse gives an account of the things that marked them: "what excusing of yourselves, but what indignation, but what fear, but what ardent desire, but what zeal, but what vengeance: in every way ye have proved yourselves to be pure in the matter". (@2 Corinthians 7:11) These are all the inward features of what an upright man is morally. Paul says, "You have proved yourselves to be pure in the matter".
Rem. Verse 15 says: "And Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the set time"; but then verse 16 says, "but Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that
{288}
destroyed among the people, It is enough: withdraw now thine hand". He cut it short.
J.T. He stopped at Jerusalem. That was a delightful thing in His eye. Typically it was the saints viewed in their best features. Jerusalem was as the apple of His eye; it involved Mount Zion which He loved.
Ques. The verse ends with the threshing-floor of Araunah. What does it represent in this setting?
J.T. "And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite". This is the position; God has reached His purpose in this judgment. David later calls this the house of Jehovah-Elohim -- before there was a stone put there. The angel was in that position. God reaches a purpose in judgment or whatever He is doing and all His operations bear out from that.
Ques. Does it have anything to do with Araunah?
J.T. It has to do with God's sovereignty. He was a Jebusite, a man under a curse. It is God's way to show He is sovereign in what He does. There are instances of several Canaanites coming into blessing.
God had here reached the foundation of the house, including the ground where the house was to be built.
A.R. In spite of the severity of the judgment of God, He has an end in mind. Here He has His house in mind.
J.T. Quite so. It says in @2 Timothy 2:19, "The firm foundation of God stands". That is the point reached; God operates from that. Ezra says they set up the altar on its base because of the enemies, @Ezra 3: 3. God had reached that point and what can the enemy do? It is for us to understand the ground God has taken up. He can operate *there* .
J.T.Jr. Is that why God is so concerned about the state of the people? He has great things in His mind and He would have us in accord with them. The previous chapter gives us the mighties, which
{289}
represent, I suppose, the great work of God in persons outwardly and inwardly; but now the people do not seem to be in accord with it. Hence we have His governmental dealings.
J.T. God needs the people. What can the king do without the people? "In the multitude of people is the king's glory", @Proverbs 14:28. In Solomon's time "Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry", @1 Kings 4:20. In Nehemiah it is the *city*. It is all a question of what is in God's mind. So that in the recovery according to @2 Timothy 2:19 it is "the firm foundation of God". You must have the people; not only people, but people apart from evil. "The firm foundation of God stands", you must have separated people for that; and hence it is "those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (@2 Timothy 2:22).
A.R. What you are saying helps us in regard of crises that arise. On the surface a certain judgment may appear very severe; but when it is over, you can see that God has had some special thing in His mind in the operation. He is really making room for His house, as seen in our chapter.
J.T. Quite so. David was thinking of numbers. If God were on those lines He would not slay the seventy thousand. He is showing that He wants only a certain class of people. "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", @2 Timothy 2:19. Those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart are the people God seeks, and whom the saints also should seek, following righteousness with them.
Rem. David has to come back to first principles as to smallness and quality and right judgment. There is gain through assembly discipline.
J.T. One has noticed that after a care meeting in which we have had to go into administrative matters, the Lord usually gives us a good first day of the week.
{290}
And I have noticed that after a discipline meeting the Lord usually encourages the brethren. That does not mean that we should not feel keenly the loss of our brethren; but God is known in the judgment which He executes, and if people are going on in self-will and will not submit to the principles of the house of God, in God's mind we are better without them. The Scriptures are full of that -- Ananias and Sapphira, for instance. We have to see what God has in His mind. There is usually an underlying condition when a sore appears on the body.
A.F.M. The end of the chapter brings out the result of all this. There is an evidence of wealth in the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
J.T. That is the one great end in mind. The book ends there and in circumstances advantageous to God's testimony: "Jehovah was propitious to the land". The previous chapter ends with Uriah the Hittite of the thirty-seven mighty men of David. Here it is an altar and sacrifices: burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. David is morally on a high level. A serious sin had been adjusted through burnt-offerings and peace-offerings offered on an altar which David built to Jehovah by prophetic direction. All was thus again on a sure foundation: "And Jehovah was propitious to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel". One important point to see here is the latent power of recovery, through the divine work in the leading man, and this extending to the whole nation.

GOD'S INDIRECT AND DIRECT OPERATIONS
@Genesis 20:6,7,17; @Daniel 4:28 - 37; @Matthew 27:19
I have in mind to speak about what God is doing indirectly, and what He is doing directly. I place what He is doing indirectly first, because it deals mainly with what is providential. The direct actions or operations of God have to do with His people with a view to their present and eternal welfare.
What is providential relates to the present only, and those employed in it are not necessarily Christians. They may be antichristian or heathen, for God does His own will, using beings of His creation at His will. But I wish to show, dear brethren, that in dealing with such He is not indifferent to their welfare; and that in using men or in dealing with men on providential lines, He seizes opportunities to deal with them directly. Thus the two services of God are linked together, acting and reacting on each other, and He would draw those who are His, who are the subjects of His direct service, into what He is doing. We should not fail to seize opportunities and we should not fail to represent Him, as drawn of necessity into the providential ways of God. In order to encourage us, He introduces in the Holy Writings persons who are not His people, and yet with whom He had direct transactions, and to whom He speaks of those whom He regards as His people. I believe He has peculiar pleasure in speaking of us to men. He has His own way of doing it. He spoke to Satan about one of His children, saying, "Hast thou considered my servant Job?" (@Job. 1:8).
I have no doubt that the different families whom the Father names cover all the eras of which Scripture speaks, and of these eras the patriarchal is one of the most distinguished. Abraham is outstanding in the
{292}
patriarchal period. God speaks to Abimelech about him. I do not suppose there was a person on earth at that time more interesting to God than Abraham. He made the earth attractive to God, you might say; he was an adornment to it. God made him heir of the world, and He made an excellent choice. Abraham has adorned the scene already and has lived ever since to God. God seems peculiarly pleased to call attention to him right through from his beginnings; the psalmist later is used to call attention to him without naming him, speaking of God's people (including Abraham), "when they were a few in number, of small account", @Psalm 105:12. Abraham represents the heavenly man and the heavenly dispensation.
There are the generations of ten personages spoken of in Genesis, but Abraham is not one of them, which is a very remarkable thing. That is because the generations spoken of are of the earth, whereas Abraham is the heavenly man. He is outside of dispensations and generations, but he had his part in them down here in earthly things and was characteristic of the moment as a heavenly man; that is, he was "of small account". The psalm goes on, "And they went from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people", @Psalm 105:13. Thus the psalmist speaks of these early patriarchs. At that time God reproved kings for their sakes, and the psalmist, whoever he was, fully entering into all that too, says, quoting Jehovah, "Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm", @Psalm 105:15. It is the patriarchal era and Abraham is outstanding in the era, the heavenly man of no account, "Abram the Hebrew", according to @Genesis 14:13. But he was such as made the earth attractive to God for the moment. God appeared to him and said in effect, Abraham, you and I are speaking together. I am certain that God enjoyed the conversation more than Abraham did.
{293}
The word. 'covenant' is written throughout chapter 17 of Genesis; God says to him, in effect, You and I are bound up for ever by indissoluble links. This would all be to release the heart of His child, as I might call him, so that he shall be in full liberty with God.
Then in the next chapter God comes to see him in company. Abimelech also came to see him in company, but it was with his military man; God did not come with a military man, He came as One of three men to visit Abraham. What a time He had there, waiting under the tree for Abraham to provide a meal for Him! I speak thus, dear brethren, so that interest may be aroused in this matter, that God is going to have a word with Abimelech about Abraham, and He is intending to evangelise Abimelech. So that if I am at all called into such circumstances, where I have to do with the rulers of this world, God would be saying to me as I am praying about it, Do not forget that you are in relation with Me, and when you come in contact with those men, do not forget you are My representative; and do not forget that I have a means of talking to those men too, and talking to them about you. But then, you are not the sole object of the conversation; these men are men, however exalted they seem to be, and God would say to you, I have rights in those men, I have rights in you, of course, I have told you so, I have My links with you, indissoluble links; but I have rights in those men you have to deal with. They do not know that, and they are not at all representative of Me in character; they may be legal, like Pilate, but not at all representative of Me in character. You are to be that; I do not expect them to be that, but I expect you to be that.
In chapter 20, God expected a good deal of Abraham. He talked with him and made a covenant with him according to chapter 17, and according to chapter 18
{294}
He came to see him in company and received a meal at his hands. Now we are in chapter 20, and God has in mind that Abraham *is* something. We are not told all that Jehovah said to Abimelech; according to the psalm He reproved kings, and no doubt Abimelech was one of them. Pharaoh was another, the great monarch of that day. God visited his country and reproved him. Now the time has come for Abraham to know and to be drawn into the indirect affairs of God with kings. In the last twenty-five years the people of God have come as never before into relation and touch with kings. The word 'king' denotes a person in supreme authority over all that is under him. It is a system; and God is saying to us in this scripture that He has access to these men and knows how to speak to them, and that He speaks to them of His people, "mine anointed ones", "my prophets". What comes out here is a delicate situation. God is occupied with the inner movements of Abimelech, and He tells Abimelech that He knows the integrity of his heart. Let us not despise this man. Think of the Creator of the universe speaking to a Philistine king! God says, "thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart". Whatever it be in them that is good, God notes it and perhaps tells them about it, but in doing that He is telling them about His own people. Now He says, in effect, to Abimelech, This man is an important man, though so young a man. I know him; he is a prophet. What feelings the king had I cannot say, but you may be sure God made him feel He was interested in him too.
Abimelech was a man in whom God had rights. God is the Preserver of all men, and He had to do with Abimelech in regard to that.
Coming now to the gospel, we read in 1 Timothy, "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be rendered in its own times", @1 Timothy 2:5,6.
{295}
Are these times my times? Do I live in the period of "its own times"? Every one of us, from the youngest to the oldest, should greatly value these gospel times. Well, God is dealing with these men, He is using them in His governmental ways, whether they be Christian, heathen, Mohammedan or apostate. Think of being classed with Buddhists, Mohammedans, Hindoos, Chinese and other such nations that God is using governmentally, using them in His government in an indirect way! He may even use the devil, but God would never put it into my heart to speak the gospel to *him*. If it be antichrist, the beast, the man of sin, well, if I knew it were he, I should not preach Christ to him. What is stated about him is that he goes to perdition, and I do not want to hinder him. I cannot, of course, but if he goes to perdition, he goes, and he goes in a short time too. But I am dealing with ordinary men; God says, I have an interest in those men, and I have been telling them that you are such and such.
It is remarkable the number of young men who are able to preach the gospel now. God is speaking about these young men, for they have to do with persons whom God is employing governmentally. God would say to these persons in some way, These young men can preach the gospel. That is exactly what He said in principle about Abraham. This man can prophesy, just as He would say about you, He can preach the gospel. Abraham was a gifted man; prophecy is a gift. He was a gifted man, and God would, so to speak, say, There is right in your very premises here, in your land here, a man who can prophesy. Is that not interesting to you Abimelech? God said that Abraham was a prophet; He did not say he would prophesy for Abimelech, but that he "will pray for thee". I do not know which is the more important; I think I should rather be prayed for. Abimelech had got himself into a difficult place; he had not
{296}
realised, what he was doing. He thought Abraham was just an ordinary way-faring man who had just happened into his country; but God said. You are mistaken, that man is a prophet and a priest, and he will pray for you. Not only *can* he do it, but he *will* do it. I want to be like that. God is giving us great opportunities at the present time, suffering opportunities, to be sure, but suffering is a great feature of Christianity. Christianity is outside of all dispensations, it is heavenly; the sheet came down and went up and stayed up. That is what Christianity is composed of, heavenly people down here, people like Jesus that God is not ashamed of. He says to Abimelech, That man is not what you think he is, he is a prophet, he will pray for you. That is important. Is Abraham going to deny what God has said about him? Is he going to belie it? No. The chapter tells us that Abraham prayed for Abimelech and for his house and the prayer was answered. Could one do more for Abimelech? Was there anything more important at that time than to pray for Abimelech? Abraham prayed for him. I like that part of my subject. It is divided into three parts, which is abundant, I think, for any address.
The next part is about Nebuchadnezzar, one of the most remarkable of men, a man who became himself a preacher. Before that he was a skilled persecutor of the people of God. Persecutors learn how to persecute, and he was one such, but God had to say to him. He took him up when he was an unconverted man who had no interest in God whatever; but God spoke to him in a dream and then the dream left him. Why did it leave him? In order to bring one of God's people into his presence -- Daniel. The missing link must be supplied, and by the people of God. The link between God and men is really the saints. Well, I cannot enlarge on that, only to say that the dream implied that Nebuchadnezzar had the
{297}
greatest place in the great governmental system that God set up after Israel was rejected. "Thou art this head of gold", @Daniel 2:38. He was the head of the great Gentile system that God had set up to carry on the government of this world whilst Israel was rejected. But is that all? Is this governmental matter, this war matter, all that God has in mind? What has He got for Himself in that? Nothing. It is abominable to Him. He has something more than war in mind. The newspapers really do not deal with what God has in mind in this matter at all.
We are to supply the link; He wants us to do it. The Daniels supply the link. Sometimes we say, Dare to be a Daniel. It is a time of daring and of courage. There is need for boldness in understanding the link between God and men. So Daniel established the link: "Thou art this head of gold", @Daniel 2:38. But then, he said more than that; Nebuchadnezzar, you are a wicked man, that is what he said in effect; "break off thy sins by righteousness", @Daniel 4:27. God is also saying that He is going to make something out of Nebuchadnezzar. He is not simply using him in governmental ways, providentially, God is going to establish a direct link with him, and Daniel is to be the link, to be the instrument. We are in the time in which these great gospel matters are to be announced, "the testimony to be rendered in its own times", @1 Timothy 2:6. It is a long drawn out period, God is pleased with it, and He is telling the young men today, "You are a link between Me and these men. It is a suffering time for you, but do not forget, You belong to heaven; you are in that sheet that came down from heaven, material capable of the greatest suffering; you are to be like Paul, who was shown what great things he must suffer to bear the name of Christ before kings and the sons of Israel". What are our young men going to do with that commission? And so word came from God when Nebuchadnezzar
{298}
was at the height of his glory, as full of pride as a man could be. There is a king of the children of pride (see @Job 41:34), and that king was educating Nebuchadnezzar. "Is not this great Babylon, that I have built?" he said, @Daniel 4:30. The word had gone out of his mouth, the change came, he became as an ox, ate grass as an ox in the government of God. This is God's direct dealing with him. God can make one of His own children out of him. Who are the hardest people to convert? Politicians are difficult, statesmen are not quite so difficult. Nebuchadnezzar was a statesman, he was a king, therefore not so difficult. God says, "I am going to make something out of this man by direct action". He was put out amongst the cattle for seven years, but the time came when he was converted, and it was through Daniel.
That is the point I am making for those of us who have to do with the powers of this world. (I know one thing, that greed for making money is about the worst testimony. Nothing will do more damage to Christianity at the present time than greed for money; losing our opportunities to serve God, sacrificing the precious privilege of serving God in the assembly, to make money. I only say that by the way.) Nebuchadnezzar says finally, "Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of the heavens, all whose works are truth, and his paths judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase",
(@Daniel 4:37). Did ever before a statesman come to such a point? Daniel was the instrument, the link. Daniel began in Babylon with severity, not against other people, but against himself. He learned how to fast, to deny himself, and he came before kings, before great men. That is how things work. Let us therefore, dear brethren, pray that we may not fall when we come into touch with these men, who are the agents of the indirect government of God. We are the agents of the direct government of God, greater
{299}
than any of them, and having power to speak to them with authority.
So it was with Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, and so with Daniel. It is a suffering time, we are not worthy of the name of being heavenly people, save as capable of suffering. The Lord said, "For I am come down from heaven, not that I should do *my* will, but the will of him that has sent me", @John 6:38. And again, "*I* am the living bread which has come down out of heaven ... . but the bread withal which *I* shall give is my flesh, which *I* will give for the life of the world", @John 6:51. It is on the line of suffering, but what a noble thing it is, what a privilege, as subjects of God's direct work, to be representatives of Him to the subjects of His indirect work! So that we have both together, and the agents of the indirect government of God are evangelised. Evangelists are brought before them in spite of themselves, the opportunity is given to speak a word in season, "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all", @1 Timothy 2:5, 6.
I just want to finish with a few words in regard to Pilate. The greatest representative of God, the Lord Jesus, was there before him. How honoured he was, how privileged he was too! But he was not converted. His wife was available to God, though not directly apparently, because she was asleep. How God can use people when they are asleep! He never uses them when they are asleep in the meetings, never! It is another matter when they do that. But when they are asleep legitimately, like Pilate's wife, God can use them. She says, "Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered today many things in a dream because of him", @Matthew 27:19. She was asleep, and she suffered in her sleep, not because of anything she had done, but because of Him who was before Pilate now.
{300}
She got the idea of a just person into her soul when she was asleep. You see the means by which God may address these indirect agents of His government, selecting even a man's own wife at a critical moment.
The testimony failed in Pilate, but it stands out particularly as the testimony of God directly to her husband through her. "Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man", she says, "for I have suffered today many things in a dream because of him". It was as Pilate sat down, you notice. That was the tribunal, we might say, that the Lord Jesus had to do with, and Pilate was sitting down in the official position, clothed with all the authority that Rome could accord to its representatives. He was the governor, and here was a message from his wife when he was sat down thinking of what he, a poor, weak man, was going to do in the judicial position. God says, I will give him an opportunity, I will use one who ought to have influence with him. At the opportune moment, at the critical moment, the word came from the bedroom of his wife, as I might say, saying to him, "Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man". What a message! What a messenger! What history! We shall have to wait, I suppose, for the history of this woman, but she became available to God in a dream to evangelise her husband, as it were, to save him from a crime, the darkest act ever perpetrated. He did not heed the message, but the message was sent nevertheless.
Let us not be weary in well doing. Whatever she said further to her husband I do not know, but we may be sure that when he came home she would say, Did you get my message? Yes, he would reply, but I was in the midst of judicial matters sitting in Caesar's judgment seat. He judged unrighteous judgment, he was not a righteous man; the righteous Man was before him. The Judge of all mankind shall sit upon His throne and Pilate will stand before Him,
{301}
yea, he will flee from His presence, consigned to eternal doom. He refused to listen to the evangelical word sent by his wife at a critical moment. He is a lost man, he had his opportunity.
We do not want to let these men we have to do with go by without some little testimony. You are fit for it, do not be afraid, you are quite capable of it. You can preach the gospel in your own local meeting and do it well; why not do it before these men? It is your opportunity to do it in your own way, as one who knows Christ; and with the Spirit of God in your heart you can bear direct testimony to these men who are the indirect instruments of the government of God.
{302}
JOY RESULTING FROM COMMITTAL
A Word Given At A Meeting for Ministry
@Hebrews 10:25; @Exodus 33:11; @Psalm 122:1
What has come before us already will help, I think, to make clear what is in these scriptures; that is, @Exodus 33 presents a young man remaining within the tabernacle -- as it says, "his attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from within the tent". It has been said that the evil of mixtures is met by adherence to the assembly. The assembly is the residence of holy thoughts, thoughts exclusive of what is unholy. The tabernacle represented the house -- the residence of what is of God, indeed God Himself, inclusive of the holiest, where God speaks conveying His mind. And it is for us to find our home there; as one desired, "that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire of him in his temple", @Psalm 27:4. It is our privilege to have recourse to the house; not occasionally, but in principle to be there always, as Joshua was. So that we come under these thoughts of God; full thoughts, as I said, concrete in themselves and intrinsically exclusive of admixture. Our minds are thus kept pure.
The young man Joshua departed not, we are told, from the tabernacle. It was pitched outside the camp. It was greater morally than the camp; in fact, all that sought the Lord went out of the camp unto the tabernacle. So that the application is, I think, in the exhortation in Hebrews: "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together". One is thankful, in looking around, at the goodly number here at this time, for it affords pleasure to God. But when goodly numbers should be here in this hall, very
{303}
often there are few; and this, alas, applies to other meeting places in the city. There can be no doubt that the poor attendance at our gatherings is, in measure, a cause of much that happens that discredits the testimony with which we are connected.
So the epistle to the Hebrews opens up to us what these books in the Pentateuch set out, and particularly the house: "whose house we are"; (@Hebrews 3:6) bringing it down in a very concrete way to the saints at any time -- if we continue -- not if we are casually hanging on, as it were, putting in appearances occasionally or at set times, but as of the thing, as *being* the thing; as Peter writes, "first from us", that is, the house of God -- the judgment begins from the house of God; (@1 Peter 4:17). Peter confirms what the writer of this epistle sets out, that the Hebrew Christians were themselves what the types had indicated; namely, the tabernacle -- the greater and more perfect tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man. The epistle to the Hebrews makes it very concrete in its application and, dear brethren, while one would not be critical, we are enjoined to "convict, rebuke, encourage, with all longsuffering and doctrine", @2 Timothy 4:2, that what we profess might not fall flat as we are together. It is the great thought in Christianity, in the concrete sense, that the saints are marked as together. The dispensation began with the thought that all that believed *were together*. It began with them all together in one place (@Acts 2:1), the Holy Spirit honouring the position; and those that were there, I may remark in passing, are called earlier "the crowd", chapter 1:15.
We began this meeting with the hymn, "Where the saints in glory thronging". The word 'thronging' gives a beautiful thought, because it contemplates the distinguishment of each person in the throng and the liberty that belongs to us as in heaven. There is no need for special, as one might say, religious
{304}
garb; the saints are in perfect liberty there, and ornamented too, but in the mutual feeling of love; "where the saints in glory thronging", corresponding with what I have spoken of about the crowd of names.
The crowd and a throng are much alike, and it occurred to me that it was a beautiful suggestion of what there is for us in the way of enjoyment even as coming together, instead of tardily strolling in -- a most humbling thing! Where is the sense of liberty and joy and holiness in each other's company? "In glory thronging" -- that we are really the occasion of joy to each other; the meeting together is there, to be enjoyed now. It is the circle in which the Holy Spirit promotes the elements of eternal life. That is what is intended. How can we do without it -- deny ourselves of it, is beyond my understanding; that is, if we are spiritual, and hence this word, "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together". Why should a little rain, or a little frost, or a little something in the house, or the like, detain us from what the Spirit of God lays such stress upon? The word is, "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom is with some". How humbling to belong to this class -- those who forsake the assembling of themselves together.
Then in the Psalm we get experiences, for in principle the Psalms are a counterpart of the Pentateuch. There are five books in the Pentateuch, and five in the Psalms; and the Psalmist here says, David himself (no surer witness or testimony in these matters than David), that he would not give sleep to his eyes nor slumber to his eyelids till he found a place for the Lord, a habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. But the God of Jacob was not to be there alone; He was to be in the house with His people. And so David says, "One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to
{305}
behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire of him in his temple", @Psalm 27:4. It is not casually, dear brethren; not in a perfunctory way, as though you would just as soon not be there. The irregularity of the attendance of our meetings is most humbling -- pardon me for saying it, but it is true; and it is most humbling for the Lord particularly, because it shows a disregard for what He has provided. "I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of Jehovah". "When *they* said unto me", who are the "they"? Where are they going? A festive multitude; they went on the way like that, dear brethren, into the house of Jehovah. That is what I had in mind, not in the sense of being another speaker, but in the sense of having before us what there is provisionally in the way of a circle of affection, not even to speak of the great thought of God's service, but the happiness, the joy that belongs to the assembly as the residence of the Spirit of God; the residence of God Himself, where He makes room for us. "I rejoiced when *they* said ...". Who are the "they"? *Those who go*. In @Luke 2 is the record of one old sister who did not depart from the house. She was there serving night and day; she did not miss the greatest thing that could have happened, that is, the presence there of the Lord Jesus.
So, as I said, Joshua did not depart from the tent; that is a characteristic thought for a young man. And so, "I rejoiced", the Psalmist says; and, let *us* be glad! Even in that we will be glad; before we leave our houses, and on the way, and when we sit down together, there is the holy sense of the Spirit pervading. It is the scene of eternal life, and we cannot afford to be without it. If we sow to the Spirit, we are told, we shall reap from the Spirit life everlasting, and that is peculiarly true in the assembly.
{306}
CHRIST AS LIFTED UP
@John 3:14 - 16; @John 8:28, 29; @John 12:31 - 33
J.T. I was thinking of these three passages in John's gospel which allude to the lifting up of the Son of man. The teaching relative to each of these statements is in mind: first, Christ lifted up as a necessity, as He says Himself, "Thus *must* the Son of man be lifted up", John 3:14; second, the persons who lift Him up, as He says, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man" (chapter 8:28); and third, the statement, "and *I*, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me", chapter 12:32. I hope we shall find that the teaching connected with each of these statements of the Lord applies to our present exercises.
The first is a necessity. He said "must", and connected it with @Numbers 21, a chapter that has been very current among the brethren for many years as bringing out the teaching of the gospel in view of eternal life.
A.R.S. This expression "lifted up" refers to the crucifixion of the Lord, does it not? But why does He use that expression? Why does it not say, When ye have crucified the Son of man? It is a peculiar expression.
J.T. It is. It would point to the fact that He was made a spectacle of ignominy, lifted up between heaven and earth. It is for us to understand spiritually why the expression should be used. Clearly the thing was not done in a corner, nor was it done to shield the Lord from anything. It was to expose, so that everything connected with the Lord's death might be seen. The crowd that stood around and jeered and commented enters into all this, and an
{307}
examination of what happened will, I think, enable us to arrive at the meaning of the words.
A.R. Is @John 3 to expose man's state? That is, in @Numbers 21 everybody was dying as the result of the serpents¬ bite.
J.T. Hence the "must". God could have removed the fiery serpents, but He did not. The only escape from their bite was this provision that He made. God could remove sin out of the world and destroy Satan if He wished, but He has His own way of meeting emergencies, and the brazen serpent was one way. The fiery serpents were all around, so that it would be most urgent to look at the serpent of brass. It says in @Numbers 21:4 - 9, "and the soul of the people became impatient on the way; and the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us up out of Egypt that we should die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and no water, and our soul loathes this light bread. Then Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, which bit the people; and much people of Israel died. And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, in that we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee: pray to Jehovah that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. And Jehovah said to Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, and looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole; and it came to pass, if a serpent had bitten any man, and he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived". These are the facts of the brazen serpent, and the fiery serpents are not said to have been removed. God is not altering external circumstances, He is altering *us*. He lifted up this thing outside of the range of man, so to speak, so that everyone could see it. If it had been on the level of the crowds of people who were seeking healing by
{308}
a look, they would, have had to jostle one another to get a view; but it was put where everyone could see it. Millions could see it, and everyone that looked lived. But it is a look that is *steady*.
A.R.S. Would the serpent being put up on a pole convey to the people looking at it that at the cross of Christ the serpent was vanquished?
J.T. The first point to see is that it was lifted up on a pole. That is a question of altitude, visibility. Religion would bring it down and befog it, but it is clear of all human influences or darkening thoughts. It is away beyond these elements, according to divine direction, so that everyone can look. It says, "Make thee a fiery serpent", @Numbers 21:8, that is, make one like the ones that are biting the people, "and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, and looketh upon it, shall live". So that the serpents were still there; the point was to *look*.
J.S. Is that taking account of sin in the flesh?
J.T. It is. "God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh", @Romans 8:3. But this was not exactly "in the likeness of flesh of sin", it was in the likeness of a serpent. It is the condemnation of sin in the flesh, only that the serpent has to be borne in mind as being annulled. Yet the benefit is not in that fact alone; I have to look, and look steadily. So that instead of the removal of the serpents the state of sin is corrected.
A.N.W. Did you wish to bring out the uplifted position in @John 3 as advantageous to us whereas the passage in chapter 8 is possibly more an exposure of us?
J.T. That is so. There is a certain responsibility in the persons who lift Him up; but the idea of the lifting up in chapter 12 is that He draws all to Him, and it is "from the earth". It would allude to the

court of the tabernacle and the entering in on those lines as drawn to Him; because John is not ecclesiastical in his terms, he gives the facts. The Lord is lifted up from the earth and all are drawn to Him.
A.Pf. In the beginning of @John 8 the expression as to lifting up is twice used. It says in verse 7, "he lifted himself up", and in verse 10, "Jesus, lifting himself up". The woman looked and got the blessing. Has that a connection with this?
J.T. That is good. The Lord had been doing something before He lifted Himself up. It says, "But Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his finger on the ground. But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her. And again stooping down he wrote on the ground. But they, having heard that, went out one by one beginning from the elder ones until the last; and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing there. And Jesus, lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Has no one condemned thee? And she said, No one, sir. And Jesus said to her, Neither do *I* condemn thee: go and sin no more", @John 8:6 - 11. There is much in that, as to what He was writing. He stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground, according to verse 6, and in verse 8, again stooping down He wrote on the ground. The allusion is to Sinai rather than to Numbers 21. It is a question of the Person who was there, and of the authority He had to write. He was writing His own death, you might say. He was going to die for her or He could not have said, "Neither do *I* condemn thee". The law would and did condemn her, but He was adding something.
A.R.S. It does not tell us what He wrote.
J.T. Spiritual or intelligent persons would ponder what He did, and seek to discover what was meant.
{310}
As the Lord says, "But when he is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth", @John 16:13. The Holy Spirit helps us as we ponder these incidents to get at the truth of the matter. But clearly it is not here lifting up from the earth, it is lifting Himself up from writing on the ground, alluding to His death. He did it Himself.
J.S. The first writing put the legalists out of court.
J.T. And the second kept her in, so that she did not need to go out. The Lord says, "Go and sin no more". She is under His rule. He did not tell her to go out. She is like a person on parole; it is a question now of how she will behave herself. It is not like @John 11:44, where the word is, "Loose him and let him go". She is under surveillance. If she sins more, a worse thing will come upon her.
J.S. The man in chapter 5 went and sinned again.
J.T. The man at the pool of Bethesda, you mean. Exactly.
F.H.L. Does not the lifting up of the Son of man involve the thought of being accursed? "Cursed is every one hanged upon a tree", @Galatians 3:13.
J.T. That is the thought, the bite. Anyone that was bitten and looked would be a convicted person, because the type requires that any person bitten and looking shall live.
G.V.D. Is there a connection between the necessity for the lifting up of the Son of man and the necessity for new birth?
J.T. They are often put together. There are two "musts", you *must* be born again, and the serpent *must* be lifted up. The first "must" is the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer, and the second is the work of redemption accomplished on the cross by the Lord Jesus. They both go together.
G.V.D. I was thinking that the one arises out of the other.
J.T. They really stand together. New birth alone
{311}
will not do. We must have redemption, that is, sin has to be dealt with.
A.A.T. Would the bite of the serpent be @Romans 7?
J.T. Quite so. @Romans 7 shows that you *are*. bitten.
A.R. Does @John 3 and the history of the first man introduce another man? Looking at Christ you see another kind of man, a man who lives.
J.T. Quite so. That the Lord Jesus was made sin and was made a curse are great objective thoughts. They are solemn thoughts. We have to take them in, and one who is bitten will do so, because if he is bitten he feels the thing. Thousands do not feel it at all.
A.B.P. In @Numbers 21 the emphasis seems to be on the word 'fiery'; Moses was told to make a fiery serpent. The word 'serpent' is in brackets, as if the emphasis would be on the *kind* of thing.
J.T. That is the kind of serpent it was. It must allude to the external view, the impression produced on the mind.
A.B.P. That possibly would be more in evidence than the form of the thing.
J.T. The word 'fiery' is stressed, the word 'serpent' has to be added to make the sense. Then it says, "Moses made a serpent of brass", (@Numbers 21:9) as if he were intelligent in what he was doing, because brass is a symbol of judgment.
A.B.P. In that sense we not only have to trace the thing to its source, but also to have a right judgment of what the character of sin is.
J.S. Is it as Son of man that He takes upon Him sin in the flesh, and becomes that? In chapter 8 He is Son of God.
J.T. He says in chapter 3: "thus must the Son of man be lifted up". "Son of man" is a convenient term in the Lord's own mouth, and is seldom used by any other. It conveys what He is in relation to
{312}
men, as of us, and to establish our confidence, indicating that He is on our side.
F.H.L. It is a position of power according to @Psalm 80:17, "upon the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself". Why is it that the truth here in chapter 3 is for an individual, whereas the other two scriptures seem to be spoken to the Jewish crowd?
J.T. Well, this is the basic part of our subject. The three texts taken together form one theme, and obviously this is the basic one, for the "must" is attached to it. There is no hope of God accomplishing His thoughts in man at all unless this "must" is carried out. The Son of man has come in to carry out the divine thoughts in regard to the human family, not the angelic family, because John stresses that the life was the light of *men*. It is a question of men, and the first thing must be the dealing with sin, not only the transgression but the thing itself; and that is what the serpent means, that the thing is dealt with there, in the likeness of the thing that touched the people.
C.A.M. The fact that it was a serpent shows that John is dealing with the source in keeping with the whole setting of this part of the gospel.
J.T. Yes; man is not the source; that is important. The word 'serpent' takes you back to the beginning, for the devil sins from the beginning. He is the author of sin.
C.A.M. In connection with this idea of the bite, are we warranted in saying that there was poison in it? It was a poison that got into the blood-stream of the person.
J.T. I suppose it is well known as to the serpent family, that its power lies in injecting the poison so that a man is thoroughly affected by it, and the type would show that he dies.
{313}
A.B.P. Would there be a connection, between this and Satan's entering into Judas?
J.T. I do not know that it is blood-stream there. That is more Satan *entering* ; as entering he himself is an active agent.
A.B.P. I had more in mind the thought of the serpent as the source. Satan personally is seen active as entering into Judas.
J.T. That is true; but we have to differentiate between the poison injected and Satan himself, because what is dealt with is really sin in the flesh, not Satan in the flesh; it is the poison of sin, and how that is introduced.
J.S. Would Judas be more the vessel?
J.T. It was a personal matter with him. Judas himself was a devil; that is, a personal active agent against God. But this is a virus, it is a poison. Mary Magdalene had seven demons in her. That is not in the blood-stream. That means she had accorded them a place through her conduct; her conduct was dreadful, and one after another got in there. But it says that seven demons went out of her. That is not sin in the flesh, it is the injection of beings who find a place in a man or a woman and act against God. Then the position is made untenable by the light of Christ coming into the soul. It is not the dealing with sin in the flesh, but the ejection of a being that has got in to act against God. That raises a wonderful range of thought as to satanic activity. In heathendom, of course, it still has scope. We cannot say very much about it in Christendom, but in some countries there is certainly scope for satanic activity in persons.
A.N.W. That would show that there was a moral reason why Paul was able to shake off the viper into the fire, and was not vulnerable to its bite.
J.T. Just so. They looked to see him fall down dead, but he did not, he was immune. There was
{314}
power against that. Something had happened, in him before, or he would not have been immune to it.
A.R. The woman that had had seven demons would be a place for the demons to live, whereas this bite would affect the whole constitution, sin working in the flesh.
J.T. That is it, sin getting into the constitution. It is a figure of speech. What happened in the garden was that Satan injected this poison into Eve's mind. It was a bite.
C.A.M. Without this instruction of John which goes to the very beginning of things, I suppose the human mind would be deceived, because Satan's approach was an attractive sort of thing.
J.T. It certainly was. He must have found some sort of means of attracting Eve. This is found in books now.
R.W.S. Did you allude to new birth as the conviction that the virus is in me?
J.T. New birth I understand to be some sort of element, called "spirit". "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit", @John 3:6; not *the* Spirit, but "spirit" in quality. It is like a thread or fibre in the garment. It is inserted and it affects the whole being, only in a modified way. New birth is not redemption, but it is something in the constitution or fibre of the person that will affect the whole being in time. The word 'again', as you know, means 'throughout', from top to bottom. Whether the subject be a learned man like Nicodemus, or any other type, it has its effect. The Spirit operates, and the Lord calls it being "born anew", "born from above", it may be rendered. But it was never intended that a man should be left just with that. New birth is only the beginning of things. Redemption is necessary, and hence the second "must", that the Son of man is to suffer on the cross as lifted up. The allusion is to the serpent, of course. So that
{315}
everyone who is bitten, can see, and in seeing not only lives but has everlasting life. It is a settled matter according to divine purpose. It is not simply that one individual lives at a time, but the idea of eternal life is there for all.
C.A.M. That matter of "spirit" in connection with new birth is very enlightening, because I suppose it would be right to say that the immediate result of what Satan did was, in principle, to divorce the spirit from God, so that bodily appetite governed instead of spirit. If it is right to say that, it seems to help greatly to see that new birth is the very first action with regard to the *spirit* of persons.
J.T. Yes; it is clearly an initial action. Whether it happened in Eve and in Adam in the garden is an interesting question. I believe it did, but the truth of new birth did not come out then. It was too soon to bring it out, because man after the flesh had to have his day, and the law had to be given to bring out what sin really was, "in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful", @Romans 7:13. We have to learn from God what it is. God will have this thing brought to light. He will give thousands of years to work it out, "that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful" (@Romans 7:13).
Nicodemus, a teacher of the law, should have known all about the law, but the Lord has to tell him about new birth and then about the serpent in the wilderness, these two "musts" and the settlement of the whole matter that began with Eve in the garden of Eden.
A. B. It does not say that Eve got her name until after the fall: "And Man called his wife's name Eve; because she is the mother of all living", @Genesis 3:20. I was wondering whether the use of the word 'Eve' suggests another generation, like new birth?
J.T. It does. It is living in the true sense of the word which would confirm that the idea of new birth
{316}
must have taken place there, but it was not yet named. The time for it had not yet arrived. God could have settled the whole thing in Eden, but He did not. He let it have its full scope that it might, by the commandment, become exceeding sinful, then He dealt with it in the cross. The worst kinds of sinners are contemplated, such as Mary Magdalene, Saul of Tarsus, and the woman in @John 4. It is where sin is exceeding sinful that God shows that He has dealt with it and forgiven us.
R.W.S. Like the centurion? He observed the things that were happening at the cross and he confessed the Son of God. Might new birth work quickly?
J.T. Why would it not? Apparently others with him were affected too. God can do things very quickly. The thief on the cross must have been affected just there.
T.H. Would you say that it necessitated an anointed Vessel in flesh to deal with sin in the flesh? "God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh", @Romans 8:3.
J.T. The Lord Jesus had to come to take the matter up Himself, the thing was so awful. Take the serpent itself, what an awful thing it was to deal with! So that Satan is called "that old serpent", meaning that he is the author of sin and is old in it. But he is taken by one angel and chained, according to @Revelation 20. Only the Lord Jesus could really take up the matter because of its age, its extent, and its history, covering so many centuries and so many countries. So that now the Son of man has come to take up the whole matter, and He says, It must be done. Unless it is done, He says in effect, there can be no life, no eternal life. The primary thought of God is eternal life. It was promised, and without this act, this lifting up of the Son of man, it could
{317}
not be reached. But it *is* reached, and that is the teaching connected with the lifting up.
J.T.Jr. Is that connected with the thought of believing? Believing on the Son of man as lifted up? It is not the look exactly in John, it is believing.
J.T. Quite so; the word for believing in the New Testament means that one is brought into it.
C.A.M. The "old serpent" that we are considering seems to give a great thought as to eternal life. John deals with the very beginning of time and goes right on to the end, so that this life is a matter that surrounds it all.
J.T. It is eternal life because it is a question of God's purpose, and that must be reached. When we proceed to the second and third scriptures I think we shall see that the Lord would bring us, according to John's way of teaching into the divine system. He would bring us into the tabernacle, so to speak, where we enjoy the blessing. No one should be outside. "*I*, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me". That is from the earth, notice. He is drawing us away from that. He is not talking about earthly blessing.
A.R. In @John 12 He is the Centre of another world.
J.T. That is it, but He is lifted up between earth and heaven. The tabernacle system comes into mind. The holiest is not in view of the public, but the court is. He is lifted up there to be the Centre of attraction, and all that is behind it is for us.
J.T.Jr. Are there degrees in the thought of eternal life and in our apprehension of it? In the first scriptures it is a question of believing, but later in the gospel it is brought forward in another connection. In chapter 8 it says, "*I* go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin; where *I* go *ye* cannot come", @John 8:21. That seems to be a further idea. He had put the question to them as to believing,
{318}
and now tells them that He is going away and that they would die in their sin. Does not the idea of believing enter into the initial matter? And then in @John 4 there is the water in us, there is something in us now springing up and we are moving on; but still the initial idea of eternal life is there first.
J.T. Quite so. The springing up, it says, is "into eternal life". So that you are drawn along in a current in chapter 4; but here in chapter 8 the Lord is dealing with the Jews in a judicial way, and He says, You will die in your sins if you do not believe that I am He (verse 24). And in our verse it says, "Jesus therefore said to them. When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things. And he that has sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because *I* do always the things that are pleasing to him", verse 28, 29. Now He is becoming attractive, it goes on to say, "As he spoke these things many believed on him". He would go further and liberate them, but He is saying, When you have lifted Me up as Son of man, then you will know I am He. That would mean that His true deity and all that He is would come to light through this means.
G.V.D. Was that not brought out in the centurion? He said, "Truly this man was Son of God", @Matthew 27:54.
J.T. He was simply saying that as to who the Person was. We must remember that his confession of the Son of God was not just the same as Peter's. His confession was based on objective knowledge, what he saw. Peter's knowledge of the Son of God was by way of a revelation, that is the idea in @Matthew 16. We are in the realm of revelation, not simply what appears outwardly, but what is inward by revelation. The centurion did not have a revelation, nor did the men in the boat (@Matthew 14:33) who
{319}
believed that He was the Son of God. They believed because of what they saw, but Peter's knowledge of the Son of God was by revelation, and we are in that. It is not simply objective knowledge.
A.A.T. The centurion heard the Lord give a cry and saw Him give up the ghost. Then he said, "Truly this man was Son of God" (@Matthew 27:54).
J.T. Yes, that is what he saw and heard. Others had seen the same thing, but Peter had had a revelation. That is Christianity. Let us see that Christianity is *revelation*, not objective presentation, in the sense of signs that everybody can see, but revelation.
C.A.M. That is an instructive remark, because it was really the creation that was this lesson-book for the centurion, but for us it is a greater thing than that.
J.T. Yes. You get a true grasp of the Son of God by the Father's revelation.
A.R. This apparently is not from revelation but from standing by the cross and contemplating the person lifted up. As I stand by the cross and contemplate Him light comes into my soul and I begin to know who He is.
J.T. Then the Lord says, "*I*, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me". That does not only mean when He was on the cross. The real drawing was after He went to heaven. The Holy Spirit draws us into all the truth. The Lord went up to heaven, He was lifted up out of the earth, but now He draws all to Him, and what precedes that is that the world is judged. "Now is the judgment of this world", verse 31. So that we are drawn out of it into Christianity, into the assembly, into the court and into the holiest.
F.H.L. Mr. Darby uses the word 'out' of the earth. Would that suggest not only the cross but ascension?
J.T. Taking the figure of the tabernacle it is that
{320}
you are taken into the court. The teaching of this passage is, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone", @John 12:24. That is another necessity; but this time it is the death of the Lord Jesus to bring out of the earth a people like Himself. He bears much fruit, so that Hebrews says, "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one", @Hebrews 2:11. We go into Hebrews from this chapter; there we have the tabernacle system and all that enters into it. It is Christianity as drawing near to God.
A.B.P. Is the Lord emphasising that the Jews would know and be condemned? "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am he", (@John 8:28).
J.T. The "ye" would not mean that every one of them would know. It is an *abstract* idea that would be known. It is the knowledge of the Lord Jesus as to His Person that is in question in this chapter, "for unless ye shall believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins", @John 8:24. And the lifting up would mean that whoever did it would be responsible. It would not be to condemn the Lord Jesus but to bring out the greatness of His Person, which the Jews did not intend at all. The Lord says of the Comforter, "having come, he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment", @John 16:8. The Holy Spirit would do that, and that is involved here; but the truth of Christ's Person is what has come out through His being lifted up. He is a divine Person. He came out of the grave Himself, and ascended up into heaven Himself, and sent down the Spirit Himself. It brings out just what the Jews *did not intend*. They thought He was just a Galilean, but instead of that their action brought out the greatness of His Person.
A.R.S. What is the force of "draw all to me"? It does not mean everyone is going to be converted.
{321}
J.T. Not at all. It is a question, of the attractiveness of the Lord, that He is going to draw all on the principle of attraction, as lifted up out of the earth. He is before everybody's eyes because He is lifted up, but as out of the earth. Where is He going? He is going to heaven. It is Christianity that is in mind in the whole teaching of this section. It is the corn of wheat that falls into the ground and dies. So that it is the true Christian that is drawn to Him.
R.H.S. Looking at Him in heaven -- would that include others or are you applying it only to the saints?
J.T. The assembly is in mind, but you might include all that are Christ's at His coming. If you look into it you will see that the teaching bears on what this verse says, that the Lord is lifted up out of the earth. Am I going to live on the earth? He has gone away from the earth into heaven.
A.R. In the end of the section it says, "Jesus said these things, and going away hid himself from them", verse 36. I suppose @John 12 is the conclusion of the matter outwardly and @John 13 is the beginning of what you are speaking of as the holiest. It is the beginning of the opening up of another sphere.
J.T. Quite so. He says to Peter, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me", @John 13:8. It is part with Him. It is not negative teaching now as we go on after this twelfth chapter. But in chapter 12
Andrew and Philip tell the Lord that the Greeks desire to see Him. They thought the Greeks were great people and that it would be interesting to the Lord that such great people were coming to see Him. But He says, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone", @John 12:24. We sometimes sing, "No longer now alone"; our verses in chapter 12 refer to the persons that are to be His companions. They are to be like Him, they are to come up out of the grave with Him, and He is to be
{322}
so attractive and so influential that He draws them to Himself. Are we drawn to Christ? The next thing is, What will He do with us? He is off the earth, He will not come back on to the earth for us, He is going to take us up there. He will come to meet us in the air. He is so attractive He will take us all up. That is the teaching that enters into all this. We do not want to live and to be somebody on the earth, because the world is judged. The Lord is so powerful in His attraction that He will lift us out of the world.
J.H.S. In the Song of Solomon it speaks of the chiefest among ten thousand. Is that not a distinguishing thought?
J.T. That is the idea exactly. He is so attractive that you cannot stay away from Him.
C.A.M. Referring again to the court of the tabernacle, I suppose an element like the Greeks could not approach into those precincts. Unless they came into the blessing they could never go where the Lord was going.
J.T. They would have to lose their Greek reputation. That is the principle of it. No importance is attached to men and their reputation here below. We read of the seven thousand names of men slain; that means that their names are of no value.
A.B.P. Is Lazarus seen in @John 12 as one who is attracted to Christ in this way, drawn to Him? He was loosed and let go, and he was one of those that sat at table with Him.
J.T. That gives the idea of it. I think the Lord is moving on to Christianity in our verse, because He speaks about falling into the ground and dying or else abiding alone. He must bring out a race of His own, a humanity that is according to God. It is man, but man of a new order. Even the Jews will not do.
R.W.S. There is altitude and there is depth. You alluded to the pole as altitude, but falling into the
{323}
ground would allude to the heart of the earth. All that makes Him very attractive.
J.T. That would enter into the measurements in Ephesians: "that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height", @Ephesians 3:18.
C.A.M. The thought is surrounded with the universe itself -- the immensity of all that is involved in the Lord coming into time.
J.T. The teaching throughout this chapter helps. We have already alluded to verse 20: "And there were certain Greeks among those who came up that they might worship in the feast", @John 12:20. They would see Jesus. Philip and Andrew tell the Lord about them, and it says, "But Jesus answered them saying, The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit. He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal", @John 12:23 - 25. This is the process by which we arrive, in a moral sense, at being of His order. If we hate our life in this world we keep it to life eternal. And then it says, "If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant. And if any one serve me, him shall the Father honour", @John 12:26. That is all developing the truth of the much fruit that comes out of His death with Him. The coming up is an act of God, but the moral side is in hating your life here. You do not belong to the earth at all, you belong to heaven. You love the Lord, and if you serve Him you will be with Him where He is and the Father will honour you. Then the next thing is, "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But on account of this have I come to this hour. Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven,
{324}
I both have glorified and will glorify it again. The crowd therefore, which stood there and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to him. Jesus answered and said, Not on my account has this voice come, but on yours", @John 12:27 - 30. So that you see, dear brethren, this teaching is to draw us into the current in which the Lord is. The voice is not for Me, He says, but for you. How God would bring us into the current of what is in His own mind! How interested He is in us! The Lord says, It is on *your* account this voice has come. Then He says, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out: and *I*, if I be lifted up out of the earth will draw all to me", verse 31, 32. So that you see how the power of attraction comes in; He is the chiefest among ten thousand, ten million, all that there are! He is the chiefest in beauty. But all this involves His going up to heaven and the Spirit coming down and working in us, so that we may be attracted and brought into all that He has in mind for us.
A.N.W. It is striking that He should again deal with this matter of lifting up. A mortal man could not do it literally, but He has in mind to attract all to Himself.
J.T. You can see the force of the word 'attract' or 'draw' here. It is not in the other two references. The "must" does not imply this. The first is the dealing with sin in the flesh; and the second is the Jews exposed and the deity of Christ coming to light; but here He is drawing. It is the supreme attractiveness of Christ as lifted up ignominiously on the cross.
A.R. He takes us out of this world, and becomes the Centre of another world. I suppose we do not have to wait until we get to heaven to work this thing out.
J.T. It is going on now. It is a question of whether I am drawn to Christ. We must examine our own
{325}
selves to see whether He is the supreme attraction to our hearts, because the teaching surrounding this statement involves that we are of Him. There is that in us that responds to Him, but the moral side is that I hate my life in this world.
A.R. Paul says, "But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them to be filth, that I may gain Christ", @Philippians 3:8.

Pages 326 to 429 -- "Family Affections". Detroit, September, 1922 (Volume 56).
FAMILY AFFECTIONS (1)
@Genesis 13:12,18; @Genesis 22:19
W.C.R. You had some thought about family relationships?
J.T. Yes, of course, in spiritual sense. I thought we might see that they flow out from what God is; that they abide, and so are not what we might speak of as provisional, but primary. Family relationships represent primary thoughts, or desires, of God and so they abide. I thought it would be helpful if we could look at them a little. Paul says, "I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named" (@Ephesians 3:14,15).
G.W.H-n. You used the word 'primary' -- what was your thought?
J.T. A primary thought is one that flows out from, or is expressive of, God's own desires, apart altogether from sin or meeting its consequences.
G.W.H-n. That which preceded sin?
J.T. Yes. A provisional thing is something that God entered into to meet conditions that arose. Provisional relationships terminate. Primary thoughts remain and, as it is said, the Father names every family, we see from this what an interest He has in families, and how they take character representatively from Christ. The names they receive indicate what they are; for instance, it is said of us, "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we *should be called* the children of God" (@1 John 3:1) -- a fact that should lay hold of our hearts. In John's gospel we read that, "He came to his own, and his own received him not, but as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be
{327}
children of God", (@John 1:11,12) -- to take that place. That refers to the liberty we have in our souls, but the epistle says we are *called* children of God; we are designated in that way.
W.G.R. In Galatians it says, "Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father", @Galatians 4:6.
J.T. There you have the *power* suited to the relationship already established.
G.W.H-n. These relationships are what lay behind the coming of the Son into manhood.
J.T. Yes, exactly. These were in the heart of God and the Son became Man in order to make them effective; so that I thought we had in Abraham, in that way, a foreshadowing of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. "Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac", @Genesis 22:2. That was said to Abraham. The relationship of father and son is there in a unique way. It is the first time we get *love* mentioned in Scripture, and I think it foreshadowed the relationship between God and Christ -- announced at His baptism. "Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac", @Genesis 22:2. When we come to Galatians we see that the others are not counted; those born after the flesh are not the children of promise. "In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee", @Genesis 21:12. We have to see that we are on spiritual lines in considering Abraham as father and Isaac as son.
W.G.R. As a matter of fact, he had Ishmael for a son, but he was not recognised.
J.T. And others, too, the children of Keturah, but God would develop the great thought that He had before Abraham was. As the Lord says, "Before Abraham was, I am", @John 8:58. Divine thoughts were there. They claimed to be children of Abraham, but the true children of Abraham had to be found elsewhere. They were not the children of the flesh.
{328}
G.W.H-n. Do you not think that this gives great force to the provisional ways of God?
J.T. I think it does. Provisional ways are somewhat like the scaffolding to a structure. The structure is what is going to abide. The provisional things are, of course, a witness to what God is, but what He cherishes is the family, and that is what abides.
G.W.H-n. So in @Genesis 22:6. "They went both of them together"; the father and son walk with this in view.
J.T. Yes, and then after the death and resurrection of Christ in type, they come back to the young men, and all went *together* to Beer-sheba, so you have an increased company. Figuratively you have a forecast of what *we* have got.
J.S. Abraham is a pattern father and Isaac is a pattern son.
J.T. Abraham, through acquaintance with God, had acquired parental instincts that may be regarded as spiritual, for he is said to be the father of all believers. Stephen remarked that he removed into Canaan after his father died, showing that natural parental influences do not enter into the purpose of God. "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house" (@Genesis 12:1), but then it says that Terah took Abraham, his son, and came to Haran (chapter 11:31). That was not going out of his father's house; but Stephen says "after his father died". That has to be recognised.
G.W.H-n. Movement began then.
J.T. Yes, hence it is Abraham as clear of natural relationships that we have before us.
W.H.F. So that we must regard these dwelling places as spiritual.
J.T. Yes. I thought by calling attention to these passages we might see how this great principle of paternal instincts and affections is worked out in the dwelling places. You must have the dwelling place if
{329}
you have the family, so the first thing is that Abraham *dwelt in the land of Canaan*. That is the first thing that comes in. It is said in Hebrews that he "dwelt *in tents* with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise", @Hebrews 11:9. The promise was of the land, so that in principle he is already dwelling there.
W.H.F. It is on the line of God's purpose.
J.T. That is it. As we were singing, 'We seek the things that are above'. Our citizenship is in the heavens. Our living associations are there. Abraham dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs of the same promise. He would regard them as having part with him in their great spiritual inheritance. That is, the promises that refer to Abraham, refer to Isaac and to Jacob also, and he would, in the light of that, convey to them that they were sharing the same thing in family relationship.
W.G.R. They were edified by living with him.
J.T. Yes, so at the outset we are lifted out of earthly relationships and moorings into the heavenly. It may be but in a little way we see it, but even the youngest Christian ought to see that his living associations are in heaven.
W.H.F. In the psalm it speaks of how pleasant it is for brethren to *dwell together in unity*. God seems to have the thought of dwelling before Him in all His ways, and the consequence of that is blessing.
G.W.H-n. So you would not hesitate to call the attention of the youngest believer to this, would you?
J.T. No, that is the thing which comes before us at the very outset.
G.A.T. In connection with what you are bringing out in regard to Abraham, we should be impressed with the fact that there are certain associations we ought to be found in even now, is that right?
J.T. Quite. The apostle John, who deals with this line more than any of the others, shows us from the outset that the thought of dwelling and of the
{330}
family was before him; but in chapter 2 of his gospel he brings in the water of purification. Mary says to the Lord, "they have no wine". Well, that seemed a very simple remark, but he says, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?(@John 2:3,4)" He is preparing for the spiritual order of things. Then she submits and takes her place. "Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it", (@John 2:5) she says. There were six water pots of stone, but they were empty; they were to be filled *up to the brim*, meaning that relationships are not to be according to nature, they are to be spiritual, but if spiritual they must be pure. The very best natural relationships we can have are impure. Now there is nothing more important to take into one's soul than that -- the very best relationships are not pure. In fact, it says the heavens are not pure, in His sight, hence the necessity for the water of purification. The pots were to be filled up to the brim. There must be complete purification. The Lord in @John 3:5 says, "Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God". I think that very often we dwell on the Spirit and forget the water. That is to say, at the very root -- the very outset of our moral being, the principle of water is necessary, because there must be purification. The life must be pure from taint, and John, I think, lays the basis for family relationships in that way. They must be in purity.
W.H.F. Water indicates a setting aside of the man after the flesh, does it not?
J.T. Yes, all those relationships, good as they are, as created of God, are impure.
W.C.R. You mean the relationship of husband and wife is impure?
J.T. All is tainted.
G.A.T. How do you explain that?
J.T. It shows what a terrible havoc sin has wrought in humanity. It enters into everything. So
{331}
that we may not be deceived, and mix things. The spiritual is by itself; everything is "after his kind". That is a principle in the Scriptures; things must not be mixed. See @Genesis 1. The vessels filled to the brim means that I am *wholly* pure. I have to come to apprehend the death of Christ in this light.
W.G.R. Those at the marriage would ignore that. We were noticing this morning the danger of natural relationships affecting us morally. Where they are not held with God they swamp us.
J.T. I am sure that is a constant danger to which we are exposed. Abraham, taken up by God, should be considered. @Romans 4 says that he is the "father of us all", so you consider your father. You see your spiritual father, and he as such depicted what God is as Father.
G.A.T. In selecting a wife for his son, Isaac, he was most careful that she be taken from his own stock.
J.T. Yes, that is just what comes out, so, living at Beersheba, the next thing is he heard, "Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor: Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel (and Bethuel begot Rebecca.)" (@Genesis 22:20 - 23.) That comes to light at Beersheba. He comes into the light of the assembly, as viewed from the family side. Rebecca is thus fit to be Isaac's bride.
W.B-t. In the first passage we read it says, "Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom". It says of Lot that he dwelt in the cities of the plain. Lot separated from Abram. Deliverance from Lot came as a consequence.
J.T. Yes, as living in Canaan, Abraham held to his calling and everything was regulated accordingly. All your projects for yourself and your family are in
{332}
the light of that. You may say, Well, what is your standard for your children? This is the standard and you cannot get a higher one. Our children should be impressed with the great spiritual dignity and wealth that, as believers, we are enriched with.
G.A.T. Lot's standard for his children was Sodom.
J.T. His sons-in-law ridiculed him when he talked about leaving Sodom. He had no power with them, for his associations were there.
W.G.R. Abram says to Lot, "If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right", @Genesis 13:9.. He wished no strife between brethren, and was prepared to suffer any disadvantage in Lot having first choice.
Lot chose the best according to the natural point of view, and what is the consequence of it?
G.A.T. Lot took four steps backward. The first one was covetousness, he coveted the well-watered plains; the second, he pitched his tent toward Sodom; then, third, you see him in the gate of the city; the fourth, he was drunk.
W.G.B. And you see the result in his family.
J.T. Yes, a sorrowful family it was. It says, "Lot lifted up his eyes" -- but, alas! not to survey the promised land, like Abram, but to look into the world in its delusive attractiveness. It says, "And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of the Jordan that it was thoroughly watered, before Jehovah had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; as the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as one goes to Zoar. And Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan" (@Genesis 13:10,11).
W.G.R. "Like the land of Egypt"; that would correspond with Lot's state of soul.
G.A.T. You would call him an earthly minded person, I suppose?
J.T. I think he considered just for the present and had no thought for the calling of God at all. Like Demas, he loved the *present* world.
{333}
W.B-t. As dwelling in Canaan, everything was by faith with Abraham; he was looking for the world to come, not the present one.
J.T. Yes. "He looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God", @Hebrews 11:10.
G.A.T. Lot wanted a city also, but only such as the world affords. Even a small one of these would satisfy him.
J.T. As to us, much enters into our projects what our outlook is. Now, "Lot lifted up his eyes". He did it of himself. Then it says, "And Jehovah said to Abram, after that Lot had separated himself from him, Lift up now thine eyes", @Genesis 13:14. God is asking Abram to do it. Lot did it himself, but here Jehovah says, "Lift up now thine eyes". This is another outlook. He says, "Look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward; for all the land that thou seest will I give to thee, and to thy seed forever" (@Genesis 13:14,15).
W.H.F. Lot seems to have been a hindrance to Abraham. He does not seem to make very much progress until Lot separates from him. First, his father dies, then Lot leaves him and he is free.
J.T. God would have us in that way to start with Him alone. "I called him *alone*.", He says, "and blessed him", @Isaiah 51:2. Each one of us has to start thus, and it is an immense thing to begin with Canaan in view. You say, I thought that was the *end* of the gospel. But God puts the best at the start. Your conscience may need help, relief and purging, but God puts the very best at the beginning.
W.G.R. "Thou shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance", @Exodus 15:17. Israel sang that at the beginning of their journey in the wilderness.
J.T. The great thing is to be governed by the light, thus you are in the right position. Abraham
{334}
dwelt in the land of Canaan. He was in the right position. It is from the place *where, you are now* that you are to look.
G.W.H-n. You look from that place?
J.T. Yes, he was in the right position. Lot had separated. The worldly element had gone.
G.A.T. Abram was up to it. He was positionally right and morally right. We are often positionally right -- as, for instance, at the Lord's supper -- but not morally right.
J.T. The next thing is, he is at the oaks of Mamre. His living associations are right. He is not considering for earthly advantages. Lot was. You see he is maintaining his position in relation to the purpose of God, and in due time the children come in. Isaac and Jacob come in, and this is what they come into. They are "heirs with him", it says, "of the same promise", but what a promise it was! A promise that God made to him. All was to be shared jointly, but shared in *dwellings*, in family relationships. Now you see the exercise one had was that we might see first of all that Abraham represents the father. He represents that thought in Scripture. His name signifies that and the first great thing about him is that he dwelt in the land of Canaan.
W.H.F. Abraham was right and he went on.
J.T. And the next thing is he removed his tent "and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron". Now in that, I think, we have the thought of *stability*. A spiritual man knows where he is, he is not carried about by every wind of doctrine or influence.
W.B-t. Quite an advance over verse 12. He has the right position there, generally speaking. He is in the land of Canaan.
J.T. Yes, and his general outlook is that he has the purpose of God before him. You may say, How would this work out? You do not allow anything
{335}
different from it. There may be touches of sorrow in connection with your children, and what not, but this is your association, and all your projects are in relation to it.
W.B-t. I have been struck in connection with the parable of the sower. In explaining it to His disciples, the Lord says, "in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it and bring forth fruit with patience", @Luke 8:15. This sets forth a Christian, "an honest and good heart", etc., and you can go on with such.
J.T. It is a great thing to be stable. One who dwells by the oak of Mamre is stable. There is uncertainty all around, but you are *dwelling* there. The next chapter brings in the war of the nine kings, and Lot is carried away in it; but of Abraham it says, "And one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. And he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre", @Genesis 14:13. That was where he dwelt, he was not carried away.
G.W.H-n. No believer is safe with his feet off the ground of purpose. As in Sodom, Lot was exposed to the enemy. But of Abraham it says, he had three hundred and eighteen trained servants born in his house. He had the means by him to meet the emergency, and was able to recover his brother.
J.T. One has known how easily brethren get carried away. They are not dwelling in divine association or standing on their own feet. Lot is an example of this, he is carried away and his property. But where was Abraham when they came to tell Him? By the oaks of Mamre.
G.W.H-n. So if you have a profound sense in your soul of the purpose of God you are able to go after your brother who is moving away.
J.T. You are on solid ground yourself and can pull him out of the morass.
{336}
G.W.H-n. You love your brother and would have him with you.
H.W.D. What ministry would you suggest to a person that they might become dwellers among the oaks?
J.T. The truth of the resurrection of Christ. Colossians, I think, answers to the oaks of Mamre. They were in Hebron and part of the inheritance that Caleb asked for.
H.J.G. As risen with Christ we seek the things that are above where He sitteth at the right hand of God.
J.T. Yes, just so.
G.A.T. Would you say that at the start he had to do with God alone? I think the secret of Christian progress is how I start. Have I had to do with God?
J.T. Yes. God *appeared* to Abraham. It is the way God is apprehended in your soul. These things come to you one after the other, but the first apprehension of God in your soul gives character to you afterwards.
Ques. You mean as revealed in Christ?
J.T. Surely. "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia" (@Acts 7:1). There would be the suggestion of what God had in His heart to effect that appearance. *Abraham would never forget that*. He would not perhaps understand it then, but he did afterwards.
G.A.T. Paul, in telling of his conversion, spoke of how he had to do with Lord personally.
J.T. Quite. There was the first appearance, then the Lord says: "And of what I shall appear to thee in" (@Acts 26:16), and there are in some sense these appearances with us. The Lord has His own way of making Himself known to each of us; one way with you and another with me, but He seeks opportunities to reveal Himself to us, and these appearances are what make the man.
{337}
W.G.R. They give an impression, do they not? It says of Paul, "The Lord stood by him and said, Be of good courage, for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must bear witness at Rome also", @Acts 23:11.
J.T. That appearance would, of course strengthen his soul.
W.H.F. It says Abram built an altar.
J.T. There are two so far. The first one was at Bethel, but this second one shows he was progressing. Lot had separated from him, then Abram moved his tents and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, where he built an altar, all of which would show he was getting on.
W.H.F. It denotes progress.
J.T. Yes. Abraham is qualifying for the great spiritual family of which he is to be father. He has lived in the land of Canaan (a general thought) and now dwells by the oaks of Mamre (a particular locality). After offering up Isaac he goes to Beer- sheba. It says, "And Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beersheba", @Genesis 22:19. He and Isaac had gone up to the mount together. It says, "And they went both of them together. And they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built the altar there", @Genesis 22:8,9. But then when God intervenes and he returns, it says he returned to his young men. That is to say, he comes down from the mount of the Lord with the light of *divine provision* in his heart. He called the name of the place Jehovah-jireh, meaning, "As it is said at the present day, *On the mount of Jehovah will be provided"*. (@Genesis 22:14) It had become a current saying in Israel up to the time of Moses, because it is Moses who writes this book, and no one better understood what the mount of Jehovah meant than Moses. He had been on it on two occasions of forty days each,
{338}
with the Lord. He heard Jehovah opening up great thoughts there, unfolding the pattern of the tabernacle and the types of the Lord Jesus as a sacrifice and Priest. He would be impressed with the fact that Jehovah had abundance; indeed, all that was necessary for the carrying out and effectuating of His thoughts. Moses would acquire all that knowledge on the mount of the Lord, and know what it meant. So when he records this instance of Abraham, he would well understand it. It was a current saying in Israel, no doubt, in his day. Well, Abraham came down from the mount with the knowledge in his soul that God was faithful and would provide everything, and he came to his young men and they went together. It was an illuminated company -- as they wended their way south to Beersheba.
W.G.R. I was wondering if you would say God appeared to Abraham as the Almighty, giving him the light of that in his soul here. He gives Abraham the light of himself as the God of resurrection (for He raised Isaac from the dead here typically). It is additional light, and God confirms it to him in his own soul. Is that right?
J.T. Quite so. It says he received him again from the dead, in a figure.
W.G.R. We may have light about God in a way, but there comes a time when He makes that effective in our souls; we arrive at it, so to speak, and now Abraham arrives at a knowledge of God as He appeared to him in the beginning, as Almighty.
J.T. Then you have in addition to that the promise, then the oath. It says, "And the angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from the heavens a second time, and said. By myself I swear, saith Jehovah, that because thou hast done this, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, I will richly bless thee, and greatly multiply thy seed, as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the seashore;
{339}
and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because thou hast hearkened to my voice", @Genesis 22:15 - 18. What wonderful light was given to him! He not only had the *promise*, but also the *oath*. Jehovah called to him the "second time". "For God having promised to Abraham, since he had no greater to swear by, swore by himself",
(@Hebrews 6:13). Well, now, it is all this that enters into Beersheba, because it is "the well of the oath". That is, he is now dwelling in the place that denotes the *faithfulness* of God. We have the general purpose of God, and the stability of the purpose of God, and now the faithfulness of God.
R.L.G. It is most interesting to look at Abraham as representing God Himself, as we have been noting, "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all", @Romans 8:32. Abraham gave his son here. It illustrates God's great purpose and plan.
J.T. There are two things running through here. One is that Abraham is a foreshadowing of God himself in giving Christ; the other is the education of Abraham, and in that he is a type of the believer as well. This third dwelling place denotes that he has now arrived at the knowledge in his soul of the faithfulness of God.
G.W.H-n. It is not man's relief here so much as what the death of Christ yields for God. The temple was built on this spot, was it not?
J.T. Scholars are not satisfied about that; it was in the *land* of Moriah. There is that which is for God in the resurrection of Christ; it says Abraham received Isaac back from the dead in figure. I take that to be the man of faith seeing, all that his heart cherished (for everything centred in Isaac) go into death, but it comes out again. He has him now out of death and so has him permanently, and I think that is what Beersheba means -- the faithfulness of
{340}
God. Everything is secured in a risen Christ, so when Jacob comes down here later and is going to Egypt (@Genesis 46:1 - 3) it says, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father *Isaac*, not his father Abraham. God, as it were, confirms that in saying, "I am God, the God of thy father; fear not to go down to Egypt", meaning that whatever the outward appearances, everything is secured in Christ.
G.W.H-n. Referring to Abraham returning to the young men and conversing with them, that would be in the spirit of relationship, would it not, sharing what had been secured in the death of Isaac?
J.T. Now that is the kernel of what was in my mind; you have the Father and the Son. The father has the son back, figuratively, from the dead. Before he delivered him up it was, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac". (@Genesis 22:2) How that would go to his heart! But he went on with Isaac, "They went both of them together", @Genesis 22:6, and now he has got him back, and you can think of what was in Abraham's heart as he went down the mountain to the young men with his son, his only son, whom he loved! He had him now permanently. Well, he joined the young men, and what would they see? A father with a son risen from the dead (figuratively in his case, but when we apply it to the antitype, it is God and Christ), and that is where the truth of family relationship lies, for it is here that we come in, as we learn from @John 20.
G.A.T. Think of the heart of the blessed God: He had an only Son, and the time came when He had to offer Him up. As Christ was in the garden in agony, how the heart of the Father must have been touched!
J.T. He spoke to the Father: "If thou be willing, remove this cup from me", @Luke 22:42. All that enters into this.
J.A.R. He comes back now to talk with the young
{341}
men. Would that refer to Christ coming to His own after resurrection?
J.T. I think it does. What would they see? They would see Abraham's delight in his son as received back. He loved Isaac, and now that he had him back he would look at him in an entirely new way, and so it says, "Abraham returned to his young men and they rose up and went together", he and the young men. What an item of education for these young men!
C.M.Y. A heavenly company is typically seen here.
J.T. Just so. It was an educational time for them.
H.W.D. Would you think the ministry of Christ risen from the dead produces these young men?
J.T. I think the disciples come into this. @John 20 teaches that the disciples of the Lord were brought into His relationship with the Father. It is as risen from among the dead that the Lord gives us to have part in the family.
W.G.R. When the Lord appeared in the midst on the morning of resurrection the disciples saw something, so to speak, that they never saw before.
J.T. Yes, the great results of His death, perfectly valued by Himself, would give character to the scene. They had contemplated His glory before, but now He had been into death and had come out of it. The sense of all this would be present, although not yet fully understood by the disciples.
G.A.T. Now applying this to ourselves, when Abraham came back to the young men supposing they had ignored or made light of Isaac, what would Abraham think of that? Do we not ignore the Lord a good deal and make light of Him, even as Christians?
J.T. The Lord would impress us with the necessity for spirituality in divine things. I was thinking of Jairus¬ daughter (@Mark 5). He healed the demoniac
{342}
in public, and He healed the woman with the issue of blood in public. The crowd did not affect that, but when raising Jairus¬ daughter and bringing her into the circle of life, He put everybody out; the musicians and all are put out but Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the child. She was brought into that circle, and what a circle it was!
W.G.R. Resurrection is not a public thing.
J.T. No, I am brought into a holy, sober, spiritual sphere. There were seven there -- the Lord Himself, Peter, James, John, the father, mother, and the girl raised up make a circle of seven. She was raised up into that circle.
G.W.H-n. Brought into life. So there are relationships existing now that are permanent.
J.T. And young people are brought into life in that scene. It is a pure, holy scene. "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren", @1 John 3:14. The love is a holy love.
G.W.H-n. Later on in the book of Genesis, when Jacob goes into Egypt, he says to Joseph, "I had not thought to see thy face; and lo, God hath showed me also thy seed". He also claimed them, saying, "they shall be mine", @Genesis 48:5 - 11.
J.T. H e was a true parent; doubtless he had learned from his father Abraham in this regard. We shall have more as to that later, but before we close we ought to see more clearly what comes out in Beersheba. It is God's eternal faithfulness in Christ. Abraham went there with the young men and Isaac; typically it was a wonderful company. It says, "Abraham dwelt at Beersheba". He had now the light of the faithfulness of God. Upon that, additional light is given. It says, "And it came to pass, after these things, that it was told, Abraham saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor", @Genesis 22:20. Note, *it was told him*. We are now in the
{343}
presence of the assembly, for it goes on to say: "Uz his first born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel, the father of Aram, and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. *(And Bethuel begot Rebecca".)* (Genesis 22:20 - 23). Abraham has the light now of a suitable companion for Isaac; the family relationships are to be extended, but the bride is to be lineally suited to Isaac. Being related to Abraham, she is of the right line.
G.W.H-n. You were quoting from @Ephesians 3: "For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named", @Ephesians 3:14,15. This would be @Ephesians 1:19, would it not? "And what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead, and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies, etc., and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly". (@Ephesians 1:19,20,22) Rebecca comes in there.
J.T. That is right. This light as to the assembly typically comes in at Beersheba, the family relationships are to be extended, so in chapter 24, after the death of Sarah, Abraham directs his servant to go to his kindred and seek a wife for his son Isaac. You see the faithful parental instincts in Abraham all through here.
W.C.R. Are you looking at Abraham as a believer when you say that?
J.T. I am keeping in mind the two lines already Mentioned -- that is, he represents the mind of God in regard to Christ and the assembly, and, on the other hand, Abraham is a type of the believer in the way in which he progresses in the knowledge of the truth.
H.W.D. Isaac's bride was to be called from Abraham's relatives.
{344}
J.T. That is, "He that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren", @Hebrews 2:11. That precedes the truth of the assembly. One has to be in the light of the relationship in which we are set with Christ to understand the assembly. The assembly is formed of His brethren.
T.H. Does this work out with Abraham as it does with us? We all know that ultimately death will sever all links and ties of nature, and so Abraham takes the knife, he appropriates death, and in order to come into divine relationships we have to go into death. There is no entering into life without appropriating death.
J.T. He went through death in offering up Isaac. The requirement that even Isaac had to go into death was the supreme test of Abraham's faith.
O.J.O. He had actually raised the knife, he had come to that point.
G.A.T. What would you say about Eliezer? He was really the one who *found* the wife.
J.T. His *name* is not mentioned in connection with Rebecca. It is *Abraham's servant*. He observes the *will of Abraham*.
W.B-t. In chapter 24 Isaac is set before us as a lonely man meditating in the field. Rebecca asks, "Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us?"(@Genesis 24:65) Typically, Christ is now in the view of the assembly. "It is not good that Man should be alone";(@Genesis 2:18) we can think of Christ in the light of that.
J.T. His mother had died. Israel was deceased.
W.G.R. God does not give Christ that which is beneath His dignity.
J.T. That is it.
W.G.R. The assembly is not beneath Him; it is of His own kindred. I suppose it is a great moment with us when we arrive at that, that we are kindred to Christ.
{345}
J.T. That is the light that comes to Abraham here. Then in chapter 24 he causes the servant to swear to take a wife for Isaac from his kindred. The light had come to him that she was there.
W.C.R. Adam said, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh". (@Genesis 2:23) He recognised himself in Eve.
J.A.B. Bethuel begot Rebecca. There is nothing mentioned about any other children.
J.T. That is the point in chapter 24. Abraham acts on the light given. He knew she was there, but does not mention her to the servant; he has to go and find her.
G.A.T. Is that the same as the treasure hidden in the field?
J.T. Pretty much. The ministry of Paul brought her in, but the Lord had spoken of the assembly in the days of His ministry.
"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham";(@Acts 7:2) the glory itself shall shine out ultimately in the family. On Christ shall be hung all the glory of His Father's house; @Isaiah 22:24.
W.H.F. "The Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into his hand", @John 3:35. So Abraham is a figure of God as Father.
J.T. Quite.
G.W.H-n. What dignified thoughts the "young men" would have as they returned! Doubtless they would listen and respond to all that was presented to them in Abraham and Isaac.
G.A.T. Quite different from the thoughts of the two on the road to Emmaus -- they thought Isaac was dead, but the Lord revealed Himself to them as risen.
{346}
FAMILY AFFECTIONS (2)
@Genesis 44:14 - 34; @Genesis 45:1 - 5
J.T. These chapters strike one as being particularly applicable to the time in which spiritual family relationships have become deranged, such as are exhibited at the present time. What is needed is adjustment among God's people generally, and these two chapters help in that way, as showing the great need of this ministry of Joseph's. That is, a ministry of Christ which brings about adjustment of divine relationships among the saints. After Abraham the paternal instincts were not so marked. Isaac was evidently a good husband, for it says he loved Rebecca, but there is not much to indicate that he was an especially good father. He had preference for the man after the flesh, for his venison. Isaac loved Esau, because venison was to his taste. Evidently a man of natural appetite. Jacob's history is marked by circumstances not conducive to the development of family relationships, because of the different mothers. It was not one son, as with Abraham, "thine only son", but twelve, and there were four mothers. So the circumstances in which the children were brought up were such as not to foster family affections. Jacob's sons are not marked by these affections. They had little sympathy with their father, and they had no love for their brother, so that the behaviour of the ten becomes the occasion of this remarkable ministry that you get in Joseph, a ministry which I think has been in progress ever since the Lord was rejected.
H.W.D. To whom did the ministry come? You said certain circumstances became the occasion of certain ministry.
J.T. Primarily it refers to the Jewish remnant,
{347}
but it has an application to us also. Right family relations will be established among the Jews in the last days, when they become "one stick" in Christ's hand. As brethren they will dwell together in unity, but this ministry is not only applicable to them. It marks the Lord at the present time, and I thought it would be helpful, therefore, to consider these chapters, so that we might see how these divine relationships that we have been dwelling on are adjusted where they become deranged.
W.G.R. It is not a father and son here, as Isaac in relation to Abraham, but brethren in relation to Christ. Is that right?
J.T. Yes.
H.W.D. Does that naturally follow on with what we had this afternoon?
J.T. You see we have the paternal feature presented in Abraham: His name means, "Father of a multitude", in him you have the paternal thought presented. He *loved* Isaac, and dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob. There was in him a reflection of God Himself. "The Father loves the Son"; then He loves us also as His sons. But of Isaac it was said, "Thy son, thine only son, Isaac, whom thou lovest", @Genesis 22:2. Then Rebecca is brought in as his companion, and she is loved by Isaac; so that you have family relationships and affections extended.
H.W.D. The elements are brought together which would produce the brethren, is that it?
J.T. The brethren are seen in Jacob's family. But failure came in. Whilst Isaac and Rebecca present a type of Christ and the assembly, Isaac fails. He breaks down and is unable to discern the difference between Esau and Jacob. He is governed by natural tastes, he loves venison, he is a man of appetite. There is that which precludes the development of these affections of which we have been speaking.
In Isaac's house the wives of Esau were a cause of
{348}
grief to Rebecca and Isaac, and then Jacob has to flee from the face of his brother and he has to *serve*. for a wife. The prophet says that Israel served for a wife; (@Hosea 12:12). All these circumstances preclude the development of these affections and relationships of which we have been speaking, so that Joseph's ministry, among other things, is to bring about the restoring, adjusting and re-establishing of them.
H.W.D. Strictly speaking, this is Israel, is it not?
J.T. Yes. As I said, the full bearing of it toward the godly Jews will be seen in the latter days when they are brought together under Christ. "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!", @Psalm 133:1. This will be seen in them. Christ is brought in as the great Priest in heaven, then the oil flows down on His beard and to the skirts of His garments. It will be fully seen then but it is seen amongst us now, and there never was a time when this ministry of Joseph's was more needed.
H.W.D. What marked the sons of Jacob marks us naturally, and the ministry of Christ is needed to remove that from us. Is that your thought?
J.T. That is it. Now just to briefly sketch the previous history, let us look at chapter 37. It says, "Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons". (@Genesis 37:3) So far there is a continuation of Abraham. Abraham loved Isaac; Isaac loved Rebecca; and Israel loved Joseph That is what is recorded. The ten have a father that loved a son -- Joseph Then the spirit that marked Jacob's other sons is depicted -- not only a murderous spirit towards Joseph, but it says, "And they took Joseph's vest, and slaughtered a buck of the goats, and dipped the vest in the blood; and they sent the vest of many colours and had it carried to their father", @Genesis 37:31,32. Mark that, they *sent* the vest to their father, they did not take it. Had there been any affection for their father, they would have gone to him at a time when he needed their support,
{349}
but they sent and had it carried to their father, and said, "This have we found; discern now whether it is thy son's vest or not". Not "our brother" -- not a word about that. It is "discern now whether it is *thy son's* vest" (@Genesis 37:32).
W.C.R. Like "this thy son" in @Luke 15.
J.T. Exactly, the passages correspond.
G.W.H-n. So they are not only against their brother but against their father.
J.T. Yes, there was a total want of sympathy with their father. God says in the prophets, "If then I be a father, where is mine honour?" (@Malachi 1:6).
G.W.H-n. They were totally irresponsive.
J.T. Yes.
B.L.C. Does not the nature of Jacob come out in his sons in their actions?
J.T. The nature of the man born after the flesh comes out surely. It is for each of us to see what the flesh is *in me*.
W.C.R. It is your own picture.
J.T. Yes, I do not know of anything in a way that is more touching to think of than these ten men under those circumstances sending the vest to their father, and sending the word, Is this thy son's? It would pierce his heart like an arrow that he had not an atom of sympathy from them. There was not only the loss of his son Joseph, but the want of sympathetic affections in his other sons.
G.W.H-n. It was a cold, heartless act.
O.J.O. It shows what the natural man is, does it not?
J.T. It is a question whether we have sympathy with God. You see, the children of God are all loved of Him. Christ died "Not for that nation only, but that He also should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad", @John 11:52. So if one loves Him who begets, he loves also him begotten of Him. The two things go
{350}
together. The test is whether I love the children of God.
G.W.H-n. We see a wonderful service on the part of Joseph at this point, taking a review of the past, he seeks the recovery of his brethren.
J.T. Jacob and Joseph knew what existed among the ten brothers. @Genesis 49 shows Jacob's parental exercises. "Gather yourselves together", he says, "and hear ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father";(@Genesis 49:2) he then reviews their history and takes note of the wicked things they had done.
G.W.H-n. "Simeon and Levi are brethren, *Instruments of cruelty are in their habitations"*. (@Genesis 49:5) What an exposure!
W.B-t. Is it not remarkable that, after all that occurred in regard to Joseph, it says, "Judah went down from his brethren?" He seemed to go from bad to worse; chapter 38:1.
G.W.H-n. Do you take it that Judah had measured things here?
J.T. That is what we want to come to in chapter 44. Judah expresses the exercises they had arrived at, so that without going into any further details it says, "Judah and his brethren *came to Joseph's house"*. That was an important movement. It is a good place to come to, is it not? The light had shone into their souls. They had been in his presence several times. We can read between the lines what exercises they must have passed through (in mind and heart) as to who this man might be. In the early part of this chapter particularly it says, "What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak, and how justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants". *God* had found it out. That was the result of a process -- the whole series of events led up to this.
G.W.H-n. Gradually.
{351}
J.T. Yes, God had found it out, you see. He is owned in it now.
W.G.R. In other words, God had discovered it to them.
J.T. Exactly, and brought it home to them.
W.G.R. Does this show the skilfulness with which God brings things home to us, what grace, what pains He takes to discover to us what we are. It says, "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do", @Hebrews 4:13.
J.T. Exactly. You will notice it says of Joseph that "He was still there". Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house and he was still there. He knew what was coming.
G.W.H-n. "They shall look upon me whom they pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son", @Zechariah 12:10. The spirit of that was already working here.
J.T. Yes. It will be a family affair, "As one mourneth for his only son ... . The family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, ... every family apart", @Zechariah 12:10,12,14. God will cause the light to come into the families and they will see how they treated the Lord.
G.W.H-n. You spoke this afternoon about the faithfulness of God. God foreseeing and foreknowing each one of us, His faithfulness follows us up until we reach the point of self-judgment.
J.T. That is it, and it is going on all the time. I do not see how we could go on without it. It is a great comfort to know this purpose is being pursued, so the children of God scattered abroad should learn to judge themselves as to what their attitude has been Godward, and Christward, and brethrenward. We have got to answer for everything, all has to be gone into, if these divine relationships and affections are to exist; there must be the going into all this, and in Joseph's house. He *is* still there.
{352}
O.J.O. Would that bring in the judgment seat of Christ?
J.T. It does, in the principle of it. Here Joseph's brethren were convicted before him.
O.J.O. I was thinking that what has not been judged here we shall have to go over with Him there.
J.T. This rather illustrates what we have at the *present* time. The judgment that is going on continually. If anyone injures you, you can reckon on the Lord taking the case up, and bringing circumstances to bear on that person, until he comes to the point where he comes to Joseph's house and has the matter settled.
R.L.C. Things done in the dark will be brought to light.
J.T. The Lord is going on with this work unceasingly, and in this way affections suited to the children of God are brought about.
J.A.R. Why was the cup put in the sack of the youngest one?
J.T. To bring the thing *home* to them. They were obligated to Jacob about Benjamin. It doubtless represents another feature. He did not betray or sell Joseph, nor had he anything to do with it. Joseph knew that Benjamin was the test, and Judah accepted it. He says, "We are my lord's bondmen". Joseph replies: "Far be it from me to do so! The man in whose hand the cup has been found, he shall be my bondman". That was the point, and further it says, "Then Judah *came near to him*, and said, Ah! my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant". The thing was urgent.
G.A.T. We have considered Abraham making and appeal for Sodom. It says, "Abraham drew near". These men draw near, they have an appeal to make. It is a great thing to draw near to God.
{353}
J.T. "Draw near to God, and He will drawn near to you", @James 4:8.
G.A.T. We must know what it is to be near to have communion and make intercession.
J.A.R. Does this prove Judah's affections are now toward his brother?
J.T. Judah is the mouthpiece. Let us examine what he says: "Let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears". Now take note of what he says, because it illustrates the light and the judgment that had come in. "And let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh". He recognises Joseph as superior, as supreme. Typically it is God Himself in Christ. "My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?" Note these two words -- "a, *father*, or a *brother"*. Joseph would bring in that adjustment. This is how it comes in: "Have ye a father, or a brother?" The reply was, "We have an aged father, and a child born to him in his old age, yet young". Here is a sympathetic man speaking. He knows what it is to be a father himself. "His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set mine eye on him. And we said to my lord, The youth cannot leave his father; if he should leave his father, his father would die. And thou saidst to thy servants, Unless your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. And it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food. But we said, We cannot go down; if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us. And thy servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons; and the one went out
{354}
from me, and I said. He must certainly have been torn in pieces; and I have not seen him again hitherto. And if ye take this one also from me, and mischief should befall him, ye will bring down my grey hairs with misery to Sheol. And now, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us -- seeing that his life is bound up with his life, it will come to pass when he sees that the lad is not there, that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol. For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I shall be guilty toward my father all my days. And now, let thy servant stay, I pray thee, instead of the lad a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren; for how should I go up to my father if the lad were not with me? -- lest I see the evil that would come on my father". There is a son and brother speaking. He has come to it now.
G.A.T. He knows the father's heart now.
J.T. How very different from, Is this thy son's coat?
G.A.T. It is all out now, would you say?
J.T. Yes. So it says, "Joseph could not control himself".
W.C.R. What a contrast between this and the first two brothers we get in Scripture. "Where is Abel thy brother?" And the reply, "Am I my brother's keeper?", @Genesis 4:9. Judah had not been his brother Joseph's keeper, but now he is prepared to be Benjamin's. Does this suggest to us that we should be surety for our brethren?
J.T. I think so. We are brought to that. This is a remarkable speech, showing how God brings a man to self-judgment, and at this point it says, "Joseph could not control himself". He must make himself known now because the *brotherly state* is there. It is as if he said, I could not recognise you
{355}
as my brethren until you arrived at the brotherly state.
H.W.D. Is Joseph a type of Christ in that way?
J.T. Yes. The Lord is bringing about in us the brotherly spirit; we must think not only of the relationship, but also of the spirit and affection suited to it.
G.A.T. Would you connect this with the Lord appearing to His own in the upper room? All being put out from Joseph corresponds with the closed doors.
J.T. Quite.
W.H.F. Joseph was sent to preserve life. What application would that have for us now? Joseph is a type of Christ in rejection here.
J.T. Primarily, I think, he is a type of Christ preparing for the Jewish remnant when they are obliged to leave their own land. I think @Romans 9 to 11 are in view here. The question raised is, What about the promises to Israel? The spirit of Christ in His love for Israel was reflected in Paul. He had wished to be a curse from Christ for his brethren. There is a remnant now, "For I also am an Israelite", (@Romans 11:1) Paul says. He found a refuge prepared for him among the Gentiles by the rejected Christ.
W.H.F. Joseph is a type of Christ as Lord, being over Egypt as administrator; everything is now under his hand to distribute.
J.T. So he says, "God sent me before you to preserve you a *remnant* in the earth". The word is "remnant", @Genesis 45:7.
G.W.H-n. Supposing I am not on speaking terms with my brother, and there is a good deal of distance between me and the saints, and no brotherly spirit found in me, I am sure, in such a state, I can not approach God. By what particular truth am I affected so that I have the spirit of a son and of a brother?
J.T. The Lord has His own way of affecting you,
{356}
and of bringing home to you what will affect you. It may be in some governmental circumstance, such as the loss of a loved one, of a business, or of money -- whatever it may be; the Lord knows how to turn that to account in your soul, and to bring you to inquire, What is the meaning of this? There is a searching process, an initial exercise, and presently the light dawns on you and you own you have been wrong.
H.W.D. You mean that is an illustration of what you have been saying?
J.T. Our brother was raising the question as to how it would apply to a brother now. These were governmental circumstances, but Joseph turns them to account. God turned them to account so that Judah and his brethren judged themselves in that in which they had failed. They had been without sympathy toward their father and toward their brother. Now Judah speaks in beautiful terms about a father's feelings and about his brother Benjamin. We may reckon on that. One of the comforts one has is that governmental dealings help us.
G.W.H-n. Concurrent with the governmental dealings of God with us is the precious light of love flowing in; a sense of what is in the Father's heart brings things to a climax, so to speak.
J.T. "Awake north wind, and come thou south", @Song of Songs 4:16. We can pray for that.
H.W.D. Does Joseph act here in priestly grace?
J.T. Yes.
H.W.D. He was lord, as administrator of the good things of Egypt, but here is acting as priest, is that it?
J.T. I think so. He acts with the greatest skill and is completely successful in reaching their consciences. That is what was before him from the very outset.
W.C.R. It says, "Love never fails".
{357}
G.A.T. I can pray very easily for the south wind but it is a test to pray for the north wind.
J.T. It is not only your garden, but the Lord's garden. "Awake north wind, and come thou south; blow upon *my* garden", @Song of Songs 4:16. That is your garden, and then, "Let my Beloved come into *his* garden", @Song of Songs 4:16. You do not pray for tribulation, but it is necessary for the north wind to blow upon *my* garden.
W.B-t. I think it is worthy of note that Judah had lost two of his sons in the government of God; @Genesis 38. The discipline evidently prepared him for this exercise.
J.T. Quite so. He now had a father's heart.
W.B-t. We earlier touched a little on "Our God is a consuming fire". (@Hebrews 12:29) Your thought seems to be that the Lord Jesus is still adjusting things amongst His brethren, like Joseph does here, using discipline if necessary.
J.T. I think we ought to accustom ourselves to recognising God in everything. He has one thing before Him in this world today and everything else subserves it. Every king, every government, every famine, every war, and every occurrence in the world is intended for the furtherance of the prosperity of the saints. It says a sparrow does not fall without Him; @Matthew 10:29. It is not simply that He marks the sparrow's fall, but it cannot fall without Him. How much less can a war, or a famine happen without Him! All these things are under God's direction, and all for one purpose. That is to say, for the furtherance of the interests of Christ and the assembly, which is the garden.
R.L.G. Then it is quite possible that a brother or sister might be suffering some injustice from a brother, which they would bear for the Lord's name, and He, in due time, would make the thing manifest and restore the brother, bringing them together.
J.T. It may take a long time for God to develop
{358}
things in the world because His judgment there is indirect, but in His house His judgment is direct. God acts there directly and issues come out much more quickly. At the beginning they came out very quickly, as in the case of Ananias and Sapphira.
G.A.T. The more spiritual the company the more quickly judgment comes in.
J.T. Sometimes where spirituality is low, evil may go on undetected for a while. One has seen that, Alas! but when the Lord gave the sop to Judas he went out.
W.G.R. At once. We should detect the evil quickly.
W.H.F. The north wind is discipline, and exercise and adjustment preparatory to the south wind, which would be a ministry of blessing, etc.
J.T. Just so.
G.A.T. Does God not allow discipline to come in for two reasons with the individual? One on account of my unjudged actions: "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep",
(@1 Corinthians 11:30). Then in @Hebrews 12 that there might be "the peaceable fruit of righteousness" (@Hebrews 12:11).
J.T. Exactly, discipline goes on all the time.
W.B. -- t We get a little afraid of it sometimes.
J.T. But it goes on, "Tribulation *worketh* patience", @Romans 5:3.
Rem. Discipline is only with sons, is it not?
J.T. Quite. It is the son that is disciplined, that he might be a partaker of God's holiness.
Rem. It will be a source of great satisfaction to the Lord's heart when He sees unity established among the Jews as in @Psalm 133, "There the Lord commanded the blessing" (@Psalm 133:3).
J.T. So @Romans 5 gives you a set of workers. "Tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed". (@Romans 5:3 - 5) That is, you have specific workers at
{359}
your service. Then in @Romans 8 you have, "All things work together for good to them that love God". (@Romans 8:28) That is, war, famine, and everything works *together* for good.
Rem. Our hearts have to be established in the knowledge of God before we realise that.
J.T. Yes, otherwise you think, like Jacob, that, "All these things are *against* me", @Genesis 42:36.
W.C.R. When Jacob started he had not quite reached the end God intended in the discipline. He says, "Ye will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to Sheol", (@Genesis 42:38) but when he finally surrenders and says, "Take your brother ... . And I, if I be bereaved of children, am bereaved", @Genesis 43:13,14. The will is broken. Discipline from God was to effect this in Jacob.
A.D. Not only in Jacob, but in the brethren.
J.T. Yes, Judah, I think, here voices the exercise of the brethren. They had all come to it.
G.A.T. I thought he was taking in measure, the place that Moses took, and that Paul took, when he was willing to become a curse for his brethren's sake.
J.T. And because of that, it says, "Joseph could not control himself before all them that stood by him, and he cried, Put every man out from me. And no man stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brethren", @Genesis 45:1. We have now come to definite adjustment, because adjustment is in the Lord making Himself known first. If I am to be right generally I must know what He is to the brethren when He makes Himself known. If I am to be a brother I must see what He is to the brethren.
R.L.G. Previously he was used to preserve life, the life of Judah, and here Judah voices the brethren's feelings.
J.T. Yes, it says, "No man stood with him when Joseph made himself known, to his brethren. And he raised his voice in weeping; and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. And Joseph
{360}
said to his brethren, I am Joseph" What a moment!
G.A.T. "Handle me, and see", @Luke 24:39.
J.T. Just so. First he says, "I am Joseph", and then, "I am Joseph your brother".
G.A.T. He made it clear that he was Joseph "It is I myself", @Luke 24:39.
W.H.F. The chapter indicates the coming day when Christ will present Himself to the remnant of the Jews and their eyes shall be opened to see the very One whom they cast out.
G.A.T. I think this scene is wonderful. "He fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept: and Benjamin wept on his neck". They wept together. There was intense sympathy between them. Then he kisses his brethren, kisses them all. As @Luke 15, it is the kiss of assurance.
J.T. Quite. He says, "I am Joseph Does my *father* yet live?" How he thought of his father, and immediately enquired after him! It is not "*your* father" or "*our* father", but "*my* father".
R.L.G. All the brethren would be in a broken state.
J.T. That was what gave occasion for the making known by Joseph.
G.A.T. It is well to note that after announcing himself he enquires about his father.
J.T. Yes. Family relationships were emphasised. Then it says, "His brethren could not answer him, for they were troubled at his presence. And Joseph said to his brethren. Come near to me, I pray you". It is adjustment here. In His dealings with us, the Lord would have nothing less than this. He would have us free in our affections to draw near to Him. As near to Joseph, his brethren learn everything from him, just as the Jew shall bye and bye, and as we now have to learn everything from Christ.
G.M.Y. Why does he not say "our father"?
J.T. I think it is the Lord's personal distinction.
{361}
Joseph maintains that throughout. "My Father, and your Father" the Lord says, but never "Our Father". He never links the disciples with Himself in that way. It is "My Father and your Father; and to my God, and your God", @John 20:17.
G.A.T. When He teaches the disciples to pray He says, "Say, Our Father", but He did not include Himself in that.
G.W.H-n. I like what you say as to distinction. You get the height of the truth in the Lord. If you are adjusted from the top you get an apprehension of what the brother is in Christ, and in connection with "My Father" the light of sonship, would you say?
J.T. Yes, I suppose the two things go together, the relationship between Father and Son and the relationship between brethren.
R.L.G. The action of his brethren severed Joseph for a long time from his family, but now they are about to be united. Do you not think that what we require today is the clearing up of that which causes distance, that happy relationships might be restored?
J.T. He says, "Come *near to me*, I pray you". That is what they needed.
H.W.D. Is that what discipline results in, the drawing near to Christ?
J.T. That is it. Many of us are sort of "long-distance" Christians.
G.A.T. It has been said that the death of Christ has not only removed the distance between God and man, but between man and man, and that is the case here.
R.L.C. Joseph is not free until they are together in self-judgment. Then he is free to reveal himself to them.
J.T. There were the two sticks, the stick of Judah and that of Ephraim, and they become one in the Lord's hand; @Ezekiel 37:19.
{362}
W.C.R. "Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim", @Isaiah 11:13.
G.W.H-n. The fruit of adjustment, as we are looking at it now, through the service of the Lord Jesus, we get in the assembly, do we not? You are adjusted with your brethren and Godward, fitting you for service with Him before His God, is that right?
J.T. Yes, quite, and the first thing is to come to Joseph's house. He is "still there".
G.W.H-n. What a wise arrangement of things led up to all this! As you were saying a little while ago, all that has taken place in the world, wars and such like, is divinely ordered to bring an issue more quickly with the saints, but how wise and skilful the hand of God, the wisdom of divine love to bring to pass a service Godward.
H.W.D. Have you in your mind that at the Supper, for instance, we come together with the idea of Christ being pre-eminent among us? Is that similar to Joseph saying here, "Come near to me, I pray you". That thought would be in your mind on Lord's day morning.
J.T. Quite. It is the time the Lord would have us come near to Him as His brethren. All the pressure and heart searching we experience are to prepare us for this. The Lord is working with all the saints so as to bring them in a suitable state to the assembly.
W.C.R. Joseph had been lord to them, but that does not suggest nearness. Now he would have them near to him as head.
J.T. I think the language here would indicate that to his brethren he is no longer lord. He says, "I am Joseph *your brother*, whom ye sold into Egypt. And now, be not grieved, and be not angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither, for God sent me before you to preserve life". The type shows that the Lord would disarm us of all fear in His presence.
{363}
G.A.T. The Lord is made known in the breaking of bread.
J.T. He would have us free before Him. "Be not angry with yourselves", Joseph says. It is no place for self reproach. They had made their confession and now he would have them in the liberty of brethren.
G.A.T. You mean when I come to the Supper it is not with thoughts of myself. You leave all that outside.
J.T. Quite. It is a question of what the Lord is to you. Of course you come in self-judgment.
H.W.D. Is this a type of Christ not being ashamed to call us brethren?
J.T. That is what you get here. When the brotherly spirit exists among us He can join us and recognise us.
G.A.T. We have had a verse before us that might fit in here: "If any one has not the Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him", @Romans 8:9. That verse comes before me if the flesh shows itself amongst the brethren.
J.T. Gideon's brethren were like him; @Judges 8:18, 19. The Lord recognises us as like Himself. The gospels afford us a description of the brethren so that we may know them. Those He recognises in Matthew and Mark are those who do the will of the Father here. In Luke it is they hear the word of God and do it, but in John they are *believers*. The word "believing" applies in a characteristic way to them. "They saw and believed", it says; the message through Mary in @John 20 is to such.
R.L.G. To-day Israel rejects the Lord, but the day is coming when He will make Himself known to them, and they will believe on Him.
J.T. There will be a resemblance in them, the law will be written in their hearts and minds. They will be like Him in that sense, but we are like Him in a greater sense because of the Spirit indwelling us.
{364}
W.B-t. And because of that He is not ashamed to call us brethren.
J.T. The marks exist. Gideon's brethren had a resemblance to him and he acknowledged it. Now the gospels indicate the marks of Christ's brethren: those who do the will of God, those who keep the word of God, and those who believe in Christ risen. John gives us the spiritual state suited to the brethren, which leads outside the world. As characterised by these marks, we have a link with another world and know what it is to be out of this world. Christians in human systems do not understand that at all, nor can they.
G.W.H-n. What part of John are you referring to?
J.T. Chapter 20. Peter and John saw and believed, although they went to their own home; Mary Magdalene did not, and she got the message. But then the others "believed". I think that feature of the truth as presented in John is what is so entirely outside the understanding of Christians in the "systems". They do not know what it is to have a link outside this world altogether. That is what John aims at, an out-of-the-world state of things.
G.A.T. Like the isle of Patmos, a place of separation.
J.T. Somewhat. In John the doors were shut. You have to note that. It is not a place with *one* entrance; there were *doors*. I have no doubt that this refers to hearts. The doors being shut, Jesus came and stood in the midst.
G.A.T. Shut against what?
J.T. The religious element. You do not bring that in. You feel it is unsuitable to Christ. It is not "door" but "doors" in John, and there is no furniture. It is not a question of what is external, but what is internal. He comes to where the disciples *were*. 
{365}
W.B-t. It says the Egyptians in the house of Pharaoh heard, would that indicate Joseph was not ashamed of these men now?
J.T. You will notice it is a *second time*, not at the first visit. Stephen tells us that it was "the second time" he made himself known to them; @Acts 7:13.
G.W.H-n. Would you not say that the ways of God here, and all that marks *time* are for the maturing of God's *primary* thoughts?
J.T. Yes. The development of family relationships and the affections suitable, is always before God in His dealings with us.
G.W.H-n. How important and valuable time is. When the activity of God in time is over, what a harvest for His own heart there will be, when that which was looked forward to in counsel, before time, will be matured for Himself. His disciplinary ways with us should be welcome in view of all this.
J.T. So it is, "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages", @Ephesians 3:21.
G.A.T. In coming to the Lord's supper it should be as having everything out with God, and with nothing but love for all the brethren, not only those I am walking with but *all* the brethren.
J.T. Judah only speaks here, but doubtless he expressed the exercises of the others. Joseph recognises that. If you have one spiritual man the Lord recognises him.
{366}
FAMILY AFFECTIONS (3)
@Jeremiah 35
J.T. It occurred to me that this chapter would help us in further considering the subject before us, as showing how a father's wish was adhered to and carried out. We have been engaged with family relationships and were dwelling on certain passages in the book of Genesis. We saw how the parental instincts developed in certain dwelling places in Abraham, and how he, being the typical father in Scripture, *dwelt with Isaac and Jacob*. We noted the dwelling places with that in view. They were the heirs with him of the same promise, so that the family instincts and affections would be rightly developed. We saw that he is said to have dwelt in the land of Canaan, then by the oaks of Mamre, and last at Beersheba, and how the light as to Rebecca came to him there, and that he acted on it in sending his servant to seek out Rebecca; so that the family was to be continued, and the links were to be equal -- she was to be of Isaac's kin. Then we saw certain disarrangements having come in through Isaac and Jacob, the relationships were adjusted under Joseph, and I thought this chapter would furnish a further link in the chain of Scripture, as showing how a family rightly regulated and adjusted regard the will of the father.
G.W.H-n. Before going on to that I wish you would go over the three dwelling places -- Bethel, Mamre and Beersheba. He dwelt at each of those places, did he not?
J.T. It says in a general way he dwelt in the land of Canaan, in chapter 13 of Genesis. I think we enlarged on that as indicative of the purpose of
{367}
God being in view in his dwelling places. Did you have something further?
G.W.H-n. I only wanted you to say whether Mamre is an advance on Bethel.
J.T. I think it is, in that it speaks of *stability* , ( "oaks" ) and Beersheba is in the light of the death and resurrection of Christ, and of the oath; @Genesis 22. God having no greater to swear by swore by Himself, so the soul is established in the *faithfulness* of God. You rest in that. Perhaps you had something else in your mind.
G.W.H-n. No, I only wanted to be a little clearer on the difference in the positions at Bethel, Mamre and Beersheba. With regard to the last point, is it not very necessary for us to apprehend the faithfulness of God so that our souls may be established?
J.T. I think so. The family relationships are developed in these connections. We were noting that Abraham, on the one hand, suggests God's own affections in the fact that he loved Isaac, gave him up, and received him back from the dead. Then we noted also that he represents the believer in the progress of his soul. Then the sons of Jacob, being adjusted in regard to Jacob and in regard to one another, I thought the sons of the Rechabites might furnish another link as showing how adherence to a father's command is a mark of family affections. I think their position is very much akin to our own. Their father had died. The Lord's relation to us is very like that of Jonadab's relation to his family.
W.C.R. You mean that where there is a brotherly spirit adjustment comes in and the natural consequence is that those who have been thus affected do the will of God and keep His commandments?
J.T. Yes, quite. The Lord said, "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me", @John 14:21. In the institution of the
{368}
Lord's supper there is a certain allusion to the family. It is a family institution. The parental thought enters into it. The Lord, in partaking of the passover, was in the position of head of a house, as Jonadab was head of a house. The passover was celebrated in families, all in relation to the centre in Jerusalem. To-day the family thought, natural family links are stronger among the Jews, I think, than among any other people, and the family principle was augmented by the passover. There was to be a lamb for a house. The family thought descended to the most insignificant man in the nation, but then all the families revert back to one great family, because all must emanate from, and all revert to, God. However, many thousands or millions of families there may be, the family principle is worked out in each, but then it reverts back to the great divine Progenitor. It must necessarily, and so the feast of the passover brought the family feature into evidence. They repaired to Jerusalem in families, and, as there, they had the passover, each family having it apart. The links would be strengthened in each family, but then they would broaden out. They all come from one parent stock. As the Jews said to the Lord, "We are Abraham's seed". The Lord admitted that Abraham was their father, according to the flesh.
"I know that ye are Abraham's seed", but he was not their father spiritually, for they did not "the works of Abraham". He makes very plain who their father was in that sense. But then He says, "Before Abraham was, I am". See @John 8:58. That is, He went back further than Abraham, so that the family root goes back of Abraham.
R.S.S. How would you apply that to the Lord's supper?
J.T. The Lord's supper was instituted on the passover night. They partook of the passover as a family matter. He instituted His Supper under those
{369}
circumstances, and it was to supersede all that went on in Jerusalem at that time in the many houses in which the passover was celebrated. The Lord was the "House-father" on that occasion, and the word, or commandment, as we may speak of it, was to be the bond, and indeed the test, of the saints during His absence.
R.S.S. Do you, for that reason, think that the gatherings of the Lord's people now are more in the character of a family than a large congregation? The Lord made them sit down by fifties, etc., having some reference to the gatherings of the Lord's people to commemorate the Supper.
J.T. Yes, I think the small gatherings afford occasion for the development of family feelings and affections more than the large ones do, but then the small ones have the one great family in view. We must revert to that. There is one great family now -- the children of God. "That we should be called", it says, "the children of God", @1 John 3:1. So that the local companies afford the occasion for the development of family feelings and affections; but we ever bear in mind that now there is one great family.
G.W.H-n. The great point here in these sons is obedience, is it not?
J.T. That is it.
G.W.H-n. What begets obedience?
J.T. Love does.
G.W.H-n. While you were quoting @John 14, I was thinking of verse 23, "If a man love me he will keep my word", @John 14:23. Love begets obedience.
J.T. Yes, there is the keeping of the *commandments* in verse 20, and in verse 23 the keeping of the *word*. In both cases it is love. There is a striking parallel between @John 14 and this chapter.
G.A.T. Does partaking of the Supper denote that
{370}
I have affection for Him, and that I also want to keep His word?
J.T. Yes, the commandment refers to His *will* and the word refers to His *mind*. The commandment must necessarily come first. Unless the will of the Lord prevails we do not get His word. The word comes out in ministry. The commandments are specific; they are the test, but, "If a man love me, he will keep my words", (@John 14:23) He says.
G.W.H-n. It says the virtuous woman of Proverbs does her husband good and not evil all the days of her life. Her service springs from affection.
J.T. I think we might get help if we were to see that fatherly instincts and affections necessarily emanate from God. He is the source of all; I think the Lord meant that when He said, "Before Abraham was, I am", @John 8:58. He was before Abraham, hence all that comes out in Abraham, in this respect, is a reflection of what is in the heart of God. God took him up for that. His name signifies "father", which means that God intended to set out what was in His own heart and bring it near to us. Abraham is said to be "father of us all", and we ought to consider him in this light. The Lord was before Abraham; what came out in Abraham was from Him, and so He says, "I am the root and offspring of David", @Revelation 22:16. He was the Root. To appreciate the royal line you must go back to the Root of it. The two features come out in Matthew: "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham", @Matthew 1:1. Although He comes in through them, He was before them.
G.W.H-n. So that when Abraham took the three days¬ journey with Isaac, he was only setting forth what was in the heart of God.
J.T. That is it.
R.S.S. Do we not find that the thought of relationship originates not only with, but in God? I
{371}
mean the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. So God is the source of all, of what we are now speaking about, and that which also goes with relationship -- affections.
J.T. It is "Before the foundation of the world", (@John 17:24) but God graciously takes account of our capacities. The Lord connects eternal things with time, or an event by saying, "*Before* the foundation of the world", @John 17:24. That is the way the Spirit of God refers to eternity. Our minds are capable of taking that in to some extent, at all events, but it was there then before the foundation of the world. The Lord refers to it, that the Father loved Him then, and also to the glory that He had with Him then. So we can look back to the circumstances of Genesis and see that they must be but the reflection of what was in God's heart. God was working it out in a man, so He says, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house", @Genesis 12:1. There must be complete severance from the natural before God can develop spiritual relations and affections.
Stephen says, "After his father died" Abraham removed into Canaan. It was *after his father died* that all this came out.
R.S.A. That throws great light on the necessity of Abraham having to leave his kindred and father's house.
J.T. Quite so. He must be apart altogether from the natural, he was to dwell in the land of Canaan.
R.S.S. Really in all this it was God's desire to reveal Himself and what was true of Him.
J.T. That is it, and the affections seen in Abraham are but the reflection of what is in the heart of God.
R.S.S. Referring again to @John 14:23, "If a man love me he will keep my word". "Word" carries with it not only the will of God, but the, revelation connected with it.
J.T. There are the "commandments" and the
{372}
"word", and then the "words"; @John 14:21 - 24. "Words" express details, you might say.
R.S.S. Quite so.
G.W.H-n. In connection with what you have been saying about Abraham reflecting the thoughts of God, how affecting it is to think of the Lord saying, "Lo, I come; in the volume of the book it is written of me; I delight to do thy will, O my God", @Psalm 40:7,8. How, if one may speak reverently, He awaited the opportunity to act for His God. In His life it was the joy of His heart to unfold what was in the heart of God and to bring to pass His will.
J.T. John's gospel, in one feature of it, develops that for us, that He did the Father's will *always*. He was the *sent* One.
G.A.T. All these men that God placed on the earth in testimony before the Lord came were but a reflection of what was in the heart of God, but when Christ came He brought the fulness of it.
J.T. Yes, all that was in God's heart had now taken form. He said, "He that has seen me has seen the Father", @John 14:9. The Son having become Man, you have here on earth One in whom all these features are seen, so when the Lord said, "Before Abraham was, I am", @John 8:58. He implied that He was the source of all that came out in Abraham, but then He would give expression to all its fulness, and I have no doubt when He instituted His Supper the parental idea was there in its perfection. Those who sat about Him would know what the heart of a Parent was. It all came out in Him.
R.L.C. A peculiar test is submitted to these Rechabites by Jeremiah.
J.T. It is a very strong test because they are brought into the house of the Lord.
R.L.G. It emphasises the parental thought very beautifully; they respect their father.
J.T. I think the institution of the Lord's supper
{373}
is strongly related to this. The parental thought was there. The Lord was the House-father. They say to Him, "Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?", @Matthew 26:17. It would be His house, as it were, for the moment. Jonadab's command to his house is parallel to the Lord's request in instituting His Supper.
R.L.G. Would it have been very becoming for them to have drunk wine in the house of the Lord?
J.T. It was a strong test, through the prophet.
R.S.S. Would there not be rather this difference between what we have in the command of Jonadab, and what the Lord says in connection with the observance of the Supper; it was a command in one case, but it is not exactly a command in the other?
J.T. It is not, but His will enters into it. "This do for a remembrance of me", @Luke 22:19. Love would not ask anything stronger than that in the way of a command.
R.S.S. I suppose, in a way, it shows the difference between Judaism and Christianity. Judaism was connected with demand, whereas in Christianity it is not exactly commandments we get so much as principles, precepts, and expressions of the Lord's mind, to which affection would delight to adhere.
J.T. I think 1 and 2 Corinthians taken together form a commandment, especially the first one. In fact, he says so. "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14:37. I think it is strictly commandment, not commandments, but commandment of the Lord. The first letter has a sort of imperative bearing on it. The second one is restorative. I have been thinking a little of the expression, "the *second* time". It was on the occasion of the second visit of his brethren to Egypt that Joseph made himself known to them; the second letter to the Corinthians is like that.
{374}
"That ye may have a *second* benefit", @2 Corinthians 1:15, he says.
W.G.R. The first one is more regulation, preparing them for the second.
J.T. Yes, quite so. The second brings in what is more positive -- the heart of God and of Christ.
W.G.R. The covenant?
J.T. Exactly. God is made known to them there.
G.A.T. They were to prove their love to their brother.
J.T. That was it. "Assure him of your love", @2 Corinthians 2:8. The brotherly spirit was to be there. The evidences of it were there, in that they had judged themselves, but they were to confirm their love to their erring brother; @2 Corinthians 2: 8.
O.J.O. Would you say the parental thought was in evidence when the Lord says to Mary, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and to my God, and your God", @John 20:17.
J.T. Well, it brings the Father in, but I think as the Lord instituted His Supper the parental idea was there in Him. The Father's affections were there, they were brought near to the disciples, and our position now is seen in theirs. In the Rechabites there was sacrificing love. Is our love such in kind and quantity that it will keep the commandment under *all* circumstances? In the severest test can we hold to the commandment?
J.S. It has been said if we keep His word the world has no use for us, and if we keep His commandment we have no use for the world.
J.T. That is so, I am sure.
W.G.R. Would the commandment of Jonadab to his family not have significance with us now? He commanded them, not to drink any wine, all their days, they nor their sons for ever, not to build houses
{375}
to dwell in, and not to sow seed nor plant vineyards. Are those things not suggestive to us?
J.T. Very. He made a heavenly family out of them, so to say. They were to have no earthly joy, not to build houses, and not to have vineyards and fields. In other words, to be pilgrims and strangers on the earth.
G.A.T. The Levitical idea?
J.T. Very much the position of the Levites in the book of Joshua. And the Lord says here, "Jonadab, the son of Rechab, shall not want a man to stand before me for ever". That is the heavenly family typically.
W.C.R. The Nazarite?
J.T. Well, it amounted to that. Whatever it was that led Jonadab to give this commandment, it is quite clear that the Holy Spirit ordered it that there should be such a family in Israel as this. They were a nomadic family. They moved about without houses, dwelling in tents. Their position was therefore a testimony to a heavenly family in the midst of apostate Israel. There is no doubt that Jonadab had some reason for it, as verse 7 shows, and the Lord so ordered that He should give this commandment, in view of testimony, and took account of it in the days of Jeremiah.
G.A.T. You do not object to one owning a house, do you?
J.T. The thing is to get the spiritual thought, to see what God's mind is.
W.G.B. It is the spirit of the thing.
G.A.T. If I own a house it is to be no more to me than a tent. I am to be ready to leave it at any moment.
J.T. You must live in a house, but the idea is that the development of family relationships, affections and instincts are in relation to what is heavenly. The book of Genesis brings that out. Abraham *dwelt*
{376}
*in the land of Canaan*. That is the first great feature. Now *why* should Jonadab have given this commandment? It is very striking. What may have been in *his* mind is one thing, but God so ordered it that a man in the midst of Israel (Jonadab was contemporary with Jehu) should desire that his children should not drink wine, neither build houses, nor plant vineyards. What can we see in it, but that God had it as a testimony. It is also put down as a testimony for us that the family of God is to continue here in heavenly characteristics. There is the testimony that we have no dwelling place. "Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come", @Hebrews 13:14.
W.G.R. The great witness had broken down, I suppose. Israel was to have been a witness, as those who kept the commandments of God; and now in their midst He has this family, and points to them, to showing how faithful they had been to their father's commandment.
J.T. You see how valuable they were as a testimony at this juncture. They were there, and God could bring them forward to show that, at any rate, one family in Israel was marked by obedience to a father.
W.G.R. "To obey is better than sacrifice", @1 Samuel 15:22.
G.A.T. Are you applying this to show that if there was one family of whom this was true, it ought also to be true of us in connection with the Lord's supper? Every true Christian ought to respond to His request to partake of the Supper.
J.T. God had in the Rechabites a remarkable testimony at the end of those days; Jerusalem was about to be destroyed, but God had in them a good witness in regard to what He was about to do. What an advantage it is now, since God is about to come in in judgment on Christendom. He has the
{377}
sons of the Rechabites, as you might say: those who have returned to the desires of the Lord and adhere to them. God has them. He can call upon them and bring them forward, so to speak, as a witness to obedience.
W.C.R. It was a supreme test to which they were put, as brought into the house of God and wine is set before them. You would think they would drink it because of the conditions and surroundings.
G.W.H-n. Where family relationship is lacking there is the tendency to bad conduct, as in the case of the Galatians.
J.T. Yes, the enjoyment of family relationship was lacking.
J.S. I suppose obedience to the father in the Rechabites showed that they had affection and reverence for him. Apart from obedience there is no affection.
J.T. That is right. They had continued all those years without any attention, apparently, having been paid to them. Now at the end they are there, you see, and God takes account of them, bringing them forward as a witness. He was going to destroy Jerusalem, but He has in them a witness. There is one family at any rate that knows what it is to be obedient to its father. So analogously, at the end of these days God would call attention to some who have regard for the Lord's wishes, because they love Him.
W.C.R. He says to Philadelphia, "Thou hast kept the word of my patience", @Revelation 3:10.
J.T. Exactly. Then He says, "I also will keep thee".
W.B-t. Your thought is that there are Rechabites upon the earth today: there is that which corresponds to that family?
J.T. Yes.
W.B-t. Will you please develop it a little?
{378}
J.T. It refers to the recovery of the truth of the Lord's supper. We have often dwelt on @Acts 20 in that respect, but there is one thing that perhaps may not have been noticed. That is, the apostle at the outset *discourses*, and after the recovery of Eutychus he "talked" or "conversed". Instead of a discourse, they converse. In verse 7 it says, He "discoursed to them". Then in verse 11: "Having gone up, and having broken the bread, and eaten, and having long spoken (or conversed, as the foot-note reads) until daybreak, so he went away", @Acts 20:11. That is, having broken the bread and eaten, there was a conversation in which, of course, Paul led. The recovery of the truth of the Lord's supper has brought about mutual relations among the saints. There is room for gift, but not only that, we have the mutual side, also the state suggested by conversation between the brethren. As we see in the Rechabites, there is a family marked by adherence to the Lord's wishes; but then there is amongst the saints that which sustains them; we are kept in the way of spiritual conversation. It says in @Malachi 3, "They that feared the Lord spake often one to another", @Malachi 3:16. The mutual relations that have ensued recovery maintain us in family relationships; we are near one another, and have common interests.
G.A.T. It was a wonderful conversation the Lord had with Cleopas and his companion in @Luke 24, at the end of which they were restored.
J.T. Yes.
W.B-t. Your thought is that the young man being asleep and falling down from the third loft corresponds to a period in the history of the Rechabites when they were unknown?
J.T. The family was there from Jonadab's time undoubtedly. They retained their nomadic character, but Nebuchadnezzar's army coming into the land they were forced into the city, and God says as it

were, Here is a witness in the very midst of the city to obedience of children to a father. He says in Malachi: "A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour?"(@Malachi 1:6) He was a Father to Israel, and the presence of the Rechabites in Jerusalem at this juncture afforded Him a witness to what Israel should have been to Him. How great a thing, therefore, it is to be in obedience! Such are a witness to what the church should be to God and to Christ, and I think, as has been remarked, Philadelphia is just that. The Lord says, "Behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee", @Revelation 3:9. What a thing that is! A witness in the midst of corruption to what the assembly should have been is thus honoured.
G.A.T. No doubt the Spirit of God has wrought in the hearts of a few today, and these are a sample of what the whole church should be. They seek to maintain the true principles of the assembly.
J.T. That is it.
G.W.H-n. A Philadelphian holds and cherishes every divine thought of the assembly.
J.T. Yes. The overcomer there is made a pillar in the temple of God.
R.S.S. What you have drawn our attention to is of the utmost importance; we find such as you are speaking of, who are endeavouring to walk in the truth according to their measure. They have some devotion, know what to do, and how to occupy themselves. This in contrast with, not only the world, but Christians generally. You will find that these, unless they are really devoted, do not know what to do with themselves, even on the Lord's day; whereas, having the Lord's mind and having guidance, we are not at a loss. We have purpose in connection with our lives. I have thought of that a
{380}
great deal, and really pity people in that they are at a loss to know what to do with themselves.
J.T. To know what one is about, as you say, is a matter of great importance. The time is then rightly occupied. Speaking for oneself, I do not know of anything more scarce than time. When you think of the vastness of the things of God, the thought that you have scarcely touched them is forced upon you; and yet you have to admit that there are many who do not occupy themselves rightly.
G.W.H-n. You lay great stress on the Supper: do you think family relationships could be known where the Supper is lost?
J.T. I think the Lord's supper develops them. In the Lord personally we have the thought of father presented to us. He was for the moment Head of the family, the disciples would understand that, and would regard Him in that light. James and John were there, they were not in the house of their own father. It was the Lord's sphere in which they were, so the institution of the Supper would carry with it the family thought.
G.A.T. It has often been remarked that we are a testimony to the ruin. I have never been clear as to that remark. I feel in connection with what we are reading we ought to be a testimony to what can never be ruined.
J.T. The Rechabites, you see, witnessed to one thing -- to their affection for a father. That is the one point, and it seems to me it is what the Lord values now.
R.L.C. They dwelt in tents until Nebuchadnezzar came up against Jerusalem; then for fear they went into Jerusalem. It is very beautiful that they were so obedient to their father's instructions.
J.T. They are a ready witness for God to what Israel ought to have been at that time. Well, how great a thing for us that a few brethren in a locality
{381}
may be a present witness for God of what the church ought to be. It dignifies the position they occupy, and the thought should greatly encourage devotedness and discourage disobedience and worldliness.
R.S.S. You drew attention to @Acts 20 and the difference between discoursing and conversing. Now this was in connection with the observance of the Supper, was it not? You would not exactly converse at the Supper, would you?
J.T. I think we do *afterwards*. Our history, as in the assembly period, is composed of *weeks*.
R.S.S. You are not confining it to the time we are convened?
J.T. No, we must include all that follows during the week. We are set in family relationships. I do not know of anything that needs emphasis more than that, that we are set in family relationships. Families converse together. It is well known all over the world that what marks a family at the table is happy; free converse. That is what should mark us.
R.S.S. What you say now makes it perfectly clear to me. I thought it was a question of when we are convened. Perhaps it was the case in @Acts 20.
J.T. It was no doubt, but all our meetings through the week are a continuation of the assembly meeting of the Lord's day.
R.S.S. Quite so -- such a meeting as this, for instance.
W.C.R. You were saying the Supper brings in adjustment and the brotherly spirit.
J.T. It does, and I think the fatherly spirit, too. I am not now speaking of our relationship to the Father, as in @John 20, but rather of that care which the Lord manifested towards His disciples. He is "the everlasting Father", @Isaiah 9:6. All that Abraham was in this respect is presented fully to the saints in Christ; it comes out where the family celebration is; so that our relations with one another
{382}
through the week take character from that and are on mutual lines.
W.B-t. Will you say a little about verse 9: "Nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, or seed, but we have dwelt in tents".
J.T. The rest of verse 10 should be added: "And have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us".
W.B-t. I had in mind more particularly that they had no vineyard, nor field, nor seed. They did not seem to cultivate land.
J.T. They were a witness to what is heavenly.
W.H.F. The Rechabites were marked by faithfulness in that condition of things; at the present time faithful men, going down to the end, who shall be able to teach others also, would correspond. It would indicate an overcomer in Philadelphia. Philadelphia today is not in evidence like Thyatira or Sardis, etc., it is hidden. I suppose there is a time coming when the Lord will make manifest Philadelphia's faithfulness.
J.T. Just so, and I think He does it *now*. The Lord has His own way of showing His approval.
G.A.T. Do you think Philadelphia can be located; is it hidden now to the spiritual?
J.T. I do not think it is. The Lord says, "He that hath, to him shall be given". The Lord, it seems to me, is indicating those that *have* by giving them more. "And he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath", @Mark 4:25. I do not know that I am exactly right, but I think what is spoken of as evangelical Christendom is being withered up. Those responsible had much that they borrowed, and the Lord wrought through them, but that which they had is being taken away. There is very little now outside of those that *have*.
G.A.T. Did you say what-they had was borrowed?
{383}
J.T. Very largely. The Lord says, "Whosoever *has* to him shall be given", @Mark 4:25. The Rechabites represent those that keep the commandment of the Lord; to such He manifests Himself, which involves that they receive light and blessing. They *have*. The apostle says, "That good thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy Spirit", @2 Timothy 1:14. I do not think anyone has anything that he has not got by the Holy Spirit. It is by Him you *have* divine things.
The five wise virgins *had* something -- the oil. The recognition of the Holy Spirit implies that the saints have something, and the Lord gives to those.
W.B-t. The recognition by God of the obedience and faithfulness of the Rechabites is very comforting. He is going to perpetuate that family.
J.T. He is not going to want a man to stand before the Lord. That is the great thing -- to *stand before the Lord*.
W.B-t. How do you understand that?
J.T. Their correspondence with Philadelphia is striking. The Philadelphian overcomers have a peculiar place in that way. Their rewards are in connection with what is precious to Christ: "The temple of *my* God, ... the name of *my* God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from *my* God, and *my* new name", @Revelation 3:12.
R.S.S. I was wondering why Jonadab is brought to light. Jehu had bidden him come up into his chariot in order that he might see his zeal for the Lord. Is there any connection between that and what we have before us?
J.T. I think he was a *fellowship-man*.
Ques. The question is asked, "Is thy heart right?"(@2 Kings 10:15) What is there in that?
J.T. That is just the point. Jehu says, "Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jonadab said, It is". That is the basis of fellowship.
{384}
"And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot", @2 Kings 10:15. That is, he is in complete identification with a man God is using.
G.A.T. What do you mean by a fellowship-man?
J.T. Well, one that has committed himself to what is of God in connection with others. In giving Jonadab his hand and taking him into his chariot, Jehu, as it were, recognised him as in fellowship.
G.A.T. Both walking together.
J.T. Yes, they are on the same errand now. Their hearts are right. Fellowship is a *heart* matter. It is not simply that I am breaking bread. It is a question of my heart. If anyone wishes to break bread, the question is, is his heart right? The Lord's heart is right. The Lord's supper is the disclosure of what is there. He says, This is what my heart is -- what about *yours* ?
G.A.T. That solves a number of questions as to people who wish to break bread; are their hearts right?
J.T. It is a question of the state of heart, and, as one has often remarked, in breaking bread, there should be a link established, that of affection with the brethren. You come and are one of them. The loops and clasps of the tabernacle suggest that.
Rem. The Psalmist says, "I will run the way of thy commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart", @Psalm 119: 32.
J.T. Just so. Jonadab being the progenitor of these men, and being a fellowship-man, it is all the more noteworthy. It is the more striking because the Holy Spirit puts these things together for us.
H.W.D. Paul's instructions to Timothy were to the end that he should take account of those that called on the Lord out of a *pure* heart.
J.T. Yes, to "Follow righteousness, ... *with them"* (2 Timothy 2:22)
{385}
FAMILY AFFECTIONS (4)
@Genesis 48:8 - 22; @Genesis 49:1,2; @Genesis 50:22 - 26; @Numbers 27:1 - 11
G.W.H-n. Would you continue the thought of God being typified in Abraham and now in Jacob here?
J.T. I was just going to mention that. In order to rightly and fully apprehend the teaching connected with the family, we have to see that the patriarchs represent God Himself. They also represent the believer in his history; but no brother today could be regarded and spoken of as Jacob is here. You can see that Joseph regarded his father as more than an ordinary father. He regarded him as representative of God, there is therefore a sort of forecast of God's own place in His family in Jacob's position here. Then the position of Joseph becomes all the more interesting, because he represents the Lord Jesus in the manner in which he adjusts the family relationships.
R.S.S. When you speak of the patriarchs, is it Abraham, Isaac and Jacob you have in mind? Do you confine your idea to the three?
J.T. Yes, they are so spoken of.
G.W.H-n. Joseph's father sends him to seek his brethren, and he is found in the fields of Dothan seeking them. What a lovely setting forth of the Lord Jesus coming into this scene, is it not?
J.T. Quite, and Joseph's position (as already noted in the chapters leading up to chapter 45) becomes intensely interesting as illustrative of the Lord's service today in adjusting the family relationships. It is said that "To us there is one God, the Father, ... and we *for* him", @1 Corinthians 8:6. The whole family is for Him.
G.W.H. "Of whom are all things, and we for
{386}
him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him", @1 Corinthians 8:6.
J.T. The "by whom" is much like Joseph here; the Lord is bringing in the family, and adjusting it so as to fit it for the Father. Hence, after Joseph's final interview with Jacob and the blessing of his two sons, it says: "And Jacob called his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days. Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father", @Genesis 49:1, 2. The whole family is in view, Joseph amongst them, but then Joseph already is given one portion above his brethren. That is to say, I apprehend, the Lord Jesus takes His place in the family, as pre-eminent in it, but nevertheless in it. He has obtained one portion above His brethren. He is first-born among many brethren.
R.S.S. Why is it collective? "Behold, I die; and God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers, and *I* have given to thee one tract of land above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow", @Genesis 48: 21, 22.
J.T. It would be an allusion to the death and resurrection of Christ. In the chapter we have reference to the sovereignty and *power* of God in glorifying Christ.
R.S.S. There was that in Satan's hands, which was taken by divine power and conferred on Christ.
J.T. Joseph is now seen with his brethren. Consequent on his having received from Jacob the blessing, Jacob is recognised by Joseph in his own place. No one could have that place but Jacob, and it helps greatly, I think, in considering the family in the New Testament, because you have God accorded His rightful place in relation to it. In @1 Corinthians 8:6, as we said, it is, "There is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him". Then in
{387}
@Ephesians 4:4 - 6, there are the different circles: "There is one body and one Spirit, as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all". All the circles are for the Father. All must be for Him, and so in @1 Corinthians 15 again, having subjugated everything, the Son Himself becomes subject when He gives up the kingdom to Him who is God and Father -- He is both -- that God may be all in all.
R.S.S. Why do you say Joseph accords Jacob the position which is even beyond the ordinary father?
J.T. If you look at the passage I think you will see that. It says: "Joseph brought them out" (the two lads) "from his knees, and *bowed down with his face to the earth"*, @Genesis 48: 12. Thus he recognises that Jacob has the blessing to give.
W.G.R. His distress that the blessing should be upon the head of the younger would indicate he wanted the blessing for the first-born.
J.T. Yes, who but a man who represented God, could, take such a place as Jacob takes here? Joseph had earlier brought him in and placed him before Pharaoh, and he blessed Pharaoh. "Without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better". Joseph recognises this; being a man of faith he recognises his father as representative of God; in a sense, God Himself was there. Now, the Son becoming Man, we can see all this is transferred; all must apply now to Christ.
R.S.S. Is the same thought indicated in connection with Isaac and the importance of the blessing?
J.T. It is the same thought in the three patriarchs.
R.S.S. It is recognised by Rebecca in regard to her sons, and by both Esau and Jacob.
J.T. Yes, it was. I think it helps us greatly to understand the book of Genesis if we see that the position of the patriarchs was occupied by Christ
{388}
when He was here. What God is as Father must come out in Him. All the divine parental feelings and affections came out in Christ. He says, "Have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father", @John 14:9. He was no less than that, so Abraham, Isaac and Jacob represent God in this way, as the great parental witnesses, now all is in Christ in the fullest way. This is set forth in the position of Jacob in chapter 49 as he looks down the line, and sees by the Spirit the end from the beginning: the great parental instincts, feelings, and affections, are expressed in what he says. And so at the end we get, "These are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them; and he blessed them: every one according to his blessing he blessed them", @Genesis 49:28. You see it is a blessing, but it is a blessing coupled with the strongest denunciations of the evil that should arise in them. The evil is not passed over, but it is the outgoing of a father's heart. "Listen to Israel your father". He is not blind to the guilt, nevertheless the blessing is for every one of the tribes. Even Dan (although later an apostate tribe), had his blessing.
R.S.S. It is rather remarkable that he does not say, "Gather yourselves together, and I will *bless* you", but it is, "I will tell you what will *befall* you at the end of days". At the end of the chapter we get the Spirit of God making this comment, "Every one according to his blessing he blessed them";(@Genesis 49:28) whereas, on the other hand, I think Jacob speaks of blessing Joseph's sons himself, does he not?
J.T. Yes, he said, "Bring them, ... that I may bless them", and, "God ... bless the lads", @Genesis 48:9,16.
G.W.H-n. Referring to @John 14 again: "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; ... Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in
{389}
me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works¬ sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also", @John 14:9 - 12. What the Lord had in view was to bring the disciples into the same current of life as Himself, by believing on Him, and that is really what is typified here, is it not?
J.T. Yes. Jacob in blessing the lads had in view that his name should be there. He said, "Let my name be named upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac". You see the whole paternal testimony, or stamp was to be on Ephraim and Manasseh. Now that is one feature of the family -- the parental stamp is on it. As the Lord says, the Father "makes his sun rise on evil and good", and the disciples were to correspond with this. They were to "be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens". See @Matthew 5: 43 - 45. That is, the Father's *character* is to be there; the evidence that the Father's name is on us.
R.S.S. Have you any thought why there are *three*, patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? And why "children of Israel"?
J.T. They are the children of Israel you mean?
R.S.S. Yes, not the children of Abraham.
J.T. All that Abraham and Isaac were was passed on to Jacob, and dispersed amongst the tribes. The three would be a *complete* testimony to what is parental, and was passed on to this wonderful family.
R.S.S. We should be great losers if we had not the testimony seen in those three men, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
J.T. Yes, each one had his own peculiar experience and place in the testimony.
G.A.T. Has the blessing of Joseph's sons any
{390}
connection with the Lord leading His disciples out to Bethany, and lifting up His hands and blessing them?
J.T. Yes. You see, God, as the source of blessing, must enter into that. Of old Aaron was to bless the children of Israel, saying, "The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace", @Numbers 6:24 - 26. That was the blessing wherewith the high priest blessed Israel, but then it was the blessing of God. As I was saying, He is the source of all: "Of whom are all things", (@1 Corinthians 8:6) and everything must revert to Him. All that comes in between is for adjustment, and in the adjustment the Lord as Man becomes supreme in the family. He there acquires His own distinctive place. Since in grace He has taken a position in it. He is pre-eminent in it, but is in it, so *Joseph* is addressed in chapter 49, not Ephraim and Manasseh, and he has the blessing.
Ques. Would you connect that with @Hebrews 1: "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows", @Hebrews 1:9?
J.T. Yes. "*Above* thy fellows". God has given Him that place.
G.A.T. Would you say that anyone who disowns Christ today has no claim upon God?
J.T. Quite. He is the test, you see. It is, "What think ye of Christ?" (@Matthew 22:42). "Everyone that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God", @1 John 5:1. That is one mark of the family.
W.G.B. "Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father", @1 John 2:23.
R.S.S. Your thought is an important one in connection with the testimony of the fathers and the development of filial affections, being transferred to Christ.
{391}
J.T. Yes, I believe that is the thought we do well to get hold of.
R.S.S. The necessary knowledge of the Father must be through Christ, which, of course, greatly enhances the thought of what Christ is and the revelation brought to us in Him.
J.T. That is what I was seeking to bring out. The gospels have to be read in that light.
R.S.S. I think we see the moral necessity for this, because, as John's gospel shows, and as the hymn we sang says: 
<blockquote>'Thou hast made known the Father, whom we've seen <br>In Thy blest Person -- infinite delight!' (`137:4) </blockquote>
It is in Christ that we learn and see the Father.
J.T. And so the disciples in company with the Lord from the outset would be impressed with that. He would impress them with the fact that all the Father is was there in Him, and could only be known there.
R.S.S. And that they appreciated Him thus is seen by that early verse in the gospel of John: "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth", @John 1:14. It would indicate that the disciples had been impressed by Him in their measure.
J.T. Yes, and then the epistles bring in the adjustment. I think there is the complete adjustment of family relationships in the different epistles. There had to be the disentanglement of Jewish claims, for the "children" were primarily Jews; they had to be detached from Jewish relations. Joseph's two sons were born of a Gentile mother and brought up in Egypt. Well, that had to be adjusted in relation to the other eleven sons whose experience was different and who were born for the most part in Padan-Aram. Therefore, the epistles afford the adjustment that
{392}
was necessary to bring all the elements of the family into direct relation with God in heaven. The truth of sonship was used to this end.
G.W.H-r. Is your thought the adjustment of Jews as well as Gentiles?
J.T. Yes, all have to come under it, and see "one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him", @1 Corinthians 8:6. How are we to be for Him? As in the family, as sons. We have often sung, 'And now as sons before Thy face'. Well, that brings in Joseph, so it says, "One Lord, Jesus Christ, *by whom* are all things, and we by him". (@1 Corinthians 8:6) I apprehend that He brings us in before God -- He is the Son. The book of Genesis shows the place that Joseph had with Jacob. "Israel loved Joseph", it says, and the Holy Spirit makes prominent the place that Joseph had with him, but then they must all be brought into accord with that; his own two sons as well as the other eleven needed adjustment, to be brought in suitably.
G.W.H. "That he might form the two in himself into one new man", @Ephesians 2:15.
W.C.R. What is learned of the Father now does not terminate, does it?
J.T. Oh, no, it is for ever. The education that we are receiving now is to abide. We are to be "*for him*".
W.C.R. The scripture you have quoted several times, "That God may be all in all", (@1 Corinthians 15:28) does not indicate that the thought of the Father terminates, and the thought of God becomes prominent; it is the full revelation of God more there.
J.T. Yes. You see in @1 Corinthians 15, it is "To him who is God and Father", @1 Corinthians 15:24. Well, the idea of God must remain, but the idea of Father equally remains, and it is very striking that the Lord in the message through Mary places the Father first -- "My Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", @John 20:17. That was the point then. His great thought
{393}
was to bring them into the family. Both ideas remain, but when we are to be brought into it the Father is first mentioned.
G.W.H. It has been said the last acts and words of great men are very significant. This is almost the last act of Jacob. Hearing that his father was sick, Joseph brings his sons to Jacob who blesses them. It shows the importance of the present moment, which is marked by blessing.
J.T. It does. Jacob calls his sons, after he has established Joseph's position by giving him one portion above his brethren; and says, "Gather yourselves together, and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days. Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father". You will observe there are two words 'gather' and 'assemble'. First he says,"*Gather* yourselves together", and then, "*Assemble*, yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father". The whole family now is spoken to by the great parental head, and the distinction between the two words helps. To be gathered is one thing and to be assembled is another.
W.C.R. What is the distinction?
J.T. Well, the idea of being assembled is that each one knows his place and is in it intelligently. As gathered, all were in one place, to be spoken to -- "I will *tell you"*, Jacob says. As assembled *they were to hear* : "Hear ye sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father". Therefore, Reuben would have his position, Simeon, and Levi theirs, each would know his own place in the family.
G.W.H. As appointed by the father's will and mind?
J.T. Exactly, and each would know his particular place.
G.W.H. And take it up intelligently.
J.T. As assembled. Paul says, "I speak as to
{394}
intelligent persons: do ye judge what I say" (@1 Corinthians 10:15), which implies that they were to be in assembly. It is as assembled that each has his position, knows it, and listens in that position.
R.S.S. And does he speak to them here in the order of their birth?
J.T. He does at the outset.
R.S.S. That would, I think, be in line with your thought as to the various parts being assembled, finding their place and working in order.
J.S. I suppose there never is any confusion in a company when gathered, if they know their part and place in the assembly.
J.T. In the high priest's breastplate each tribe had its place, so "Assemble yourselves" would imply that I know this. Peter, for instance, knew John's place. He beckoned to John to ask the Lord. He knew John had that particular place, but then in the Acts, Peter stands up and addresses the brethren (chapter 1:15) and obviously they recognise that he has a place also.
G.A.T. Martha was not in the good of what we are considering. If we come intelligently to our places we do not complain about others next to us.
J.T. I think one of the most important things for us to see is, what it is to be *in assembly*. Many are simply members of a congregation, whereas it is our great privilege to be in assembly.
G.A.T. "Israel your father", is the spiritual side, you said. Would "Ye sons of Jacob" be the natural side?
J.T. It is the side of *responsibility*, I think.
W.E.R. Is gathering the work of the Spirit?
J.T. There is such a thing as *our coming together*.
W.C.R. It says in @1 Corinthians 11, "When ye come together in assembly", @1 Corinthians 11:18.
J.T. That is what I was thinking of. It is not simply coming together but "together in assembly".
{395}
W.C.R. In chapter 12 we are shown the relation of each with the other, so that all function. As you were saying, the thought of assembling is that all might function properly.
G.A.T. You were speaking about the mechanical idea. The parts are all sent to a certain place, and as put together, they become a whole.
J.T. They become one unit, and I think the word is therefore rightly used in that connection. It shows the importance of brethren learning to assemble instead of being simply members of a congregation; as assembled each one has his place and functions in it.
R.S.S. Is not the Lord's presence necessary in view of our being thus gathered, in order to rightly form us?
J.T. I think He comes to us as assembled, but we come together in assembly, in the light that governs the position.
W.C.R. We come together sometimes as units, instead of seeing that each is to fit into his particular niche with a view to forming a whole?
J.T. That is what one has been endeavouring to convey. I believe many of our young people are quite irresponsible. They fail to accept responsibility as members of the body fitting in and functioning. They do not see the force of it, whereas the Lord would impress upon us, that it is our privilege to assemble. Of course, we never assume to be *the* assembly in any locality, but as coming together, each in the light of it, we are in order, and the Lord can take His place amongst us.
W.C.R. When Judah came back from the captivity there were porters, doorkeepers, Nethinim and singers. They brought back sufficient for the service of God to function properly. Although the whole nation did not return to Jerusalem, there was sufficient there to answer to the mind of God.
{396}
G.A.T. In @John 20 it says the disciples were assembled, and Jesus came and stood in their midst. That is the condition to which He can come.
J.T. We ought to notice that the word 'assembled' should not be there. A feature with John is, he never emphasises the official side. He is dealing with *persons*, not with the public side, but with what is inside. The church comes down out of heaven for display, but inside it is more the family idea. The correct reading of @John 20:19 is, "Where the *disciples were"*, without saying that they were assembled. They were within and He came to them.
G.A.T. It does not fit in here, then.
J.T. It does not. 1 Corinthians fits in here. "I speak", Paul says, "as to intelligent persons: do ye judge what I say", @1 Corinthians 10:15. And then he proceeds to unfold the assembly, and each person addressed would be exercised to know what part they had in it.
G.W.H. We come up in the light of assembly relations, do we not?
J.T. Quite. And, whilst you disclaim being *the* assembly, you do claim to be in the light of it and are functioning. This is a great truth if we could only lay hold of it.
W.B-t. It will not do for someone to try and assemble a meeting as you would assemble parts in a mechanical way.
J.T. No, it is for *them* to assemble. "When ye be come together in assembly", @1 Corinthians 11:18. As you walk into the place where the saints are you regard yourself as of the assembly. You are *of it*. You may say, Well, others are also. Yes, they are; all the saints in the town are of it. They are not all present but I want to avail myself of what is available, and so I take my place with those who are recognising the assembling. This is a most important truth. The
{397}
Lord is pleased to come in and help us as we recognise it.
W.C.R. The truth of @1 Corinthians 12 is to overcome independency of one another.
J.T. And everyone, no matter how insignificant he may regard himself, or however obscure he may be, has a place to fill. So chapter 14 is the thing in working order, and what is emphasised in that chapter is the intelligence. "I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the *understanding*", @1 Corinthians 14:15.
G.W.H. Though it is a broken day you would not allow the brokenness to hinder you from assembling. You would do so in the light of what the assembly is in the mind of God.
J.T. Quite. Well now, in suggesting the passage In @Genesis 50 want to call attention to the manner in which Joseph passes on parental affections to the children, and how it bears fruit in later years. The family seed that he sowed (for the children were born on his knees), bore fruit in later generations. It says in verse 22, "And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years". The children of Israel, therefore, had the benefit of Joseph's presence with them for a great many years in Egypt; and it goes on to say that, "Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh *were born on Joseph's knees"*. See what a parent he was!
R.S.S. His great grandchildren.
J.T. Yes. What an immense thing it was for that family to have a parent like Joseph! He would continue in that way, all that was in the patriarchs, and it portrayed itself in the manner in which he took account of his posterity. He "saw Ephraim's children to the third generation; the sons also of Machir, the son of Manasseh were born on Joseph's knees".
{398}
G.W.H. Do you think the action of Joseph suggests to us the service of the Lord Jesus as nourishing us in divine love? It is marvellous to picture the Lord carrying on such service with the saints, establishing them in all that is of God.
J.T. Yes. The fact that Joseph was so linked with the patriarchs and had direct contact of course with his father, is very striking, and all this seems to enter into his own relations with his posterity. Abraham had set this forth. It says, he "dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise" (@Hebrews 11:9); and Joseph carries on this same method in regard to his descendants.
W.C.R. That is what is suggested in the sons of Machir being born upon his knees?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. It is very remarkable that they should thus have been born, showing what a parent he was.
W.C.R. Would it suggest there should be the paternal thought and desire with the people of God now, to see that there is that brought in to carry on the testimony?
J.T. I think so. One would like to maintain that instinct, and you see how, in @Numbers 27, the posterity of Machir on the feminine side showed that they profited by all this, they valued the inheritance.
W.C.R. Is that the reason you read about the daughters of Zelophehad?
J.T. Yes. "Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir". "Our father died", they say, "in his own sin", but they desired the inheritance. Abraham had conveyed to Isaac and Jacob the thought of the inheritance -- "heirs with him of the same promise", @Hebrews 11:9, and I apprehend that every true father -- Joseph and those that followed -- would convey to their children what a great inheritance they had.
R.L.G. I was thinking of the prophetic word of
{399}
Jacob, there is no blessing given to the first three sons. It is all warning, is it not? But they seem to recover themselves most beautifully when you come to Moses¬ blessing of them: "Let Reuben live, and not die", (@Deuteronomy 33:6) and Levi comes into wonderful blessing. He has recovered himself entirely.
J.T. Yes, I think Moses¬ blessing contemplates the work of the Spirit. There is no failure contemplated, so that recovery is complete in the Spirit, but if you want to get an account of young men and young women go to their father. He knows about them. Young people are known best to their parents. They may seem very nice young people in the meeting, and all that, but if you want to get an estimate of them go to their parents. Jacob *knew*, he could tell.
W.H.F. Moses¬ blessing is connected with the purpose of God. He views them in that light.
J.T. Yes, he does, and it is after the Spirit comes in typically; @Numbers 21. They are viewed as not in the flesh but in the Spirit, but a true father will take account of the failures of his children. He does not ignore them.
W.H.F. So Jacob knew more about them than Moses in that way.
J.T. Yes, he did.
R.L.G. Proverbs tells us to, "Hear ... the instruction of a father", @Proverbs 4:1.
G.A.T. Is your thought that in their generations certain families were faithful to their parents, and so we should be faithful to our Father -- God?
J.T. That is the teaching of it. You see the epistles are intended to set us up in relation to God as Father. "If ye invoke as Father him who, without regard of persons, judges according to the work of each, pass your time of sojourn in fear", @1 Peter 1:17. "That ye may be the sons of your Father" (@Matthew 5:45), the Lord says. Now that you are adjusted and set up in relation to the Father, the next thing
{400}
is to reflect His character. Jacob says, "Let my name be named upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac", @Genesis 48:16. It is the Father's name that is to be on us. The Lord says in His prayer to the Father, "When I was with them I kept them in thy name", and then "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them", @John 17:12, 26. The family in that way is marked off by the Father's name; and the Father's characteristics are to be seen in us.
R.S.S. The name signifying what is set forth in the person. It is remarkable that the names of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were upon Ephraim and Manasseh.
J.T. Well now, these five women stand out, being in the direct line of Joseph through Machir, as illustrative of family tuition and training; in due time they *value what came down to them through their fathers*. They valued the inheritance and would have it.
W.B. Why do they mention their father in connection with his death? "He was not in the band of them that banded themselves together against Jehovah in the band of Korah; but he died in his own sin", @Numbers 27:3. Why did they bring that in?
J.T. I think they were spiritual women. They evidently had a great abhorrence of party spirit, as every spiritual person has. They say their father "was not in the band of them that banded themselves together against Jehovah in the band of Korah". They apprehended that, as you can see. They say, "he died in his own sin". It was a sorrowful thing that he died thus, but it was better he should die in his own sin than in the band, because Korah's sin was apostasy. They were spiritual women and distinguished between discipline for individual guilt and discipline because of being in a band. That is
{401}
the moat terrible thing. Korah's band was a terrible uprising of the flesh. You cannot but admire the way they present their case. It says, "And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes, and the whole assembly, at the entrance of the tent of meeting". That is to say, typically they recognise the Lord Jesus in Moses, and as High Priest, in Eleazar, and those who are leaders among the saints in the princes, and the whole assembly; and they are in a public position at the entrance of the tent of meeting. They avow before all that they desire the inheritance.
J.A.R. Would you say they were in the full sense of what would keep up their father's inheritance.
J.T. They were. In the last chapter of the book the question of husbands came up. The tribe of the sons of Joseph took occasion to bring up that question, which was in order; the daughters of Zelophehad did not do so, they valued the inheritance and desired it.
G.W.H. "That ye should know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints", @Ephesians 1:18. That ye may know it. It greatly pleased Jehovah here when they were set for things. It says, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, The daughters of Zelophehad speak right".
J.T. The Holy Spirit mentions that they spoke and what they said was right.
W.G.R. What came up in the last chapter of Numbers as to their choice of husbands would be governed entirely now by their spiritual intelligence. They could not make a wrong choice there if the inheritance was before them. They had spiritual discernment and would not marry outside their own tribe then.
J.T. They were to marry whom they pleased, but in their own tribe.
{402}
W.C.R. And in view of the inheritance, that it might not pass from tribe to tribe but be kept in its right place.
R.S.S. Does not a very important principle come out in the passage just referred to in the end of Numbers? The affections of these women were to be confined to a certain sphere. There was no doubt ample scope in the tribe of Manasseh but they were not to go beyond that.
J.T. It says, "and the chief fathers of families of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel", @Numbers 36:1. And then it says: "Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well. This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry whom they please; only they shall marry one of the tribe of their father, that no inheritance of the children of Israel pass from tribe to tribe, for every one of the children of Israel shall, keep to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers". (@Numbers 36:5 - 7) And then it says, "even as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad". (@Numbers 36:10) And then, they "were married unto their uncles¬ sons. To those that were of the families of the sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, were they married; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father", @Numbers 36:11,12. These women were subject to God's commandments.
R.S.S. And set forth that principle of which we were speaking. I mean our affections should be controlled. Take for instance the question of marriage, we are not to be married to unbelievers. If there is a tendency in that direction we should immediately check it, for it would be lawlessness to pursue such a course.
{403}
FAMILY AFFECTIONS (5)
@John 20:17 - 23
J.T. It occurred to me, in connection with this reading, that it would be well for us to see that the idea of the family of God is presented in an objective way in Scripture, and particularly in this gospel; so that the message sent through Mary had in view what had been earlier presented to the disciples objectively. I was thinking of the passage in @Genesis 22 already dwelt upon; that the young men who accompanied Abraham and Isaac to the land of Moriah would have seen "*an only begotten with a father"*. Particularly after Isaac was offered up, and they went together to Beersheba. Then in Jacob's family the ten had the opportunity of seeing Joseph as loved of the father; and in Joseph, not only the true thought of the brother is seen, but he showed what a son should be to a father as well, in his relations and actions toward Jacob. They would see in him the divine idea of a brother and of a son with a father. It is in this gospel we have so often brought before us the relations of the Son with the Father. At the outset it is said, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", @John 1:14. They contemplated that, and throughout the gospel the Lord refers to His relations with the Father; particularly in His prayer, recorded in chapter 17. The disciples would have, as privileged to listen, an insight into what He was with the Father, and would see what a place they had in their relations with the Father and the Son; so that this message through Mary would bring them into the good of it. In chapter 1 we have the expression, "to them gave he the right to be children of God". (@John 1:12) This message would accord to them the liberty, that doubtless they would now desire, to
{404}
take that place; for He says, "my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". I think it is well to take it up in this way because we can only learn things aright as we learn them in Christ. The idea of the family must be learned as we see the relation in which the Lord Jesus stood with the Father.
G.A.T. Why does He start with "my Father"? Why does He not say, "my God" first?
J.T. The family idea is in view. "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God", @John 1:12. It is the only place in John's writings where we have what corresponds with the expression, "our Father". Elsewhere it is almost invariably, "*the* Father", or "*my* Father". Here we have, "*your* Father", so that we are privileged to enter the circle of relationship, and have the same liberty accorded to us in which Christ is, through this message.
R.S.S. By the way in which several of the epistles begin, do you not get the same thing? For instance, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ", ( @2 Corinthians 1:3).
J.T. But that is Paul, or Peter ( @1 Peter 1: 3), not John.
R.S.S. I see, you are speaking of John's writings when you speak of "Our Father" in that way.
W.B-t. "Whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and mother", @Mark 3:35. The family thought is an all embracing one; much larger than that of the assembly.
J.T. It is. There are *families* (@Ephesians 3:15), and I think the distinction would arise from the mothers. Compare @Galatians 4.
W.B-t. Not from the fathers?
G.W.H-n. Would it be carrying the type too far to say that Joseph's sons are typified here? The fruit of Joseph's toil was the sons he presents to Jacob. The Lord's pathway was over here, and as the fruit of His toil He says, "Go to my brethren
{405}
and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".
J.T. I think Jacob linked on Joseph's sons with his family. It was the end of Joseph's ministry in that sense, in regard to Jacob. He brought an additional element into the family.
G.W.H-n. Would you not say, that of all the fruit of Joseph's life -- his exaltation and ministry, none is so precious as the two sons that Jacob claimed.
J.T. Well, he says, "they shall be mine". They were on no less a platform than the others, "as Reuben and Simeon", @Genesis 48:5. The Lord, it seems to me, brings the disciples into direct relation with the Father in this message. That was what He had in view throughout, that they should be brought into this relationship because all must revert to the Father. He comes forth from the Father but goes back *with these*.
R.S.S. In the beginning of this gospel we have children referred to: they have right to be called the children of God, not children of the Father. Do you get that expression in Scripture?
J.T. In @Matthew 5 we have "Children (or sons) of your Father".
R.S.S. That is a moral thought.
J.T. It is, and it is a cognate thought with the children of God as you see them in John's epistle. They are like their Father. "In this are manifested the children of God", @1 John 3:10. In what? In the practice of righteousness. That is to say, they are known publicly, as such in the practice of righteousness. It is much like Matthew, "The sons of your Father who is in the heavens". (@Matthew 5:45) They are like their Father, but then in John's gospel it is that you *take that place*. How many are able to do that? It takes moral power in the soul to do it. The Lord gave them *right* to take that place.
H.W.D. You mean faith will not do?
{406}
J.T. The privilege is accorded to you, but it is a great thing to be *able* to take that place. Immediately following, you have: "who have been born, not of blood nor of flesh's will nor of man's will, but of God", @John 1:13. That is the next thing to consider.
G.A.T. "Behold, I and the children which God has given me". Is that the idea?
J.T. Yes. You see the taking of the place is an act of your own. The nature that sustains you in it, is the result of God's work -- "who *have been* born, ... of God".
R.S.S. Does the thought of children involve moral likeness in life and nature?
J.T. I think so.
W.B-t. In @Luke 3 it says, "which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God". (@Luke 3:38) It contains a different idea, but would you throw a little light on it?
J.T. Adam was "of God", as the passage should read. God breathed into Adam's nostrils and he became a living soul. @Genesis 1 speaks of living souls swarming. They are such by the word of God, but Adam was made a living soul by the *breath* of God, and in that way became His "offspring". Paul says, "Being therefore the offspring of God, we ought not to think that which is divine to be like gold", @Acts 17:29. That is, one ought to determine from oneself what God is. So that man, through Adam, had a wonderful place in the creation, but then in John's gospel one great point is that you take the place of children, and this passage (chapter 20) lets us into the light and gain of it.
G.W.H. His activities in chapters I and 20 were to enable them to take this place.
J.T. That is it. Chapter 1 lays down the thesis, as it were: "He came to his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them (whoever they were and wherever they were)
{407}
gave he the right to be children of God", @John 1:11,12. Then the gospel opens the subject up.
R.S.S. Your thought is that it requires courage to *take the place* of the children of God?
J.T. It does. It takes holy boldness, which God would encourage in us.
R.S.S. You have confidence and ability to appropriate what God places within your reach.
H.W.D. His death and resurrection come in between chapter 1 and our passage.
J.T. Yes, and then all the unfolding objectively of the parental idea in Christ, and what sonship is as seen in Him, because the next thing is, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, *who is in the bosom of the Father*, he hath declared him", @John 1:18.
Then, in verse 14: "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only begotten with a father", @John 1:14. They could speak of that, it was something *contemplated*, into which they are admitted in measure in this message.
W.C.R. Our title in chapter 1, to take the place of children of God, we see effectuated in chapter 20. The family comes into view there.
J.T. That is it. Having in view the sending of them out. "As the Father sent me forth", He says, "I also send you". After saying that He breathes into them. They are in that way, I think, constituted fit representatives of Him, for they received His Spirit, and are now regarded as trustworthy. John develops that side.
W.C.R. He links them with the Father in chapter 20 at once. If the family comes into view that relationship must be recognised, and for the first time He speaks to them of His Father and their Father, His God and their God. He brings them into that relationship now, and gives them His own Spirit, that they might enjoy it.
G.A.T. Is that the "power" we get in chapter 1?
{408}
J.T. It refers to that, I think. He lifts them into that position. This message is a sort of Magna Charta of the family. We must never let it go. It is the ground of our position. "To them gave he the right to be the children of God", @John 1:12.
G.A.T. On the simple act of believing, is that the idea?
J.T. It is said of those that *receive* Him. It is not simply believing, but *receiving* Him.
G.A.T. How would you explain that?
J.T. "As many as received him". He is presented to be received, and those that receive Him prove that they are born of God. He is the test, and those who value Christ, answer to it.
W.B. It all turns on that. The reception of Christ, or the place He has in the affections, is really the proof of work of God in the soul.
G.A.T. Zacchaeus received Him into his house is that the idea?
J.T. Yes, he "received him *joyfully*".
R.S.S. Would "As many as received him" not refer to the remnant in Israel that received the Lord when He came? If one of these recognised and received Him he would be given the right to take the place of the children of God. Of course, the same is true of *everyone* who receives Him, and we may each inquire. Have *I* received Him? The passage adds, "to those that believe on his name", @John 1:12. The gospel of John is distinct from the other three in its character; it presents to us the revelation of divine Persons.
J.T. Yes, and that is the basis really of family relationships.
R.S.S. Exactly.
J.T. So he says, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only begotten with a father", @John 1:14. That is the kind of glory contemplated. If we can understand what it is to be an only one with a father, that is what they saw. The reciprocal affections
{409}
between a father and an only one were seen. And you can understand how, in contemplating those affections, the desire would grow to have part in them.
R.S.S. It is wonderful to have an inlet into what is revealed in regard to divine Persons.
J.T. Yes.
R.S.S. How great the thought is!
J.T. One could hardly define how they saw the Lord in this way, but they did. They *contemplated* Him thus. That is, they must have seen Him in certain exercises and movements outside of ordinary affairs. For instance, in @John 17 they were undoubtedly present when He prayed, and we know from @Luke 11, that He was praying in a certain place and one of them said, "Lord, teach us to pray", @Luke 11:1. They would have seen Him in that attitude and it would affect their hearts. The word 'contemplated' shows how they appreciated the thing. It was no passing event with them; the effect of it remained.
R.S.S. It was the way the Lord prayed that affected the thief on the cross, I am sure. "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do", @Luke 23:34. I suppose it was that which broke his heart.
G.A.T. Do you think they were so impressed by the way He prayed that it created in them a desire to pray in like manner?
J.T. Yes, "Lord, teach us to pray". (@Luke 11:1) It says, "He was in a certain place praying" (@Luke 11:1), and again, "He was praying alone", @Luke 9:18. It does not appear that He ever prayed *with* them, but they were privileged to see how He prayed, and to see in prayer His peculiar relations with the Father, and they were affected by it.
R.S.S. It is very striking how He taught them. He gave them a form of words, but enlarges on it by giving them an indication of the character of God in what follows: "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?" etc.,
{410}
and then, "How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" (@Luke 11:11 - 13) -- the greatest gift of all. I think the idea was to teach them the character of the One they were addressing in prayer.
J.T. And then to know how to be *with* God as Father and how to he *with* men as brethren. I think Joseph helps us as showing what a son should be with a father, for we see in him what a true son is. And he taught his brethren what a brother should be.
W.B-t. In chapter 20 the Lord says, "My Father and your Father". He brings them into the conscious knowledge of the relationship on their side, does He not?
J.T. Yes. It would be an exercise now, I judge, for the disciples as to how they were to be with the Father. If you are to be admitted to the presence of a great personage the exercise would be, How am I to be suitably with him? Applying this to ourselves, we have to learn how the Son was with the Father. If I do not know that, I shall not know how to be with Him. It must be learnt from the Son.
W.B-t. Is that connected with the work of God in you?
J.T. It is, but you see, the thing is to *contemplate*.
W.B-t. I was thinking of what you were saying about the Lord praying, and the disciples desiring to be taught to pray. They desired to know how to address God; but here there is the added thought -- "My Father and your Father; my God and your God". There is a distinct advance beyond being taught to pray.
J.T. What would come into their souls, and what should come into ours is, How am I to be with the Father? and then, How am I to be with the brethren? I have to learn both these things through Christ; this was how the apostles learned. "We have contemplated", they say; this would bring the idea
{411}
into their souls, and now, through the message, they are admitted, into that which they contemplated.
W.C.R. Is there not a suggestion, of this in our chapter? Mary does not quite understand how to be with Him. She could touch Him, but He says, in principle, You must be with Me on entirely new ground now.
J.T. That is it.
H.W.D. The disciples rejoiced upon seeing the Lord. This would be because they had Him back in resurrection, but I gather from what you are saying that their joy would be enhanced because of having been admitted into the same circle in which they had contemplated Him.
J.T. It would, in as far as they were able to apprehend it then.
H.W.D. That would give them immense joy.
J.T. It would, as far as understood. One would like to get clearly the thought of contemplation, because that is what enables you to be in the family relationship. If you do not contemplate how Jesus was with the Father, how can you be in that relationship? You must learn from Him.
W.C.R. Does that not bring in the thought of the holiest?
J.T. In a way it would. I was thinking of that. You go in there to contemplate really, and as you apprehend the Lord with God you know what to do. I believe only those who frequent the holiest know how to act in the assembly, because it is in the assembly we come into family relationship and privilege, and as apprehending what Christ is with God; you know how to be with Him also. One feels that one knows little about being with God. Paul says, "For I, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God", @Galatians 2:19. But if he lived to God he must live according to Christ. What God has before Him is that we may be brought up to that standard.
{412}
R.S.S. Our brother asked if knowing how to be with the Father involved, a subjective work in us. Contemplation is not exactly subjective, it is rather objective; but are not both found in the end of @2 Corinthians 3, where it says, "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord, ... are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit?", @2 Corinthians 3:18. That is, you get the objective and the subjective there.
J.T. Yes, you do. The work of God necessarily underlies everything -- that which God effects in me sovereignly, and there is that by which *I am affected* through my intelligence. There is also that which *He effects* through my intelligence, which gradually takes form in me as I contemplate.
G.A.T. Is the thought of contemplating of which you have been speaking akin to choosing the good part?
J.T. Pretty much. Mary sat at the Lord's feet and heard His word, but we learn from others as well, you know. It is God's way of teaching us by presenting things objectively to us. Now if it be a question of the family with which we are engaged, we have to learn how to be in it from the Lord, and John's gospel brings that before us.
G.A.T. If we take the place of being children of God, as having the right to do so, God will look down and expect from us the manners that belong to the family of God.
J.T. He does. That is one thing I believe the Lord would especially emphasise -- family affections. It is for these He looks.
W.H.F. It is in the holiest, is it not, that these divine instructions are given? It would therefore be a question of the individual entering the holiest, and of the light Christ presents to us there. I understand the holiest to be a moral thought, it is really
{413}
Christ now, and not a material thing as in the days of Israel.
J.T. Yes. Of course the holiest is a wide subject and includes more than what Christ is in family relations; indeed, it is on a different line and involves what He is as the One through whom God effects all His will. It is really the apprehending of what He is with God, and the instruction obtained in the holiest you bring into the assembly. Apprehending Christ in this way enables one to come out in increased power in relation to the things of God here. No one knows what it is to be in the assembly, or to be in the Lord's service really, unless conversant with the holiest.
W.H.F. And I suppose it is the impression the soul gets from the Lord in the holiest which enables him to minister for the Lord in the assembly. Would you go with that?
J.T. I think so. There is something about it that is distinctive.
H.W.D. Is @John 1 rather an indication of what is in the holiest?
J.T. It is a similar idea; it refers to what Christ was with God.
G.W.H-n. Would you say the Lord's service in John's gospel is pretty much the declaration of the Father's name: "I have made known to them thy name?" (@John 17:26). That is, He was setting before them what the Father was, and what they should be to the Father with Himself in their midst. "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", @Hebrews 2:12. The disclosure of what the Father was to them, fitted them for this response.
J.T. Yes, quite. "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", (@Hebrews 2:12) would involve what we have been saying. They had contemplated His glory as an only one with the Father, and have now been brought
{414}
into it themselves, so that He is in their midst. It would be well to note that what we get in this chapter has largely in view what they were to be *here*. "As the Father sent me forth", He says, "I also send you". They were to be here according to what He was.
G.W.H-n. Seeing that He was going to ascend.
J.T. Exactly. He was about to ascend, and they were to remain here, and in saying that He breathed into them to the end that they might be here according to Himself.
G.A.T. Is this not really the carrying through of what God had in His mind in connection with Adam? He said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness";(@Genesis 1:26) and having formed him, He "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life", @Genesis 2:7. Here the family is seen in His own image and likeness and He breathes into them.
J.T. Yes, He had in view that they should have His Spirit. I think the children of God, as sent into the world, are patterned after Him. "He breathed into them" and sent them out with His Spirit.
G.A.T. He has thus secured for God what was in God's mind at the outset, that He should have men down here morally like Christ.
J.T. Yes, "My Father and your Father" refers to our private relations with God, or privileges, but "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you", is our public service.
G.W.H-n. In the beginning of @Acts 4 they are publicly seen to be of the same Spirit as Jesus. Is that the idea?
J.T. Yes, quite. "Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, which is the ninth hour", @Acts 3:1. They represented what the Lord left here. That is to say, Peter is the *administrative* side and John the *family* side. These are the two features of our position -- administration
{415}
in Peter and family affections in John. If these are found together you have Christianity; that which the Lord intended to represent Him in this world.
G.A.T. And would bear testimony.
J.T. Yes, so chapters 3 and 4 of the Acts are what you might call "Peter-and-John" chapters; they are marked by Peter's and John's relations to each other, as if the Holy Spirit would set out in these two men, at the beginning, a delineation of the dispensation. The one representing administration in a spiritual way, and the other the family of God. These two things should go hand in hand, so that Peter says, "Look on *us"*. They characterise the present dispensation. Then we see the fruit of this in the healed man *holding* Peter and John. What a sight for the people!
W.H.F. Having "the Spirit of Christ" (@Romans 8:9), would answer to the Lord's breathing into the disciples here.
J.T. It would; they are constituted of Him by His breath.
G.A.T. You spoke of the man, who had sat at the Beautiful gate, holding Peter and John. How would you apply that to the Christian today?
J.T. Well, every Christian should hold them -- hold the administrative side and the family side.
G.W.H-n. You hold both Peter and John.
J.T. Yes, "Open" brethren make a great deal of the family -- of the brethren, but they do not hold *Peter*. They are lax on the administrative side, i.e. the order of the house of God. We want both. You cannot have the former if you have not the latter.
G.A.T. It is remarkable that this man makes such progress in so short a time, when many who have been on the way for years, have not even seen what Peter and John represent.
J.T. If you look at those chapters, the healed man was with them all through; and it says, "Having
{416}
been let go, they came to their own company" (@Acts 4:23), and he, doubtless, with them.
G.A.T. Peter and, John could point to him as a testimony to the healing power of God in the soul.
R.S.S. He was a living witness.
J.T. He was indeed.
G.W.H-n. Peter and John were maintaining what the Lord presented here.
J.T. That is what one was thinking. Breathing into them He set them up in this way, and in representing Him they know what to do.
G.W.H-n. The family is for the Father's heart; but administration has to do with outward order and blessing.
J.T. That is just what one had in mind. John represents the family, and the administrative side subserves it. The family *abides*, but there will be no need for administration, in that way, in heaven. Peter's line is a provisional one. "The elders which are among you I exhort", Peter says. "Who am their fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also am partaker of the glory about to be revealed; shepherd the flock of God which is among you", @1 Peter 5:1, 2. That is what Peter was exercised about, and you can see that it would subserve John's line, because if they are shepherded and cared for, the family affections would have liberty of action; so that John is closely allied to Peter at the outset, because the Spirit of God would, I think, present to us the full idea of the dispensation. Therefore, John drops out of view after chapter 4; then it is Peter, and later you get Paul and Barnabas, but the primary thought is to present the dispensation in these two apostles, Peter and John.
R.S.S. Would you say that Joseph set forth both Peter and John, especially after his brethren came to Egypt? He was lord in Egypt, and yet he occupied the place of lordship and headship to them. Lordship
{417}
has to do with administration and headship more with what you have been speaking of as family relations, has it not?
J.T. And what we have already considered, that the children of Machir were born on Joseph's knees; this would be John distinctively. "I write unto you, little children", (@1 John 2:13) John says. He also writes to the "young men" and "fathers", showing his affectionate care for the family.
R.S.S. It is very remarkable that we get in the Old Testament these wonderful descriptions of New Testament truths. There could hardly have been a more unlovely family than Jacob's at the time they cast their brother into the pit, and then sold him as a slave, and sent home and told their father a lie in regard to it; and living that lie for about thirteen years. You could hardly imagine a more unlovely condition in a family than that -- the deceit all the time in their hearts. Now the striking thing that takes place is the way in which Joseph deals with his brethren, so that he brings them to that wonderfully interesting point where Judah reminds Joseph, not knowing who he was, of what he had asked them, namely, "Have ye a father, or a brother". (@Genesis 44:19) It is not Joseph saying it now, but Judah; he had now learned what fatherly and brotherly affections were. It is perfectly marvellous that God should have taken up a family in such a condition, and have brought about such an absolute reversal of it. How like God it is!
J.T. And would you not think that John is like Joseph in that way, reflecting the Lord, of course? In Revelation he writes as a brother. He is a "brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation", @Revelation 1:9. The family had become deranged again: Ephesus had left its first love, and more serious conditions followed, but John's ministry is effectual in recovery, so that at the end of Revelation it is, "He that overcomes shall
{418}
inherit these things, and. I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son", @Revelation 21:7. That is the end, the overcomer is brought back to the family privilege.
G.W.H-n. When administration broke down, then John revives the family.
J.T. Quite so. I think that word, "I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son", (@Revelation 21:7) reminds us of God's *primary* thought; that, after all the failure, He reverts to what was originally before Him.
G.A.T. Do you not think the secret of Judah coming to the point he did was that he had already confessed that "God has found out the iniquity of thy servants?", @Genesis 45:16.
R.S.S. Quite so, because it is confession that clears the ground.
J.T. It is an immense thing that God has recovered us to the light of the family; now it is for us to come into the benefit of the true Joseph's adjusting ministry; and, as having adjusted us, He would perpetuate the family feelings and instincts, as we see in Joseph in the way he saw the generations of Israel, and how that the children of Machir were born on his knees. The book of Revelation, I believe, corresponds; it is, "I, John, your *brother"*, (@Revelation 1:9) who writes it, and he would bring the brethren back to the recognition of family relationships and affections.
"He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son", @Revelation 21:7.
G.W.H-n. Is not an administrator one who exercises authority on behalf of and for another? And it is really the authority of Christ in the house of God that is exercised by those who have His authority.
J.T. Just so. The Lord said to Peter, "Feed my lambs"; "Shepherd my sheep"; "Feed my sheep", @John 21:15 - 17. He gave him that definite commission. Then Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, and what of this man?", @John 21:21. That is, John. And the
{419}
character of John's service was well known to Peter afterward, for he and John went up to the temple *together*.
G.W.H-n. "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?"(@John 21:22) John is to continue, as it were.
J.T. Quite so.
S.W.P. Should everyone possess administrative ability?
J.T. I think there ought to be a sense of responsibility in that you cannot suffer sin upon your brother. If you know of that which is inimical to the house of God, or interferes with its activities, you ought to make it known. A sense of responsibility is a great thing, and everyone should accept it.
H.W.D. Would affection make you administrative?
J.T. I think it would. In a family one child helps another. One has noticed it often, the care an older, child has over the younger. That, I think, ought to characterise every Christian.
G.W.H-n. And in that care for a younger child it is parental care delineated.
J.T. It is learnt from the parent and carried out.
G.A.T. Then we are to bear one another's burdens.
J.T. You want to see everyone right.
G.A.T. If you saw something wrong going on would you report it?
J.T. One has known of cases where things were known to others and it was not made generally known, and the sin developed. The sea of glass denotes transparency *underneath* ; everything is open; you do not want to keep anything hidden. Transparency is a great feature in the house of God.
{420}
THE PRESENT MINISTRY OF CHRIST
@Deuteronomy 1:1 - 8; @2 Corinthians 3:1 - 18
What I have in view in reading these scriptures is to speak about the present ministry of Christ. Christians generally have little or no knowledge of the Lord as Minister. Indeed, many of the Lord's dear people could hardly give an account of the Lord at all, if they were questioned; and where ignorance of Him in regard to His present place exists, there is great exposure. Saints in such ignorance are exposed to the enemy in a peculiar way.
You will remember how of old, when Moses was on the mount with the Lord, the Israelites said: "For this Moses, the man that has brought us up out of the land of Egypt -- we do not know what has become of him!", @Exodus 32:1; and in that state the suggestion was made by the people that Aaron should make gods for them. That is to say, ignorance of or indifference to the Lord, exposes us to the awful sin of idolatry. They said, "We do not know what has become of him!", @Exodus 32:1.
One is reminded in that connection, by way of contrast, of a lover of Christ. The Song of Solomon depicts the exercises of such a one. The Lord alone, beloved, knows these exercises. He know the diverse elements in us even though having love for Him, If there be love in us, He has set it there, but He knows, alas! what is there, within us, which accompanies it, and what discipline is necessary in order that that love should come to light in its own brilliancy and purity. Indeed, in reading John's writings, we are impressed with this, that he insists on things being just as they are. Everything must be of its own kind. There must be no admixture. The divine nature must be brought to light and so the discipline
{421}
is necessary, in order that all contrary to it might go. Hence Peter says to the Lord, "thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee", @John 21:17. The Lord did know, but in order that it should come into evidence the process of discipline had to be introduced. The feminine speaker in the Song of Solomon had to go through the discipline, but she was a lover of Christ. It is a love song, and not a one-sided one, thank God! There are two speakers in it.
That is what the Lord is aiming at. He would bring us to join Him, and so, if you read that book, you will see how it is brought about: the bride comes to the point of describing the object of her affections. She knew Him so well that she could delineate His Person in His absence. She presents a perfect picture without the Person being before her eyes. His appearance was so impressed upon her that she could delineate it, and so impress others that they asked her, "Whither is thy beloved gone?" Can you tell, Christian, where He now is? "Whither is thy beloved gone, ... that we may seek him with thee?"
(@Song of Songs 6:1). Do you know, dear brethren, that if we know the Lord and can speak of Him rightly, as she could, that others, with whom we come into contact would like to know Him too, and seek Him with us? She can describe Him, and then tell where He is. "My beloved", she says, "is gone down into his garden", @Song of Songs 6:2.
Now, it is as apprehending the Lord thus that we come to rightly understand His present ministry, the ministry of His love, and that, I apprehend, is in view in the *glory* of the Lord in the chapter read from 2 Corinthians, which we *behold*.
We read of the glory of Christ in the next chapter. He has varied glories. Indeed, every glory rests on Him in some way. Any glory, or fancied glory, that does not rest there is to be disregarded. So that, if
{422}
it be the glory of the Lord, it is the glory of One who administers. Do you know, Christian, what that is? Have you discovered in your spiritual history that there is One in heaven who is caring for you constantly? If you are sick, He is the physician. If you are in trouble, He is the sympathiser. No ill can befall you, no sorrow can arise, that He cannot meet.
So you find this: you become acquainted with Him and presently you say, Well, it is the Lord. You trace everything to Him. Not one thing can happen without Him, and as you accustom yourself to connecting everything with Him, you gradually see the wisdom of every move, of every occurrence, and presently you see the love that is in it, for wisdom is but the handmaid of love, and as you see the love you see the glory. The glory of the Lord -- the One who on high is watching over every saint on earth.
You say, What place have I to fill? Well, the first thing for you to discover is the place you have in the heart of Christ. The first thing is to know Him -- to read the breastplate. Learn to read it. You will find your own name in it, and, as you discover your name there, you begin to see that all the official power vested in Christ is for the moment active on your behalf. Can anything be greater than that? All His official power for the moment active on the behalf of the loved ones.
I never tire of referring to Paul's words: "The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for *me*", (@Galatians 2:20). He knew the place that he had in the breastplate, and never doubted that the love of Christ pursued him from the outset of his spiritual career until he finished it, and was received by the Lord. One is here reminded of the Rock which followed Israel. Paul says, "That Rock was Christ", @1 Corinthians 10:4. Think of that! He followed them, a mighty Water-Carrier as it were in the wilderness. The blessed
{423}
Lord thus attends to us in His grace. The Rock which followed them was the Christ, and they all drank of it. Think of the grace in His heart, leading Him to follow us in the wilderness, to refresh us with the abundance of water that He has.
Then the Ark went *before*, the people to seek out a resting place for them. They took three days¬ journey from the mount of Jehovah, and the Ark went before them in the three days¬ journey. The Rock was behind and the Ark before; as the Ark moved, Moses said, "Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee", @Numbers 10:35.
The Lord goes before and follows after, and what is in between beloved? The High Priest! He is capable, it says, of being touched with the feelings of our infirmities -- the *feelings* of them. So you see how the Lord takes account of us in His administration, and how ultimately, if not now, we come, through His gracious dealings with us, to behold the glory of the Lord; this is as we come to know Him.
As already indicated, this is something to be proved every day. In every experience, whatever it may be, you may see the Lord. Look for Him! One has often referred to the bow in the cloud; @Genesis 9. That is what faith looks for. You see the Lord in the cloud. Directly the cloud arises -- the sorrow, or whatever it may be, look for the Lord in it, and as you look for Him, and see Him, you will see the glory.
Stephen looked steadfastly into the heavens. As a Jew, he would have feelings of sorrow as he saw the Sanhedrim of Israel -- that which should have stood for what was right -- gnashing their teeth upon him.
He would have no thought of himself, but of the glory disappearing from the beloved nation. It was a calamity, a dark cloud for any godly Jew to witness, and Stephen felt it. (The Lord Himself, in contemplating Israel's rejection of Him and the judgment
{424}
about to fall in consequence, had wept over Jerusalem.) Yet, in the presence of all this, Stephen looked steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus there.
We may be assured, beloved brethren, that whatever the sorrow in our circumstances, it has not come without Him, and His love is behind all His dealings with us.
Well now, I wanted to show from Moses, the nature of the ministry connected with the passage in 2 Corinthians. You see, in Deuteronomy we have the *man*. In Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, we have the *official* -- the apostle, but in Deuteronomy the man himself speaks, and so you will find that in @Deuteronomy 10 when Moses was about to go up to the mount the second time, Jehovah says to him, "Make thee an ark of wood", @Deuteronomy 10:1. There is nothing said about the gold of the ark. It is no question now of God setting Himself forth in Christ, but of a man who is capable of sympathy for the saints, who knows what the flesh in us is capable of, and that it is useless to cultivate it, or expect anything from it. Hence it is what Moses says, as you will observe, not what he was commanded to say. The man Moses was used but it is what he says according to what Jehovah commanded him, it is not authoritative statements but an exposition. The word 'unfold' is used: "On this side the Jordan ... began Moses to unfold (or expound) this law", @Deuteronomy 1: 5. In other words, he is a type of the Lord Jesus as giving effect to the covenant -- and therein lies the glory of the One foreshadowed. It is a Man that can sympathise with us, that knows us well, but who, at the same time, knows the heart of God perfectly, who is foreshadowed in the book of Deuteronomy.
The Lord Jesus is still unfolding, one might say. He is unfolding the covenant, making the love of God effective. Paul says here of God: "Who has
{425}
also made us competent as ministers of the new covenant", or perhaps strictly, "New covenant ministers", @2 Corinthians 3:6. *They* were employed. The ministry is carried on by the Lord Jesus. It is His glory. In this respect, His glory is to make the love of God effective in your heart and in mine!
The Lord Jesus knows the love of God perfectly. He has given the fullest effect to it in dying, but He seeks to give present effect to it *in our hearts*. It is a work delightful to Him, to bring the love of God into my heart and set it there, so that it becomes active Godward and saintward, and *that is His glory*. He garnished the heavens; He upholds all things by the word of His power, but the ministry He is exercising now is peculiarly, "the glory of the Lord". Even that which was done away was introduced with glory, but there is "that which abides". It is not only introduced with glory, it "subsists in glory". Marvellous ministry! The Mediator can lay one hand upon God and the other hand upon us; He knows the heart of God, and then, beloved. He knows our hearts too. And to find a way whereby *He* brings what is in the heart of God into our hearts, calls into activity wonderful grace and wisdom in this His great service.
Paul and his associates were new covenant ministers. That is to say, they were employed by the Lord, but not here as bondmen; they were "ministers". The word is different from bondmen. They had part in the ministry, but the Lord is the Mediator of the new covenant; the ministry of it is carried on by Him. It is His ministry, and, as I said, Moses at the end of his path foreshadows it. He was at this time one hundred and nineteen years old. His life was divided up into three forties. He had been forty years in Egypt; forty years, as we may say, with God in the desert; and forty years *with God and the people* in the desert. It is one thing to be with God alone in
{426}
the desert, but another thing to be with God and the people in the desert. Being with God and the people there, he came to know them, and God in relation to them. He says of God, at the end of the third forty years, "Yea, he loved the people", @Deuteronomy 33:3. God loved the people; Moses knew that love. In the last year of his life he says virtually, I want to make that love effective in the people insomuch as it lies in me. This corresponds with what the Lord Jesus is doing today.
The book of Deuteronomy is the glory of Moses. "These are the words which Moses spoke", it says, and he spoke them, as before stated in the last year of his life, after he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan; (@Deuteronomy 1:1 - 4). You say, What does that mean? Well, it means that the Lord has brought down the flesh in us. He cannot make effective the love of God in us, in our hearts, if the flesh is dominant -- that big "I". You know, that Og was a very big man. I believe he represents you and me in our natural estimate of ourselves. I need not remark on the disposition of the flesh to exalt itself. The Corinthians, I believe, entertained Og. The apostle says, "ye are puffed up". (@1 Corinthians 5:2) Evil was in their midst and they were not ashamed of it. They were reigning as kings. They were inflated, and so had to be brought down. Og has to be slain, and Sihon, the king of the Amorites. These two kings are not in the land. They refer to you and me, to each of us naturally, before we reach the land, and the work of the Lord is to bring down the corresponding elements in us. Before we get the precious ministry of Moses, contained in Deuteronomy, Sihon and Og were slain. This is an important consideration for us.
It is after that, beloved, that you get this rich unfolding of the covenant. You are now ready for it -- ready for the love of God, and so Moses in this
{427}
wonderful book unfolds the spirituality of the law. What he brings out is that it was the love of God that was behind it, and the great result to be produced was love in the saints. Hence the lawyer asks the Lord, "Which is the great commandment in the law?" and the Lord quotes from Deuteronomy: "Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding", @Matthew 22:37. That was the law. It was the first and great commandment, showing that God is after the love of our hearts. But how can He get love from our hearts if He does not put it there? The glory of the Lord is to put that love there. He places the love of God in our hearts and that is the ministry of the covenant.
Then the Lord says, "The second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets hang", @Matthew 22:39,40. In Deuteronomy you have the *unfolding* of the law; that is, what lay behind it. The first thing Moses refers to in the unfolding is that God had said to the people that they should go into the land of Canaan; @Deuteronomy 1: 7, 8. He wants you to go into it, but how are you to go into it? In the sense of your own importance? No, it is after the destruction of Og and Sihon. Then you are ready for the love of God. If we go into the land; if we are to be, dear brethren, in family relationships, it must be as having the love of God in our hearts, and so the covenant, as I may say, subserves the family.
The Lord brings love into our hearts. He sets it there and the outcome is that we love God, and we love the brethren. It is in that light we go into the land of Canaan. Family affections belong strictly to Canaan, the sphere of the Father and Son. We go into it as having everything adjusted attaching to our responsibility in regard to us. We love God and our neighbour; we work righteousness; all that is
{428}
the result of the covenant ministry of Christ, and now we go into Canaan. Hence yon have in this book, "Ye are the sons of Jehovah", @Deuteronomy 14:1. You are to go in in the light of family relationships. The covenant subserves this relationship, so that we are in Canaan in the knowledge that we are sons of God and brethren of Christ.
Well, now, dear brethren, that is the burden of what I have to say, but I wish to add a word as to "the Spirit of the Lord". Paul says, God has made us new covenant ministers, not of the letter, but of the spirit. That corresponds with Deuteronomy. The *spirit* of the covenant is Deuteronomy. Then he says, "now the Lord is that Spirit". One might inquire, Why does it not say *Jesus* is that Spirit, or *Christ* is that Spirit? Well, the Holy Spirit is accurate, and is occupying us with one thing in this chapter, the ministry of the Lord and the manner in which it is carried on among the saints. It is carried on in holy liberty. It is what the *Lord* is doing; it is an administration. He is endeavouring to introduce into our hearts the love of God. Paul says, "having this ministry ... we faint not", @2 Corinthians 4:1. He had part in it. Christ was acting through him, so he says, "We faint not", nor do we put a veil, like Moses, on our faces. And then he goes on to say, "We all, looking at the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory".
It is the glory of the Lord we see, let us understand what this means. Let us understand what Christ is doing for us. Begin with yourself, for we may thus learn the truth in this sense. See what the Lord has done for *you*. Trace it back to Him, and in this way you see the glory. It is love that was working all the time. He is aiming at introducing the love of God into our hearts. Whatever He rolls in upon us: trouble, loss of position, sickness, death or what not -- it is the love of God that is behind it. So, *we all* 
{429}
beholding -- every one is the subject of it. "These are the words which Moses spoke", it says, "*to all Israel*", @Deuteronomy 1:1. The Lord intends that we all should begin to look with unveiled face at His glory.
It is time, beloved brethren, that we begin to think, and to trace out things, to see why this and that happened. We then learn that all was in view of the love of God being in our hearts. It is the patience and the wisdom of the Lord (His glory is in it), that He has borne with us all this time, for He wants to bring us to Himself, that the love of God may be in your hearts truly, and that there may be the outgoings of it Godward and saintward, and when the Lord effects that in us. He has achieved a triumph that He values. It is His glory, and we are to behold it, and, beholding it, we are changed into the same image.
The word 'same' there implies that we are all alike; indeed, the end in view is that all the saints on earth should be brought into this. As the new covenant is made effective in our hearts we behold the glory of the Lord. Thus there is liberty among the saints. It is the Spirit of the Lord, and where this is there is liberty. May God bless the word to us all!
{430}
THE RESURRECTION
@1 Corinthians 15
It is to be noted, that resurrection is left for the end of this epistle. Whereas it is referred to immediately in the second epistle to the Corinthians; @2 Corinthians 2:9. This, no doubt, was because of the state of things at Corinth when the first letter was written.
Here it is treated in its full bearing in regard of death as opposed to God, rather than involving the special privilege of Christians now, as in Colossians. It is a question of God's power which the existence of death challenged, and that we could not know anything beyond the grave was also challenged. "How say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?" So the apostle takes occasion to show how the moral universe must be established in resurrection.
It is presented therefore in relation to the general testimony of God rather than showing the special position of Christians now. In Colossians it is: "Ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead", @Colossians 2:12. But here it is a question of the testimony as Paul preached it in its full bearing. "But I make known to you, brethren, the glad tidings which I announced to you, which also ye received, in which also ye stand, by which also ye are saved ... unless indeed ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you, in the first place, what also I had received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures". I think it is well to see that he is dealing with the thing, as you might say, in its entirety. It is the subject itself being dealt with, and the effect should be that they were "Steadfast, unmoveable always
{431}
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord".
The burial of Christ clears the ground entirely of the man who was offensive to God in view of a new beginning for God; He having in grace taken the place of man according to the flesh. It reminds us of @2 Samuel 21, where all the bodies of the offenders had to be buried. It was after the burial that God was entreated for the land and was propitious. As if man has to learn what it says in the Psalms.
"They die, and return to their dust", @Psalm 104:29. Speaking, I
suppose, in irony of man's natural origin; he has to return to his dust, to the source of his being as regards his body, a very humbling thought. Christ has died vicariously, and was buried and has submerged the offending man; "but now is Christ risen from the dead".
It suggests @Genesis 6, "The end of all flesh is come before me", @Genesis 6:13. All flesh was submerged. If He was buried, all flesh was removed from before the sight of God -- nothing left of man according to the flesh. Crucifixion would be the character of His death which was public; but burial is putting wholly out of sight. Abraham said: "That I may bury my dead out of my sight", @Genesis 23:4. It is a remarkable statement. Though he loved Sarah, yet as dead she should be out of his sight. There is no revival of that kind of man so "God giveth it a body as it *hath pleased him"*. It is a question now of resurrection.
Resurrection is not resuscitation. The triumph of God has been secured in a Man. The Man who comes out of death first is the Man who glorified God on the earth. Resurrection involves that what comes up pleases God. The going down refers to what displeases, hence His burial is part of His vicarious work and the coming up is on account of what He is: "Christ the firstfruits" is the Man who glorified God on the earth. In Christ's resurrection something
{432}
is introduced the like of which had never existed before. Lazarus, also, and the young man of @Luke 7, and others were signs. They did not set forth the new order of man; they were brought back to the natural life. In Christ we see a Man invading the whole domain of death, and bringing everything that Satan had plunged into it out of death, so that even the wicked dead will have to say to that Man. A Man will dispose of everything for God, both those who are of His order and the wicked.
A complete triumph for God has been secured in a Man. It is really a *world out of death* we come into. It is well to take account of the fact that Christ had glorified God on earth before He died vicariously. His burial is the counterpart of His vicarious death. "Christ the firstfruits" -- He begins the new order of things, and all are brought up according to that, so the development of the teaching is: "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly". Only "It is raised in incorruption ... it is raised in glory ... it is raised in power ... it is raised a spiritual body". All these are details emphasising the character of the resurrection; but the fulness of it is: "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly". Thus we are made to correspond with Christ. "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?", @John 6:62. He came from heaven and went to heaven.
There is a connection with @Leviticus 23. There we have Christ the firstfruits; without that there could be no place for the feast of weeks, or Pentecost. The one necessarily depends on the other. The sheaf was waved before Jehovah by the priest. It is Christ out of death, and afterwards the "two wave loaves". God virtually says, "This is what I am going to populate My universe with". Here we have "afterward they that are Christ's at his coming". It is a question of kind of order -- the grain of wheat.
{433}
The Lord's death was not from weakness. He died in the vigour of manhood; but, then, He felt it: "Take me not away in the midst of my days", @Psalm 102:24. It was a surrender. The "much fruit" from the "corn of wheat" would include all the redeemed. The full result of His death would be seen in all that are His. When the Sadducees raised the question of the resurrection the Lord said: "Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God", @Matthew 22:29. Then He cites that passage in @Exodus 3: "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living", @Matthew 22:32. The revelation He made to Abraham involved this, and then He made a covenant with him, namely, that of circumcision. The sign of circumcision in the body which typically involves the Holy Spirit. The presence of the Holy Spirit gives the certainty of resurrection. The Old Testament saints did not have that. "For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh", @Philippians 3:3. The Holy Spirit is the power by which we are to be raised, so that we *already* have the victory. It is not only that we *shall* have it; but we *have got it*. "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory". The truth of resurrection is taken up here only with the saints. It does not refer to the wicked dead here. Resurrection, as it is dealt with here, carries with it a moral thought; it is not resuscitation. The wicked dead shall be brought back; but the *principle*, of resurrection brings in a new order of things -- that which is of God.
The first burial in Scripture is in the light of resurrection. Abraham bought a field in which to bury Sarah. It was bought in the light of resurrection. Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph had that spot in view. It is interesting that Isaac (as typifying Christ risen) was introduced before burial is mentioned.
{434}
First, we have in @Genesis 17: "I am the almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect". (@Genesis 17:1) Then Isaac is brought in on that principle -- God's almightiness. Then he is raised from the dead -- received back in a figure. There is the idea of a new order of things in Isaac. The man out of death comes into view, and then the burial of Sarah.
Death is looked at as an enemy as it affects the saints of God. It is a penalty in regard of the wicked. It was a penalty on man as having sinned. Viewed as a penalty it is not an enemy, it is God's servant; but as Satan uses it against the people of God it is an enemy. It is dealt with in this chapter in regard of those who are touched by the power and life of Christ. "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive". That brings in the idea of headship. It does not include the wicked dead. "For all live unto him" in @Luke 20:38, refers to those who had faith.
Resurrection is the annulling of death for us. When I am taken out of death it has no power over me; in fact, Colossians and Ephesians teach that it has no power over us now; but it is annulled *literally* when you are taken out of the grave. An unconverted man is afraid to die; death is God's penalty on him. After the redeemed are taken out of death the wicked are still retained there. For them hades and death are a penalty.
No one really understands death save those who have the Spirit. You understand the consequences of death. You see it first of all as a penalty; but then you see it also as in Satan's possession which he uses against the people of God and against God. This chapter shows that the saints get the victory from that point of view. The wicked dead never get victory. We have a figure of it in Goliath who had a sword, a figure of death, and he wielded it over the Israelites for forty days, typical of the period in
{435}
which Satan held men in terror by death. David took it out of Goliath's hand and used it against him. Scripture teaches us that death is *ours* now; @1 Corinthians 3:22.
Although Satan had the power of death, he could use it only as God permitted him. He was not permitted to touch Job's life; @Job 2:6. Satan has put many men to death; the martyrs witness to this.
Resurrection as power applies to the wicked dead also: "The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation", @John 5:28, 29. But there is nothing new in them. They are simply brought back to be consigned to what is called "the second death"
-- the lake of fire. Death is ours now in the sense in which you can apply it against the flesh; besides, it may be the means of our departing to be with Christ. "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death". A condition of things will be brought to pass in which death will never have a footing again. Now, through faith, those "who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage"(@Hebrews 2:15) are delivered. Primarily death was a penalty. "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die", @Genesis 2:17. So that it says: "Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression", @Romans 5:14.
It is thus seen extending over the whole race of men; but in the Jordan it is seen in a *condensed* form as acting against God. It was an enemy -- it was between the people of God and the land of promise. It is in connection with the land we see the full idea of the enemy and there it disappeared. The Red Sea did not disappear. Death remains on the earth today as it always did, emphasised sometimes more than at other times; but when you come
{436}
to the Jordan the thing disappears -- it is cut off out of sight; in fact, when the people came to the Jordan there is no water in it at all; that is what has come to pass for faith, so that we have the victory *now*. The nearer you get to death the more you realise it is so.
"All that are *in the grave* shall hear his voice, and shall come forth", @John 5:28,29. Individual identity will remain in the glorified state. The principle in regard to the condition of the man *inwardly*, applies to the *outward* , that is, the thing as to *its character* ,for instance, now that you are born of God, you are inwardly "as is the heavenly". That refers to us as Christians *already* ; but still we are known here on the earth as the same persons; there is now no physical change; our identity remains. So, as regards the body, all that it shall he evidently comes out of heaven. "Raised in incorruption" -- "raised in glory" -- "raised in power" -- "raised a spiritual body". All that does not come out of the earth, it comes from heaven; but it is a question of the *character* of the thing. You will be recognisable as the same person. It is not that the body is brought down and formed at that moment; it is changed by the power of God; but yet it will be "our house which is from heaven", @2 Corinthians 5:2.
If it were a matter of God creating a new set of bodies in heaven, that would not convey the idea -- that would take us back to the original thought of creation. The idea is power -- what God *can do*. The body of humiliation is under divine power, transformed like unto His glorious body and "according to the working of the power which he has even to subdue all things to himself", @Philippians 3:21. The subduing is being effected now in a moral way in the souls of the saints and the consummation of that will be when we get our new bodies.
"But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body". (@1 Corinthians 15:38) God does it
{437}
instantly. "We shall all be changed, in a *moment*, in the twinkling of an eye". So yon can understand the word: "The exceeding greatness of his power", @Ephesians 1:19.
The body in which we are raised could not be identical in a material sense, because it is to be spiritual in contrast to the natural; but identity conveys the thought that the same features are there, so that you are recognisable. The Lord after His resurrection said: "Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see", @Luke 24:39, and yet it was a spiritual body.
It is all set forth in the Lord. He is the pattern of what follows, only we must always guard that He did not see corruption. It is marvellous that God can do all this in a moment. "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye". The question as to what bodies Moses and Elias appeared in is easily solved by the knowledge of God. This is the solution of all these problems; the Lord met the Sadducees: "Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God?"(@Mark 12:24) We cannot naturally understand how Enoch was translated that he should not see death, nor in what body he was taken to heaven; but the knowledge of God in one's soul sets us at rest about it.
Moses and Elias were recognisable. As we grow old resurrection is more appreciated. You come to the top of a hill, so to speak, and then you see over and down, from a natural point of view, and it is an immense thing to apprehend the truth of resurrection. Of course, it should be seen at the outset, but I think it becomes greatly accentuated as we grow old. When the ark went into the Jordan it was two thousand cubits beyond the people; but the nearer they got to the river the more they perceived the water was gone.
@John 5 distinguishes between quickening and raising: "For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom
{438}
he will", @John 5:21. If you take it in its application to us at the present time, as in Colossians, we are said to be "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead ... . And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him", @Colossians 2:12,13. Being raised with Christ through the faith of the operation of God gives you a new footing or status; quickening gives you the inward power viewed in the order in which they occur literally "at the end". In @Ephesians 2 we have quickening, and then raising up; this latter, however, goes further than resurrection.
Verses 20 - 28 come in parenthetically as showing the full bearing of resurrection and then the end: "When all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all". That is what, I suppose, we may call the final, fixed order of things. The mediatorial kingdom is brought to an end so that God rests. He *is all* as the *Object* of the hearts of His creatures and *in all* as *life*.
In verse 28 the Spirit turns from speaking of the Lord as Christ, to the Son. It takes you back to @John 5, where divine Persons are acting together: "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work". (@John 5:17) Now the Father has given all things into the hands of the Son, so it becomes a mediatorial system and He works until all is brought to God, when there is no disturbing element.
Verse 35 introduces the question, "How are the dead raised up?" The apostle enlarges his answer so as to show the character of the body as it comes up and then he says: "Behold, I show you a mystery"; he opens up the mystery to the saints: "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump".
{439}
THE GOSPEL AS ASSURING THE BELIEVER
@Isaiah 7:3; @Isaiah 36: 2 - 4, 13, 14, 22; @Isaiah 37:1 - 10, 14, 15, 33 - 38
My message this evening is intended more for believers than for unbelievers, although God will not overlook the unbelievers, if there are any present. I am concerned as to believers, knowing that the enemy is abroad and active constantly to shake their confidence in God, and to rob them of the joy of their salvation; to rob them of the sense of security. He goes about, we are told, "as a roaring lion ... seeking whom he may devour" (@1 Peter 5:8) -- figurative language but forceful. The "whom" specially includes Christians. Satan seeks to devour them. Young believers move about, and when sunshine is upon them and things go more or less well, they overlook the fact that the enemy of their souls is lurking about all the time, using what may come to light in themselves, or in their environments, to damage their souls; and hence such need the gospel that I hope to present -- the gospel of *assurance*, that they may be preserved in what they have, and *advance* in it.
The verse I read in @Isaiah 7, presents a general principle in this book -- "a remnant shall return". This is illustrated in a son by the side of his father who is a prophet: it is seen in a significant locality -- "the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field". That is where the prophet stands with his son by his side, whose name is Shear-jashub, meaning "a remnant shall return". God is pleased to use various means of impressing the truth upon us, amongst these a boy, sometimes a girl, sometimes a child or a babe; here it is the son of the prophet, and he is by the side of his father in a certain geographical position which has its own meaning -- "the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the
{440}
fuller's field". It is a position taken possession of, as it were, in the testimony. God is pleased to move out and take up positions in His grace so as to affect men and women and children, and the enemy's effort will be to dislodge Him from that, as it were; not that the enemy could move God, but he can occupy the position in such a way as to becloud the testimony presented in it, and thus to baffle those who believe.
You see this in Rabshakeh who was in the exact position in which Isaiah stood with his son. Someone has seen Isaiah there, or has heard of him being there, and has believed and has returned to God; he says, "I see from this testimony that a remnant will return and I want to be amongst them", and he joins them. This doubtless describes how some of you got blessing; you said, "Others are coming into it, why not I?" and so you have taken up your position with those who accepted Christ.
The position of Isaiah and Shear-jashub is light to your soul. You say, "That word, 'a remnant shall return', came in power to my soul. It is not that I have power in myself to return; the excellency of the power is of God, but I am responsible to return, and others are returning, so I will return". To whom do I return? I return *to God*. As the watchman of Dumah says, "If ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come", @Isaiah 21:12. If there be any inquiry as to Isaiah, or Shear-jashub, or the highway of the fuller's field, or the conduit of the upper pool, the point in all that is, *return*. It is no matter for you to inquire of out of curiosity, the thing is for you to return; others are doing so but others returning will do you no good, it is for you to return; and so one has returned.
These chapters indicate that there was a remnant; Hezekiah speaks of "the remnant that is left"; these had returned and the enemy's point is to get them, and take them off to a land like their own land, as he says; that is to get the believer diverted
{441}
from the light that he has enjoyed, from the position he has taken up as of the remnant of the saved ones. There are such as are being saved; we are told in the New Testament that "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved" (@Acts 2:47): some had taken up that position, and some have taken it up today. Most of us here have taken it up, most of us here have truly returned to God.
But, beloved friends, while the salvation of God is assured to the true believer, it is a *continuous* thing -- to be realised every day. The gospel of our salvation that is announced, is a gospel that takes account of us every moment of our lives in this world, until we are safely housed in heaven when the Lord Jesus Christ comes for us and takes us to be with Himself. The gospel of our salvation applies to every moment of our existence down here, and, therefore, we need assurance in it.
If there are those here who have *not* returned, there is a word for them. The inquiry is "Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said. The morning cometh and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: *return*, come". (@Isaiah 21:11,12) That is the point in the book in the light in which I am looking at it. If there is any enquiry in your heart tonight, the answer of the Spirit of God to you is, "Return, come".
Most of us, as I said, *have* returned, but we need assurance. There is much more soul-trouble amongst us than is reported, or than is known. Wives do not know the soul troubles of their husbands, nor do husbands know the soul troubles of their wives, nor do fathers of their children, or brothers of their sisters. Soul troubles are very largely secret troubles, hence the great need of an assuring gospel. That, indeed, is what Luke had in mind in his great treatise which stands out as specially evangelical. It is written to one individual, and it is to *assure him of the things into which he had been instructed* ;(@Luke 1:4).
{442}
Possibly he lived in affluent circumstances -- the enemy would get into those circumstances, such circumstances are very vulnerable, and Luke knew it; the Spirit of God knew it, and He would fortify Theophilus, as in them, against the inroads of the devil. The enemy would come and say to him, "Theophilus, are you quite sure that the Lord Jesus is a divine Person? Are you quite sure that He is not an imposter or a myth? Did you ever see Him? Maybe you have believed falsehoods". How comforting Luke's letter would be to him. Every believer should read Luke with that in view, so that he may be constantly in the enjoyment of the things the gospel proposes, in the good and enjoyment of his salvation. There can be no doubt that Theophilus gained by it, for the second treatise indicates plainly enough that he was getting on, it shows that he had gained by the first: Luke does not call him "excellent" the second time, he is *nearer* to him; the servant of the Lord is nearer to him in his spirit and can address him more simply.
But then it is not only circumstances of affluence that expose us to the inroads of the devil, the most ordinary circumstances can do this as we see here in Rabshakeh's speeches. First he addresses Hezekiah -- there is a message to Hezekiah the king, he would shake *his* confidence: but then he says, "I am not here only to speak to Hezekiah, I am here to speak to 'the men that sit upon the wall'", the commonality of the people, and he uses their language, their very vernacular; for it is nothing to the devil whether he uses slang or the most refined language -- he can use both: his aim is to get at your soul and shake your confidence in God, and deprive you of the joy of your salvation, and consequently render you valueless in the testimony of God here.
You will see that in this position that Rabshakeh took up, the enemy is bent on nullifying the position
{443}
of chapter 7. Think of the difference between Isaiah the prophet and his son, standing in the highway of the fuller's field, and the Assyrian general standing there! It is a question of your soul. It is a question of either hearing the prophet of God, representing the testimony of God, the gospel, or what the enemy would say. How often it is that one's mind, which had been opened to the testimony of God, and enjoyed it, is presently occupied by the devil in his whisperings. "What are you trusting in?" he says. "You were at a gospel meeting and the brethren were sitting around you, and you *thought* you believed, but you have been deceived; besides, what is there to trust in?" That is how the enemy shatters the joy of many believers -- by introducing doubts; and then he flourishes Sennacherib -- "The great king, the king of Assyria", he says -- I am only his servant, he is greater than I. Such are the enemy's ways, he magnifies himself: as we read, he is a "roaring lion"; a lion is bad enough, but think of a *roaring* one!
So here he plants himself in the very position occupied a little before by the testimony of God. The testimony of God brought joy to your heart, peace to your conscience, deliverance to your soul: the enemy says, "I want to get that soul and rob him of all these things". Is it not so? These chapters are to teach us how it may *not* be so, how we can overcome the enemy, we overcome him "by the blood of the Lamb", as it says elsewhere; @Revelation 12:11. We can overcome him with the testimony that we believe, as it says, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you", @James 4:7. How are we to resist him? By the word of God -- the testimony we have received. If he challenges me as to the death of Christ, I have a testimony with which to answer him, the irrefutable testimony of the gospel: if he challenges me about my forgiveness, I have the word
{444}
of God with which to answer him: if he challenges me about righteousness, I can answer him with the word of God. Whatever it be he challenges me about, I have the word of God with which to answer him, and he flees, for he has to do with what is greater than he is. "The virgin daughter of Zion", for instance, is just a Christian.
You believed a few weeks ago, or a few months ago, or a few years ago; you have been unconquerable through the testimony of the gospel held in your soul by faith, and you shake your head at the enemy, you laugh him to scorn; that is the great result of these chapters: a daughter of Zion is just one who is in the sense of the sovereign mercy of God. Scripture says, "According to his own mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit", @Titus 3:5. The enemy says, "Look what you did yesterday; look what you thought"; but you reply, "I am no worse now than I was before God took me up". I am not putting a premium on the least little bit of sin in any Christian, but suppose it happens, and it does happen, we are told "we all often offend" (@James 3:2), and Satan charges you with the happening, you overcome him by the testimony of the death and resurrection of Christ. He will magnify the happening, he will make the happening greater than the death of Christ, greater than God. But we read "If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things", @1 John 3:20. And so, if you are a daughter of Zion, you can say, "God is as great now as He was before I was converted; He is as gracious now as He was before I was converted; He is the same to me now, I acknowledge my sin". You say to the devil, "I own what you allege, but I am not going to allow you to make it any more than it is; nor will I allow you to make it so great that the blood of Christ cannot cleanse it".
{445}
That is, in effect, what the daughter of Zion says, and the enemy has to flee: he *must* flee. Finally he goes down to Tophet that is prepared for him; @Isaiah 30:33. After all, Satan is but a creature, maybe the greatest of creatures, but still a creature; and one day an angel will come down with a chain and bind him, and cast him into a pit, and leave him there for a thousand years; @Revelation 20:1 - 3. It is extremely ignominious for Satan that one angel can imprison him, and after an appointed time, let him out again for God's purposes. He is but a creature, but he goes about as a roaring lion to rob saints of the joy of the gospel they have believed, and make them as bad as they were before, so that sometimes they forget they were purged from their old sins (@2 Peter 1:9), and they become blind and cannot see afar off. What a great triumph for the devil when he secures that in any Christian!
The words of Rabshakeh sound very effective, but what he finds is an *ordered* state of things. A characteristic Christian is well ordered; here we have one "over the household", we have a "scribe" and we have a "chronicler". To be disordered is to expose you all the more to the onslaughts of the devil. So these three men came out to meet Rabshakeh, and they act very wisely; it would not do to send the men on the wall to meet this great personage. Eliakim, the man over the house, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the chronicler, went. They represent the ordered way in which the true believer meets such an onslaught as this. Now, dear brethren, and young people especially, I would urge this -- that you have your inward affairs ordered. I mean that the believer is to have the departments, so to speak, of his moral being rightly controlled. These three men represent the three-fold responsibility of the institution -- if you will allow me to use that word. There was a great system at Jerusalem, there was the king, and all
{446}
these department heads, and they are available as soon as the enemy attacks. Thus, God coming in, the enemy is utterly defeated.
To explain: sometimes we get up late in the morning and we have to rush off to business, there is hardly time to eat the breakfast; there is no prayer, there is no reading, there is no time for going over things with God. There is no Eliakim over the house, so to speak, there is no regulation, no authority maintained. Something happens on the way to business, or after you get to the business, and you give way to the flesh and thus there is defeat. You have been to the gospel meeting on Sunday night (maybe this happens on Monday) you have been, as it were, on "the highway of the fuller's field"; you have been there on the Sunday evening, and on the Monday, as I said, there is neglect. Eliakim over the house has had nothing to say, there is irresponsibility to God. Maybe there is a sense of responsibility to your employer, for you are thinking of your salary and your progress in the business, but irresponsibility in-regard to God. There can be no headway made if there is disregard of responsibility to God. It is as sure as possible as you proceed on that way you will come in for defeat. Rabshakeh will be in the place of Isaiah, and Rabshakeh's army instead of Isaiah's son, Shear-jashub. You will be thinking of his power, and forgetting the testimony of God, forgetting the precious thought that you are one of the returned remnant, one of those who has a place with God, one added to those that are saved, as Scripture says, "The Lord added ... those that were to be saved", @Acts 2:47. You forget all that, and you come home in the evening a defeated Christian. Your countenance is little different on the train or on the bus or on the street, to the ordinary unconverted man or woman: you have lost your colour, you have lost your joy, you have lost the good of your salvation.
{447}
Then there is not only the general thought of Eliakim over the house, but there is Shebna the scribe; a scribe is an *accurate* man, he is not loose, he does not generalise, he takes item by item. We have here two words, one is the scribe, and the other is the chronicler. They both allude, as is obvious, to accuracy, to the noting down of things and recognising in an accurate sort of way, things for which we are responsible. They represent the fact, that not only daily, but hourly, and minutely, we must have relations with God. God has had it in view that His people should be in constant relation with Him, making constant reference to Him, and referring in detail, with accuracy to Him. Our very life is made up of that. It is the joy of God to have His people in holy relations with Himself according to these principles.
Now these three men are in full view of the enemy, and they know what to do. They do not speak when they should not speak, they keep silent, and they tell others to keep silent; they are, we may say, in control. But then they have deep feelings; they represent *responsibility* in the Christian. So that we read in verse 22, "Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh". You see how serious they are, and this specially enters into the lines on which a believer's progress is made. Their clothes are rent, as you will observe; the enemy is attacking, and they are unable to meet him. Rent clothes signify a certain remissness, that *something* needs adjustment. I have to learn that the garments in which I have been appearing have to be rent; a change has to come about. The believer's life is made up of that. If I speak of it positively we go from glory to glory -- "We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the
{448}
glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory", @2 Corinthians 3:18. And again, "They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God", @Psalm 84:7.
If I speak of it negatively, it is rending the garments; what I have been yesterday, I must not be today, I must progress. You will understand, that I am not putting you under law, I am showing you how you are to be preserved in the joy of your salvation; for certainly it is as important that Christians should be preserved in their Christianity, as it is to get others who are not Christians into Christianity. It is obviously a great matter to keep those who are in it, while not ignoring those who are not. Who can tell how many have dropped out? Is there not a gospel to prevent turning away, to prevent retrogression, to prevent apostasy? Surely there is! and these chapters are to show us that there can be no return, no washing white in the fuller's field, save by the death of Christ; nor can there be any preservation in the salvation to which we have come, save by the same means. So we have in the book of Revelation, "Blessed are they that wash their robes" (@Revelation 22:14), not that "*have* washed them"; we have that in the earlier part of the book; chapter 7:14. There are those who *have washed* their robes in the blood of the Lamb; there are those who "*wash* their robes". To omit the latter is to miss the joy of your salvation and to render yourself useless in the testimony of God. It is, therefore, a matter of the greatest importance that the gospel presented should make plain the provision made in the death and resurrection of Christ, that Christians should be preserved and go from strength to strength in Zion.
So, as I said, there is the rending of garments, and these men come to Hezekiah, and Hezekiah is moved; he is the most responsible of all, and he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth;
{449}
as responsibility increases, self-judgment increases. Sometimes @Luke 15 is read as if repentance were a mere historical thing, whereas it is a continuous thing; it is a *repenting* sinner who causes joy in the presence of God. Who is it who has not anything to repent of? The light and power of the gospel must always be kept fresh in our minds, and this involves continual repentance. The gospel is needed by every one of us, till the last moment of our sojourn in this world. It is a question of going from strength to strength, of being preserved in that into which we have been introduced through the gospel. Our salvation is to be continuous, and these chapters show the way of it.
So we find in Hezekiah, not only the rending of his clothes, but the putting on of sackcloth. Now he sent these two men -- "Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna, the scribe" -- the third man is left out, that is Joah, instead of him we have "the elders of the priests"; showing that in responsibility exercised in this way, there is increase of holiness and intelligence; that is a great advance. The sense of holiness "without which no man shall see the Lord" (@Hebrews 12:14) is coming into the soul. There is approach to God only on the principle of holiness; but the believer as judging himself, as seen here, has the principle of holiness. The Lord Jesus was raised from the dead "according to the spirit of holiness", (@Romans 1:4) and the spirit of holiness is in every true believer; the love of God is shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Spirit; @Romans 5:5. The priests here (@Isaiah 37:2) represent the feature of holiness. They come to Isaiah, the true representative of God, and Isaiah gives the most comforting word; there is not a word of rebuke, it is all grace; for this is a wanton attack of the enemy, and the enemy has no conscience, no feelings, no remorse, and God knows this. He knows the enemy is as a roaring lion going about seeking
{450}
whom he may devour, and God is concerned that your soul might be preserved, so He has peculiar consideration for us in these circumstances. You are covered in sackcloth, your clothes are rent, you are not full of pride, you are not blaming anybody but yourself; and heaven loves such an attitude in the believer; there is indeed joy in the presence of the angels of God on account of that. So as you will observe in verse 6, Isaiah says to them, "Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. Behold I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land". Is that not assurance? Need we fear him? No, beloved, we have means of meeting him. Indeed God here through His prophet indicates that *He* is going to do it.
Now, that is the first chapter, so to speak, in the process; the next is that the enemy is defeated, but not absolutely so. We have to watch these *second* attacks; he has to go, but instead of coming back, he sends a *letter*. The enemy has thousands of writers at the present time by which to damage the souls of the people of God, in letters, articles in magazines and novels; lying things are being constantly written about God and Christ and Christianity, at the same time exalting man as known in this world. All these things are intended to darken and baffle the saint. It is another mode of attack; he is not now attacking in the fuller's field, he is dislodged from there; he is warring somewhere else. The Lord Jesus has annulled him through death; we have only to resist him and he flees; the Lord said, "Get thee hence, Satan", (@Matthew 4:10) and he had to go; so also has he to go from the Christian as he resists him. Rabshakeh had to go back, but in going he writes a letter. I would warn
{451}
young people here about these letters written, by agents of the devil, these books that shake your confidence in God.
What does Hezekiah do about the letter? He spreads it out before the Lord. He does not send the elders of the priests any more, or Eliakim or Shebna, he goes *himself*, and he goes into *the house of the Lord*. How beautiful this is! How God would encourage every one of us to come into His own sphere, where the enemy has no power. He spreads the letter out before Him. I would urge you to read the whole passage from the standpoint of what I am saying. In verse 31 it says, "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward", @Isaiah 37:31. That is what we all are through grace, if we are Christians. "Therefore, thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow ...". That is the assurance the believer obtains as he goes direct to God as threatened by the devil. "He shall not come into this city". What assurance! You say, "Do Christians get to that point?" They do: Paul says, "Unto us which *are saved"*, (@1 Corinthians 1:18). I remember when I suffered from doubts as I believe some of you do; I do not now. Not that I want you to think of me, but of what is possible for the Christian. The enemy cannot shoot inside where deliverance is known; he shall never get an arrow there. Instead of being in the flesh, the delivered saint is in the Spirit -- "Ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit" (@Romans 8:9); when I accept that, as I may, and maintain it in the power of the Spirit, Satan can never harass me inside. "If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you", @Romans 8:9. I ask every believer here to think of that. So that we are "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time", @1 Peter 1:5.
{452}
No one who preaches a full gospel will fail to bring these things forward, that believers might be really and truly saved and assured of their salvation, and thus a living testimony to God. And so Jehovah goes on to say here, "By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the Lord. For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake". God is acting on account of Christ. And the Lord Himself says that we are in His hands, and in the hands of the Father, and none can pluck us out of Their hands; @John 10. In our scripture we have God working for us in power through faith, so that we are delivered and kept by it.
The final confirmatory word is: "The angel of the Lord went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses"; and the king himself is destroyed, as we see in verse 38. So that, beloved friends, you see here how faith lays hold of the thoughts of God, and proves that He is greater than the devil; as is written: "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world", @1 John 4:4. God maintains the believer in this world in full salvation, and consequently in testimony for Him until the Lord comes.
May God bless these thoughts to us.
{453}
MANHOOD MARKING THE PRESENT DISPENSATION
@Ephesians 4:1 - 16; @Ezekiel 47:6, 7,12
J.T. The epistle to the Thessalonians gives features of early growth in an assembly, corresponding with the book of Hosea. The expression, "When Israel was a child" refers to early growth, to youthful life as pleasing to God; then it says, "I called my son out of Egypt", (@Hosea 11:1) the latter passage corresponding with Ephesians, where full development is in view, for while sonship applies to all believers, each taking account of himself as a son, yet the thought involves full development -- manhood. So God says He called His son out of Egypt, having said to Pharaoh, "Let my son go, that he may serve me", @Exodus 4:23. Sonship involves maturity, and we may see how it is reached consciously, and how divine service is thus secured in the saints.
The passage in Ezekiel serves to show how the energy of the Spirit which marks the present dispensation results in manhood, for trees undoubtedly allude to that. In verse 7 we get the idea of it. Then there is the fruitfulness of the trees, and the evergreenness which would mark those who are prominent among the saints. One idea of a tree is prominence -- not what exists on official ground merely. There is also the thought of fruitfulness. We have, "They shall still bring forth fruit in old age", @Psalm 92:14. Ministry is said to be to that end, that we may "all arrive ... at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ". (@Ephesians 4:13) The fulness of Christ alludes to what came out in Him as man.
Ques. What is the thought of the "prisoner of the Christ" in @Ephesians 3:1?
J.T. I suppose the deflection in the apostle's path is referred to as turning aside to the Jews,
{454}
when the Lord intended him to be among the Gentiles; it seems as if the Lord would have him be among the Gentiles; Christ Himself was among them (@Colossians 1:27); for the principle of ministry is not what you *say* only, but what you *are* amongst the saints. The divine idea was to be there concretely.
Rem. You have in chapter 4, "I, the prisoner *in* the Lord";(@Ephesians 4:1) in chapter 3 it is "prisoner of the Christ Jesus".
J.T. It is a question of the Lord having him where He wished him to be -- a minister among the Gentiles. His imprisonment meant that he was to be taken among the Gentiles. "Prisoner in the Lord" means under the Lord wholly; his natural feelings were not active now.
Ques. Does this chapter show how we come into the truth of sonship?
J.T. Yes; full manhood involving sonship. We are no longer to be babes, though we begin there. Babes are most interesting, but if that state continues beyond the normal age, there is occasion for reproof, as at Corinth. Gifts are not given to children, but where there is maturity. The Corinthians were using gifts as children use toys.
Rem. The unity of the faith is introduced.
J.T. Yes. The banks of the river allude to that, a system of doctrine in relation to which the Holy Spirit operates. The Holy Spirit does not operate here, there, and everywhere; there are fixed limits in relation to which His activities are found -- "banks", in that sense. Gifts are not given to babes, not given to be misused. In Paul we have what the man was, not merely what he ministered. In @Ephesians 4:11 the gifts are persons.
One has to distinguish between the grace given to all as in verse 7 and specific gifts; every Christian has a measure of grace, but gifts go beyond that.
{455}
Rem. Gifts are the spoil of the ascended Man; as viewed thus, we cannot value them too highly.
J.T. Specific gifts involve prominence in those who have them; this is suggested in the trees. There is not much to look at in the bare trunk of a tree; as soon as it ceases to bear fruit or leaves it should be cut down. It is the divine intent that gifts should be prominent, and the scripture in Ezekiel indicates that they stand in relation to "banks". The trees derive all their sap from the river, but their position is on the banks. Wherever the waters came everything that had life was affected, but the trees had a distinct place. There was gift among the Corinthians, but Paul says, "In your minds be grown men", @1 Corinthians 14:20. Prominence after the flesh marked them.
Rem. "The trees of Jehovah are satisfied", @Psalm 104:16. Would that preserve us from human aspirations; living in one's gift, for instance?
J.T. The apostle says, "The life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God";(@Galatians 2:20) he was not living in his service. Lowliness, as in verse 2 of the chapter we are considering, marks one who has gone through discipline. The "prisoner in the Lord" implies entire subjection to the Lord, that he was wholly at the Lord's bidding. The greatest epistles issued from the prison in Rome.
Things are to be set right, so he calls on the Ephesians to "walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye have been called, with all lowliness and meekness", @Ephesians 4:1,2.
Ques. Do we get virgin affection and the light of sonship in Moses¬ song?
J.T. Israel was "holiness unto the Lord"; the two thoughts, holiness and maturity, go together. The apostle could not speak to the Corinthians as to grown, men, but as to babes. It is like verses 6 and 7
of @Ezekiel 47, whereas verse 12 gives the full thought of manhood -- trees *for food*. If God distinguishes a
{456}
man, it is for the good of others. The faithful and wise servant could minister a portion of food to the household in due season; he would know the kind of food to give each month.
Then when we come to @Ephesians 4:13, "Till *we all* arrive", the distinguished ones merge. It requires grace and humility to take one's place as with the brethren in the body. Gifts are not said to be in the body, they are in the assembly.
Ques. Are gifts food in the way they suggest Christ to us?
J.T. The intent in giving gifts is to minister food "for the work of the ministry", hence if you become bare -- no leaves or fruit -- of what value are you? Leaves indicate profession, they are not valueless, they are for medicine, as it says; healing power is connected with them. It is profession as evidencing life, the leaf does not fade. The general profession of Christianity is beneficial when in the energy of life. It is a good thing in ministry to convey a right thought, not only in what I say, but in what I am. "There is one body and one Spirit, as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all". There is this fixed order of things in relation to which all divine operations are carried on; unity pervades everything in that order of things, so that the grace given in a general way is to maintain a state of health, so to speak; "To each one of us has been given grace"; a general healthy state of things is thus preserved. The saints having generally a sense: of direct supply are preserved from clericalism, while making full room for specific gifts.
Then the apostle goes on to show that the Lord descended. He went into the lower parts of the earth; how much it cost Him to bring all this to pass. And now he comes to the specific gifts: first
{457}
apostles -- those vested with authority -- to bring about subjection. "Some apostles" -- a number of men who embodied the authority of Christ and who were marked by power. The apostles personally have passed away, but their ministry was essential at the outset. When the three thousand were brought in at Pentecost, it is stated that they continued stedfastly in the apostles¬ doctrine, and fellowship, etc.; they came immediately into the moral benefit of the presence of the apostles. The apostles¬ doctrine is a system of teaching that is authoritative, that commands the assent of the mind. There is no hope of any one unless subject to the authority of Christ. In the letters of the apostles we have embodied what is necessary for us.
Rem. There is the Spirit's flow, so we have the banks.
J.T. Yes, *men* gradually sprang up. Take a man like Barnabas; he comes to light in connection with a new movement in Acts. He merges among the others, but is a most conspicuous link in the testimony, illustrating what is in view in Ezekiel. In @Acts 14:14 you get the expression, "the apostles Barnabas and Paul". Barnabas was not an apostle from the first, he was distinguished as "a son of consolation", and later as "a good man and full of the Holy Spirit". (@Acts 11:24) He was distinguished morally rather than officially.
Then we have prophecy: "and some prophets". The order of the gifts is very instructive and applies at any time. Unless there is subjection to the authority of Christ the mind of God cannot be brought in, in the prophet. So at Antioch a prophet foretold the famine; there were others there who could convey the mind of God; @Acts 11:2, 28; chapter 13:1.
Then the evangelist, "and some evangelists" -- Philip, for example. Stephen, again, was a prominent man by moral power; though only a deacon as far as his commission went, yet he was a distinguished
{458}
vessel ( *most* distinguished) and stood out as an instance of what the Lord would do.
Rem. He used the strength that remained to him to kneel down and pray for his murderers.
J.T. Yes, it is beautiful. The evangelist is free after the apostles and prophets have done their work; so from Antioch Paul and Barnabas are sent out. Following on that, there are pastors and teachers, persons who could take care of the flock, for all those operations involve a flock. Note that "pastor and teacher" is one person: "and some shepherds and teachers". The gifts are "for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ". The body of Christ is to continue eternally; the work of the gifts is to edify it *now*.
Ques. How do you distinguish between the body and the assembly?
J.T. The body is an organism; the assembly is a company of intelligent persons.
1 Corinthians deals with the body, but as regards the gifts it says, God has set "certain in the assembly". A servant stands out by himself in the exercise of his gift. "Till we all arrive at ... the knowledge of the Son of God". This refers to Him as outside the order of things here, to the pattern of what God has in His mind in the gospels. It is an objective thought that "the fulness of the Christ" is the divine ideal; what has come out in Him as man. The epistles are to bring us to the gospels. The fulness of the Christ refers to what has come out in Him personally, not to the body, though the body will become expressive of it all by-and-by. It is "the fulness of him that filleth all in all", @Ephesians 1:23.
Ques. What is the unity of the faith?
J.T. There are to be no diverse thoughts among the saints in regard to doctrine. "Faith" there refers to the system of teaching. "Unity of the
{459}
Spirit" refers to the feelings and affections, but the unity of the faith to what has been presented in doctrine. They run together; one the public teaching which has come out, the other the feelings and affections that go with it. If brethren hold different views, it is not the unity of the faith. There should be ability to discern the truth and hold it. Peter spoke of things in Paul's teaching which were hard to be understood, but the unity of the Spirit underlay it and held them together. The unity of the faith marked the apostles. We love each other because of what we are personally as formed by the Spirit, as distinct from the teaching. Of course, love of the truth holds together also. Paul had previously gone to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter; that link undoubtedly ran all through, and Peter was therefore able to bear the rebuke Paul administered. The unity of the faith is maintained in the unity of the Spirit; if personal links remain and are established, there is no quarrel about the doctrine. The chief difficulty lies in the lack of affection to one another; if you love a person you will construe what he says in the best light. It is beautiful to see the maintenance of the unity of the faith and the unity of the Spirit in Peter and Paul.
Rem. The shepherd and teacher are one, you say?
J.T. Yes, such an one would keep the saints together and feed them. Shepherding is one of the most onerous of services. Ploughing and shepherding are linked together in @Luke 17, and after that is done we are to expect no reward but to say, "We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do", @Luke 17:10. Most of the distinguished men of the Old Testament were shepherds, and a shepherd was an abomination to the Egyptians.
{460}
LISTENING TO CHRIST
@Mark 3:31 - 35
In these verses the Lord indicates who are His brethren and regards them as a circle. He looked round "in a circuit", as it should read, on those who sat around Him. Divine love is known to those whom He indicates in this circle. They were not a circle of scientists. There are such, those who investigate and arrive at conclusions. One might speak of those who devote themselves to research and have arrived at conclusions as regards certain scientific things; but the circle of the brethren of Christ is in possession of the knowledge that none of those circles possesses. Whatever knowledge they may have as to things, the knowledge of divine love must exceed it, and this knowledge marks the brethren of Christ; they have known it. "Hereby we have known love", @1 John 3:16.
Think of that, the few, who have no earthly place, who are not marked by this world's culture, they have a knowledge that exceeds all other intelligence -- they have the knowledge of love. The apostle does not say, "Hereby we *should* know it", for John presents characteristic Christianity; he says, "Hereby we *have known* love". And how? In that Christ laid down His life for us.
I wish we could think of that, and what that circle is, and that each might have a part in it practically -- the circle which, as I said, the Lord looked round upon. He looked upon those who sat around Him. It was not a crowd standing in great curiosity round the Lord; they were *sitting*. This is suggestive of Christianity -- a circle drawn to Him sitting down to listen. Those who had natural claims
{461}
came, but they did not join the circle. They stood outside of it.
Now I mention that because many who have natural links inside are content to stand outside with very little interest. There may be a certain natural interest but there is no spiritual link. His mother and His brethren, as you will observe, stood outside and sent a message. The Lord, as He receives the message, looks around on those that sat there and listened. How happy to be found thus sitting simply and humbly and yet with the intelligence, as I remarked, that exceeds every other in the world -- the *knowledge of love*.
I do not say exactly the knowledge of the love of Christ, for that is not exactly the way John puts it. He says, "Hereby we have known love", @1 John 3:16. How happy to be in that attitude sitting humbly and simply and yet possessed with that wonderful knowledge of love, and to have the Lord. What marked the mutual ground was the fact that they sat about Christ, and He looked around on them. Can anything be so precious, dear brethren, as the fact that the Lord looks around on those who are drawn to Him, whose interest is in Him, who like Mary of Bethany are *listening* to what He is saying?
There is a difference between listening to things and hearing things. There are many things that we hear that we would prefer not to hear; but when it becomes a question of listening, then you want to hear. So Mary sat and listened to what He was saying. And so here, those in the circle of His brethren, the circle that He owns as in relationship with Him, are sitting about Him. They are not occupied with any leader or leaders, although the chapter indicates that some of the most renowned Christian leaders were there. Peter was there, as the chapter records; John and James were there,
{462}
He had selected them, for He had named them "sons of thunder", and took them into the mountain that they might he with Him and that He might send them forth to preach, and He named them.
Doubtless these were there, but those who sat around Him did not come to see or hear them -- they were sitting around *the Lord*. Hence, when the natural claim is asserted He puts forth His spiritual claim. But where did it lie? As I said, they sat about Him, but it was more than that, they "did the will of God"; that is Mark's feature of the brethren of Christ. Matthew has his own feature to present and so have Luke and John, but Mark brings forward the fact that the brethren of Christ are marked off by doing the will of God. They sat around Him and in that attitude are owned of Him as His mother and His brethren.
What I am impressed with is this, that we belong to the circle that is in the possession of this wonderful knowledge of love. No other love has any place alongside of it; hence John says, "Hereby we have known love, because he [without mentioning the name] has laid down his life for us", @1 John 3:16. That is how John puts things. The thing is so great in his mind that he does not qualify it; it is simply *love*, and then he adds, "because he has laid down his life for us".
Then there is the thought of correspondence to Christ. He immediately adds, "and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren", @1 John 3:16. I suppose it links on with Colossians, which epistle presents correspondence to Christ in the saints. I believe Colossians brings in that Christian circle in which Christ is known, as it says, "Christ in you"; that is to say, Christ in our affections, Christ among the Gentiles known in their hearts "the hope of glory"; and the point of the apostle is to bring in correspondence
{463}
with our great Leader; we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
I may not have this world's means, but there is one thing that I have more than this world's material things, and that is, I have a life from God, and it is my privilege to lay down that life for the brethren. The Lord has led the way, and so the circle is marked by it. Not only have we the knowledge of love, but it marks us, we are affected by it, and thus we know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren.
{464}
THE WORK OF AN EVANGELIST
@Luke 1:3,4; @2 Peter 1:10 - 21
One has to seek to do the work of an evangelist, without assuming to be one. The service of grace is to continue while the Holy Spirit remains here and while the Lord sits upon the Father's throne. Presently He will sit upon His own throne, what is called by Himself "the throne of his glory", @Matthew 25:31, when all the nations will be gathered before Him and He will judge them. Then afterwards He will be seen on another throne, called "the great white throne", when all the dead will stand before Him to be judged. He has now taken up His position on the Father's throne and thence is carrying on this wonderful service, which we may call the service of grace, that is, a service in which He waits on men in this world; not, indeed, that He is here personally, but He is here mediately, He is here in others, for it is said that He "came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh", @Ephesians 2:17. That preaching was through others.
This throne speaks of mercy for all, for the word of the Lord, ere He sat down upon it, in His commission to the twelve, was that repentance and remission of sins should be preached to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem; that service is in progress, and happy he who is employed in it, and happy they who are the beneficiaries of it.
It is a glorious day for you, a day which the Scriptures call "the day of salvation"; a year which the Scriptures call "the acceptable year of the Lord", (@Luke 4:19) so that I have the great honour to present to you the grace of God as it is in Christ. It is available for you. Repentance is offered to you. It is said of Esau that he found no place for repentance. The time is
{465}
coming when those who are now rejecting or neglecting or despising this wonderful proposal shall have no opportunity to make up for lost time, when the Lord shall have arisen, when the Master of the house shall have arisen and shut to the door. That is final! There is no change, the door is "shut to". Some shall come and knock. They may have been employed as church missionaries; others may have been converted through them as they spoke of Christ; they shall seek admission, but He from within shall say, "I never knew you", @Matthew 7:23.
Think of that! They may have been known in this world; statues may have been erected to them; their names may have appeared in the gazettes of the world, but the Lord says, "I never knew you", @Matthew 7:23. Think of that awful word. What about you? Doubtless you are known in your own little circle; you have a reputation. Naturally we all love to have that; we begin to establish that from the very outset -- that we might have a name of some kind and we are ever bent on enhancing it. But the word from within is this, whatever you may have here, whatever reputation, or honour, or dignity, unless you bow the knee to Christ, unless you are a repentant sinner, unless a believer in Him, that He does not know you; He will tell you so, and, not only that, but He will tell you to depart: "Depart from me". He will say then, "all ye workers of iniquity" (@Luke 13:27) -- "for whatsoever is not of faith is sin", @Romans 14:23. You may think you are doing good works; the Lord takes no account of them, they are not acceptable, they are sin if they are not of faith.
Now alongside of that I would urge on any one who has not bowed to Christ -- maybe you have believing parents, maybe you have a believing wife, or a believing husband, or you are in relation intimately with those who are believers -- I would urge
{466}
upon you that *now* is the accepted time. I may do that. I have that privilege and I regard it highly that I can offer to you in the name of the Lord Jesus that "if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation". "For", it adds, "the same Lord ... is *rich* unto all that call upon him", @Romans 10:9 - 12. Think of that, of the wealth that the Lord has, and it is available to all those that call upon Him!
In reading this passage from Luke I had in mind that there are some who although they have believed are not quite sure about things, and if you are not sure you have no joy in your soul, you are exposed constantly to the enemy's attacks, and consequent upon that there is no distinct testimony seen in you, no testimony for Christ.
This gospel of Luke is addressed to an individual who was evidently, like many of us, young in the faith. Evidently he was also a man occupying some position of an official kind. He is not asked to give that up, for the grace of God was for the emperor as it is for the slave. The grace of God is far above all these things. "For what is your life?" saith James, "it is even a vapour", @James 4:14. How quickly it passes away; and therefore what are the things here, beloved friends? They are not worth considering. God is no respecter of persons; He would have all men to be saved; and so Theophilus, although called excellent, is addressed as a believer. He is not quite sure about the things into which he had been instructed, however. Is there any one of us who is not quite sure? You have been a believer nominally; it may be that you do not know when you were converted. I have often heard people say they did not know, and this caused regret. When I ask a
{467}
person when he was converted and he says, I do not just know, I always regret that, because if you do not just know the date, my impression is that you are not very sure; that you have not built up from the bottom; that you did not strike rock before you started to build. Of course if you are sure *now* all is well; and I could not belittle anything of God in any way; but Luke speaks about method here, "to write unto thee with method" and he speaks of being *accurately* acquainted with things *from the outset*.
Paul, it may be remarked, speaks of his spiritual history from the outset. This is an important matter, more important than the date of your natural birth, much more important. God would have us methodical, therefore if one does not know when he took a definite stand in regard to Christ, then I am doubtful whether he has built up on solid ground. And if there is uncertainty in any one I would urge you to consider this gospel -- it is written by Luke to Theophilus so that he might be certain of the things he had already received, that he had been taught. But how many things we may receive in the way of instruction and yet not be sure about them! "That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed". Well now, this gospel should be read; I would urge every one to read it carefully; it will establish you in assurance of the things that are presented to you in Christ in the gospel.
I would now refer to a word in the prophet Isaiah in regard of Christ. He is said to be "as a nail in a *sure* place", @Isaiah 22:23. I suppose the "nail" is Christ according to the way Luke presents Him: the narrative is most touching, the angel announces to the shepherds who are keeping their flocks by night -- they are abiding with them -- the angel is there *by them* , he did not speak to them at a distance,
{468}
he did not call out to them, he was by them. That is a principle, indeed, in the way in which Luke presents the truth.
Some of you will remember, perhaps, how that Paul in his labours as an evangelist, when he went to Thessalonica, *went in among* the people. It says he went in among them for three sabbath days; and so on Mars Hill he placed himself down alongside men, as one of them. That is the grace of God coming so nigh to you in the vessel through whom He is speaking to you that He is standing by you, and so the angel, it says, was by them there; the shepherds were abiding without, and he was by them there, and he says, "Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For *unto you*"
(that is for you tonight) "is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord", @Luke 2:10,11. He was standing by them when he said that to them; and then presently, it says, there was "a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men", @Luke 2:13,14. What do you think the feelings of those shepherds were?
Something wonderful had come in, and they are not content with the announcement of the tidings; "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem", they say, "and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us", @Luke 2:15. That is what we have to do. We want to *be sure* about things. They are too important to admit of the least shadow of a doubt, the smallest detail must be sure to us.
Throughout the gospel of Luke you have Christ as Man; He is seen praying many times. In chapters 22 and 23 you have His wonderful death. The human heart, beloved, is seen in His thoughts for mankind; as He goes out of Jerusalem the women bewail Him, but He says, "Weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children". He is not seeking
{469}
their sympathy now; they needed His, and they had it. As He went out to the cross He was thinking of them. Earlier He had Himself wept for them, He wept for that city, and He said, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets ... how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!", @Luke 13:34. A perfect human heart, and yet divine, sympathising with all, relieving all that were oppressed of the devil. And so when He is on the cross He says, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do", @Luke 23:34. How perfectly you have the Lord Jesus presented to you as the expression of the grace of God to man.
He is on the Father's throne now, but as on the cross He besought the Father to forgive them, "for they know not what they do", @Luke 23:34. Such an One was to be fastened "as a nail in a sure place", @Isaiah 22:23.
And so you get in the Acts the glad tidings that Jesus is the Christ. That, I apprehend, means that He is in the sure place, that is to say, "God hath made that same Jesus ... both Lord and Christ", @Acts 2:36. The glory of His Father's house, and every vessel great and small is to be hung, so to speak, on Christ; He is in a sure place, God has set Him down there, having come out of death -- the certainty is in His resurrection really; He was raised again, it says, "*for our justification*", so that we may be sure.
But then the sure place is where God has set Him; He has set Him down in heaven. So that in the Acts it is the glad tidings. What were they? That Jesus is made Lord and Christ; that is the glad tidings. The One who was born in this world as a Babe, who came in among men as a Man, God has raised from the dead, and given Him glory, that our faith and hope might be in God. (See @1 Peter 2:21.) He has placed the "nail", as I may say, in a sure
{470}
place, and everything now, the glory of God and all else for my soul and yours, and millions of others, can be hung on Him. He, indeed, upholds all things by the word of His power; He is set down in heaven by God, anointed and made Lord and Christ; so that we may be sure we can stake our souls with positive certainty on that blessed Man -- on that "nail in a sure place".
Now I would inquire as to whether we are sure that our sins have been disposed of for the glory of God, sure that we are justified, sure that we have the Spirit; it says, "Being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear", @Acts 2:33. That is the Holy Spirit. You want to be sure that you have Him. Someone asked me two or three days ago, Would you pray for the Holy Spirit? Well, I said, if I had not received Him I would, certainly. It may be there is someone here who has not the Spirit. The Spirit of God is for you; He is available -- but available because the Lord Jesus Christ has gone into heaven, having accomplished redemption.
Then you have in this passage in Peter certainty as to our "calling and election". What I have to say on this point I shall be saying more to those who are Christians, although, indeed, in the main I have had them before me in all that I have said; because one is impressed with this, that many are not sure about things, and if there ever was a time when we ought to be sure it is now. John is positive in his way of putting things. He says, "we know". It is not "we believe" simply, but "*we know*". So that one ought to know, ought to be sure, and again I would remark that one ought to know when one made a definite stand for Christ, and one should know all about one's history ever since. If you had been a methodical Christian you would know all about it
{471}
ever since; you would know just what you are now and what your relations are with Christ, how much you know about Him, and how much you know about God.
Now Peter would help you on that line, so that he gives you additions that are to be made. He says, "giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity (or love)", @2 Peter 1:5 - 7. This is a feature which should be noted, because the uncertainty that marks many believers is due to negligence, to carelessness. What Peter speaks about here is methodical. These qualities are not put down in a haphazard way, they are put down in the order in which they should be in our souls. Hence, if I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, the first thing that should come in is *virtue*. What I would understand by virtue is that I can say, Yes to what is of God, and I can say, No to what is of the devil. I have courage. I am definite about it. And it is this definiteness that builds up a state in our souls in which we are always sure, and being sure we are always happy in the Lord; we have got joy. I do not go down the list, I just confine myself to that, you can look at it at any time, and I would urge you to look at it.
Peter says in the verse I began with, "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ". One is thus perfectly sure in regard to himself. But then we want assurance in regard of others, and so I touch on the latter part of the chapter, because it helps us as to certainty in regard to the *whole scope of Scripture*. The enemy is endeavouring to shake the
{472}
authority of Scripture; if he could in the least degree insert any suspicion as to the book of Genesis he would succeed eventually in shaking the whole fabric of Scripture in your soul. Therefore the apostle Peter, as he was about to leave, as he was about to put off his tabernacle, said he wanted to have the saints assured, not only in regard to their own souls, but in regard of the whole scope of Scripture, indeed, in regard of revelation, of all that God is in Christ.
The little bit of ground on which I stand is not going to sink, but I am sure about the whole universe; it hangs together, you see. That is the principle of the latter part of this chapter. I not only know that I am on solid ground myself, but that every one who believes is also on solid ground, and the whole purpose of God stands; that, I apprehend, is what we get here. We have the word of prophecy made surer -- that is how it should read. It is not of private interpretation, it is of general bearing, one prophecy interlocks with another; it is all one thing; if you endeavour to undermine the one you undermine the whole superstructure; the law, and the prophets, and the psalms, as the Lord says, all hang together, and they are all for you, and they are all for me; I come to them and I get in them what I know is sure. The word of prophecy is made surer. You do well to take heed to it, it was uttered by holy men of God who were moved by the Holy Spirit, so that I am sure in regard of the great moral system that God has brought in in Christ -- I am as sure of it as I am of this great physical system that we are set in. Thank God for certainty! May we all know it.

MOURNING AND LAMENTATION
A Word given at a Burial
@2 Chronicles 35:24 - 27
Mourning has an important place in Scripture. In many instances it expresses natural affection in bereavement, and the like; but it is also the outcome of feeling in persons concerned in the testimony of God. In this sense it marks the Spirit of Christ, especially in Jeremiah, who represents this feature of our Lord peculiarly. Abraham is the first mourner mentioned in Scripture, hence it is proper to those who have faith. "Devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him", @Acts 8:2.
The passage read is instructive because of the *variety* of persons mentioned as mourning, or lamenting, for one who had been conspicuous in the service of God. Ascending the throne at the tender age of eight, Josiah in his reign was marked by extraordinary devotedness to Jehovah and zeal for what was due to Him and His house. "He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left", @2 Chronicles 34:2. Although the occasion of the king's death was not in keeping with his ministry, this did not prevent the people from lamenting it, as the verses read testify so touchingly.
Firstly, *Judah:* "Judah ... mourned for Josiah". We have here suggested the people as taken up *sovereignly* and *spared* -- for the ten tribes had already been captivated. Regarding ourselves in this light, we do well to mourn the loss of one whom God used for the protection and general help of His people.
{474}
Secondly, *Jerusalem:* "Jerusalem mourned for Josiah". Responsible for the light and government of God within our own circle and in their general bearing, the saints should indeed recognise most feelingly the removal of one who served in these things with divine approval amongst them.
Thirdly, *Jeremiah:* "Jeremiah lamented for Josiah". As already said, he "the weeping prophet", represents the Spirit of Christ seen in His sorrow, and so the mention of him here is specially worthy of note. We may well link it with the supremely touching scene at Bethany, when "Jesus wept", @John 11:35. Being a prophet, Jeremiah conveys the mind of God in this time of grief. We have in him thus the highest level on which mourning can be placed. The feelings of those conversant with the mind of God being moved by the death of a servant indicate that his ministry reached a definite spiritual elevation. The original word for lamented here suggests *control* in the expression of feeling; intelligence enters into it and so what is measured and suitable is conveyed.
Finally, *singing men and singing women* mourn. These "spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day". The memory of the honoured servant is carried down in a manner to touch the affections of later generations. The speaking of singers in their lamentations would be musical. Their lamentations would be occasioned by later occurrences, but they would *include* Josiah: he and his services would thus be *continued* in freshness in the minds and hearts of generations following. "They made them an ordinance for Israel". This is a remarkable statement, as showing that honoured servants *should not* be forgotten, but held in affectionate remembrance by the people of God. We are enjoined, "Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God", @Hebrews 13:7. "Israel"(the saints viewed spiritually) understand, and thus certain names are
{475}
cherished among us. "An ordinance" implies what is imperative. "Behold, they are written in the lamentations". In this we have the assurance that the memory of the valued servant is permanently preserved -- not only in the minds of persons, but in *writing*. This is confirmed in what follows; Josiah's "good deeds" (the original conveying exceptional quality), "according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah", being written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
