WIDOWS
@Luke 2:36 - 38; @Luke 7:11 - 16; @Luke 18:1 - 8; @Luke 21:1 - 4
I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak about widows as they are viewed in this gospel. They have a unique place in this gospel, and these four of whom I have read include all the widows spoken of in the sense of being examples, or as representing features of the truth. The Lord indeed alludes to a widow of whom I have not read, but not to one in current history then, but in past history -- the widow of Sarepta -- and His allusion shows that widowhood in itself need not be representative of what is of God, for He says, "There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias ... and to none of them was Elias sent but to Sarepta", @Luke 4:26 -- that is outside the limits of Israel. He says, he was sent "to a woman that was a widow". She was singled out and honoured of God, but, as I said, she was not in current history and those of whom I have read were in current history. The Lord so regards them and they represent or include all the widows in current history at the time; such, I mean, as are used to illustrate the truth, and in what I have to say tonight, dear brethren, I am not intending at all to occupy you with past history merely, but with current history. There are those indeed who carry on what they regard as the service of the Lord and deal in past events and future events, but what the Spirit has to say to the churches at any given time alludes to what is current. Indeed, one has often remarked, and it is well to observe it, Scripture always speaks to the person who reads it -- it has him in mind -- or to the persons who may hear him read it. And so it is tonight as I have read these scriptures, they speak to me, and they speak to you, to all of us, so that we might learn something of
{2}
widowhood and whether we are in it in any sense -- in any of those four senses spoken of in these scriptures.
Luke has in mind the women he presents to help us in regard to the assembly, more particularly its public aspect. John also has in mind to help us as to the assembly, but more as to its spiritual or inward aspect. Matthew, too, has the assembly in his mind in his gospel, but in its administrative capacity. Luke would occupy us with seemliness in our public relations, and ornamentation, too. These four scriptures afford considerable instruction as to the public position of the saints as moving or walking in relation to the assembly, as of it. What you get, dear brethren, in the first instance, is a very old widow. The book indeed occupies us at the outset with old persons, but concurrently with young persons and in the public history of the assembly, these two features always appear. One generation comes and passes away, as we are told, and another comes, but the coming one is concurrent to a point with the one passing away, and the function of the one passing away is, in a great measure, to carry forward substantially and in an exemplary way what existed in the immediate past, so that there is a consecutive history in the assembly -- the passing-away generation furnishing the coming one and so on, and hence the importance of old brothers and sisters maintaining freshness in their outlook and conversation, not occupying us unduly with their earlier days, although it is well to keep the earlier days in mind, and what they learnt from the generation that was passing away as they came in; but then also what they are themselves, for we are not historians, whether oral or in the sense of writing. A mere historian in Christianity is a bore and answerable to nobody, whereas one who is in the enjoyment of the things he has in his mind and who has added to them, not anything extremist, but what is in keeping with them, is a help; he can
{3}
be listened to. He passes away in triumph and leaves something in the way of example as well as in the way of instruction and information with the coming generation. In Luke this is exactly how he presents the truth. He introduces to us two old people. No doubt, if one were enquiring as to the brethren in this city one would enquire about the older ones, and it is well to enquire, too. There are those who stretch back a long way and have had something to do, perhaps, with the recovery of the truth in this city. So Luke would just present to you that sort of thing. He introduces to us two old people -- exemplary people, too, outwardly. You could not find anything to complain of as to their way of doing, their movements and services. Indeed Zacharias is serving in the order of his priesthood, so that the casual eye would see nothing but what was right. Elizabeth, too, is highly commended, but we are immediately told that they were accustomed to pray for things which they did not expect to get. That is a very poor thing in old brothers and sisters, and indeed, so serious is it in the mind of heaven that the brother, the responsible person, Zacharias, is stricken with dumbness for a period. Elizabeth holds her ground and joins in with the work of God, the fresh work of God that was coming in Mary. She joins with that most happily. It is a very beautiful thing to see the older ones joining in with a fresh movement, for God delights in freshness and takes up young people, seemly people, suitable people, prepared people, in order to inaugurate something fresh; and how beautiful it is when the older ones join in that, are thoroughly in it -- and that is what you get in Elizabeth. She and Mary had a delightful time in the hill country of Judaea. Zacharias had to wait for nine months or so -- a very poor time he must have had in his dumbness. He could say nothing. It was judicial, and we must not assume that although
{4}
grace is reigning God is not acting judicially, because He is acting judicially. And so Zacharias has to suffer, but then he suffered profitably, for as soon as his tongue is loosed he praises God. They are his best days; he is entirely free from all personal and natural feelings, because instead of speaking of his son, glorifying his son, he glorifies Christ, that is, he has Christ in mind -- the dayspring -- this fresh glorious thought is in his mind.
Then in chapter 2 we have two old people, that is, Simeon and Anna. I am speaking, of course, about widows, and I proceed to speak about Anna. She is said to be a very old person and that is what I have in mind in referring to her first in the midst of young people, in the midst of a great movement of God, the introduction of Jesus here on earth, a babe in the temple. Well, she is of great age, we are told, but she is thoroughly in the thing. It would perhaps be questionable in some of your minds to say she was a very, very old person, but actually she must have been more than one hundred, for I take it that she was actually in widowhood for eighty-four years. But how honourably and how beautifully she is mentioned in her earlier days. She lived with her husband for seven years. There is not a flaw, beloved friends, as far as the Spirit of God is concerned, in this person. She is of great age, knowing widowhood as perhaps no one in her times knew it, but she is completely above her circumstances. She is energetic. I need not enlarge on her because she is known so well amongst us, thank God. I am speaking of her now for one purpose. I am speaking to the older ones to begin with here. How she carried down -- how far back she must have gone. I believe the intent is to the spiritual mind that she carried down conditions depicted in Malachi to conditions in this great intervention of God, that is, the old dispensation in all that it was, spiritually, is embodied
{5}
in this wonderful widow, showing that there was no hiatus, as it were, in the testimony of God. It was carried down in quality from the one dispensation to the other. Correspondingly in any communication of God in any city or country in the world, any fresh energy of the Spirit, there is no thought whatever of disregarding what preceded it. Whatever is of God is to be accumulated and carried down, not only by historic means, but in a substantial way by those who might otherwise be overwhelmed with their circumstances, that is Anna. She is in the temple night and day, as we are told, and she came in at that instant when Simeon was speaking so beautifully, so prophetically, of Jesus. She came in at that instant. She came in at the right moment. Here are two people who are thoroughly at one in regard of Christ, in regard of this new great intervention of God. They are thoroughly at one and she in a way exceeding Simeon in activities and in priestly feelings. She spoke of Jesus. She spoke of the Lord to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem; that is to say, with her there would be no question of occupying the disinterested ones. It is a question of the interested ones. There are interested ones today. It is delightful in moving about the world to see the interested ones, the interest in their faces and feelings, in their demeanour, in their attitude towards the truth. She is engaged with interested ones, and she is engaged with them energetically, night and day in the temple, maintaining relations with God in His temple. She spoke to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem, and that is all I had to say about her.
Now I pass on to the second scripture -- a very different picture, still a widow; and Luke records the Lord Jesus as having to say to her, not she to Him, as in Anna's case. The Lord is still a babe in Anna's day, but now He is in active service and He is having
{6}
to say to her, and although this is a beautiful gospel text, I am not speaking of it from that point of view, but as bringing in the widow features as applying to us at any given time. I would be very simple and pointed, and you will bear with me in any remarks that may perhaps cut against our feelings. Her position is favourable -- it is naturally favourable. I would say, dear brethren, that that is a dangerous thing for Christians, not that we are not to enjoy things. God gives us all things richly to enjoy. The ungodly unconverted enjoy them but not as we enjoy them. Rain comes down on them and the sun shines on them, but there is no giving of thanks with them. There is no return to God; they are sinning against heaven, in that sense, in God's sight, as the prodigal did. But, dear brethren, Christians may be in very comfortable circumstances, the prospect pleases, everything is just what might be desired. I have no doubt that the common idea of Nain is that it was favourable. It was set in a good prospect. Although this was a widow, she was set in a good prospect. It was evidently a pleasing place. That is a dangerous state of things amongst the people of God. I do not say that it is illegitimate, not at all, for God prospers us as our souls prosper, and there are those He can trust these material things to; but then He says, if you are not faithful with these things you are not going to be entrusted with greater things than these; that is obvious, and the danger is that we have a nice meeting, a nice business, a nice house and car. I am not speaking against these things themselves, but to bring out what may exist. There is a serpent in it, and it has to be watched. God allows it to go on. This disaster occurred in the woman's house. This boy was probably the delight of her heart. He was an only son. How delightful an only son is; how a widowed heart would cherish an only son; her only hope in all this prospect around
{7}
in which he might one day shine. We may bring up our children and educate them, and all that goes with it, in order that they may shine in this prospect. God loves us too well to allow this. The boy dies. The widow's heart is robbed of its object, but God intends that that heart is to be filled with a restored son. He was the only son, we are told, of his mother and she was a widow. Now he is to be restored. We are told that there were a good many with her at the funeral. She was a person in favour, and that is quite possible with brethren -- to be in good favour. I do not say that it should not be, but the more we accept the reproach of Christ, the less we will be in favour. It is said of the Lord that He grew in favour with God and with men, and quite right to a point, and quite wrong beyond that. The more we accept the reproach of Christ the less we will be in favour. She had a large funeral apparently, but then the Lord is on the other course. He has a good many with Him; He has the disciples with Him. Thank God for the many Christians there are today. Let nobody be afraid of numbers -- of numbers of true disciples. There were a good many with the Lord. He loves to have His disciples with Him, He looks for it, especially as He is moving along in the testimony, as it is here. He touched the bier and says, "Young man, I say unto thee, Arise". If there is any young man or young woman here who has been brought up with worldly prospects in any sense, in any legitimate sense, it is for you to pay attention, for this young man died. It might have been said that there was not a young man in Nain that could be spared less than this young man. He was taken. The Lord knows where to strike. He knows where to strike in love, where to touch us, and then it is to give us back infinitely more than we had expected, and how different now is the prospect! The young man, we are told, "sat up, and began to speak". Think of what
{8}
might be read into this. If we look at it spiritually this young man is back from the dead. What would he speak about? Normally, what would he speak of? What would anybody ask him about? If I were to see him I would ask him something about his experience. *He began to speak*. The idea is that the thing is begun. Something that was needed is begun, and he is now given back to his mother. What a conversation they would have, dear brethren, as the pall-bearers and the funeral people dispersed, and as they were alone, what a conversation they would have! What speaking! A young man come back from the dead, and is that not what is needed? It is not oratory that we can learn in the schools and colleges, it is learning how to speak according to God. Zacharias began to speak after he was dumb. This young man was dead and he began to speak, after he was dead, now that he was risen. That is the sort of speaking, that is the speaking that enriches the saints -- the assembly: the speaking of one who has had this experience; and so the testimony is greatly enhanced, because it is said that God has visited His people. All these happenings -- if God comes into a family in this way, that has been looking towards the earth or the world, converts young people, touches them as to their baptism, enables them to take the ground of their baptism, take the ground of their being risen with Christ, and to speak accordingly, what is the effect? Something has happened. A great prophet has risen up. The testimony is to Christ and to God -- that God has visited His people. Is it not worth while? That is how the testimony goes on. It is in these visitations of God, a present application is seen in the speaking of life, the speaking that marks one who has been in death and come out of it in the power of the Spirit.
I come on to speak of the third widow, chapter 18. Here we have still a different view. It is no longer a
{9}
bright prospect. It is a city sure enough, but it is no longer Nain. The saints viewed in this light are in great distress, and the more spiritual we are, the more apart from the world we are, the more we feel these things. The adversary -- this woman had an adversary. The more we are with God in widow state in this sense, the more we shall feel it. It is keenly felt. How is this to be met? Last week we had a bright week; things were bright and cheerful amongst us. This week something has happened -- the adversary has got in. How quickly things of this kind come up. The souls of the saints are wrung with distress. They are baffled. How can it be met? There is no man to help us. It is a widow, bereft of her husband. God tests us in this way. Gloom is apt to settle down upon us and I might say surrender, but not with this widow. See what she had to contend with. Here is a judge who does not care about God or about man. The circumstances are most difficult, but the Lord says they are intended to be that. They are intended to be difficult. The case of the widow of Nain was intended, and this case was intended to bring out the latent power of faith in the saints. If we are Christians at all God has put us in these circumstances to bring out the latent sensibilities and instincts that we have and we are resolved that there can be no abandonment of the position. The way out is prayer. "Men ought always to pray", as the Lord says, "Always to pray and not to faint", @Luke 18:1. We can see how practical this is, and how unless we take it home we shall be overwhelmed. Some will give up; some will turn aside; some will say, 'I cannot go to that unjust man, I cannot persevere in that'. But the Lord is picturing difficult circumstances, and He is directing your heart, not to a difficult ungodly man, but to God, for we pray to God, not to unjust judges. God would keep us away from them as regards actual judges, but the Lord is picturing a difficult case and
{10}
He is showing that faith triumphs in spite of difficulties. "Men ought always to pray and not to faint". If we look back at our histories, we shall readily discern these very circumstances having marked us time and time again, and how did we get out of it? We got out of it in this way, as we persevered in prayer. God will not fail. He bears long with the persons who are praying. They are not trying Him. He bears long as to them. We have to learn the patience of God; God is bearing long with the adversary. As to us, He is keeping His eye on us. He has great patience as to the adversary. He hopes that it may be that he will deliver himself from the snare of the devil, and God is working out His own thoughts in our souls all the while. Here it is a question of God's elect. If one were to take up the thought of the elect, how much could be said about it. It is a question of God's sovereign election of us in these circumstances. He has elected us in these circumstances. They are as much a part of His election as the other, because He brings out the latent power there is through His own work in His elect. The Lord says, to use the figure, He will indeed avenge His own elect, although He bears long as to them. Let us not thwart the purpose of God in being impatient in circumstances. God has long patience in regard to the adversary, but He has His eye on us, and the thing will come to an end. As the parable shows, the unjust judge grants the petition because of the perseverance in prayer.
Finally, in chapter 21, we have the well-known instance of the widow who gave two mites. She has a fitting place. She is on a level with Anna; she is a sister of Anna -- a spiritual woman, and the Spirit of God brings her in here. The Lord having not to say *to* her, but to us of her. It is one thing to have the Lord speak to you. He loves to do it, too, but it is another thing to have Him speak of you. It is one
{11}
of the most interesting things to hear what divine Persons say of the saints. I believe that very largely the conversation in heaven is in regard of the saints. We can understand it, in a way prove it, in the way that the more spiritual we are as brethren, the more our conversations would be about the saints -- I mean the saints in relation to God, in relation to Christ as the inheritance of God. What spiritual people do, what marks them down here, reflects what is in heaven, and I have not a doubt, I have not any hesitation in saying that the theme of holy conversation up there has to do with the saints. Think of our being the subject of conversation up there. One could prove it from many scriptures, how the saints are the theme up there. Divine persons speak to one another, of each other to each other, but they do love to speak of the saints. The Lord is interceding, we are told. "... he ever liveth to make intercession". That means that He is speaking about the saints from that point of view constantly. How sorrowful if He has to speak of our naughtiness. He intercedes -- He ever liveth to intercede for us. He is now speaking of this woman. He was watching at the treasury of God and she came there and cast in all her living. Scripture does not say, He knew everything divinely. There cannot be a doubt that He knew everything divinely, that He knew in detail exactly what that woman had. He knew much more about her than the Spirit of God tells us here. He was watching. He was looking on as to what was happening, and this woman came and cast in all her living into the treasury of God. That is a beautiful view of the saints, if indeed we can be so regarded in a concrete way. *All her living*. But then what a living! What must have entered into that living! The actual mites, the actual coins, are deposited in the treasury of God. What does it mean, dear friends? It means simply that the saints have turned around completely from mere prosperity in
{12}
this world. They have turned around completely and all that they have is now in relation to the treasury of God. It is a question of promoting what is of God in this world. What a spectacle for heaven is that! Everyone who acts like this woman becomes the peculiar theme of conversation in heaven. There is no unjust judge here. There is no one persecuting here. It is the saints turning around entirely from mere selfishness and being occupied with gain in this world, to use what they have under their hand in relation to the testimony of God. That is the final widow in this book, and what a finish!
So the Lord goes on to speak immediately (circumstances brought it up) of the temple that was then there made of stones. He says, "... there shall not be left one stone upon another", @Luke 21:6. What did he have in His mind? Do you think He had forgotten this woman? He had carried her forward in His mind. Suppose there is somebody today who loves Christ in any little way occupied with Him and promoting His interests, and found in religious associations not in keeping with Him, the Lord would say that person is in associations far inferior to him. It is no question of the evil that may be there. It is not good enough for him, and so I would say to anybody here tonight who loves Jesus, who loves God, who in the bottom of his heart would like to promote His interests but in some way is associated with something that is connected with the world, some association that is unwarranted by Scripture, I am not saying anything about the evil, but it is not good enough for you there is something better than that. The Lord virtually says, This great building is not good enough for this woman. That gift of hers belongs to something greater than this. The Lord would bring you to see that He has a building of living stones and that He is the head of the corner and that the treasury of God is there and that your giving belongs there, not
{13}
where you are. It is not good enough for you. God has reserved some better things for us, and amongst these better things is the assembly, formed of living stones. Christ Himself is the builder and there are treasuries in it and the Lord would say to you, That is your place, and your giving is to be there.
That is all. I trust these remarks will help us in this city and those of us who are visiting as to this widow character of things and the various features it instructs us in, and particularly that we should see the better thing, what God has brought in, the greater and more perfect tabernacle, where the interests of those who love Him are. May God bless His word to us.
{14}
RECONCILIATION
@Romans 11:15; @2 Corinthians 5:18 - 21; @Colossians 1:20 - 22; @Ephesians 2:16
These scriptures, as you will observe, speak of reconciliation, and that will be the subject of my remarks. It is a word that, as it appears in Scripture, requires careful consideration to be understood. We cannot always rely on ordinary meanings of words employed in our English translations. We are dependent on the Spirit to give us understanding of words, as well as of phrases, sentences and books, for the Spirit of God employs language from His own point of view, bearing in mind, of course, our intelligences, so that what He says should be intelligible to us. But still it is in words which the Holy Spirit employs, and we have to get His point of view, comparing spiritual with spiritual. And so the word used in the passage in @Romans 11 has to be understood contextually, for it does not mean that the world and all the persons that are in it as a system are reconciled. It means that God graciously regards it in that way for provisional reasons, as He regarded Jerusalem and the Jews in the early part of Acts as inadvertent manslayers. They were regarded as doing things in ignorance, God graciously so regarding them until they showed themselves afresh to be still unaltered, sending a message after the Lord Jesus by Stephen. "We will not have this man to reign over us". That altered the position. Stephen's address showed that the position was altered, that they had always resisted the Holy Spirit and were still doing so, although they had every opportunity to clear themselves, if they really did not mean what they had done in crucifying Christ. They were held in grace as ignorant of what they did, and no doubt
{15}
they were, for the Lord on the cross says to the Father, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do", @Luke 23:34. But still it came out that the more the import of what they did was brought home to them, the more they accepted it and convicted themselves as murderers of Christ, judged to be murderers by Stephen as pursuing the history of the nation from the outset. "*Ye* do always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers, *ye* also", @Acts 7:51.
So that a change took place, and the apostle Paul says, "... wrath has come upon them to the uttermost", @1 Thessalonians 2:16, and so it is now with the world. John in his gospel regards the world as under the Lord's ministry as judged, anticipating what I have been saying. "Now is the judgment of this world", @John 12:31, meaning the world as it stood in relation to the Jews. That world came to an end and has not been revived since. It is under wrath. "Wrath has come upon them to the uttermost", says the apostle. The world in @Romans 11:15 is the world from the Gentile point of view, the world taken up in the form it is in Daniel, and in relation to that world God sent Christ, and was in Him "reconciling the world unto himself", @2 Corinthians 5:19? This indeed, as I was saying, included the Jewish world at the outset, but now that is altered. The word in this passage applies to the Gentile world. But God, in order to make a way for the gospel and to allay all prejudice, recognises it as, in a certain sense, under His ordering, for indeed it was He who ordered the Gentile monarchies. Their very existence is in view of the gospel. God has had the gospel in mind that it should be preached to the nations, and with a view to this, He ordered the world as it has been since the time of Nebuchadnezzar, presenting Christ to it, both in His Person and in the gospel, and the apostle goes so far as to say that the casting away of the Jews has meant the reconciling of the world; that is, it has come into the favour of God in a provisional
{16}
sense. He, in grace, is not imputing trespasses. Not that His government does not enter into it, not that wrath is not in view as a background for the gospel, but, although regarding the world as in His favour in a sense. He has removed what would interfere with the proclamation and results of the gospel. He would remove every possible hindrance, in so far as it could be, notwithstanding what the world is and what men in it are.
The present moment has an extraordinary significance, for God is reviving in it the dispensation as He started it. Whatever the outward results of the testimony of the saints who have been restored may be, God is looking for "a testimony to them", @Matthew 10:18, as the Lord Jesus says. Whatever the results, God has a great regard for "a testimony to them" and He has restored the truth and many of His people to it, to the knowledge of Christ in heaven as Head, and He looks for it to be maintained, not only in a theoretic but in a very concrete way in our smaller measure. So it is that He has brought us back to these things, to the recognition of the powers that be, that they are ordained of God and that they are to be prayed for, that, in fact, we are to pray for kings and all that are in authority and give thanks for them and make intercession for them, for they are God's ministers. Not that He would have any pleasure in continuing the world as it is on account of itself, not that He has any pleasure in the thing as it is, but rather to make a way for what He has before Him in the dispensation, that is, the dispensation of grace Whatever persons rule the world, it is the time of the Kingdom of God in which grace reigns "through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord", @Romans 5:21. That is a most important thing, dear brethren, at the present time, because God would bring us clearly round to His own thought in the dispensation. Whatever changes are taking place in this world, God
{17}
is saying that has nothing to do with it. He has not altered His position one iota. The throne of grace remains as firmly as ever, and the gospel goes out on that ground as clearly and freely as ever, so that in smaller measure the dispensation is maintained. That is a great point and God would lay it upon us. To illustrate this point in @Romans 11, dear brethren, from the Old Testament, I would refer to Abraham because we nearly always get illustrations, or rather types, of the truth in the New Testament, in the Old; and usually in a way that makes the truth very practical to us.
So you get in Abraham, in the book of Genesis, the great idea of the attitude of God towards the world. He called Abraham out of it. There was a moral reason for that because, as it says in @Romans 1:28, "... they did not like to retain God in their knowledge". He called Abraham out of it, but not to take him up to heaven at once -- not to take him, as it were, away out of the world, that is the world as the creation. We have to distinguish between the world as representative of the creation, and the world as a moral system. It is said of the Lord Jesus that He came into the world and the world was made by Him. That is not the moral system, it is the world as ornamented in creation. God did not propose to take Abraham out of that. As soon as Abraham came out of the moral system, God says to him, 'Every nation on earth is to be blessed through you', @Genesis 18:18. That is the idea of reconciliation. You can understand, dear brethren, how Abraham would think of the world from that point onwards. In @Romans 4:13 we are told that Abraham is the heir of the world. Now, if I am an heir to an estate or a throne or a business the thing takes a very different aspect in my mind from what it would otherwise. I am coming into it. And so Abraham would look at the nations. How many there were! Whatever their names, he would look at
{18}
the nations in that light. He would say, 'They are all mine in principle; it is only a matter of time'. Well, so it is, dear brethren, that we are heirs to the world. All that heirship, of course, belongs to Christ. Christ is the heir. As was said in the parable, "This is the heir", @Matthew 21:38. He is the true Abraham, the heir of the world, and we are joint heirs with Him. And so in Abraham's case you see how he would look at the world henceforth. God says to a leading ruler at that time, Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, as regards this man Abraham, "He is a prophet", @Genesis 20:7. God would have the rulers of the world understand that the saints are not against them, and so He says to Abimelech, "He shall pray for thee", @Genesis 20:7. That was a great advantage to Abimelech, to have a man in his realm who was praying for him, whom God Himself designated as a prophet and said he would pray for Him. He was a priest as well.
You see, dear brethren, how that applies today. The Lord is in heaven. He is heir of the world and head of the nations, as indeed Simeon says, "A light for the revelation of the Gentiles", @Luke 2:32. He is brought into view, not for cursing but for blessing, that the blessing of Abraham might arrive at the nations. You see how the Lord Jesus thinks of them as He looks down from heaven. They are all His. He is heir of the world, and His solicitude Godward is in regard of the nations. We are to reflect that, dear brethren. That very great office or function is accorded to us, to pray in this attitude, not only that Christ is heir of the world but that we are joint heirs. I have no doubt that the continuance of the dispensations stands in relation to that, and that the revival of the truth in its varied parts stands in that relation, and that God would enlarge the brethren to see how the matter stands internationally. God would have us with Himself as His friends, as Abraham was His friend, so that He might communicate His mind to
{19}
us in regard of these matters and that we might know how to pray, not with any national feeling, but as a heavenly people, as those who are waiting, but in the meantime would have the dispensation continued, for it is delightful to God to continue in this way to express His patience, for patience is a great attribute of God. "... the long suffering of our Lord is salvation", @2 Peter 3:15. God is not willing that any should perish, @2 Peter 3:9. This gives the saints a wonderful place in the eyes of heaven and, although men do not admit it, it is on their behalf, too. The continuance of things as they are is largely dependent on this great intercession of the Lord Jesus in heaven and ours upon earth. It is a wonderful platform, dear brethren, when we see this. It delivers us from all national feeling -- which is really nothing. To us it is a question of laying hold of the heavenly ground we are on as priests of God and heirs of the world and joint heirs with Christ, and of being solicitous on behalf of the world. What is so interesting to us is that the gospel, in however small a measure or with whatever small results, should continue as a testimony.
So with Isaac and Jacob, but especially with Jacob. You see how he acted towards Pharaoh. You see how Joseph was installed as the head of Pharaoh's kingdom. All that brings out what was promised to Abraham. All these were "heirs with him of the same promise". They all carried on this great principle, and especially Jacob. That is, he had not only the principle, but he had the power to convey the principle when he stood before Pharaoh. 'How old are you?' @Genesis 47:8, says Pharaoh. Jacob, an old man, had already blessed the monarch, and had not asked his leave to do it, nor had the monarch forbade him to do it. He asked him about his age, and Jacob told him, but he was able to bless. You see what a place, dear brethren, the saints of God have in relation to this world, and how we may alter things that may be
{20}
contrary to the testimony in this way. And so with Joseph, for it was no accident that he became lord of all Egypt. It was a divinely appointed matter. All these men carry out this great idea of the reconciliation of the world -- in relation to Abraham, a figure of Christ as head of it. And so in Egypt God was not severe even with Pharaoh. God sent him a message and gave him an opportunity to let His people go. "Let my people go, that they may serve me", @Exodus 7:16. It was only when resistance to the revealed mind of God took place formally that God struck. So it is in our own times, and it may not be far distant, for things take place so quickly in this world. We do not know how long the thing will continue. Our business is to see to it that it does continue; that is, from the standpoint of joint heirs with Christ and priesthood to God, our prayers should continue. You see the magnitude of the position. Presently the whole position will be changed. When the saints leave, things will happen very quickly. In what is called a crisis, the whole world will veer round and Christianity will be overthrown, not only in principle but formally, officially, as it is in some nations today. Then it is that the divine attitude changes, and that this verse which I have read to you is no longer in force. In the meantime, our business is to continue on in the light of the dispensation in which we are as priests unto God.
The next thing I want to speak about is the ministerial side of this in @2 Corinthians 5. The apostle, as you will all know, in these epistles greatly stresses his ministerial authority. What corresponds in the Old Testament is the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and also Deuteronomy, but particularly Exodus. These are the ministerial books. What that means, dear brethren, is the idea of @Romans 11:15; not only that it is in force, but that it is explained it is made intelligible by ministerial services. Ministerial
{21}
services mean qualified, cultured, trained or taught persons to represent God in this world, That is what the apostle represents. As the apostle Paul says, "... all things are of the God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ" -- alluding to himself particularly, to those that represent God -- "and given to us the ministry of that reconciliation", @2 Corinthians 5:18. He has given it to us. That is a very great thing. That is to say, to a trained ministry, fitted of God to represent Him and to make the thing plain and effective. "How that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences", @2 Corinthians 5:19. Now he is bringing it round to effectiveness, and he says, "We are ambassadors therefore for Christ, God as it were beseeching by us, we entreat for Christ, Be reconciled to God", @2 Corinthians 5:20. *Be reconciled*. It was not exactly saying that the Corinthians were not, although they were refractory. In practice they were not, yet in principle they were, as believers in the gospel. At the same time, their condition required that he should bring this to bear upon them. "Be reconciled to God". Then he goes on to give the basis of it. "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us that *we* might become God's righteousness in him", @2 Corinthians 5:21. What a basis! How well the apostle knew how to bring out the full bearing of that wonderful atoning sacrifice of Jesus, that it was not only a question of our sins but that we might be made the righteousness of God. Think of the greatness of that thought. Be *made* it. Not only that we should have it to appear before God, but that we should be the very expression of it. It will be so by and by. The Lord will point to us as the expression of His righteousness by and by, but surely it has a bearing today -- that God can point to some people in this world as representative of His righteousness. Not only that they are made righteous, but that they are made "the righteousness of God in him". Think of that! What a bearing it
{22}
should have upon us in our practical ways and walk, that God, as it were, can point to us.
Perhaps it hardly enters into some of our hearts that God talks about us daily, and points to us, too. Satan is coming up constantly as he did in the days of Job. God said to Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job?" @Job 1:8. Is he the only saint that God brings forward in that way? No! It is to remind us that we are the subject of conversation in heaven, and that God thinks of us here in the place where He has set us and would call attention to us as He would to Abraham. We are told in the Psalms that "he reproved kings for their sakes; saying, Touch not mine anointed", @Psalm 105:14. He speaks to kings about us. How beautiful and great it is if God could call attention to me tonight in heaven, could call the attention of the devil and say, 'See that man (or any of us here). See what he is. Have you considered him?' You may be sure that Satan has considered him all his life and God calls attention to the beautiful traits of His own work in His people. He says, 'Look at them. They are My righteousness'. See how He challenged Balaam. 'Look at those people. You cannot curse those people'. "Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth", @Romans 8:33. Satan did, but God says they are justified. "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel", @Numbers 23:21. God says, 'Look at these people. They are made My righteousness'. What a testimony that is! How attractive that is, that one should be such as the Lord could call attention to in that way.
And so in regard of this ministerial matter the types again help us. The book of Exodus, I believe, confirms and amplifies what I am saying. Moses is the great minister and represents the ministry, and much is made of him. There is more said of him, perhaps, than of any of the ministers of the Old Testament. What an interesting person he is! He
{23}
was taken up from his infancy, and what a favour it was to Pharaoh's court that God allowed that man to be in that court. Was that nothing? It was the way God looked at things. He provided a daughter in the house of Pharaoh and she was favourable. She represented in a certain way divine traits. She takes the babe and has compassion on the babe. Was that nothing? It was the work of God to take up that babe and place him in the house of Pharaoh for forty years. What a testimony! I do not say that Moses was very much, but he was Moses, and he was exceeding fair to God, we are told, before he wept. He was taken by a woman who had no antipathy towards him; she had compassion on the weeping child. She became his saviour for the moment and took him to the house of Pharaoh. There are many such today who, under the government of God, are in the world. What an advantage. But how many of them are acting like Moses? "By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season", @Hebrews 11:25. "By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king", @Hebrews 11:27. That is the minister. He is now away from Egypt. The wrath of the king has forced him out. The king is becoming more and more hardened against God, but it is the patience of God waiting upon him, and now from forty years up to eighty years of age Moses was in the desert under the eye of God in a preparatory school. He led the flock to the backside of the desert. There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a thorn-bush, @Exodus 3:2. That is, dear brethren, where we get the idea of the minister becoming reconciled. He came under the mind of God in a peculiar way. He turned aside to see why the bush burned and was not consumed. He *turned aside* to see it. It alludes to the humanity of Christ, to the incarnation. It alludes
{24}
to what Israel had to go through in the desert, but there is Christ. God was in the bush -- in the most lowly circumstances in the thorn-bush -- and Moses stopped to look at that. He had been accustomed to great things in Pharaoh's house, but now he is engaged with a lowly thing, a thorn-bush. But there is something present in that thorn-bush that the bush burned and was not consumed. It was a question of the humanity of Christ. "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us and we have contemplated his glory", @John 1:14. It is in that way, dear brethren, that the minister comes in for reconciliation. I wonder if you understand what I am presenting. What was Moses under God's eye as he turned aside? There never had been such a Moses before. It was a Moses occupied with Jesus, in type, I mean. Heaven saw it and heaven says, "Moses, Moses", @Exodus 3:4. Heaven is expressing itself in profound interest in this man. His name was never called out before the angel called it out. Jehovah did it. Moses is coming into reconciliation. He is identified in his mind with this great thing. He will come into it more and more. He will grow in it. But, as the apostle Paul says, he was being reconciled to God, not God to him. He was being reconciled to God. He was becoming delightful to God as never before. He is now in his mind taken up typically with Christ and so the process goes on. In @Exodus 23 and 24 you see how Israel is come into reconciliation. First the minister and then those who are ministered to. The Lord would make this point to us. Do we understand this? Do we understand being brought into this attitude of reconciliation, that God looks upon us with the utmost complacency? It is because Christ has come into our minds. We are occupied with Christ as God has announced Him and has called attention to Him. 'I am going on with this, and you are going on with this, and you are pleasing to Me. You are
{25}
not going on with anything else. You have grasped My mind and I am delighted with you'. That is really what is meant. God says to Moses and Aaron and Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel, "Come up", @Exodus 24:1. Would He have them come up to His place to grieve His heart? No, beloved brethren. It is reconciled people, a people He would have before Him for His pleasure. That is the idea. They went up, and, we are told, "they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire", @Exodus 24:10. What a sight! It says they ate and drank and He did not lay His hand on the nobles. They were pleasing to Him. It is a question of Moses turning round first and occupying himself with what God presented to him. It is Christ in the bush, Christ incarnate, and Moses is occupied with it. God says, 'That is a wonderful thing you are occupied with and I want you to be thoroughly adjusted to it'. "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet", @Exodus 3:5. Then there are wonderful unfoldings of God to him right through, and now he is invited up and others with him. Israel, in principle, are in reconciliation and are invited up into the presence of God and are perfectly free there.
Now I want to make some remarks about Colossians. @Colossians 1:19, which precedes what I read, speaks about Christ being the dwelling place of all the fulness of the deity. The word 'deity' is not there. The word 'fulness' takes the place of the word 'greatness' in Hebrews, meaning that 'Deity' is referred to. All the fulness was there. It is not simply all the attributes, but God, the Deity, was there. It is not now the covenant God, it is the Deity -- that is the Latin word. It means God in His absoluteness. We must get this word into our minds -- I mean the idea of God in His infinite absoluteness. Paul has this always in mind. "Of him, and through him, and for him are all things", @Romans 11:36.
{26}
And so it says that "in him all the fulness ... was pleased to dwell, and by him to reconcile all things to itself", (as it should read, for it is a question of the neuter) "having made peace by the blood of his cross", @Colossians 1:20. You have to understand that expression. The cross had no blood. It alludes to the blood that flowed, not from the nail-prints, for that would not mean death in itself. Death took place before the blood flowed. That was properly atoning blood. It is the actual state of death that is in mind. Only John gives us that side. How significant! Paul calls it here "the blood of his cross". It flowed while He was on the cross. What a death! The forsaking had taken place before, but now He is dead, in the state of death. A most solemn thing to think of. It is by that blood that peace is made. God has done that, and on that ground He is free. Now there is peace. He has taken away the things that would harass Him in His work of reconciliation. There is no disturbing element in persons or things in the whole universe. What a marvellous thought! The apostle goes on to say "and you ... hath he reconciled", that is the Gentiles, we might say ourselves, for Colossians has the Gentiles in view. "To present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight", @Colossians 1:22. In His sight or in *its* sight, as it should read. That is, in the sight of the Deity, of the Godhead. Think of our being taken up so as to be delightful to the Deity, to God in His absoluteness. See the place we have, dear brethren. God has done that.
There is an 'if' following. It shows how God had in His mind how very quickly this would be slipped away from. He has now revived it. It is His wish that we stand firmly in this great and glorious thought that He has reconciled us in the body of Christ's flesh through death, to present us unblameable and unreprovable in His sight. In His sight. It is not now the reconciliation of the world, but what is in His
{27}
sight, that is, what His eyes are resting upon, the saints viewed as holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight. There is nothing at all to reprove. One saint spoke of the joy of an unrebuking gaze from God. Think of being able to stand in the presence of that! In *His* sight, as it says. It is before *Him* in this passage.
Then in Ephesians we have the collective thought where it is stated that He has reconciled both -- both Jew and Gentile, that is, believers from both Jews and Gentiles -- "in one body to God by the cross", @Ephesians 2:16. Peace indeed has been made by the blood of His cross, but here the reconciliation is by the cross. The enmity is slain by it, too. This is a word for us as to our practical relations with one another. What I have been applying to each of us individually is to apply to us as together. The enmity must be slain. God has done it. He looks at it as done in regard to the Ephesians and in regard to the saints at that time, but in its practical application you can see that there must be the slaying of the enmity. Enmity is a terrible thing to creep in amongst the people of God and the slaying of it is by the cross. It is an exalted way of dealing with it. What shame, what ignominy entered into the cross and the sacrificial work of Christ, and all to deal with this horrid thing called the flesh, in which enmity towards one another is so apt to wreck and spoil reconciliation. He hath reconciled "both in one body to God by the cross" -- slaying the enmity. Dear brethren, this is a very practical word, especially in the light of Matthew, the Lord Himself alluding there to a brother offering a sacrifice. He touches on many things in those chapters in @Matthew 5, 6 and 7, and amongst these things says "Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee",; one is pretty sure to remember there, for God is there. God is where sacrifice is being
{28}
offered sincerely and if God be there He will search you through and through. How terrible a thing it is, dear brethren, to sit down together with enmity, with a sense that others have things against us. In the presence of God we are searched. Nowhere else are we searched in that way. "And there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way". It makes everything of the gift. God is looking after it all the time you are away to see your brother. It is under His eye; it is your sacrifice. It has not lost its value because your brother has something against you, but He is testing you out as to what you are. There should be grace in us to overcome evil with good. That is victory to you and to Him. "Go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift", @Matthew 5:24. You alone can offer it, but be reconciled to thy brother. That verse enters into this verse in Ephesians. He has reconciled "both unto God in one body", @Ephesians 2:16. God can look upon a company of saints as pleasing to Him as a company -- there is no enmity. The enmity is slain by the cross; that is, it will be eternally, and by and by in the millennium, too. Things will come under God's eye for His pleasure and He looks for it now in a time of adversity and contrariety, so that the brethren are great enough morally, in the Spirit, and having the blood of Jesus to apply, and the water too, so that there should be no enmity, that there should be the practical expression of reconciliation in the saints viewed as together. It is a wonderful thing that God is working out -- that is the assembly in its local setting, for there is only one assembly, but still there are subdivisions in local settings. God is working out a great matter in the wilderness, in a scene of contrariety, and what can be greater than to bring about reconciliation in persons who were hitherto alienated in mind, and alienated to one
{29}
another, but are now reconciled in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity.
That is what I have in mind tonight, dear brethren, and I would commend that you take it home. One feels the power of it. What great things God has in His mind in these last days, that is, to bring about in the end what He began as a testimony.
{30}
PRAYER
@Luke 3:21,22; @2 Chronicles 7:1,2,12; @Acts 4:23 - 31; @Daniel 9:1 - 3, @Daniel 9:20 - 25
My subject, dear brethren, is prayer. I wish not only to speak of those features that appear in these scriptures, the subject really being very extensive. I wish to show first how it appeared in Jesus. As in all else, He has the first place. In all things He has the pre-eminence. He is not only *at* the beginning, but He *is* the beginning. Although coming in later than many who prayed, yet all anticipated His presence here, God having had perfection in His mind from the outset. Christ was no afterthought in any sense. In making Adam, forming and creating Adam, Christ was in the mind of God, for he was the figure, we are told, of Him that was to come, and in taking others up, from Adam onwards, in any way, God always had Christ in His mind. However far short they may have come, all the great instrumentalities that God took up had Christ in God's mind. In Abel, in Enoch, in Noah and in Abraham, one after another, taken up and fitted for some service, God always had Christ in mind, each representing some feature; however feebly expressed, the feature was there in the mind of God, and was there in a way that perhaps we have never seen it, for He is always occupied with His own idea. So this signal occasion meant that God had reached it in regard of prayer -- in regard of other things, too, but Luke alone mentions the prayer, the attitude the Lord was in as coming up out of the waters of Jordan. Not that the Lord had not prayed before; of course He had. He says, indeed, that He was cast upon God from the very outset of His being here, the extent of His prayers in His early years only known to God and Himself. But now He is engaged
{31}
in it at a peculiar time. It was an epoch-making time, a situation really intended for Him, although giving others an opportunity to set themselves right with God, for it was a time of setting things right under John's ministry. Others were involved, of course, and came to John from all quarters to be baptised, but the occasion, the service, had Jesus in mind. It was to make the way of the Lord, to make way for Him. It was a great occasion, the most signal occasion of that great ministry of John's, and it was arranged beforehand. God foreseeing and knowing what He would do, how Jesus should come into this wonderful picture; He had it all arranged, in no sense more than in John himself. The beautiful spirit that he always evinces always affects one. He was full of his own nothingness in the presence of Jesus. No one, perhaps, in the multitude that came had such a sense of the greatness of Jesus. According to John the evangelist, he disappears from this world saying, "He must increase, but I must decrease", @John 3:30. It shines here, for the Lord is praying, according to Luke, as if God were to call attention to prayer, knowing its history from the outset in the many that prayed, knowing how befitting it was in man, especially as entering on the service of God. This was a scene peculiarly fitted for heaven's delight, but it was more than that; heaven would have attention called to it. Although the voice speaks to Jesus here, it speaks of Him elsewhere, and what comes out, dear brethren, as a practical lesson, is that God is pleased with us as in prayer. He was supremely pleased with Jesus and said so, but He is pleased with everyone that is truly engaged in prayer. It is an attitude that peculiarly delights the eye of heaven and the ear of heaven -- an encouragement for us, for it may be that in the quiet hours of the night when we are wakeful, or even in the busy hours of the day when we are pressed, it is a pleasure to God to know a
{32}
heart is turning to Him, however briefly; and however inarticulate the prayer, it is known to Him, it is part, if I might so say reverently, of the life of God. You understand what I mean. You must apply the idea to God; the very words are used: a certain thing is estranged from the life of God. We should not think He is different in that sense from us. God is capable of enjoying what is enjoyable according to Him. He expects it, He looks for it. Leviticus is full of this thought as in the offerings. The offerings, the types in Leviticus, open up a wonderful field for thought as to what God is. As the apostle reminds the Athenians, we ought to think something of God, because of what we are, because we are said to be His offspring. He brings that in in regard of what man is physically and constitutionally, but how much more so, dear brethren, in regard of Christians, who are partakers of the divine nature, who are brought to know God, who are born of Him, indeed, in a spiritual sense. We should understand, even from that point of view, that there are things He enjoys, that His life consists in that way, in Christ "in whom I have found my delight", @Luke 3:22. The life of God, the enjoyment of God, entered into that. Certain history has begun in Jesus now publicly; it had been there privately. God had been enjoying it all these thirty years. As I said, the sacrifices, as types, are full of this thought -- the bread of God, what He enjoys; and the drink-offerings, all that would satisfy His heart and even, to speak carefully and reverently, to stimulate Him, for there is the wine required, the strong drink. So that relatively, in the weary, perhaps wakeful hours of the night, or in the pressing hours of the day, whatever the employment, the feeble Christian turning to God not only receives succour but occasions joy in measure. I shall come to that presently more fully, only to show you the perfection of the idea in Christ. Luke would have us
{33}
to understand how God the Father found His joy in this sense -- in other senses, of course, but Luke brings this point in, and greatly enlarges on the Lord praying, as many of us know, more than any other of the evangelists. It is that which is proper to man here, and not only that, but it occasions joy to God, and how much more so in regard of ourselves, dear brethren, when we come together, as it is said, for prayer. You will all remember how, in that well-known precious chapter, @Acts 16, the Spirit of God says through the writer, even Luke, "*As we went to prayer*", @Acts 16:13. A certain damsel, having the spirit of Python, called attention to the apostle and his companions, "These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation", @Acts 16:17. This is what she said. What was heaven thinking about at that time? Heaven was thinking about those men going to prayer; not the millennium; Heaven was not thinking of the millennium then, that was long ahead. Heaven is always occupied with the present, with what there is; and what there was then was men going to prayer, and Satan knew that and would defeat the divine thought and rob the divine eye and the divine ear of its pleasure. Let us not forget this, dear brethren, that the enemy is set against us as we are going to the prayer meeting, as we call it, and would frustrate our efficiency, our priestly power, and defeat the divine end and divine pleasure.
And now I move on to the Old Testament, to show how this works out. Solomon's prayer is perhaps the longest we get in the Old Testament, or in the whole Bible. It is a wonderfully laid out prayer -- no mere repetition of words, no vain repetition. It is wonderfully copious, covering territory and time immensely. He had prepared, we are told, a platform of bronze, the measurements all denoting what is spiritual, and he kneeled down and spread forth his hands to heaven. Heaven saw all that. Attitudinarianism, in itself,
{34}
is not of any value, but certainly there is an attitude that God delights in, and Solomon here is in a proper attitude and prays, as I said, in the most orderly way. Heaven saw and heard. It was a great day for heaven, as it was for the myriads of Israel present -- the very acme of the kingdom, of the exercises of David, the result of them, for Solomon was but a counterpart of David. Indeed, Solomon is Christ in heaven, the exalted Jesus. David is the suffering Jesus, and so as Jesus is about to enter heaven through death, He prayed, too -- the greatest of all prayers, I need not say. We are not told what He was praying about on the banks of Jordan, but we are told what He was praying about in @John 17, as He was about to die. He lifted up His eyes to heaven; it does not say His hands, but His eyes. Those eyes were met by the Father's. What a moment it was! I might say, anticipating the true Solomon, for He is already anticipating that all is over on earth; and this is the attitude ever since on high. The first thing on high, we may say, He received of the Father the promise of the Spirit. But He has told us ere going up that He was about to beg for that, He was about to pray for that, so that we might understand the wonderful economy in which we are, that it is an economy set up in man, in that way in dependence, and that we are brought into it especially in prayer; that we are brought into the economy of God set up in Jesus, who is our great exemplar in everything, but particularly now in this. He says, "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter", @John 14:16, and as gone on high, Peter tells us "having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this", @Acts 2:33. The gift of the Spirit was the greatest possible result as a gift from heaven.
Well now, Solomon is anticipative of all this, foreshadowing it, only opening up some things as to the divine side; after the long orderly prayer in such an
{35}
attitude as is described, it is said that when he finished the glory of the Lord filled the house, "the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house", @2 Chronicles 7:1. That is to say, Solomon is praying in regard of the house, a matter that should have our special attention in our meetings in our individual prayers and in our collective prayers. The house of God is a great thought with Him. It is that in which not only we find practical salvation, but in which He has scope Himself, for He has a free hand. It involves the family thought. It involves the banishment of all that is contrary to family feeling and affection, so that he promises in the prophets (@Isaiah 56) to the eunuchs and to the sons of the alien that keep His sabbaths -- that is those who rest in Christ, who observe the sign of the covenant, for us the Lord's supper -- to all such He says, "even them will I ... make joyful in my house of prayer", @Isaiah 56:7. That is a beautiful thought, for the prayer meetings are perhaps sometimes a little dull to us, in our minds at any rate, but it is not the divine intent that they should be. God will participate in them Himself, He has joy in them, and He would make us joyful. Whatever we may be externally, an alien without family, without children or relatives to reciprocate our affections; whatever there may be of that kind, those who keep the sabbaths of God, who abide in the covenant of God, who recognise the sign of it, which is the Lord's supper today, those who do such things have a great place with God in heaven and in His house, and He says, I will make them "joyful in my house of prayer". It is a great place, He says in it you will come into an atmosphere of universality -- it is a place of prayer for all nations, and, dear brethren, that is an important thing, that we should not be narrowed up to our own localities and our own affairs, but have a universal outlook and feeling for
{36}
the house of God. The house of prayer is a place of prayer for all nations. How the Lord felt all this when He made a scourge of small cords and cast out the dove sellers and money changers -- that is to say, all that is contrary to this, all that interferes with what the divine intent is in the house. And so in Solomon's case, we have a primary idea. It says, "as he finished praying". He was allowed to finish. It was a greater thing really than Peter's address to Cornelius and his company, because God acted and filled them with His Spirit *before* Peter finished. It says, "When Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord" (or Jehovah) "filled the house", @2 Chronicles 7:1. He had made an *end* -- another suggestion that it is important to make an end; that is, if we are praying, to have a definite end in mind -- a beginning and an end, not a wandering thing. God has no pleasure in that; He wants definiteness, something that has a beginning and an end, and that there should not be too much space between the beginning and the end, for the apostle says, "I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also", @1 Corinthians 14:15. Your spiritual feelings are in it and your spiritual understanding is in it -- there is a beginning and an end. Solomon made an end of praying. God allowed him to finish. Every word was pleasing; the attitude of the prayer, of the priest, as I may call him, was pleasing to heaven, and as he made an end the fire came out and consumed the burnt-offering. That is to say, God, in that remarkable way, showed His delight in what was representative, sacrificially, of Solomon and the people. They were in reconciliation, as I may say, and then the glory filled the house -- a point in the meeting for prayer that is, perhaps, hardly ever reached, but it simply means, as I understand it, that a point is reached as the brethren proceed, praying
{37}
with the spirit, praying with the understanding, covering the ground, covering the needs, when God would say, 'I like that; I want all that; I am restful in that'. It is turned from a scene of need into a scene of glory, such is the wonderful transforming power, dear brethren, that is here. And so we find in Luke as to the Lord, that as He prayed on the mount of Transfiguration, the fashion of His countenance became different, that is, there was a change. That is the idea, that you change from the sense of need into the sense of glory, God Himself taking over the scene and filling it with a sense of what He is, of His appreciation of man lifting up holy hands in intelligence -- in priestly intelligence -- without wrath or reasoning. And then we are told after this in the verse I read down the chapter, that there was an appearing subsequently. Jehovah appeared to Solomon, "Then Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: I have heard thy prayer, and I have chosen for myself this place for a house of sacrifice", @2 Chronicles 7:12. For a house of *sacrifice*. Now I would just call attention, dear brethren, to how that God is not only content -- and it brings out what He is and what we should prove, too, in our relations with Him -- that He is not only content to fill the scene with His glory, a scene of prayer, to show how pleased He is with the brethren as together according to His mind, but He comes in later and tells us that He has heard what we have prayed for. We know that He hears us. We are told in the first epistle of John, "And this is the boldness which we have towards him, that if we ask him anything according to his will he hears us", @1 John 5:14. How sweet that is, to have the sense that you are heard. "I have heard thy prayer" -- and what an answer, too. First of all, "I have chosen for myself this place for a house of sacrifice". How sweet that is in the night seasons. You know, as we get older, we do not need as much
{38}
sleep as the younger ones do. The night seasons have a place in Scripture -- a great place. If you look through, you will see how God seizes the night seasons, and even sleep, to reveal Himself. Here He appeared. This word 'appeared' is a most suggestive and instructive word. It is not merely that you get a communication but you get an impression in an appearing. It is not the same as you saw before. Solomon had an earlier appearing. It is, indeed, stated that Jehovah appeared to him twice, and it was a serious matter when he turned aside. A second appearing is not a repetition of the first -- it is different. There is some other feature shown, for the divine features are varied. God would have us to be impressed with them, and the appearing here would have relation to the prayer; He says I have taken on this house, I have taken it over, and He goes on to say that He had listened to the prayer and He would answer it. All this is most practical, dear brethren, as to our prayers: how God gives us a sense that He has heard and that He will take account and that He will do, that all is noted, that nothing will ever be forgotten by God. What I am speaking of particularly now is the impression that He would convey in an appearing -- that you get a fresh conception of God in an appearing.
I go on to the Acts, for a moment. It is a well-known passage and the point in it I have in mind, is that it is a prayer in relation to the conflict; two servants, Peter and John, had been in conflict, and had stood well and God gave victory after victory, and "being let go, they came to their own company", @Acts 4:23 -- a very beautiful thought. The outstanding servants came back to their own company, like Paul and Barnabas, later, who come back to Antioch, to take their places with the brethren. They came to their own company, and if you take the word 'company' out of it, it would be accurate enough:
{39}
they came to their *own* -- the stress is on that word, a word that is found often in this sense -- and they related what had happened. What a season they must have had together, the brethren recounting the support they had in the conflict and in their sufferings, and how the testimony was making headway. It was a time of great triumph. And now, what comes out is "as they prayed". I do not go into the details of the prayer. You will observe that the words, the phrases used, and the things referred to are but a little removed from the Old Testament way and form, but the words are just what were suitable at this juncture. They speak of the creation, they refer to the second Psalm, a very intelligible and intelligent prayer at this particular juncture, but not such as you get later. Only, as I said, it was not very much removed from the Old Testament in words, but very much removed as regards the spirit that entered into it, because instead of asking for vengeance, they are asking God to heal their enemies, to stretch forth His hands in healing. It is a very great triumph for the testimony in conflict, and that is most pleasing to God. Earlier, Solomon had asked for certain things from God and God said to him, I have heard what you asked and I am going to give you what you asked for. I like very much what you asked for; you did not ask for anything against your enemies. We have to be careful in our prayers not to pray for our brethren as our enemies. It is the last thought one should have, that a Christian could be his enemy. The more I learn to look at the saints abstractly with the divine view, the less I will allow such a thought as that. The spirit is to overcome evil with good. Stretch forth Thy hand, they say, in healing. They ask God to come in and carry on as He had been. As a matter of fact, this prayer is not only an inauguration prayer, it is a continuing prayer -- a great matter to be in our minds. God gives impulses, at
{40}
times, but the thing is to maintain what He inaugurates and supports, that it may be carried on at its proper level, and that is what this chapter means. The prayer is according to the mind of God, and it says, "And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook", @Acts 4:31. Now, dear brethren, what I mean to convey to you is that this is for continuance. It is that the testimony should be maintained at its proper level, a very important thing, that if God gives us any advantage, we do not lose that, we maintain it. He would have it maintained. He has given it to be maintained, and the way is by prayer. It can only be done by divine power, nothing can be done without divine power. The way of obtaining divine power is by prayer and hence they prayed here, and they prayed delightfully to heaven, that is, it was suitable for the moment, and heaven, as they finished, shook the place where they were assembled. That was not a shake to cause alarm, there was no suggestion in it whatever of that kind. They were not alarmed. It was a friendly shake, it was love, as much as to say, 'This is the kind of thing you can rely upon. Your attitude is right. Maintain that attitude and heaven will maintain you'. It is a great matter to keep the right attitude, the right outlook, whatever your feelings or your outward circumstances. Maintain the right outlook, even if it is only abstractly, and God will support you. Then your prayers will be according to that, and God will support us. So that the place, it says, was shaken. What a moment that was! There was no suggestion of fear, but it goes on to say that they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spake the word of God with boldness, and then in verse 33, "with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all". There are other verses, but there is not time to go into them, but to take the whole
{41}
passage as it stands, it means that the testimony is still on the level of the second chapter, there is no deterioration, and God is pleased with the attitude of the persons who pray and He says, 'I am with you in it. I will maintain you in that attitude', and they did not have long to wait. There was a friendly shake of the building, whatever it was -- the upper room or any other -- and they were all filled with the Spirit; not with fear, but with the Spirit and they spake the word of God with power, and then the general state of the saints is according to what we get in chapter 2; the level is the same, God is maintaining the level. It is a very important matter that there should be no deterioration but a full maintenance of the level that God has inaugurated, and it says "with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus", @Acts 4:33. That was the point for the moment. Later on, other things came in -- a heavenly testimony -- but the point for the moment was the power of God in the resurrection of Jesus, and with great power the apostles gave witness to that, and the saints were all in accord with what the leaders were going on with.
If you will bear with me, I will say a word about Daniel. I have spoken about Jesus as illustrating the great thought of prayer and why God has pleasure in it, and the house taken over in Chronicles, and now the testimony maintained in its full power in answer to prayer. Now I want to say a word as to the time, as to the dispensation, as to what is coming. It is said that the Lord God would do nothing but He would make it known to His servants the prophets. That is to say, God has what may be called His friends. He would look for us to be His friends. Friendship for God is a very great thought, and it affords Him great satisfaction that He has those in whom He can confide and to whom He can make communications, to whom He can unfold what is in
{42}
His mind as to the present and as to the future. In the book of Daniel, this is connected with prayer. This is one of the most interesting prayers that we get in Scripture. In Daniel we get a great deal of instruction in regard of time. Daniel says that he understood by books, that is, he was going to pray intelligently; that is, we get the mind of God from the Scriptures -- this prayer refers to the aid that we get from the Scriptures -- the prophetic word particularly. Daniel tells us that he writes at the time of Darius, the Mede, and tells us something about him, and then says, "In the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem", @Daniel 1:2. Now there is a word for all young brothers and sisters. My impression is that our book-cases are not large enough, not well selected. There is a great deal in them that is of very little value morally, and there are many works, many books that God intended should be in our book-cases that are not there. They are available. Of course, Daniel is here referring to the prophet Jeremiah, to an inspired record, but he says "I understood by books", and it would be well that the brethren should be conversant with books. The apostle Paul says, "bring ... the books, especially the parchments", @2 Timothy 4:13. Bring the books, for every bit of aid that God has furnished He looks for its appropriation. He looks for us to be conversant, to fully follow up, as was said to Timothy, what God gives, so that we might have understanding of the times and to know what Israel ought to do. So Daniel understood by books. It is not a revelation here, yet; he is going to get one. We are encouraged from this passage to read, and God would help us as we move in the light of what we get, and He gives us more. "He that hath, to him shall be given", @Mark 4:25. It is a general principle,
{43}
and it is unalterable. "And he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath", -- a very solemn matter. God looks for diligence in following up what He gives. And so, as Daniel understood, he says, "And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sack-cloth, and ashes", @Daniel 9:3. This is a very beautiful picture of a man who valued prayer, who sought the mind of God, and who valued it and knew how to get it. Indeed, in Daniel's history, you hear of him getting things on his bed, meaning that God gave them sovereignly to him; it is not a question of his own exercise. Exercise is well set out here, as it is in Paul and Elijah -- he put his face between his knees. Here you have sackcloth and fasting, as well as prayer. He goes on to pray and confess his sins, and then in the latter verses I read, you find he says, "And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin", @Daniel 9:20. *Speaking and praying*. I just read this. It speaks for itself. What a praying man or woman is to God, that is, in the true sense of the word, especially if one is harassed by international conditions and what is going to happen. God would have us turn to Him to get His mind as to things, and He opens up to us far more than we ask for. Daniel had only in his mind seventy years, but Gabriel says "thou art greatly beloved". "I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding. At the beginning of thy supplications the word went forth, and I am come to declare it", @Daniel 9:22. Is that written for Daniel only? No, beloved, it is written for us, for our encouragement, that we through the comfort and encouragement of the Scriptures might have hope. No situation is too difficult. We have the Scriptures, and we have it in books that help us to understand the Scriptures, but we get more. And so, Daniel here not only gets something about seventy years which were now coming to an
{44}
end -- the desolations were to be over in seventy years, but that was only preliminary -- Gabriel has much more in his mind than that. He has got seventy *weeks* of years, and those seventy weeks of years began well over two thousand years ago. You see how God enlarges far beyond our expectations. He does "exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think", @Ephesians 3:20, and it is not only the ending of the desolations -- desolations indeed would come, greater and more terrible than had even been known in Israel, and they are to come yet -- a terrible consummation of all the thoughts of God in regard to Jerusalem and His earthly people; but there are seventy weeks, a determined time. There would be sixty-nine weeks of years unto the Messiah, the Prince; there would be the bringing in of everlasting righteousness and there would be an anointing of the holy of holies. What a word that was for Daniel! We can go further than that. The book of Revelation opens up much more than that, dear brethren. It includes this wonderful prophecy that Daniel, and no one else, had, but it includes the heavenly side as well, that God would show to a praying brother or sister who is exercised about international matters, what He is going to do, what is coming in. The glory of the assembly in its heavenly relations is added to all this. It is not only the establishment of Jerusalem, the bringing in of everlasting righteousness, but the coming out from God of the heavenly city, depicted so wonderfully, inclusive of ourselves -- the heavenly city lying four-square, so beautifully depicted in the twenty-first chapter of the book of Revelation.
That is all I had in mind; to show you what prayer means, and how God would lead us to it, and how, if we are led to it and take it up in this way, we shall find much more than we ever anticipated. We shall find "exceeding abundantly" above all that we have asked or thought. There is no limit to what
{45}
God will do for His people. "Thou art greatly beloved". How near it is to the word on the banks of the Jordan, but it anticipated that same blessed Man, for Daniel was but an anticipation, a foreshadowing of Jesus, the Man greatly beloved.
{46}
NEWNESS
@Romans 6:4; @Romans 7:6; @Romans 12:2
What I have in mind dear brethren is to speak about 'newness' as it appears in these three scriptures: newness of life, newness of spirit, and newness of mind by the renewing of our mind. The thought appearing in this threefold way in this epistle shows that it is a fundamental one, and correspondingly involves what is different in a religious sense from anything that has preceded it. The prevalence of the word 'new' in the book of Revelation shows unmistakably that it is to mark the assembly at the end of the dispensation. We have it written in the term "new Jerusalem" to the overcomer in the assembly at Philadelphia, as if to remind us that the overcomer would know that the word 'new' fits at the end as it did at the beginning.
Religion has become prevalent not in the heathen or Jewish sense but in the Christian sense, using common phraseology. When Romans was written religion was either Pagan or Jewish. Now we have the Pagan continuing, and the Jewish only in a little way. We have Mahometanism and we have about a quarter of the world's population nominally Christian, so that the idea of religion is extensive and varied, Christendom being subdivided as we know, alas, into many sects. But whilst there are many and whilst there is variety, yet there is nothing in the accepted Christianity of the day that is properly new, nothing new in the sense in which this verse speaks of newness. I should say a fourth of the world's population has become Christianised. The Lord had directed the apostles to make disciples of all the nations, and what has happened is Christianisation of them which really means no change of heart in the
{47}
nations, characteristically, and there being no change of heart, however good their teaching may be in creeds or the like, there is nothing new in any sense in which these scriptures speak of newness. There are real Christians, of course, among them for God. There are myriads unknown to us not enjoying their privileges. Thus, of course, one makes allowances for them. I am speaking of the general profession. Hence in the last days the idea of newness in divine things is as imperative to be understood as it was at the beginning.
Christianity really is new, meaning that there was nothing like it before. There was nothing current like it before, neither when it was inaugurated, nor shall there be anything like it. And whilst public history shows that it returned to the ordinary, it took on the ordinary religious garb, the Lord has not lost sight of newness, and has wrought in our times to bring it to light. I mean newness in the sense in which it is spoken of in these verses.
The first is newness of life which includes in its application, being elementary, every young Christian here as well as every old Christian. That is what the scripture requires of every believer baptised according to this chapter; and what is in view is not only life but newness of life. God had the thought of life in mind in coming in to order things as we have in the creation. He reached the thought on the third day. But the idea was not newness. It was simply the question of vegetable life, but there is remarkable correspondence in the passages in the record of the third day in @Genesis 1 and @Romans 6, that is the third day brought out the emerging of the dry ground from the envelopment of waters that had hitherto covered the earth. There is remarkable correspondence, for the believer in @Romans 6 has come out similarly. He has been under the waters of baptism and it is not only that there is baptism to Christ but
{48}
unto His death, and His death meant being engulfed. He went to the bottom of the mountains. Deep called unto deep as He was in death. The earth and the bars were round about Him, He says @Jonah 2:6, Jonah being a figure, so that baptism is intended to be a real symbol for the Christian, that is, that he has been *not only* baptised unto Christ. Sprinkling might do for that in a way, but being baptised unto Christ's *death* requires more than sprinkling as a symbol. It requires immersion. That is to say that the believer in principle accepts that Christ's death was really intended to be his. Christ was immune from death. Death had no power over Him. He was the Author of life. He entered into death vicariously, and hence we understand that being baptised unto His death, that death was ours. It was a vicarious death but it was ours and it should be accepted in all its significance as Christ realised it. It was reality to Him. He tasted it. He tasted it in all its reality and it is for the believer to accept it in that sense, so that he comes out of it as the earth emerged by the commandment of God out of the envelopment of the waters, and it was required to bring forth grass and herbs and trees bearing fruit. The believer now has emerged intelligently out of the waters of death and it is that he should walk in newness of life. Romans contemplates us as the same individuals that went into death. It contemplates us here where we were, where we sinned, where we dishonoured God, and dishonoured man, dishonoured ourselves, dishonoured creation. In that very environment, in that very spot, there is to be something new.
Then we find another type in the deluge. The earth again emerged from the waters of death but with the added thought of the means of life, not vegetable life, but animal life and human life appearing in newness. That was the divine thought, dear brethren, that it should not be the same type of man that had caused
{49}
God grief. "Only evil the whole day" -- that was the experience the blessed God had in looking down from heaven before the deluge. He did not intend that to be resumed. He intended newness of life, a new order of things, at least figuratively, and so it was. @Genesis 9 is beautifully fresh coming in after @Genesis 8, in which we are told that Jehovah smelled a sweet savour, a savour of rest. There was some indication there for it is a question of divine experience. Let us not be afraid of the word 'experience' as applied to God, using it in a holy, reverent way. What an experience is depicted in @Genesis 6 and now God would build on it so as to bring in another experience for Himself, and as He looks at anyone of us here tonight, what He has in mind is that He should have another experience, and that the believer should have another experience. Think of the life of God. Think of the joy He has found in man. Now @Genesis 8 points to that, so beautifully set out on the banks of the Jordan. Jehovah smelled a sweet savour, a sweet savour of rest. God would have us to understand what He has in that incense, what experience He had in that odour of rest from the willing sacrifice, the intelligent sacrifice of Noah. And so He entered into the covenant. Chapter 9 is beautifully fresh in that sense. How God took man up would indicate what delight He was going to have in a new world. I am speaking of what stands out and what is realised now is that Christ has become man. I am not intimating for a moment that God did not know what would happen. But what a time was before God! What did He anticipate? He was going to have a time for Himself. Let us not overlook that. What a delight for God! There was to be a suitable state of things while earth remains, that there should be seed time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night. He was going to have a time for Himself. God's own affections entered into this
{50}
from the very outset. What a time He is going to have when the Head of the new system of things comes into power. God has blessed and is not repentant. The blessing stood, and it has come down through Shem, and not for one moment did God forget His line, the delight of His heart. It was only a matter of time. One day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day, @2 Peter 3:8. He was anticipating Jesus. There was the idea of a renewed earth and newness of life, and God entered into covenant with man. The power was there and the power remains fully realised in Jesus on the banks of the Jordan, and He entered into death there figuratively, a figure of righteousness pointing to His own death where it was tasted as He only could taste it. He tasted it vicariously for everything as we are told. Infinitude enters into that, that He could take account of everything knowing well the divine mind as to things and every person -- the hairs of our heads are even numbered, @Matthew 10:30. What infinitude entered into that moment when the Lord Jesus entered into death. How calculated everything was. How perfectly and infinitely balanced were His mind and His affections as He entered into death. God was before Him. He spoke to Him as God on the cross. Man also was before Him, knowing all that was in man and all that he was in his guilt before God. All that and infinitely more was in the mind of our Saviour as He entered into death. How real it all was. The thought in this chapter is to bring us to that. How small in our minds we may be, being in the presence of the infinitude of the death of Jesus, as to all that entered into it, what death really was. The waters of baptism meant that. It is only a figure for us, but the more we clothe it with those thoughts the more we shall understand and profit by baptism.
So the thought is now that He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. What a thought
{51}
that is to be brought in. We have in the previous chapter the glory of God. We rejoice in hope of it. We have been saying together already today, God would cause the glory to enter into our minds, not exactly in our conversion when the light of the gospel comes to us first, but if the gospel is rightly presented, it will bring rays of glory into the souls of the listeners. It involves the gospel of the glory, what God is, and then further, it is the idea of the resurrection of Jesus, that is, what Jesus was to God consequent upon all this that I have been saying. "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again", @John 10:17. What He was to His Father as He lay there in death! What experiences did God have during those three days and three nights! Did it ever enter into your mind that God had experience during those three days and three nights? What was it to Him? The object of His affections lay there in death. Was that nothing to Him? He did not lie there because of Himself. No, He died there vicariously. I want to say that the grave is as vicarious as the cross. God was deprived of Him. What experience was that? Think of what it was to God. Let us not think that God is any different to us in that respect. He has feelings and affections. What was it to Him to be deprived of His Beloved, the supreme, infinite Object of His heart during three days and nights? It was new experience for Him, and those pent-up feelings, holy affections waited the moment that was required. We may find it difficult to work out, but God worked it out perfectly during those three days and nights. It meant more to Him than it meant to any other. When the moment came those affections burst forth, the glory of the Father was there, power was there, but glory was there. How God would appeal to us by the idea of glory. He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. Think of what those affections were as deprived of
{52}
their object. Now the time had come when He could secure eternally those affections. The Father reached forth and took Him out of death in that sense. What did He die to secure? Disciples -- that there should be some continuation in us of that life that was so delightful to God. That is the idea.
So you can understand that when Phoebe from Cenchrea arrived at Rome with this letter they would read it. The whole assembly would come together in one place to read this letter from Paul. Many of them had not seen him. They were going to have a time, you may be sure. They would come together reverently and attentively and these pages would be read over, and they would say. What did this word 'newness' mean. Could Phoebe tell them? No doubt the letter was written in Greek, and would probably be translated into Latin as read in Rome, but you may be sure it was a matter of inquiry as to the meaning of this word 'newness'. And the sisters in the meeting would ask Phoebe about it too. You may be sure that Phoebe would tell them what she knew about the word 'newness' from her acquaintance with the great servant. She had a letter of commendation from the apostle. You may be sure that the brethren would enquire from her, too, and they would say, Well, it is certainly not the kind of life that is led here in Rome. There were some of them in the Palace, at least in later years, and doubtless there were then. The palace life was known and what a life! The senatorial life was known. The military, too, was known, and what a life! There was nothing new about these features of life. There were no features of Christ about them -- nothing new in them, nothing new at all. There were those who attended the shows, a word which has acquired great significance in modern days referring to theatres and cinemas and the like. These had a great place in the ordinary conversation of the Romans, and
{53}
Christians would say, 'It cannot mean that'. There is nothing new in these things, nothing new at all. Christians there in Rome would have to come to the conclusion, as doubtless they did, that newness of life meant the kind of life that shone in Jesus as here upon earth -- that kind of life! There is another wonderful type of this chapter, that is @Exodus 15, @Exodus 16, @Exodus 17, when the Israelites came out of Egypt where their tastes had been very much like the Egyptians tastes. In the wilderness they thought of them. They relished the garlic and onions and flesh and fish and cucumbers. They did not lose their relish for those strong savouries. But we are told that the waters they found after they crossed the Red Sea were brackish. They were unpalatable. The young Christian finds that although he has found a little relief in the gospel there are things brethren are going on with that are not just to his liking, not just palatable. You would rather be somewhere else, maybe, than here. Things are not just palatable, and what happened was that Moses himself could not meet the situation. He had had to do with Egypt, too, in his early days for forty years. He had had to do with the fleshpots of Egypt. No doubt he drank deeply into the pleasures of Egypt, pleasures of sin, but he chose other things besides. He chose "rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season", @Hebrews 11:25. It was a choice according to God, but in the wilderness he did not know how to meet this matter. There was the brackish water and he did not know how to meet it, and God had to show him. There is this principle of being shown and if you young Christians keep with the brethren you will be shown. Moses was shown. The Lord showed him the wood. Some say it was the cross. Though it does mean the cross, it means Christ. It was a new kind of thing. It means that He was in death Himself. It means that He tasted
{54}
death, and the believer says, 'if He tasted it, He has done everything for me'. The fact that He has been into death has changed it. In the next chapter you get the manna. What is it? The people did not know what it was. It was new. Nobody could understand the meaning. All the learning of Rome and of Greece could not instruct them as to the meaning of the manna, as to what it means spiritually -- the life of Jesus here upon the earth -- what that was, and that is the idea for you young believers to get hold of, that the thing is entirely new. A small round thing like a coriander seed came down at a certain time in the morning and there it lay on the desert. What is it? The Holy Spirit will tell you. Nobody gets on in Christianity who does not question. You will get answers as soon as you question. The Spirit of God is here to answer every spiritual question that rises in believers hearts, so that you will get to understand what this new thing is, what the life of Jesus is. He has been into every circumstance that any one of us can be in, sin apart, and we have to understand what that means, how we can live outside those things I have been speaking of in the city of Rome, court life, senatorial life, the sports that were current, and the thousands of other things that people go in for. How will you get on without them? Let every young person ask himself before God. You will find you will get on without them. What are these Christians living on? There is no music, nothing to attract people, not a thing. Nothing to attract the flesh. That is the idea. What is it? Have you not found it? Nearly everybody here has found it. What is this new thing? It is Christ. He is the hidden manna. But nevertheless the same Christ that was here and could be seen at any time in Palestine in those years of His wonderful ministry, for it is said that he not only took a bondman's form but took His place in the likeness of men, @Philippians 2:7. You would
{55}
see a wonderful Man. Others would see nothing but a carpenter. The spiritual eye could see the manna. What was there? Something new that had never been before. That is the idea in the wilderness, that we might walk, not merely attend the meetings. We do breathe life and enjoy it together, of course, but walking is a bond that we might walk in newness of life. God sees that His people are sustained by other things than what are current in this world. Much more might be said about them.
Now I come to the thought of newness of service, that we might serve in newness of spirit. That becomes very practical, dear brethren, and the Lord puts great stress on the idea of the service of God at the present time, and there is always a tendency to drop to the level of what is current in service. Young people always enquire at the outset when light begins to dawn on them, 'Why have we not got this and that?' What you need is this seventh chapter of Romans. Newness of life is more general. The whole public life, the ordinary life of the Christian is new in principle and the heart of God is delighted with it. Would that we could take that in -- the experience with God, not only our experience with Him but His experience with us. The chapter is a struggle. It is a struggle till the day dawns and the believer says, "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God", @Romans 7:25. That is the idea of newness of service -- serving in newness of spirit here. It works out in our assembly meetings, that we do not drop down into the letter, and it is very common, you know. We slip into it very readily without discerning it, sitting down just in a religious way, leaving our houses in a religious way to attend the meetings and sitting down in a religious way. It is all the letter or very largely so. That is what this chapter would check, so that we should keep in mind that those who serve should do
{56}
so in lowliness, in entire freedom from legality, in a reverential way in the presence of God -- serving in newness of spirit, what God has before Him -- not in the oldness of the letter. Under this heading it is to be understood that the hymn book is not a prayer book. It is not what a prayer is in current religion. It is something that is to be used in the spirit. It is a question of the spirit, what the spirit of worship is to be. So we do not make beaten tracks in the hymn book. What I mean is that the hymn book that God has provided, as we believe He has, is to be used in the spirit. "I will sing with the spirit and with the understanding", meaning that I have a spirit, I have something that is in agreement with God, something by which I am in touch with God, and that is brought into gain governed by my understanding, so that in assembly I am in relation to God consciously, not seeking to serve in the letter but in the spirit. All that is done is done as controlled by the renewed mind. That is the next 'new'. The mind is brought in at the end of the chapter. There it is the dominant thought, "I myself with the mind". I am now coming on in the epistle to the idea of serving God, and the mind is dominant. It is a great thing to get into a scriptural way of thinking and the place it gives this great faculty that God has given to us in His service so that we should be set in the assembly, that we should be able to sit steadily controlled by the mind. We know what to do so that we are not carried about by our feelings. We know what governs us and what to do.
"I myself with the mind serve the law of God". Then it leads on. Chapter 8 is full of the Holy Spirit. The thought is that the soul becomes bathed in the Holy Spirit in @Romans 8. Chapters 6 and 7 really set us up on mount Sinai in type, where we serve God. They were to serve God on that mount. It is the same thing only in newness of spirit, not in oldness
{57}
of letter, and then the mind is dominant. The wonderful faculty God has provided for man has not changed, as it were, and chapter 12 shows that it is renewed. It is a new kind of mind. That enters into the holy position in the wilderness. I have taken up an attitude of serving God in His mountain and I am to do it in newness of spirit and I am to be controlled by the mind.
Now I come to the idea of sacrifice. There is no real service of God apart from sacrifice. There is the great sacrifice of Christ and in those who serve that great thought is to be reproduced. Chapter 12 brings in the idea of sacrifice so that it is to present our bodies "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your intelligent service", @Romans 12:1. We are not to be conformed to this world. We have to be transformed. It is a real change by the renewing of the mind. That is another thing. The renewing of the mind is a process that is effected by the Spirit. It is going on all the time. Let us subject our minds, dear brethren, to the Spirit. The Spirit takes charge of the mind. It is dominant in @Romans 7 but the Holy Spirit takes charge of the situation in chapter 8. The believer is a sort of institution and the Holy Spirit is in charge of each one. What a chapter it is. Chapters 9, 10 and 11 are prophetical. Chapter 8 properly links up with chapter 12. The believer bathed in the thought of the Spirit of God is brought to this that he is to be transformed by another instrumentality. That is the renewing of the mind. This is to be understood. The texture of one's mind is changed and it is a totally new mind. The greatest minds, the greatest individuals are not able to understand for a moment that renewed mind. They simply cannot. It is beyond them. Let there be no attempt at all to get down to the level of man's intellect. It is something altogether new. It is to enter into the service of God in the sense of sacrifice. It sees at once that sacrifice
{58}
is essential to the service of God so that the body which every believer has is a means of sacrifice and is far more important in God's eye than millions of money. God needs Christians endued by the Spirit of God and indwelt by the Spirit and in this sense there is a new state of things in us. The body is available and presented living. One might say that in chapter 8 it says it is dead. So it is, but only in a moral sense. The body is dead because of sin. It becomes a corpse in the mind of the believer, no longer to be a vehicle for the expression of the mind of the flesh. In chapter 12 it begins with what is living -- every member vitalised by the blessed presence of the Spirit of God and so presented to God. Think of one's body being capable of being presented to God, not what it has been, but what it is through the redemptive work of Christ, that it can be presented to God, a living sacrifice, and it is by this principle of the renewal of the mind that we prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. I am perfectly clear of the wilderness, no longer complaining, but restful and satisfied. I see that every item of the will of God is good, proving it. It is a wonderful thing to find it is in the Scriptures -- another thing to prove it, to prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God; and now this is the great thought of newness. It is something entirely new and different from what is current in every religion. It is what God is looking for, as I said before of the book of Revelation, what God is looking for in these last days.
May God bless His word.

ASSEMBLY SERVICES
@1 Corinthians 5:3 - 5; @1 Corinthians 11:17 - 22; @1 Corinthians 14:23 - 25; @2 Corinthians 8:23, 24
J.T. What is in mind is to show the services in which the assembly is employed by God as seen in these epistles, that is, as in the Pauline ordering, involving subdivisions of the assembly or, in other words, local assemblies so-called. The assembly is to be used in the future, as we all know, in a great and universal way as one unit. It is seen coming down from God out of heaven in immense proportions representing the full divine thought in the sense of administrative services, but at the present time the administrative services of the assembly are in various localities. Each assembly is constituted to act for God, not independently of the others, but still to act authoritatively for God so as to be representative of Him in what is needed during this period of testimony.
In the scriptures read the first service executed by the assembly is that of discipline, the second is celebrating the Lord's supper, then prophetic ministry and then in connection with the administration of the bounty of the saints in material things. These and other services are maintained in the way of testimony in the assembly. The apostle presents the assembly to us in both epistles as the assembly of God in Corinth; that is, the assembly of God in any city or town or place as representative of Him; it is that which He has in view of these needed administrative services. That is what is in mind at this time.
R.S.T. All these services are carried out on an equally high level. You were saying that the assembly is representative of God in a city.
J.T. That is a very important side of the matter. Assembly functioning therefore would exclude all
{60}
that would be unsuitable to the anointing, and all such activities or administrative services are in the dignity of the anointing.
H.W. Are they intended to set forth something of God here?
J.T. I think that is obvious. It ought to be before us in coming together in assembly for any of these services that we are representative of God. Sometimes assembly meetings, so-called, lose their dignity and character because of the introduction of discussion and deliberation and investigation. The assembly is for administration and whatever service it may render it does it in the dignity of the anointing.
H.W. Recognition of that would help us to see the importance of the place the Spirit is given at the beginning of this epistle. The whole of the second chapter is mainly taken up with the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so. The apostle had led the way in that, because he shows that his services were by the Spirit, as he says, "And my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power", @1 Corinthians 2:4
P.D. Do you distinguish between coming together in assembly and the whole assembly coming together in one place?
J.T. Yes. The whole assembly coming together in one place is not exactly that it should function in a collective sense, but that it should afford a suitable sphere for prophetic ministry or ministry by the Spirit, so that the point is "the whole assembly", that is, all the saints in the place, so that God has full strength, as it were, in what is on hand, whereas a subdivision in a locality would come together in assembly to partake of the Lord's supper according to @1 Corinthians 11. It is not *the* assembly but the character of the gathering as in assembly.
Rem. An assembly meeting for discipline would
{61}
necessitate all the saints being together from the various subdivisions, would it not?
J.T. That is what I would understand. In the verses read he was writing to the whole assembly and saying, "Ye and my spirit being gathered together". I would take the 'ye' there to imply all, but as gathered together the word 'assembly' is not brought in but it is clearly implied. Is that your thought?
Rem. Yes. I wondered whether you would say more as to the fact that it is not intended to be a deliberative meeting where discussions take place. All the facts would be thoroughly sifted and arrived at before the assembly meeting was called.
J.T. Yes. So that a mere precise statement of the established facts is all that is needed for the assembly's conscience. The assembly will accept testimony. The whole tenor of Scripture is that it should. It accepts accredited testimony and acts accordingly.
Rem. So that any action that follows the establishment of the matter in the mouth of two or three witnesses becomes authoritative and binding.
J.T. That is what @Matthew 18 clearly sets out and it is set out here, too, and later Paul alludes directly to that and to Deuteronomy which lays down as basic in regard to disciplinary matters that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word is established. It makes the position clear and dignified as accredited testimony is presented by those who have examined into the matter. The assembly acts on that.
E.S.H. Would you say something about "with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ"?
J.T. That comes in if the brethren are all clear as to the position established in 'ye', that is, the saints coming together. "Ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ". These elements are the saints and Paul's spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is a very strong position, an irresistible one, one implying
{62}
judgment that would be effective, for that is what is in mind. A person is to be delivered to Satan. Not that we would apply that in any literal way now but still the principle enters into all discipline. There is an act of God through this instrumentality.
C.S.S. Does coming together in assembly suggest that the individual side is lost sight of entirely?
J.T. You mean the individuals forming the assembly? Yes, it is a collective thought. @Matthew 18 would show that it is very authoritative and dignified. "Tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly ...", @Matthew 18:17. All that is collective.
F.I. Judgment arrived at can only be arrived at in the assembly, not by the respective witnesses. Witnesses bring their evidence which would enable the conscience of the assembly to come to a judgment. It is the assembly that comes to a judgment.
J.T. That is right; that is how the thing stands. Judgment is by the assembly.
H.W. Why does the apostle say "and my spirit"? Why not just "the power of the Lord"?
J.T. I suppose the allusion to Paul's spirit in this way would imply the organism underlying all assembly services, but the local assembly acts in relation to what is elsewhere, and in the measure in which the action is known there is support for it. These epistles provide for the general fellowship as well as the local fellowship. A local action is really an action of the whole assembly in principle and carries with it what there is on earth. I think it enlarges the position, bringing into it what God has. Paul's spirit, of course, would be special, being who he was and having been used to gather and convert the saints at Corinth, but still he represents what there is in a general way.
H.W. I wondered if in our day it would involve that we come together in the light of the apostle's teaching as governed by it.
{63}
J.T. That is good, too. It is his spirit. All that a man is would enter into what his spirit is. It alludes, I think, to the organism and the possibility of the Spirit being there.
P.D. Would the spirits of just men enter into it?
J.T. In the sense that Paul was one? Yes, quite so. The spirit of any just man on earth would be with an action such as is contemplated here.
H.W. That would teach us it would be a very serious thing to be out of accord with such a judgment.
J.T. Indeed. It does away with local independency.
S.W. Would such a judgment be based upon and supported by a specific scripture?
J.T. Scripture may be brought in, and ought to be. No judgment, I am sure, should be publicly announced without the direct authority of Scripture or it may be invalid, because after all we may come together and make mistakes. It brings out, I think, the delicacy of the matter, that the organism underlies it, that is, Paul's spirit representing the organism. His spirit could be present although he was not there laterally and bodily. Of course, the Lord was there. "The power of our Lord Jesus Christ". So that the position is extremely delicate and solemn and I believe it should impress us with the need of being there in the recognition of the organism and that no element should be active other than operates in the organism normally.
F.W.W. That is what you meant just now when you spoke of the Pauline assemblies. Does it take character from Paul?
J.T. Yes, they are contemplated in these epistles as directly his.
F.W.W. I thought so. That is the basis upon which we move today.
J.T. Quite so. It is that or it is nothing. We are moving in the light of these things now in any cases
{64}
of discipline. It is very solemn, so that we should be impressed with the need of righteousness to the exclusion of all other elements because that enters into the holiness of God's house.
P.D. They that are spiritual are to recognise that what he says is the commandment of the Lord.
J.T. That is right, and they will, too.
R.S.T. What is involved in the expression "for I ... have already judged?"
J.T. That, of course, is apostolic. He accepted the testimony that came to him as true. Ordinarily we might say, How did he know? But he is an apostle and was used of the Lord to set up this economy. He understood its workings perfectly. He himself knew by the testimony presented that the facts were as he stated here for he sets down the facts himself. What he says here should be followed in any case of discipline. The facts are very clearly stated in verses 1 and 2, and it is a good example, too, for he is very brief in what he says and yet it is a most heinous sort of thing, a terrible crime. He will not admit of any controversy about it in the assembly; it is there.
S.W. Is it not important that he did not judge as at a distance, but as present in spirit?
J.T. Quite so, very good.
N.K.McL. Would you say a word as to the bearing of the day of the Lord Jesus upon assembly discipline?
J.T. It refers to the judgment. The word 'day' would be suggestive of the time when everything is manifest and clear. Other things would enter into the day of the Lord's coming, but 'the day' would imply perfect clarity as to everything and judgment in it, too. What would you say yourself?
N.K.McL. I wondered whether the bearing would be that the rights of the Lord had been infringed in the assembly and everything would come out in
{65}
connection with those rights in the day of the Lord Jesus.
J.T. The man is fit for that day. He is cleared through discipline. It is to bring out the service which discipline renders to a person disciplined. It constitutes him fit for the day of the Lord Jesus, that is, that his spirit should be saved. He would therefore, as we see in the next epistle, as the flesh is destroyed, be ready for restoration. It is complete destruction of the flesh that is in mind, Satan being employed. It is a remarkable state of things. Satan is brought into it.
Rem. He is made to serve God's end.
J.T. Just so. He is fit for the day of the Lord Jesus. His spirit is saved. It is a very striking statement of what discipline may effect. This is an outstanding case, but still it is the principle of all discipline, that it is not punitive, although Paul does use punitive expressions, but still it is not to destroy the man but to destroy the flesh, to do the best service that could be rendered to him at the time.
F.W.W. Would Job be an example of this?
J.T. The book of Job is intended to unfold to us the principles governing discipline and the end of the Lord. How completely Job was saved in his spirit and personally, too!
F.W.W. Satan was used as the tool, was he not?
J.T. Jehovah would have Job come under discipline in this way, and Satan was ready, showing that although he would damage the assembly, as there, God would use him. It is a very fine testimony to the supremacy of God in all circumstances, and that supremacy is what belongs to the assembly, too, over all circumstances, that even Satan, although near us, may be turned to good account.
H.W. "That the spirit may be saved", is the object of all this.
J.T. That is what is stated, "... him that hath so
{66}
wrought this: to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan for the destruction of the flesh", @1 Corinthians 5:4,5. There is no admission of any possibility of it being wrong, because it is "being such". First we read "him that hath so wrought this", and again "being such". The matter is definitely so. There is no question about it that it is so.
Rem. And the witness should be able to state that it is so.
J.T. That is the idea exactly, so that every conscience is carried that it is so.
Rem. In point of practice, you would expect the brother who would be voicing the judgment of the assembly to refer to a scripture that would name the thing as God saw it.
J.T. I am sure that is a right and convicting procedure. It is a definite statement of the facts. The use of Scripture to confirm and guide is certainly to be desired, and should be followed, too.
Ques. Would you think it necessary that the facts should be corroborated by a second brother?
J.T. I think it might, but that brings in another matter, that is of confidence. No doubt one should state the facts and another corroborate them, but confidence would accept that the findings stated by the one brother had come from the brethren who had investigated the matter, because they would be all there and silence would give consent, but the less cumbersome the better these things are. There is no need for formalities. If the statement is made plainly, the conscience is carried. All the brethren who investigated the matter would be there, and there would be no doubt about it. But still two witnesses would be right.
F.W.W. Is it important to keep the organism in view?
J.T. I think it is. The brothers and sisters present are all in the thing and have already learnt how
{67}
to hold themselves bodywise, not as so many units present but they are present bodywise. That comes out more in the Lord's supper but still the organism must be present in the assembly services, even in discipline.
C.S.S. Would you say another word with regard to "the power of our Lord Jesus Christ?" This is God's assembly, is it not? It is not exactly the power of God that we have in Ephesians, for instance. Twice he mentions "our Lord Jesus Christ".
J.T. It is the power of God used mediatorially. The Lord is given His full title in connection with the execution of such matters, implying that they are all in his hands. I think that is about all it could be, to bring in the authority of Christ, for that is most important. The apostle himself represented that.
N.B.S. Would you think if we were under the hand of the Lord that two or three scriptures would be all that is required on the line of a prophetic word from the Lord to deal with the matter? Sometimes we have a large number of scriptures.
J.T. As far as I know generally disciplinary affairs and judgments are made unduly cumbersome. Scripture of course, is always Scripture, but this chapter deals with a very outstanding matter in eight verses. I am not saying that these verses should not be amplified in their application but brevity and dignity, I think, should mark disciplinary matters. What do you say yourself?
N.B.S. I want help. If we are together in dependence on the Lord He would give the needed word as you say, in brevity, and sometimes the multiplicity of scriptures referred to does not conduce to help in the matter.
F.I. Going back a bit, in regard to the organism, you do not view the organism as confined to the local company but the local company as moving in view of the whole assembly.
{68}
J.T. Yes, only that the thought of the organism is applied to the local assembly, too, but without the article preceding it. "*Ye* are Christ's body", that is, they were that in character and that brings the thing in specially to that local position, whilst including by extension the whole assembly on earth, and I think Paul's spirit being present would suggest that it is well to keep that in mind.
F.I. I was thinking that. One was feeling that in the judgment come to in a local assembly it should be in view that it should be a judgment which should be accredited by the whole assembly universally.
J.T. Yes, you can see how the rendering of authoritative decisions by brothers alone is contrary to Scripture.
H.W. I wondered if you would go on to that. Do you mean in the care meeting?
J.T. Yes.
H.W. You spoke about the organism being more distinctly connected with the celebration of the Lord's supper.
J.T. It comes in there and we are formally said to be one body in @1 Corinthians 10. I think it can be readily understood that the features of the assembly itself would come into more evidence when we come to the celebration of the Lord's supper than it would in @1 Corinthians 5 which stresses their being gathered together without mentioning the body. "For I, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged ..." and then "ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ". It is a question of accuracy and established facts and power in chapter 5 but in @1 Corinthians 11, beginning indeed with @1 Corinthians 10:15, we get the organism produced; it is represented in the bread. It is a very touching thing that we should correspond with the bread which is the Lord's body, so that it would be a love matter as permeating the saints.
{69}
P.D. Would you connect the thought of organism with the body as seen in the loaf?
J.T. Well, it is stated in connection with the loaf, "The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of the Christ? Because we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf", @1 Corinthians 10:17 That is what I was alluding to. It is very elementary and, in the service that attaches to it, whilst we may have all the light of Scripture as to the body in our minds, we should confine ourselves to what is applicable at that particular time in the service, not bring in all that relates to the body which Colossians and Ephesians teach, but confine ourselves to what is applicable at that time. It bears on what we are as together, whether we are there bodywise. It does not say we are the body of Christ; it is one body. It is the idea of unity and affection; although we are many we are one body.
H.W. Is that the prominent thought in your mind when you speak about the assembly of God being here in testimony with regard to these various features, that there is the setting forth of Christ here in connection with the Lord's supper?
J.T. Yes. I thought these two chapters show how this great service, perhaps the greatest of all the services rendered by the assembly here on earth, is the service of the celebration of the Lord's supper. The apostle formally detaches the Lord's supper from the houses of the saints. Evidently it had been attached to them according to @Acts 2, but now it is in the assembly. "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper". It means that their conduct excluded the Lord's supper, but normally it should have been to eat the Lord's supper.
Ques. Is there anything more than party spirit that would interfere with that? It is the great way in which that service would be interrupted by the
{70}
introduction of what is divisional amongst the saints.
J.T. It seems to be the leading thought in what the apostle says. It is more than what is said in @1 Corinthians 1:12 -- "*I* am of Paul, and *I* of Apollos, and *I* of Cephas". It is more than that here; it is that greatly accentuated. They actually carried divisions and partisan feelings into the assembly. It is more serious because he says, "when ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper. For each one in eating takes his *own* supper before others, and one is hungry and another drinks to excess. Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? Or do ye despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them who have not?" It would seem that they were eating in coteries together as professedly gathered in assembly and thus nullifying what they professed to do. It was not the Lord's supper. They were eating in companies and the poor ones who had no houses or no means were left out. It was distressing. You marvel at the length to which partisan feeling can go.
Rem. It may extend to this if it is not judged earlier.
J.T. Just so. It will be carried into the assembly in some way or other, and in that sense will nullify what we come together for, so that we may come together and fail in the object for which we come together.
F.W.W. Would the partisan spirit, the independent spirit, break up the feature of the organism?
J.T. Clearly so. It is the sphere of the devil where persons are eating in several coteries and others not. He has a place in such a condition. They were despising the assembly of God, although the apostle does not say so here.
H.W. Whilst we are sitting down together in one circle are we in danger of doing this in a spiritual way
{71}
and there being divisions or discord amongst the saints?
J.T. Yes, we may not be sitting in companies but inwardly we may be just as divided and even carry feelings of animosity into the assembly.
Ques. Would the allowance of that deprive us of the Lord's presence with us?
J.T. It does. It breaks up the organism and, of course, there is evil in it, too; there is leaven in it. So that we are enjoined to purge out the old leaven, whatever it may be. There is no time to enlarge on any of these subjects but only to bring out how they all fit into the assembly. The matter of prophetic ministry is the next service rendered. The assembly becomes the sphere of it, but it is the whole assembly in a place. "If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place ..."
Ques. Do you mean that the success of prophetic meetings is not only dependent upon the presence of the prophets but the saints together in that character?
J.T. That is a good way to put it and a very important way. It ought to appeal to us to be present at such a meeting; everyone should be present; the more there are the greater the power.
H.W. That would show the importance of the opening verses -- "Follow after love". Love is to be seen actively working amongst the saints.
J.T. In touching the matter of gift in chapter 12 he says, "... and yet show I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence". So that the saints themselves are greater than the gift or gifts present. The way of surpassing excellence is in the saints. It is not a question in that statement of the gifts but of the whole assembly. The whole assembly is a sphere of love -- the way of surpassing excellence. Think of what it is to God when we all come together actuated by love -- the more excellent way. What a sphere there is for gift, how much liberty there is, and the
{72}
Spirit of God can unfold the mind of God to the gifts.
P.D. Spiritual conditions amongst the saints would make way for the prophetic word.
J.T. Clearly, it involves all the saints according to @Acts 2:1, "they were all together in one place". They were there of one accord and the Spirit came in as if to honour that and that should be in our minds in an assembly meeting.
E.L.G. Does "all together in one place" provide a better atmosphere for a prophetic word than coming together in separate subdivisions?
J.T. I am sure it is so. Whatever proportion a city may take on God has his best in all the saints together. That is what He has in the way of public testimony here, and the way that love is brought in in these chapters as making way for gift is very striking. It is delightful to heaven to see the saints *all* together and in the more excellent way, and way of surpassing excellence, that is, the way of love.
H.W. The working of this organism that you spoke of is greatly hampered on account of the conditions we are found in. I was wondering how it worked in these broken days.
J.T. Broken conditions, of course, interfere. We cannot get all the saints in Adelaide together, nor in any town or city in the world, and hence God has not His best in our meetings now, but still He recognises what there is and according to the Scriptures all Israel that are present come in for things only they are in lesser power because the Lord says to Philadelphia, "Thou hast a *little* power".
C.S.S. Does it take in the recognition of what God has set in the assembly?
J.T. That is the idea. Chapter 12 shows that God has set gifts in the assembly; chapters 13 and 14 are to bring out the love. That is the great thing. Love abides and goes through. "And the greater of these is love", @1 Corinthians 13:13. It is called the way of surpassing
{73}
excellence. What a thought that is -- that we can furnish that under God's eye in any town! That is the way of love, and then the gifts have scope. Of course the gifts themselves may be hampered in themselves as to who should take part, but what is in mind in the end of chapters 12 and 13 is the way of love which includes all the saints.
Ques. Does the effect of prophetic ministry depend on what has gone before in connection with discipline and in connection with the breaking of bread?
J.T. I think these things are in their order. If discipline is not attended to and the breaking of bread is not maintained in its true sense, then we cannot expect a ministry according to this chapter. We cannot expect the way of surpassing excellence.
J.P.Sr. You spoke of chapter 11 as representing the unity and affection. Would this bring in unity and dependence as to God's mind for His people in this city?
J.T. Very good, that is just what I would say. Love makes the way for it, love in all the saints. I am sure we should pay attention to that. The whole assembly come together in one place and love being there, there is an opportunity for the Spirit to unfold the mind of God. It is a question of intelligence.
Rem. Where those conditions existed you would expect the Spirit of God to come upon a prophet.
J.T. You would. To go back to @Acts 2, the standard is that all the saints are there. You say, it is one hundred and twenty; there may have been others. We do not know, but they were all there; they were there of one accord and in one place; then heaven began to move. They heard a sound. It is fine when you hear a rustling among the brethren. You feel in your spirit that something is going to be said; everyone is aglow and you do hear something because the Holy Spirit has scope. The right conditions are there.
{74}
Rem. It is set forth prophetically in many a scripture, but we see in @2 Chronicles 20 how Jehoshaphat called a fast and it says "all Judah stood before the Lord ... Then ... came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation; and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah", @2 Chronicles 20:15. In principle you would expect that in a prophetic meeting.
J.T. Very good indeed, for "all Judah" there would be the whole kingdom. Many stay at home for a trifle, you know, but really they are interfering with this matter; they are interfering with the organism and they are not functioning when they are not there.
H.W. Many, alas, only look upon the assembly as a place of the celebration of the Lord's supper and do not consider these other important aspects.
J.T. No.
E.W.C. How frequent should such meetings be? Weekly or monthly?
J.T. As far as my experience goes, monthly, and God seems to honour them and they are not allowed to displace other meetings. They ought to be additional to other meetings.
E.K. Are they connected with the thought of the new moon? It says, "Blow up the trumpet in the new moon", @Psalm 81:3. Would that suggest that there should be a distinctive note in the meeting for ministry?
J.T. Yes, but it is just a question of the word 'month'; it does not enter into church economy. I think it is properly Jewish, Israelitish. Ours is the weekly. The scope for the services seems to include the week. That is @John 20 would show that the Lord came in on the first day of the week and came in eight days afterwards. What intervened would be the development of what came out of the first incoming of Christ, and then there is another incoming a week afterwards and that seems to set up the principle governing our dispensation. But the month and the new moon are Jewish so that making it monthly
{75}
would be more a matter of convenience, I think. The Lord recognises what we do; He is with us in what we do. "I am with you all the days", He says, @Matthew 28:20. If we come together, if it is convenient, for an additional meeting in a month, the Lord is with us in that. I am not ignoring what you say as to the new moon, but strictly it is an Israelitish symbol, I think. The remnant of Israel which had once been lost to view has come back again.
Ques. Do you mean that it is a matter of wisdom rather than principle?
J.T. I think it is a matter of wisdom, the Lord leaving these things to us. He does not tell us to have a reading on Wednesday and a prayer meeting on Monday; He leaves these things. There is latitude in that way in our services.
Rem. So that if we are not wilful we will soon find what God honours and supports amongst the saints.
J.T. That is just it. One has often suggested that our procedure at such a meeting as this and other meetings may not exactly correspond with what they did at the beginning but the Lord is manifestly with the brethren and they are not out of keeping with what is mentioned at the beginning. Whether the meetings then took the same form, I do not know. It would be questionable.
C.S.S. Do you suggest that all localities should be alive to this matter of coming together in one place for these meetings? Sometimes there does not seem the power for it.
J.T. The power is supposed to be when they come together. It is when we come together that power is realised. In truth it is a matter of faith. The Lord says, "According to your faith be it unto you", @Matthew 9:29
N.B.S. I was going to enquire the difference between "whenever ye come together" in @1 Corinthians 14:26 and "if then the whole assembly come together" in @1 Corinthians 14:23.
{76}
J.T. I think the "if" in verse 23 bears out what we were saying. It is left open, as if the Lord would say, 'If you do it, whenever you do it I am with you'. Then verse 26 is enlarging on the matter as to the procedure. "What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together". There again it is "whenever". It is not a stated time like a weekly meeting. He indicates the order in which the service is to be carried on. But in chapter 11 it says, "when ye come together in assembly". It is not 'if' but "when" as if it were a definite thing and practice; that he is dealing with a definite thing that went on amongst them. The "if" and the "whenever", I think, suggest a little more openness and elasticity as regards this meeting than what we have stated as regards the Lord's supper. What do you say yourself?
N.B.S. I thought that. But I wondered if "whenever" left it open where the whole assembly together in one place is in view.
J.T. We can only act in the light of these things, as we always say, but the Lord is with us. What can anyone say if the Lord is with us? And every Christian sensitive in the organism knows when He is there. That is one of the features of the organism that you discern that He is with us.
J.P.Sr. We would delight to come together for such occasions to know the presence of God amongst us.
J.T. Just so. It is a question of God at His strength, so to speak, in this passage, that He has got the full strength of what He has in the place under His hand and hence the great results in the ministry of prophecy.
F.I. Do you think that a meeting like this would be helpful in times of crisis or difficulty amongst us locally?
J.T. Very much so. @1 Samuel 19 brings that out most strikingly. It was a time of great crisis because
{77}
Saul was endeavouring to slay David -- a terrible state of things. Jonathon saves David and Michael saves David, but then this final attack seems to be irresistible. Saul sends messengers to where David was and when they come, instead of taking David they find the prophets prophesying under the presidency of Samuel. It is the full thought of the thing, and the messengers come under the power of ministry and they do not attack David. Other messengers of Saul come and the same thing happens. It is the power of ministry. Finally Saul himself comes and the same thing happens. That brings out in a most striking manner what prophecy is as meeting a crisis. The enemy is completely defeated.
S.W. Prophetic ministry is not limited to a meeting of this character.
J.T. Indeed no, but it ought to enter into a meeting like this.
Ques. Would we get a greater sense that God is for us in prophetic ministry?
J.T. Yes. You can see how the assembly would be established at Corinth in occurrences like this -- the occurrences that are described in verses 24 and 25. "But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or simple person come in, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all; the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling upon his face, he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you", @1 Corinthians 14:24 - 25. It is said of that man that he reports things and he falls down and worships God which is the great thought. It secures the worship of God, but then he reports things. You can understand how he would go home to his house and say, I have a wonderful experience today. I have never been in a company like that. I have been in the Jewish synagogue and the idol house but I went into the Christian assembly today and it was a wonderful time. That is what God has. And that man comes into the benefit of what God
{78}
has, and now he is reporting it, so that the assembly is enhanced immensely by the power of God expressed in prophetic ministry.
E.B. Is this really the answer to the first chapter in regard to God's assembly? It is the testimony rendered now and God is indeed there.
J.T. Quite so. "That God is indeed amongst you". The man is convicted and would tell the truth.
E.B. All these matters cause us great exercise at the present moment in view of making room for God to come in, which He desires. Every one of us should be greatly concerned to provide these occasions for divine Persons to operate.
J.T. That is the point, that *all* were present, the whole assembly, and then all prophesying. The idea of prophecy is to be in our minds, not simply teaching, but prophesying.
Ques. Does it mean that every brother should learn to hold himself available on such an occasion?
J.T. That I think is what is in mind, so that you have in the procedure described, that if one is speaking something may be revealed to another sitting by and the one that is speaking is to know that and that brings out that the organism underlies this, the sensitiveness by which we discern that another has something from God and you sit down immediately to make room for that other.
E.W.C. What would be the character of what is prophetic in such a meeting as that?
J.T. The effect of it on the soul of this man we read about is that he is convicted of all. That is, all that are present are brought into the conviction. It is a collective matter and he is judged of all; they are brought into it. And then the secrets of his heart are manifested and thus falling upon his face he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you. That, I think, illustrates what the prophetic ministry is. It is bringing God to his
{79}
conscience so that he worships God as convicted of sin. But all the others convicted him, too; they are all in it.
N.K.McL. That would include brothers and sisters as well.
J.T. Yes, it is the whole assembly.
F.I. Would you say that although you may get prophetic ministry in our comings together generally, yet in normal conditions there will be more power in a meeting of this description of which we are speaking?
J.T. That is evidently what God had in mind, to bring out what He had in Corinth as over against all else that was there. God was in the assembly and here is a man completely secured for God. He is securing men for Himself and they are worshippers to worship God.
F.I. That is, the meeting primarily is not for the man but for believers. As the result of the prophetic word it showed the power there was there by the man being brought under conviction.
J.T. I should say that every person present would feel the thing that brought that man to confess his secrets, that every person present would also be searched by the same thing. The others had judged themselves normally but this man had not till now. He is convicted of all and judged of all, which means that we are all judged by the same ministry. You say, It searched my soul; I understand that man because it searched my soul. That is the idea. God comes to us in prophecy and searches the secrets of our hearts like the woman in @John 4:29, who said, "He told me all things that ever I did". That is the thing that she stresses in her testimony to the men.
Ques. Do you think as having gone through this process there would be more bounty available?
J.T. That is the next thing. The subject begins in the first epistle, "Put by at home", @1 Corinthians 16:2. You can understand that when a man is converted like this and
{80}
he is a worshipper of God that he tells his wife and family and what happens? They are all converted. If we worship God we should bring all our material things to God, too, because they are included, they are needed for the service of God. In our verses it is said that the messengers carried this bounty. That is, Titus and others are "messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory", @2 Corinthians 8:23
Rem. There is a peculiar feature then about assembly giving that bears that character.
J.T. It seems to me that is how the giving of the saints will work out. Other things, of course, affect us, but the prophetic word ought to affect us. God has needs in the testimony for such as we have materially, and we should in a balanced way prepare for the collection as God has prospered us. That is the way to put it. Here the bounty was actually accumulated and passed through assembly hands, so that these messengers are messengers of assemblies and they are Christ's glory.
H.W. This thought of glory is very beautiful coming in here. Is it the thought that the messengers are Christ's glory or the assemblies?
J.T. I think the immediate reference is to the messengers, but of course, it involves the assemblies because they are messengers of the assemblies, but what a thought that a man travelling from Corinth, we will say, to Jerusalem, carrying this money is an expression of Christ's glory. What an attractive thought that is.
H.W. Because it was an expression of what God is -- the bounty of the saints.
J.T. Exactly.
E.I. Does the laying aside at home bring into view the family idea, that which is a support in relation to the assembly?
J.T. I would think so. Wife and children are
{81}
brought into it. From my understanding of it it is a household matter, in the sense of budgeting.
Rem. So that the matter of giving is always presented as on the basis of calculation and sobriety. Although the first day of the week is brought in to give the right sentiment to free us, there is no question of *mere* sentiment.
J.T. It is not a mere sentiment, but it is remarkable that it is brought in there. It is not brought in in relation to the Lord's supper but it is brought in in relation to the giving.
Rem. The laying up at home is in relation to how God has prospered you and what you give in relation to the assembly would be on the principle of calculation.
J.T. That is what is stated. A man comes in with his salary on Saturday and takes his wife into account and they talk about matters. They have their expenses to meet. It is a question of how the Lord has prospered him. It would be simple mathematics. But on Lord's day morning he would discuss the matter again and say, We must be liberal, you know; this is the first day of the week; and the Lord was rich and He became poor for our sakes that we through His poverty might become rich, so that he would be apt to give a little more. Still the principle of mathematics or counting or weighing comes into it because it is according to the prospering, whether he has made more that week or not. He is supposed to know and give accordingly. Paul is very particular on that line, so that we should budget what we have to give. We know each other and know pretty well what we can do on the principle of counting, so that the budget is to be on that principle -- we can do so much.
R.S.T. How would the question of present need bear upon our giving weekly? I mean, you were speaking of budgeting. Most of us do that locally.
{82}
Some months there is need for more than others. Do you think we take that into account in our giving?
J.T. There ought to be increase. The announcement of a need ought to bring out the excess. We should sacrifice a little more to meet it. Budgeting has that in mind. The need is to be met.
P.D. Would the thought of the first day of the week appeal to the affections of the saints and cause them to respond?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. A spiritual man would refer to that, how the Lord sacrificed everything, not only that He accomplished redemption, but He was continuous in His love. He sought out the loved ones and looked after them. That is the idea -- you continue in the thing.
N.B.S. The brother conveying the bounty was admitted to a very dignified service.
J.T. It is remarkable how Paul Himself had been used in it. It tells us in Romans and in @Acts 11 that he himself and Barnabas and now Titus had been used in it. It is no ordinary matter. The glory of Christ is in it.
{83}
THE ASSEMBLY'S BEGINNING AND FAILURE
@Revelation 1:9 - 20; @Revelation 3:7 - 13; @Matthew 18:15 - 20
J.T. The proposal is in view of bringing out the position in the book of Revelation as to the general history of the assembly. The passage in Matthew is suggested because it will enable us to see how the assembly began to function, as one might say, officially, and Revelation shows how it broke down; at least it records the fact. It is thought it will help us all to see how the breakdown took place, and hence the necessity for this book -- what is called the Apocalypse. It is clearly distinct from ordinary assembly epistles and the gospels. It contemplates the breakdown of what the gospels and epistles present as inaugurated by the Lord Himself and by the Spirit. So that we have the Revelation given to the Lord Himself: "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him", @Revelation 1:1.
A.P.T. What would the apostle John represent in this matter himself?
J.T. Well, he is a prophet, and not simply an ordinary person who might be included in the list of prophets. They come in second in the list in the classification of gifts in Ephesians: "apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers". John has to be regarded as distinct from the ordinary prophets. No doubt all the apostles had the gift of prophecy, but the book of Revelation is not simply a ministry as in the assembly convened; it is written, not spoken but written by one specially used. As it is said here, "he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John", @Revelation 1:1. This could hardly be said of any ordinary prophet as is included in the classification in Ephesians. John is viewed as a special servant, a bondman to whom the thing is
{84}
signified; not simply revealed by the Spirit in the ordinary sense. It is said that the prophets of old spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, but the word here is 'signified'; "he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John". Clearly, therefore, he has a distinct place, a unique place.
A.R. Can we not come into that place by being bondmen?
J.T. That is a word entering into the book in a special way. It is said, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place". But the whole Apocalypse was signified to John. Other bondmen come into it. It is important that we should, too; every one of us; but John has a unique place. In fact, there is hardly another just like it in all the Scriptures.
R.W.S. Why does God allow the breakdown?
J.T. Well, perhaps it may be to show what He can do in meeting it. You wonder why He allowed Peter to break down, or David. It may be that He intends to show what He can be, or what He is in meeting breakdowns; and this meeting now is in order that we might make inquiry as to what marked the beginning and what marked the breakdown.
A.A.T. Has every testimony broken down? Has the testimony of the different dispensations broken down?
J.T. That is a different thing. The Lord's did not break down; you know that. You would say that. But every dispensation did, because dispensations are committed into the hands of men.
J.T.Jr. Is there a difference between the external side of testimony and what we might refer to as a remnant -- what is faithful?
J.T. That comes out in this book. The first thing is to compare verse 9 with Matthew. The opening verses up until then are introductory; we might say
{85}
prefatory, but John is introduced in this formal way: "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus. I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day", @Revelation 1:9,10. Now we have nothing like this in his history as an apostle. Then what follows here is, "I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet, saying, What thou seest write in a book, and send to the seven assemblies: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea. And I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden lamps, and in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man". I think we see here the clue to @Matthew 18. That is, the Lord is in the midst of the seven lamps or light-bearers. It says in @Matthew 18, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", @Matthew 18:20. He is here in the midst of seven assemblies, seven light-bearers. The link is plain enough that He is in the midst in both cases, only there is a great difference between the "in the midst" in Matthew and the "in the midst" of the scene in Patmos. The Lord Himself spoke in @Matthew 18 and there are no habiliments at all suggested like these in @Revelation 1, so that we have to inquire, Why the change?
F.H.L. Do not some features of this position remain right from Pentecost through to the taking away of the church? The seven are in view, are they not, in the sense that there is a complete thought from the beginning to the end?
J.T. Just so; only there is a great difference between the Lord's attitude here in Revelation and @Matthew 18. @Matthew 18 must depict what immediately followed -- the inauguration of the assembly at Pentecost, whereas this contemplates an era long
{86}
after; although John was alive at Pentecost and he is alive here, but great services took place, including Paul's to bring about these seven assemblies.
A.R. Is @Matthew 18 favourable whereas @Revelation 1 is unfavourable? There are unfavourable conditions in Revelation in the seven assemblies. He is there judicially or governmentally, like the Son of man.
J.T. Quite so. That is the point, just to see the difference; whether the cause is somewhat to be found in @Matthew 18 in trespass by the brethren.
A.N.W. He is in the midst, is He not, in @Revelation 1, whether they will or whether they will not; whether they are together in His Name or not? Is that not so? Is that not His rightful position as in the midst of what bears His Name?
J.T. It is; and He is there because there is some basis for His being there. Some here abandon even that position so there must be some basis for His being there in Patmos. He is not mentioned first Himself. What John sees is not the Lord Himself but the seven lamps, as if they were still worthy of notice. They are, indeed, called lamps or light-bearers so that this light was still there shining.
W.C.R. Is there any thought of decline in @Matthew 18 in connection with the two or three?
J.T. I think there is. The trespass is perhaps the secret of what we find in Revelation. The first point in @Matthew 18 is, "Tell it to the assembly" without any question of her authority or decline. But then the Lord says, "Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", @Matthew 18:19,20. That would link on pretty well with Philadelphia in Revelation, so that the first part of the passage or
{87}
paragraph in @Matthew 18 is what you might call pristine assembly conditions where it is formally owned. "Tell it to the assembly". It formally owns the official place of the assembly. But when the Lord says, "Again I say to you", there is a suggestion that something happened and we are in smaller circumstances.
A.R. Where difficulties appear, the root condition is usually personal feeling.
J.T. Just so. I think the link would be there -- the trespass was not acknowledged. Therefore the solemn word, "Let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer", @Matthew 18:17. That would correspond pretty much with 2 Timothy. That is, the principle of iniquity would be there in the refusal to acknowledge the trespass, so that withdrawal, the principle of withdrawal from the man, or designating him as a heathen man and a publican, is necessary. There is the parting of the ways. Then the next thing is, "Again I say to you". The Lord is making provision for that, that if we have to deal with persons in that way, if the thing goes on we may come to a day of small things and we have to look to two. They are of moral importance in being two of the assembly, answering to the assembly, and then two or three answering to it.
A.R. Do you think that was the root here in this place?
J.T. Well, very largely, I would think. The way love had waned as at Corinth. You know how they treated Paul, several of them, and said his letters were weighty but his bodily presence weak and his speech contemptible, @2 Corinthians 10:10. They discredited him. That would be the sort of thing that had become general, I would think, if we can examine this book, because this book is really prophetic. All that is indicated was not just existent when it was written.
A.A.T. Do you think that His position in the
{88}
midst of the candlesticks is a continuous position? Is that a position He has taken all the time?
J.T. It is in the sense, as has been remarked, of authority. Any personage or king or president or head of anything would have a right at any time to look into and investigate and challenge conditions. His habiliments are judicial. He has a right in these garments to come in at any time and examine conditions and maybe indict anyone in the position.
A.A.T. In @Matthew 18 it would not apply.
J.T. It would apply. That is just what @Matthew 18 does suggest, that there are judicial conditions. There is a regular prosecution that enters into church order, and prosecution in view of discovering or having sin judged and dealt with. That is the point in the passage.
F.H.L. Would "Let him be to thee", @Matthew 18:17, answer to the overcomer? It is an individual appeal.
J.T. Pretty much. As far as you are concerned, you are done with him. The others may not be, but you are taking the lead in being done with him morally and as far as you are concerned the assembly has the final word. That is, hold or maintain the truth of the assembly. What would we do without the court? It is a judicial position.
A.A.T. The court is not the care meeting, is it?
J.T. No, but it is preliminary. It is leading up to it.
E.S. Would you explain the use of the word 'kingdom' in verse 6 in relation to what we were speaking about in connection with the breakdown?
J.T. We were speaking of that in Rochester, as to how the saints are constituted a kingdom. There are several kingdoms spoken of in the Scriptures, but this one seems to be to meet an emergency, just in keeping with what we have said already. @Matthew 18 is an emergency and we are provided with the means to deal with it, and they are conclusive. The thing
{89}
does not go by the board. It reaches the assembly, that is, the court, the head authority representative of heaven. Now @Revelation 1:6 says, "has made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father". That would give the saints authority to act in power. Any kingdom has ramifications, because the idea of a kingdom would be represented in a republic as much as in an empire or an ordinary kingdom. They all have the same features of a kingdom, and if conditions arise that are intolerable, that, we will say, @Matthew 18 does not meet, if the Lord brings out the idea of a kingdom and constitutes the saints in a given place or generally a kingdom, then they can proceed against evil that may exist that may be intolerable. If the Lord Jesus makes us into a kingdom, we can deal with it. There is no reason why we should ever be driven to the wall by wickedness.
J.A.P. With regard to the word 'breakdown', if @Matthew 18 is functioning, is that breakdown? If there is power in the saints to meet evil, is that breakdown?
J.T. It does not seem so. @Matthew 18 is intact at first, but then if we read carefully and keep the Apocalypse and the epistles to Timothy in mind, we can see that there is a second matter. "Again I say to you", the Lord says, "that if two of you shall agree". He has already said, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven". That is a big thing. That is an immense power in the hands of the saints, but then He passes on from that and uses the word 'again' meaning there is a change of events, a change of circumstances; a smaller set of circumstances, and He begins with two, saying, "If two of you shall agree". Two of *you*, notice; that is, two of the assembly. The idea is still intact in their minds. They have access to heaven. They ask the Father who is in heaven. They are united about it. It is given to them, those two. Well, that
{90}
might be enlarged into a kingdom, if you get those two on moral lines. They have agreed about a thing and heaven is listening to them and heaven answers them, so that the thing is given to them. That may be the basis or nucleus of a kingdom provided by the Lord or constituted by the Lord to meet a very wide emergency; because we have had in the history of the testimony certain things beginning small but widening out everywhere and it becomes dangerous, and the Lord usually comes in and constitutes persons with power to deal with it.
J.T.Jr. John speaks in his third epistle about having written something to the assembly. He says, "I wrote something to the assembly; but Diotrephes, who loves to have the first place among them, receives us not. For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with wicked words; and not content with these, neither does he himself receive the brethren; and those who would he prevents, and casts them out of the assembly", @3 John 1:9,10. Would that show what had come in even at the beginning?
J.T. That helps us, I think. The lady, the person in the second epistle, who was a sister, whom he directs that if one comes, not having the doctrine, he is not to be received into the house, nor even be bidden God-speed, @2 John 1:10 -- all that would point to what we are speaking of; how emergencies are met and how the saints are changed by the Lord into a court or kingdom with authority to deal with evil.
R.W.S. So that what precedes the "again", "tell it to the assembly", and the two or three agreeing -- the one is as legal as the other.
J.T. That is good. You are in reduced circumstances but the legality is there; not using the word 'legality' as anything that binds up the brethren but what is owned to be right and of God.
R.W.S. Is that not where we are tested? An
{91}
action in pristine conditions might be bowed to by reason of the very number of those who bow, whereas the "two of you" might be just two weak brothers ostensibly or publicly. Is that not the test, to understand that that is just as legal as what existed at first?
J.T. That is very good. And then the extension is to "two or three", which is wider and may go to any extent.
A.N.W. Would you say a word as to the bearing of the "unto my name". That seems to be the crucial point there.
J.T. Gathering together is also a matter of importance publicly. The 'two' are not said to gather together nor are they said to do anything in the Lord's Name. It is to stress the importance of agreement or unity in two persons who are constitutionally assembly persons. It is to bring out the value of assembly persons, whereas the next verse, verse 20 says, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". That is a public position and the Name has authority vested in it.
A.R. Paul stressed the idea of unity before he stressed the idea of withdrawal in 1 Corinthians.
J.T. Quite so; unity in @1 Corinthians 1 and authority in @1 Corinthians 5.
A.R. We so stress the idea of authority we forget the idea of unity.
J.T. That is the order and I am sure that is important. He says, "ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ", @1 Corinthians 5:4. That is what I was thinking of, the apostolic spirit; and then, the person "being such", @1 Corinthians 5:5. Let us be sure that what is alleged is so, "to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh". You have not only the court but the executioner, you might say, because the
{92}
prisoner is not only condemned but he is put under limitations; delivered to Satan in this case.
A.P.T. Referring again to the "two" in verse 19, would that be, as you were saying, not exactly assembled together, but they have assembly status in that sense? They agree on a matter. Is that the way you look at it? "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens". These two persons are not assembled as we get in verse 20, but they have assembly status as a result of their agreement.
J.T. The point of importance or value attached to them is that it is "two of you". You just wonder why it should say "on the earth", but it is to bring out the position, I suppose, the position of the assembly. I think we can see how much enters into this; how heaven is brought into it, and the Father; and these two are on earth and they are agreed and they ask and it comes to them. I think that is very important, how a thing starts. This thing may be some widespread leaven or heresy, as has taken place frequently in the history of the testimony or assembly -- a widespread thing may begin small. As James says, "See how little a fire, how large a wood it kindles!" @James 3:5. It begins small, but how wide it may extend!
R.W.S. Is this necessarily two in a locality? Two brothers or a brother and a sister.
J.T. It would seem as if it could be either a brother or sister. Take the elect lady whom John mentions, or Gaius. Suppose they were two. Or suppose it were Priscilla and Aquila. You can see, if they were living in Corinth and Paul were attacked or the truth were attacked, how they would agree and speak to God, and it should come to them from heaven. It might begin to spread.
A.A.T. In verses 18 and 19 are we not in the
{93}
midst of a discipline matter? The context before and after indicates that discipline is in view, does it not?
J.T. Yes; it is a question of a brother. "If thy brother sin against thee". It is a trespass matter, and then what you are to do. It has been often gone over, but we are just looking at it now as to how it merges publicly with what we have in Revelation; this matter of the Apocalypse, which is something that does not appear in the Lord's remarks in the gospels nor is it accounted for in the epistles by the apostles. It is something that is contemplated as coming in later, called an Apocalypse, an unveiling, meaning it was not exposed. The thing was not exposed, but now it is exposed and it is to meet conditions that were mysterious in the way of wickedness. "The mystery of iniquity" is spoken of in @2 Thessalonians 2:7 and it is spoken of also here; the mystery of the seven stars, etc. The word 'mystery' comes in several times in the Apocalypse. The word 'Apocalypse' means an unveiling, but it is not contemplated in the early ministry or writings of the New Testament except here. It was written here, of course, in John's time, apostolic times, but it is an unveiling of something that is to develop later fully.
J.A.P. In regard to what you say about mystery, I notice it says in the letter to Ephesus, "thou canst not bear evil men; and thou hast tried them who say that themselves are apostles and are not, and hast found them liars", @Revelation 2:2. You would think they had a good reputation in dealing with things, but is not the mystery of evil you are speaking of suggested in: "thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate"?
J.T. They were faithful to a point, but there is something against them. At the same time Ephesus seems to be generally in a fairly reliable condition. But now, is it the point at which or into which
{94}
@Matthew 18 enters? @Matthew 18 was evidently held as a weapon in the discipline in the assembly, but did it fail to meet conditions in Ephesus which is the first church mentioned? That is, was it enough to expose the fact that love had failed in Ephesus; that it had left its first love; that it happened at the very time in which they were trying those that said they were apostles and were not, and they did not like the Nicolaitanes, but still there is something happening there that the Lord has to resent, and did @Matthew 18 enter at that point? Was it enough to meet that, or was that ever met? Was the want of love in the assembly ever really adjusted? That is a question to be understood.
G.V.D. Does not love underlie gaining a brother? Usually it is a matter of gaining the brother.
J.T. It is. Love was supposed to be there. The man that was trespassed against, if he has it, will succeed, and the procedure indicated would suggest he did succeed. That is, the man's state is recognised by someone. He is guilty of unconfessed trespass, and unfit for the fellowship.
A.R. Paul says in @1 Corinthians 13:8, "Love never fails".
J.T. It is significant that that is brought in at Corinth. They failed at Ephesus. They were able to judge bad doctrine, but they failed in the matter of love.
F.H.L. Is that why you linked it with Philadelphia? They had an open door and a little power.
J.T. Yes; I hope we shall see that there is a point of merging between @Matthew 18 and @Revelation 1, for the Apocalypse contemplates that some hidden thing has happened in the history of the church, and it is a question of whether it was ever adjusted.
A.N.W. Are you carrying the idea of @Matthew 18
{95}
and the trespass both into the meeting for prayer and the administrative meeting in verse 20?
J.T. I would. These are the resources that we have, but how long do they last? How long will they hold against the evil? Why did the Apocalypse have to come in and the peculiar attitude the Lord Himself takes up judicially?
F.S.C. Would you bring in the turning away from Paul in Asia? He says, "all who are in Asia, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes, have turned away from me", @2 Timothy 1:15.
J.T. Quite so. There is an event in the history of the church that had to be dealt with, and many other such things are alluded to in Paul's own word; like Alexander the coppersmith and Demas defection. These are all matters that have to be adjusted, and of conditions in Corinth the apostle says in the letter, 'When your obedience is fulfilled I will have to deal with them', but did he ever deal with them? It is just a question of whether they were ever dealt with. Are we obliged to allow things to lapse as unable to deal with them, or is there a means by which we can deal with them? @Matthew 18 ought to hold, but evidently it had failed and Revelation contemplates that -- that love in the assembly had failed.
A.P.T. In Paul's address to the elders he says, "and from among your own selves shall rise up men speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them", @Acts 20:30. Would there be some lapse locally to allow that?
J.T. There you are. There is another point -- the elders of Ephesus. In fact, when we come to look at it now, we will see how many things there are that were already working even before the Apocalypse was given. Its application is plain. It contemplates the ending of apostolic ministry here below. John, of course, was an apostle, more as mysterious, continuing to the end, according to the end of his gospel, but
{96}
apostolic power had waned when the book of Revelation was inspired.
A.N.W. The Lord Jesus walking in the midst of the assemblies would denote he was not entirely restful but that something needed examination.
J.T. I think that is right. He had to go journeys.
D.Macd. In relation to two of you agreeing on a matter, sometimes a situation may come up in a local assembly and there is a difference of opinion, and it comes up time and time again -- the same issue. Is it then a question of two persons agreeing on the matter?
J.T. It would seem as if something has to be done, not by the whole meeting, but by some two. That supposes loyalty in at least two. There will be something done. It will be successful. It will be done to them, the Lord says, of My Father which is in heaven. If we can get a condition like that, we may be sure we will get results. Even although it is a widespread matter, it will be met.
R.W.S. Is there not a suggestion that it will be added to? It speaks of "two or three" following that.
J.T. Just so.
A.N.W. And then further, the subsequent evidence that the Lord was in it. "There am I" He says, showing that He was in it.
J.T. Quite so. If He has a footing surely something will be done.
J.L.F. In what way does the one that is offending hear the assembly?
J.T. That is another thing. That would be a matter of procedure, too; whether two brothers were sent to him, or whether he were present. We are told in Timothy, "Those that sin convict before all", @1 Timothy 5:20. That would mean he was present. Sometimes the offending brother is not present, and, of course, that is a disadvantage. If he were honest,
{97}
he would be present. If he knows the brethren have a charge against him, he should be present, but if he is not present, the brethren would have to go and see him. I suppose two would have to go and see him.
A.R. If there is withdrawal, there is self-will somewhere. A person being withdrawn from is a result of an act of self-will on the part of that person.
J.T. What is your point?
A.R. It shows there is a bad state in the person.
J.T. Well, we will suppose that this person who is contemplated here has trespassed against his brother, and the brother addresses him and he fails to listen, and then he brings two others and he fails to listen to them, then the next thing is, Will he hear the assembly? Tell it to the assembly, and if he will not hear the assembly, "let him be to thee"; that would mean, if he will not hear the assembly, he is a self-willed person, and it is not simply now that he has trespassed against a brother, but he has trespassed against the assembly. He is showing disrespect for divine authority, because divine authority is vested in the assembly. I suppose that is what makes the sin so serious.
A.A.T. Is he wicked?
J.T. That is the inference. We do not get what the assembly does. We have to go to Corinthians for that. @Matthew 18 does not go that far, but it shows how the brother who is trespassed against can bring in conviction of the brother who trespasses and establishes the idea of the assembly. It is to regulate how the brother acts who is trespassed against and what he is to do. What he does is to regard the man as a heathen and a publican. The assembly's action is not stated.
A.N.W. Would it not be in verse 18? I wondered if that might not give us the authoritative action of the assembly, and then the Lord turns to the plural
{98}
again: "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven".
J.T. That is authority that they can take on, but it does not say they took it on. The Lord does not go that far. He indicates how the matter can be settled. What is left unsaid is for faith to proceed in. It is right to act on.
A.R. Why should two brothers or two sisters be divided? God has linked us together. It is because there is some issue.
J.T. Is not the issue here a trespass? The man does not listen to his brother.
A.R. Cain and Abel were divided over the idea of a gift.
J.T. Quite so. It is the want of love and subjection.
R.W.S. It must require skill to reprove. It says in verse 15, "go, reprove him". The note says, 'to show the true character of anything, so as to convict, and hence reprove by showing a man's fault'. It must require skill to know how far grace should operate, and how far love should go in this matter of reproving. Is that why it is "two of you"?
J.T. I suppose love is really the basic power of dealing with the matter. It never fails, but the Lord seems to have in mind that we should be thoroughly versed in the procedure with one another, to adjust matters of this kind in the assembly, and He shows that the procedure laid down by Him is successful. The man is isolated as far as the one whom he has trespassed against is concerned. He is isolated. Well, I think all that put with the other facts that we have implies that we have light. Intelligence enables us to proceed with this light to a full result. So that "If two of you" comes in, and then, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven". That is there, and it seems to be in a way constitutional; what belongs to the conditions as
{99}
governing this matter, and the brethren can take it up.
W.C.R. The little strength in Philadelphia corresponds with the two or three?
J.T. I think we might link that on there. What is clear now is that there is enough in what the Lord says to furnish light for us as to any matter that has to be reached governmentally. The Lord gives us intelligence to take things up. The Lord is dealing with persons who are of the assembly: "two of you" and they have enough light to proceed and to reach a conclusion.
J.T.Jr. Would you say in principle that the Lord acted on this when He spoke to Peter in the previous chapter? It says He anticipated him. He did not let the matter drop without being spoken about. I mean in chapter 17. It says, "And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying" @Matthew 17:25. Did you have that in mind, that the thing is taken right up? The whole matter was settled quickly. The piece of money that was found in the fish's mouth settled the matter. The matter of paying the tax was settled.
J.T. If you carry that through into chapter 18 -- we are dealing with two persons who are at odds -- one of them is right morally and the other is not. The question is whether the evidence we have in the paragraph we read in chapter 18 is enough to reach a conclusion. You might say, Well, there is nothing said as to what is to be done with this man. One brother has to regard him as a heathen man and a publican, and others are not doing it. They might say, we do not see that we should do that. Is there not enough light in the instruction the Lord gives to settle the matter? I believe the Lord would convey to us that we are assembly persons and have light, and that He gives us enough for us to go on and reach a conclusion.
R.W.S. Reaching a conclusion individually.
{100}
J.T. I think the whole assembly could reach a conclusion on the facts given. That is, this brother is a righteous man. He has shown himself to be righteous. He has gone the whole way with the other man, and he, in his own mind, is settled as to him and regards him as a heathen man and a publican. Can the matter hang in the air like that? No. The Lord has given enough for the assembly person, or the assembly itself to act. The assembly is composed of intelligent persons. If we have a case brought in such as the Lord indicates here, there ought to be enough intelligence in the assembly to settle the matter, so that we do not need to let things drag. If he is a heathen and a publican, if the Lord says that man is not fit to be your companion or to have any fellowship with you, then he is not fit for the assembly.
A.A.T. A heathen and a publican is out of fellowship.
J.T. Can we not furnish all that is necessary? The law of the house is not like the law of Moses. It contemplates that the assembly, which has to do with the matter, is formed of intelligent persons.
A.N.W. If there is nothing personal nor any prejudice, there would be a unified action in regard to it.
J.T. Can a man stand by himself? If he has judged that the man is to be treated as a heathen man and a publican, are the other brethren to stand by and say nothing? The Lord does not mean that at all. The word 'you' there is a guide. The assembly is formed by persons who are intelligent, and made intelligent by the Spirit, so that they will know what to do. The Lord has given us enough information so that we can act. What can we do in every care meeting, but see that that brother is righteous? His attitude is right and we must all support him. It is intelligent persons that have to do with him.
{101}
J.H. Was it not a serious matter in @Acts 15 when Paul and Silas separated from Barnabas and Mark. The brethren sent forth Paul and Silas. Is that akin to an assembly action?
J.T. It shows that the brethren generally were with Paul. That is as clear as anything. Of course, the authoritative thing there was the letter written by the assembly, by the elders and by the Spirit. The Spirit confirmed it. It was sent abroad among the Gentiles. That was the conclusive, authoritative thing. What happened between Paul and Barnabas was a matter of heat. There was contention between them and it was so strong that they separated one from another, but there was no assembly action called for in that. Paul was justified in the mind of the brethren generally.
J.H. I meant as regards Mark. He was justified in his action that Mark should not go with him.
J.T. It was not an assembly matter. It was a levitical matter between the two. We would all say Paul was right, but we could not say more than that, because Barnabas was not out of fellowship, nor Mark either. This matter involves a person unfit for fellowship, and if one brother says it is so, are the others to say nothing? The Lord says, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven". Bind that man that is unfit for fellowship.
A.A.T. Then we turn to 2 Timothy to act?
J.T. We do not need to turn anywhere. This is spiritually anterior to 2 Timothy. This is a condition that might arise at any time after the assembly was inaugurated. Things were still intact, but when the Lord says, "Again I say unto you", He means there will be a change from that, and I think the book of Revelation contemplates that and 2 Timothy also.
R.W.S. Does the practical working out of this expose the Corinthian state that exists? We read about Philadelphia, but concretely it is humbling --
{102}
the lack of uniformity of judgment and action towards those withdrawn from.
J.T. Clearly, but the position at Corinth was not really settled. There were many others, and that is just what ought to come up now; how much there is allowed to pass because general conditions among the brethren do not afford power to exercise discipline where it should be exercised. He says, "having in readiness to avenge all disobedience", @2 Corinthians 10:6. And he tells us in the second letter of those who were still reprobate, and he says, I am waiting for you brethren to judge yourselves in every detail. I must wait for your obedience so that I can proceed against the others. We cannot say that they ever were proceeded against.
A.P.T. Does he not seem to have a little hesitancy in the end of the second epistle as to coming again, that the difficulty would still be there? Does he seem to suggest that?
J.T. I would say so. He had in mind to come, but then did he come? Did he deal with all these persons? I think we are reminded that if they are not dealt with, at any rate they should be spoken of. It should be understood that they exist and the book of Revelation contemplates that there are things existent that have not been dealt with.
J.A.P. Do you think the case of Absalom in David's kingdom was always a source of weakness?
J.T. It was. The book of Revelation contemplates there are many such matters. Every assembly had something that had not been dealt with.
A.N.W. "How say some among you that there is not a resurrection?" @1 Corinthians 15:12.
J.T. Just so. Was it ever dealt with?
A.R. Joab was a politician.
J.T. His was a case that was never settled until Solomon came to the throne, and so it is in all these letters to the assemblies, the Lord has almost in every
{103}
one something that He has against them, meaning it has been there and has not been dealt with. So that He says, "But I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel", @Revelation 2:20. How long had she been there? Are there any such conditions around in the gatherings today? Are there conditions that there is not enough power to enable us to deal with them?
W.C.R. If that is the case it would be equivalent to saying there was really no assembly status in the place.
J.T. You might modify that a little, because the conditions at Corinth would not allow the apostle to deal with serious evil there. Are there such conditions now? We have to look into it. I think two of you agreeing is a great point. If you get one or two who are right with God, God will act with them and for them.
A.N.W. You have these assemblies, but the word is addressed to the angel of that assembly, and that element coming to light would take the word on.
J.T. The word 'angel' is really the link with God, like the spirit in a man. A man's spirit is like the lamp of the Lord in the man's self, and so it is the angel in the assembly is like the spirit that God can act with and use against the whole assembly to set it right.
R.W.S. "Having in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled". "Your obedience", is general, is it not, more than the two or three in Corinth?
J.T. The whole company had to be righted in the matter before the apostle could proceed. There was a strong party of them and it might mean a split in the meeting if Paul were to proceed against them.
R.W.S. Did it begin with two?
J.T. Very likely. The house of Chloe. What about her? She was one like that; and the house of
{104}
Stephanas. These were things that Paul could use there to bring about better conditions, and so he sent Timothy there.
F.H.L. Was he afraid of conditions developing in Philippi when he addressed Euodia and Syntyche?
J.T. They were not right; although it was a very wholesome assembly, yet they were to be of one mind in the Lord. All these matters ought to be settled, and there ought not be anyone acting lawlessly amongst us, doing as they wish. The secret is that the general condition of the assembly in such a case is not right.
A.P.T. Persons who only come to the breaking of bread are really not in agreement locally, are they?
J.T. You just wonder about a person like that. The allusion in chapter 11 of 1 Corinthians helps. "For this cause", @1 Corinthians 11:30. Well, these are the causes. The cause, of course, immediately was the conduct in the meeting when they did come to the Lord's supper.
W.W.M. Where there has been withdrawal, or we might say, binding, there is a unity there with others, but it is just as important when there is a loosing that no feeling is carried.
J.T. That is the thing; to get to the end of matters. The end of a matter is better than the beginning, especially in the evil; getting it finished.
W.W.M. In regard to your reference to feelings, Mark's name has been mentioned. While that was not an assembly matter exactly, as you say, but it was between Levites, yet you can understand when Paul says to bring Mark for he is serviceable to me for ministry, it would suggest that the man has thoroughly judged his course and now he should be received by all.
J.T. There should be no question about him at all. Very often when a man has really judged himself and the brethren want him to be with them, some are not free about it, and that is where the difficulty
{105}
arises, but in Mark's case the matter is clear. It is a finished matter.
W.C.R. The eleven stood up with Peter.
J.T. Yes; indeed. They had no difficulties about him now. The end of a matter is better than the beginning, especially if it is a recovery, where there is restoration.
A.P.T. Would it be right to suggest if love is not acting the action is negligible? It is really love in all assembly discipline; the love of God as seen in the cross and the judgment of Calvary.
J.T. It is the one thing that is missing really at Corinth; the one thing that could not be illustrated. It is like a picture. @1 Corinthians 13 stands by itself. It is a description of love; not a model of love, but a description of it. It is one thing to get a description of a person, and it is another thing to get a picture of him, and the final thing to see the person himself. So that Paul gave us the description of love in chapter 13 and other such evidences of what was in his mind, but he sent Timothy so that he might live among them day and night, as it were, that they might learn in him Paul's ways as they were in Christ. As it were, he was Paul himself. That was better than a description in writing.
A.A.T. That is why Timothy is called his son.
J.T. The description in writing is, of course, vague, but the person is an embodiment. We had the idea of impersonation, persons being impersonated in other persons. Elijah, when the Lord was here, was impersonated in John the baptist, but he was himself on the mount. The actual Elijah was there. "Two men ... who were Moses and Elias". They were not impersonated. They were the veritable Moses and the veritable Elijah, but John the baptist was representing Elijah. The Lord says, "If ye will receive it, this is Elias, who is to come", @Matthew 11:14. But there is another Elijah to come yet, but no
{106}
doubt it will be some other impersonator; a man right here on earth, whereas Elijah has departed to be in heaven. Well now, I mention all that because it is a principle in the letter to Corinth -- the impersonation of Paul. "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord", @1 Corinthians 4:17, as if it were a complete representation of the apostle. And why? "Who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ". That is important, too, to keep in our minds, because John the baptist represents it, and it will come in presently in relation to the Jews. Elijah is to come. Are there not impersonations in some little degree among the brethren that remind us of what is real; whether it be in the Lord Himself, or in the apostles, or later ministry because it is better to have the person than to hear about him?
A.P.T. Paul says later he had no one like-minded. Whom does he refer to there?
J.T. Himself, I would think. "For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on", @Philippians 2:20. That is, how he would himself care for the saints, and Timothy would have the same way with him.
A.R. He says, "Yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence", @1 Corinthians 12:31.
J.T. That is descriptive. He was not saying that it was a model of love among the Corinthians, nor that he himself was a model of love. It was just a writing; the showing was just in writing, not an impersonation. It is a beautiful description, but it is only a description. There is no person there. They are all abstract statements.
W.C.R. What is the thought of the Lord writing the name: "I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from
{107}
my God, and my new name", @Revelation 3:12? What is the thought in the name?
J.T. That is representation, I think, too. You would be reminded of His God and of New Jerusalem. The person who is an overcomer in Philadelphia would remind you of the things mentioned, which is near to what we are saying. It is very near to the idea of impersonation. The Lord Jesus is a perfect impersonation of the Father. John the baptist, in ministry, was the impersonation of Elijah.
R.W.S. Despite the two or three, if our eyes are open do you think we will discover all these features working out practically in the idea of impersonation in the fellowship?
J.T. I think so. I think there are reproductions in the family of God. We are sure to get near likenesses. In all families you get near likenesses, and no doubt there are now near likenesses of past ministry.
{108}
THE THIRD APPEARING OF JESUS IN RESURRECTION
@John 21:4 - 17
This chapter, as most of us will know, is an appendix or a postscript. It is written after. The gospel is complete at the end of chapter 20. This, therefore, is, as I said, an afterthought, but a full thought. It is a dispensational chapter indeed, as if the Spirit through the apostle were to compare the dispensational idea, saying, "This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples, being risen from among the dead", @John 21:14. So that the showing to the disciples is found in this afterthought or postscript. The other two occasions are in the body of the book; they are found in chapter 20. This third occasion is found in the appendix, as if it must be there. It must not be overlooked in this great composition known as the fourth gospel.
A dispensational idea comes in, for the third time alludes to the millennium, or what immediately precedes it; what is intended to make it up, that is to say, not only the Jews but the nations. The Jews will lead, have the first place, but the nations come in, too, for indeed, primarily the Jewish nation was intended to be in the very centre of the earth, of the circle of the nations. They are essential, therefore, to the divine scheme on the earth, and these one hundred and fifty-three great fishes are symbolical of the nations. They are viewed as great at the end. The Israelites, that is, the Jews as we speak of them now, come into chapter 20. That is, they are seen where Thomas appears, having been absent at the first great meeting of the disciples with the Lord after He rose. The first meeting is on the first day of the week. It has a great place in that chapter, and it is signalised
{109}
by being the day of the first great gathering of the disciples with the Lord after He rose from the dead. What a day that was! The day of chapter 20. The first day is inaugurated by the glory of the Father. The first day of the week is signalised as representing the gathering of the assembly -- the greatest thought in the universe outside of divine Persons. The Lord Jesus came where the disciples were. They were first in His heart as He arose. He came where they were. That was the first appearing. The second was when Thomas was present eight days afterwards. What occupied the Lord during those eight days we have to leave, but He was occupied well. Luke would say, Those eight days have to be deducted from the forty. There were thirty-two days more, but those eight were between the first gathering in the upper room and the second when Thomas was present. Luke would say that the Lord was engaged with His own even in those eight days during what we call the week-days, the week-nights. We have enjoyment from the incomings of the Lord on those days on the same principle as we have it on the first day of the week. The first day is supremely the day in which the Lord is known in the midst of His own; but Luke would say and does say, that during all those forty days He appeared to His apostles. Here we are told that this is the third time in which the Lord showed Himself to His disciples; the third time. Now, there are many other times; there are several mentioned in @1 Corinthians 15 and we know that there are some mentioned in Luke and some mentioned in the early days of the Acts, but these three are particularly in mind at this time in this postscript, as I said; this afterthought of John, yet a full thought, a precious thought, a spiritual thought, a Spirit-inspired thought. It is the third. Therefore, it is bound up with chapter 20 in this sense. It is the third of three occasions in which the Lord showed Himself
{110}
to His disciples characteristically. He showed Himself to Mary, by herself, but that is not included here. He showed Himself to the two on the way to Emmaus, but that is not included here. The Spirit has in mind it is a characteristic showing to the disciples. There were a good few of them. They were not all there. There are a good few of us here now, so that this has a characteristic bearing to the time of the appearing to the disciples. You can well understand, dear brethren, that these meetings are much more important than any experiences we may have ordinarily in an individual sense. The appearings to individuals are not mentioned in these three. These are three singled out as characteristic appearings to the apostles or the disciples. The word 'disciple' here is more than simply that they were believers. It is really tantamount to the fact that they were apostles. Peter was there and Matthew was there and John was there. It is a characteristic time, and so was the season in the eighth day of chapter 20, and the first day of chapter 20; and so an occasion like this is a dignified occasion and those who miss it miss dignity. They miss something that they will never get afterwards. I mean to say, there will be others afterward, but not just the same. There is always something distinctive. In each of these appearings, there was something distinctive. The first was the greatest, and there will be a last one of these meetings on earth, and I should not like to miss it if I have not gone to the Lord before. I certainly should not like to miss the last occasion such as this. Many will, I am afraid, and we should be warned not to miss.
Well, now, I wanted, in making these remarks, to show how the occasion here, this third appearing, has peculiar dignity attached to it. The phrases and the words and thoughts all bear this thought, this suggestion: that it is a time of dignity. It is very like other times. It is a fishing affair, a fish matter in the
{111}
sea of Galilee. It was not a large sea, but it was large enough for the Lord to bring out great thoughts from the standpoint of the sea. It is nothing, you might say, as compared with the Atlantic or the Pacific or the Arctic or Antarctic. It was a few miles long and a few miles wide -- a small lake, but it was enough to be called a sea and enough to bring out thoughts of the sea, and miracles belonging to the sea -- one hundred and fifty-three great fishes -- great fishes in a small lake, for it really was a small lake. What size these fishes were we are not told, but they are called great, and the word 'great' is intended to convey to us that they were great. Whether they were really ordinary in the lake, who can say? We read of one that had a piece of money in its mouth. The Lord knew that one and he knew the piece of money was there. We read, too, of a fish that had Jonah in it. It was not an ordinary fish of the Mediterranean. It was prepared of God for that purpose. We must not forget that God can do things for a purpose, for an occasion, for an emergency, and that fish was for an emergency that swallowed Jonah. God prepared him. You could not find him in the aquarium anywhere, nor his bones. It was provided for the occasion. So that fish that the Lord told Peter to find, with the piece of money in its mouth enough for the tax, was undoubtedly a fish of that kind: a fish made for the purpose. And may I not add those one hundred and fifty-three great fishes? One would like to have seen them! How long were they? And yet they would not be much in seeing them. They were just fishes, but they were great; quite a good many, one hundred and fifty-three. Why did they stop to count them? Well, I have alluded to the idea of dignity, and surely the word or phrase "great fishes" belongs to the great phrases or terms in this chapter. It is a chapter of dignity.
Well, the first thing that might be thought negative
{112}
to what I am saying is that it was a fishing scene and those who were engaged in it had been engaged in fishing before. It was their trade, and the Lord found them in that trade. He found two sets of them in that trade. That was the beginning. Now the question arises spiritually, Is there any change in these men? Of course, Nathanael was not in the first fishing scene. He is seen in @John 1, but is there not a change in these men? They are turned aside to fish when they should have been fishing for men, but nevertheless they had not lost their discipleship, nor had they lost their apostleship. The Lord is not quick to discard us, you know. He is very patient with us. He holds on to us. There is no idea that these men lost their apostleship in the fact that they went off fishing. There is no thought that Peter lost his apostleship because he denied the Lord. There is not a word about that. The Lord never brings it up. I am speaking thus that we might come to regard the Lord even in the service. He does not discard us quickly. He values us and He never forgets our best moments, what we used to be; in our darkest moments the Lord never forgets the brightest moment. Did He forget the brightest moments of these seven in this expedition? No. He is not saying to them, You are all wrong. No, He said, Children. "Children, have ye anything to eat?" @John 21:5. You will not assume for a moment, I am sure, that I am in any way minimising the fact that they turned aside to fish when they should be waiting for the Lord to appoint them their work after He arose. The Lord knew well how to deal with that. In fact, there is something here to show that He was dealing with it. The fact that He raised the question of whether they had any meat, knowing well they had not, was just to remind them they had been working for nothing. They had got nothing for their night's work. If we are not catching anything, then there is something
{113}
wrong with us. It is a fine thing, when a person is a little away, however little, to call a halt and challenge himself or herself why it is I have no results. When I speak of results, I do not mean simply persons who are converted through me or make confessions through me. No, not that at all. That is only one result. There are many others that are open to the Levites, but in this case there was none. They said, No. They had to say it. The Lord meant them to say it. The Lord did not say it Himself, He could have. It was evident. He could have looked at their boat and seen it was empty. Fishermen always look at the depth of the boat; the draft of the boat will indicate. If they go shell fishing that is the way they determine at a distance whether the expedition is a success, the draft of the boats. These shell fishing boats draft heavily.
Now, the Lord knew that, but He asked them to tell whether they caught anything, and they said, No. We have no meat. But the Lord said, "Children". Very beautiful, I think. The link of affection is established at once. John says, "It is the Lord", @John 21:7. Well, now I wanted to bring out this dignity in these one hundred and fifty-three fishes and how they point to the dignity of the nations as they come into God's possession in the future. There is no moral dignity attached to the nations now. Not that I want to say a word against the authorities, but there is none. There is none where there is not a full recognition of Christ. But then when the Lord gathers the nations they are worth gathering. He is going to have them. "And the nations shall walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory to it", @Revelation 21:24. That is a clear indication of what they are. How rich, how wealthy, how valuable, how worth having. That is really, dispensationally, what is meant. You can see the importance of this afterthought, that surely the Lord would not want to
{114}
leave the nations out. His earthly people, that is, the Jews, are involved in Thomas in the second meeting in chapter 20, and the assembly is in the first meeting, and it would look as if the Lord were to say. Well, I must not leave the nations out. I must bring them in. And hence the postscript, as I said.
So we have one hundred and fifty-three great fishes. They are counted. They are worth having. The Lord said, "Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken". They are recognised; they are owned as having taken them although the Lord had directed how it should happen. "Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find", @John 21:6. As I was saying a moment ago, was it not a miracle? Were they just fish that were usually caught there? Who can say? Why not say they were prepared for the purpose? So the nations will be prepared for the purpose. They are not in evidence now. The nations are now represented in ourselves. God is gathering out of the nations His people and is placing them in the assembly, so that we have to understand what these fishes really are. They are great. The nations as they are today are wanting. God is owning them and they are here today, but they are not the ones that are pictured in that one hundred and fifty-three great fishes. These are the product of the labourers, of the Israelites, the twelve, whoever they may be; the working people of that day. They will be honoured in the nations being gathered together for their service. "And the nations shall walk by its light", @Revelation 21:24. It is a very beautiful phrase. They walk in the light of the heavenly city. That is to say, they walk in the light of the assembly in heavenly glory, and also, they bring their glory to it, showing how entirely they are secured for heaven.
So, as I said, these one hundred and fifty-three fishes, great fishes, point to dignity in this part of the gospel. They point to a dispensational result in
{115}
the future, but then, as the Spirit of God says, "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching", @2 Timothy 3:16, and this is profitable now for more than I have said. It is profitable for ourselves, that in these last days I believe God is aiming at dignity among the brethren. Of course, we have to own that there are very few persons of value coming in among us. We may as well accept that. There are some. Thank God there are some among us who have not come in in that sense. They are born and brought up among us and, of course, they are the best -- I would say, the best soil. And yet, surely, there is something for us as to persons of value in the service and ornamentation in the assembly in coming in through the gospel. There are many of them abroad, and the Spirit of God shows that in the early days there were distinguished men. Some distinguished in this world like Theophilus and Paul, or Saul, and many others; but there are others distinguished, as converted, through spirituality and that is the great point. There is no value really in what a person may have been before. It is what he is after his conversion or through his conversion. The great fishes must represent those that are the fruit of the work of God, and we must admit, dear brethren, that we have very few. But we thank God for what we have, at least, I hope we do. I do; for the number here today, the dignity, the spiritual dignity manifest in a number of persons such as are sitting here listening to the word of God, valuing it; valuing the fellowship we are in today. Surely it is a great matter, but it could be greater and it may be greater. It can be greater. God can make it greater. And so I go on to the sheep. The great fishes are one idea. They represent quality and value, value in the eyes of heaven. And the apostles are seen as capable of catching them, although the Lord really did all the work, you might say. He told them where to cast
{116}
the net, but they drew the fishes in and the Lord says, "Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken". That is a beautiful thought. If the brethren have any dignity through conversion, coming into the assembly, bring them. Let them be seen. The Lord is waiting to see them. Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken. They are already great. Conversion will make a man great right away, if it is a real conversion. Alas, most of them are not too good! But a real conversion like the conversion of Paul and many others that are mentioned, constitutes the converts great, so that they are able to work at once. Paul was able to go to work almost immediately. The subject of his first preaching was that Jesus is the Son of God. That was the great point, too, for the moment to the Jews, that He is the Son of God. And so, as I said, one is exercised about getting some like that; great by their conversions, an evidence of the power of God -- their conversion and then their subsequent formation so that there is ornamentation and usefulness. There is the word 'great' which is applicable. They are really great. It is only the work of God that can really make a man great. Why not have an eye for it, dear brethren? Aim at something. Fishermen aim at something. All workers of that kind aim at something. What we aim at we may count on God to give us. Not that the apostles were aiming at anything. They did not really know much what they were doing. The Lord did everything. But He says, "Bring of the fishes which *ye* have now taken". And they brought them, and we are told then that they were great and that they were counted.
Well, that is one thing, and the first thing I mention is that these men were fishers before. They had gone through this experience before, and now they are greater men than they were then; although some of them failed and were now failing in some degree, yet they had not lost their apostleship. They had not
{117}
lost their greatness. They were all men of God abstractly. They were levites, workers, and part of the assembly. They had not lost their greatness and the Lord knew they had not lost their greatness, and as far as He was concerned they were not going to lose their greatness, and He at once emphasised their greatness. "Children", He says. And, "the fish which *ye* have now taken". So that this is the third time. We are not left in this dispensation without this picture of what will mark the coming glories of Christ when He appears in the gathering in of the nations. It is exhilarating to think of the nations, what they will be as depicted in these one hundred and fifty-three great fishes.
And, now, the Lord says, "Come and dine", @John 21:12. It is a dining time. It is not simply, Come and eat; you are hungry. That is not the point. The point is it is a dignified time. The Lord would never fail to add dignity to our position. He does not care for us making too much of the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He looks for the idea of the feeders, but it must be a spiritual thought, and so the dining. "Come and dine". There is no word of reproaching Peter until he dined. His dignity stays. The dining is only to re-establish it in his soul; what he is to Christ. He is the real Peter that Christ had in His mind. He had named him; he has not lost his caste. The Lord would emphasise that he is the same Peter, and dining surely is to add to that. He is more dignified now than he was in the morning when he came in without any garment on. When he heard it was the Lord Jesus he said, I have nothing to put on. That is really what he meant. I have nothing to put on. Well, he had something in a coat and he put it on. The idea is, if we are to dine we must be dignified. The dress-suit, so to speak. Pardon the allusion. That does not carry much with it, but it is right. It is the idea of something. Peter had to put on the
{118}
best he had. It was not much but he had the sense that he must appear in clothing. We must not be found naked and we must not be found without a wedding garment. Paul says, "that we shall not be found naked", @2 Corinthians 5:3, but it is also serious to be without a wedding garment. You might be clothed without a wedding garment, but in the full dress affair we must have on our wedding garment. A Man comes in and He is the Inspector. He knows what is suitable in the presence of royalty, so that he says, "Bind him feet and hands, and take him away, and cast him out into the outer darkness", @Matthew 22:13. Most solemn. That is persons who pretend to be Christians and are not. So that, here we have the idea of dining. If Peter had anything better than the overcoat he would have put it on. If he had had an opportunity to go into a dressing booth he would go in and dress before he sat down before the Lord. Let us not forget that. It is a dress time, but then it is a dining time. That is the point. "Fish laid on it, and bread". That was all that was necessary. The word 'dine' is a full meal. It was not what we call dinner, but it was breakfast really; it was early morning. But it was a full meal. The Lord had it and they dined.
And then the question of heart comes up, which I am not going to enlarge on. It has often been spoken of, but the Lord raised the question after they had dined. In verse 15 it says, "When therefore they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?" All that is just to challenge this boasting of Peter in a very mild way. I might go on and speak quite a little on that point, but it is well known, only it is noticeable that the dining comes first. It is after they had dined. It is no question of the clothes now. It is a question of love, whether you love more than others. And, dear brethren, this is a challenging thing, because there is always this tendency to rivalry
{119}
in one way or another. Peter said, "If all shall be offended in thee, *I* will never be offended", @Matthew 26:33. He would profess that he loved the Lord more than others. Perhaps he did, but anyway, the Lord would bring it out, and the Lord brought out from him finally that Peter had to say, Lord, I do not count on You just believing that I love You because You are a divine Person. You are God and You know what is in my heart. He really meant to say, Lord, there is evidence in me that I love You. That is very challenging. Is there any evidence in me that I love the Lord Jesus? He says, "Lord, *thou* knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee". That is, You know by what You see. Not simply by divine power, but by what You might use in the sense of evidence. So that Peter says, Lord, You know that there is evidence in me that I love You. That is really what he means in the last word as to this matter of love. And the Lord is satisfied about that. If you can say of the Lord that He knows that you love Him, the Lord would say, I am satisfied; I am not going behind that. I am not going round the corner to see what you have been doing. I am satisfied by what you are and what you do, by the tone of your voice and the way you speak. I am satisfied that you love Me. I am not going to go behind that. I am satisfied with that, and that settles the matter. The Lord settles the matter Himself by accepting Peter's remark. He could see that Peter loved Him. That settled the matter. That brings up the matter of sheep as over against fish. There is no question of dignity when we come to the sheep. They are the same persons, of course, but they are sheep and they are lambs. The point in sheep is largely that they are defenceless persons. Figuratively, they represent the saints as defenceless. "He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and was as a sheep dumb before her shearers, and he opened not his mouth", @Isaiah 53:7.
{120}
That is the idea, and that is what the Lord was. He brings in now the lambs and the sheep in addressing Peter as to his love. It is no question of love as to the fish; not that they did not represent the same idea, but it is a question of love, because the sheep represent the Lord in a most peculiar way. They have the same characteristics as the Lord Himself. They are like Himself. "They shall hear my voice", @John 10:16. They would not hear the voice of strangers. They will not follow a stranger. That is what the Lord brings out. And so, when He is finishing dining and this matter of the love of Peter comes up, then He says, What is in My heart are these sheep. David says, "But these sheep, what have they done?" @2 Samuel 24:17. And the Lord is saying in His heart in talking to Peter, "These sheep". How many He had who can tell? He says, "They shall never perish". I have laid down My life for them. They are the supreme object of My care now. Not the nations, but these. Now Peter, feed My lambs. Then He says, shepherd, merely. "Shepherd my sheep", @John 21:17. He would say in effect, you know you have strayed yourself, Peter, and you are a real sheep. You strayed, so that there is no guarantee that others may not stray. Who is there here who would not admit the liability of straying, especially young people? How ready to take advantage of an opportunity to do what you should not do. That is straying, turning aside. The word is, "Shepherd my sheep". You cannot apply the word 'shepherd' to fish. It is a remarkable thing that they are not provided for in the deluge. That is another matter, but there it is no idea of feeding them or caring for them. They are caught. But it is the idea of caring for the sheep. "Shepherd my sheep". And Peter is entrusted with that; possibly the Jewish sheep. That was possibly the immediate application of the word, for he was the apostle of the circumcision, but
{121}
nevertheless, they were sheep. And then finally, "Feed my sheep". Feed them. You say, Where shall I get the food? Well, that is for Peter to determine. He had been with the Lord for a long time and he knew what the Lord did and he ought to know, and the Lord implies that. You know. You know what you needed and what I supplied to you. Now you do the same. First, "Shepherd my sheep", and then "Feed my sheep".
That brings out, dear brethren, the generality of the saints; not simply the distinguished ones I have been speaking of. That is an important matter, the distinguished ones. I have been thinking of the elders. We are to call the elders when we are sick. Call the elders. They are the distinguished ones; not the ordinary ones. Therefore, what is in mind here is the generality of the saints; old and young, rich and poor, lame and halt, sick and well. That is the idea. Every one of them is to be the subject of love and care that flows out of love and that flows out of experience with the Lord Jesus as to what He does; how He has dealt with ones; how He would have many to deal with the brethren viewed in their generality as sheep and as lambs, the diminutive thought, little sheep. The Lord does not say to Peter, Shepherd them. It is for their parents to look after them, for that is the office really, not that the Lord did not, for He took little children in His arms, but here He omits care of the lambs. He has in mind that parents should have some care for them. Never let them out of your sight, if you can. Be an example to them. But then, the Lord does not tell Peter to shepherd the lambs; He says, "Shepherd my sheep". The grown-ups need shepherding. He finishes with the word, "Feed my sheep". And Peter takes it on. He is given that charge. He had a charge from the Lord. He had the keys. The Lord gave him the keys, a great matter. It is another
{122}
matter altogether. He gave Peter the keys of the kingdom; not of the house, but the kingdom. Peter had those keys, a very great charge; and now, alongside of that charge, he has the feeding of the lambs and the care of the sheep and the feeding of the sheep. It is the generality of the saints, and so it is that the Lord is helping us in these general meetings and in all our meetings. They are a provision that He has made Himself in His wisdom, and the brethren are taking advantage of them under the merciful sovereign care of God. The brethren seem to have awaked to the value of these meetings, and they are being held twice as often as they used to be. The brethren seem to like to come. They are occasions of dignity and good and care. So, I commend all this, dear brethren, to the saints for consideration, so that we may proceed on these lines in these meetings.
{123}
WASHING
@Titus 3:4 - 6; @Revelation 22:14,15
J.T. What is in mind is to consider a little the scriptural suggestion of washing. These two scriptures were read, but only as basic. There are really others that will come under review. This time of the year tends greatly to affect the brethren, especially the young ones, because of conditions at resorts for bathing and the like. They tend to pollute and the brethren become weaker spiritually and need the application of washing in view of the service of God the first scripture read deals with the subject. It says, "But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit", @Titus 3:4,5. There are three things mentioned or used in the gospel, used by God and announced in the gospel here: washing, applied in relation to regeneration; and then the renewal of the Holy Spirit, so that the subject of the gospel enters into what is before us; and then in Revelation the application as to not one washing, not one primary washing, but continuous washing in view of defilement contracted.
A.R. There is a footnote to the word 'washing'. It says, "a new state of things or a change of position". Will you explain that a little bit for us?
J.T. The washing of regeneration is given in the note: Washing is right here. It is a bath, or the water for it. 'Regeneration' is not the same word as 'being born again', nor is it used so in Scripture. The force of the word is a change of position; a new state of things. The word is only used here and in @Matthew 19:28
{124}
for the Saviour's coming kingdom. The word 'washing' has to be regarded by itself. It is said to be a bath as we see in the note, and then the word 'regeneration' is a different idea altogether. The word 'washing' which is introduced first in the note, has to be regarded by itself, only allied with regeneration, and then the great thought of the renewal of the Spirit; so that there are three thoughts. The first one is washing. It is not in the daily or constant sense as in Revelation, but a complete thing, such as is involved in new birth. New birth was first introduced as born again, born throughout, without which we cannot see the kingdom of God; but then the Lord gives an additional thought, namely that unless one is born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. These expressions in @John 3 are allied closely to what we have here, only the washing in @Revelation 22 is more what the believer sees the need of and applies daily and constantly. He washes, in other words.
A.A.T. The Ethiopian eunuch went into the water, but that was the water of baptism. That was not washing, was it?
J.T. Baptism is washing. It is the principle of it, and is applied to the deluge. Baptism is likened to the deluge, meaning that the earth was cleansed by the process and at the same time the believer goes through water.
A.N.W. Would your second scripture have an external bearing, an outward bearing, and the one we are looking at in Titus more inward?
J.T. I would say that; yes. It is an accompanying thing to Revelation. It is not the application of a bath for washing or cleansing but evidently for water; that is, to cleanse the inner state of a man as regeneration takes place.
W.W.M. Do you think that the application of the death of Christ in the water aspect is suggested
{125}
here? Does Naaman suggest anything in this? He was told to go down seven times in the Jordan. It was a water matter there.
J.T. Well, it was; yes. In the antitype, however, I would think it includes redemption. The idea of washing is applied sometimes to sins as well as sin. What we are engaged with now is more sin as a state, describing the state in which man is as unregenerate. But what Naaman needed was more extensive, I would say. It was not simply water, but the Jordan; that is, death was brought into it in a peculiar way; and seven times. But @Revelation 22 contemplates water in a constant application because of recurring defilement, but the sins are dealt with, too. We are told in @Revelation 1 that the Lord Jesus loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, which is another phase of the matter.
J.A.P. Is the kind of state that you are seeking to help us on emphasised in chapter 1? The Cretans were liars, evil wild beasts, and lazy gluttons, @Titus 1:12. What you are stressing now meets that kind of thing.
J.T. They represent man in a certain state. These were given to a low state and conduct. No doubt the use of the word 'washing' would bear on that. Sometimes you get a golden thread but it bears on a particular circumstance, and no doubt the Cretan condition was in mind.
R.W.S. Whereas the regenerate would be the positive position brought in following the washing?
J.T. I would say it is an accompanying, correlative thought. Washing is mentioned first, as if it was the one thing that ought to be stressed with such people as the Cretans. There are grades in the human race; grades of wickedness. Some persons follow a more respectable course but others wallow in the filth of this world, and the idea of washing has to be stressed to meet the condition; and so with the Corinthians: they needed the cross; that is what they needed
{126}
because they were making something of learning, and what they were in that sense. The apostle says, "For I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified", @1 Corinthians 2:2. Then he proceeds to enlarge on the cross. He is dealing with man as at Corinth. And so, as it were, with the Galatians it would be a legal thing; the legal side of the world where ethics and the like are applied and insisted upon.
A.N.W. I wondered whether that was not the point here largely, rather than evil things. "Not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which *we* had done". Even that is to be offset by God's own mercy.
J.T. That is stated. There is no doubt there is a suggestion as to the low habits of the Cretans -- always liars; a remarkable thing. No doubt that was in the apostle's mind. There are other things, of course. In fact the gospel, you might say, is fully in mind in the chapter.
Ques. Would the thought of self-judgment enter into both of these scriptures, or is that a different thought altogether?
J.T. It would be in mind, because it is a question of washing. There is something to be washed, you know; that is, to be purified, and that would imply there is something of God that is affected; but at the same time the work of God in regeneration does not meet the whole matter. It needs the principle of washing. Regeneration is a new beginning; a new start, and washing is more negative, to remove something that is polluted.
C.N. So that verse 3 of our chapter is connected, is it not, with verse 4? Verse 3 says, "For we were once ourselves also without intelligence, disobedient, wandering in error, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But when the kindness and love to man of
{127}
our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit".
J.T. Yes; he brings in these three things as stressed. He could bring others in. He speaks of other things that could have been covered by other features of the gospel; but we must not forget the need that exists. It is a sort of inner thing. Of course, it continues all the time -- pollution in the world -- but this season of the year greatly accentuates it, and it is lightly thought of, perhaps; whereas in truth these places defile us. We hardly realise it, and may be unable through the experience to take on the service of God.
R.W.S. Is there a link between being born of water and this washing?
J.T. I think so. That is what I was thinking. The Lord adds that in the second word about new birth. If we look at chapter 3 of John, we shall see, perhaps, how the matter stands. After Nicodemus remarks, the Lord's answer is, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew", and that word 'anew' is 'throughout'. It is a thorough matter. But it is positive, too. "Verily, verily, I say unto thee. Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God", @John 3:3. That is the first answer. Now Nicodemus comes back with another suggestion: "How can a man be born being old? Can he enter a second time into the womb of his mother and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily". That is the second "verily, verily", here, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God", @John 3:4,5. So that water is introduced in the Lord's second answer and is to remind Nicodemus that it was not only that the idea of new birth should
{128}
take place by the Spirit -- but that man was polluted and the idea of washing had to apply basically. So that he would be cleansed in his mind and affections. But it does not go so far as what we have in Titus, because in Titus we have the added thought of renewal of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit effects new birth and applies the water, but then there is the additional thought of the presence of the Spirit; the reception of the Spirit; the renewal of the Holy Spirit which God shed on us abundantly.
A.R. Would it be like a new man for a new sphere?
J.T. That is right; a new man inclusive, not only of the positive effect of the Spirit, but the washing; that is, purification.
A.R. You do not bring any impurities in amongst the saints.
J.T. That is the idea. We are just calling attention to the unclean state of things that we cannot but be aware of at this season of the year, and whether it is taken account of and met in our souls by the provision of the water; because there are two elements: the water and the blood. The water is for cleansing the inward state.
A.A.T. I did not get your meaning about the season of the year.
J.T. It is a season in which we attend those resorts or bathing places which are full of people and are unclean, peculiarly so; and the brethren go there with little thought of that and they are unable, at least in measure, to carry on the service of God unless the water is applied specifically in view of the conditions.
A.P.T. Ananias said to Paul, "Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name", @Acts 22:16. What do you think he had in his mind there? Would there be any link with this?
{129}
J.T. It would be a question of what he had been going on with. He says 'sins' there. That is, the law had been broken for hundreds of years and Paul came in on that. He was peculiarly guilty because he was violent in attacking Christ in it. He had to deal with his past history; not only his personal sins, although they were especially in mind, but the whole nation was in mind in the guilt of a broken law, and was he to continue in that? Why was he delaying? It would seem as if he was loth to leave the Jewish system. "Have thy sins washed away". That is, it would be true baptism; the death of Christ in the sense of water.
Ques. Would the washing in @John 13 have any bearing on what you are speaking of?
J.T. Yes; it would. It is a more refined thought, because they were already washed. They were already clean, as the Lord Himself says, "by reason of the word which I have spoken to you", but what was meant in the water that the Lord used is the new order of things which He was about to introduce and which they were to be brought into. It was to have part with Him. He says, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me", @John 13:8. It is a very high elevated side of our subject.
A.R. The man in @John 9 was told to go and wash his eyes.
J.T. That was to clean off the mud that had been applied. The Lord anointed his eyes with mud. He spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle and told the man to go to Siloam and wash. It was a process all included in the death of Christ, so that he saw. He says, "I washed and I see", @John 9:15.
R.W.S. Does this first scripture bear on the bathing resorts, or is it the second scripture or both? I am not just clear because I can see the washing of the robes is what I must do, but this washing in Titus -- is not that done to us?
{130}
J.T. It would be an act of God, as you might say, to begin with, only that it is a necessity that is felt and accepted. That man not only gets his sins dealt with, as forgiven, but his state is dealt with; and the first word that is used is the washing. The Cretans needed their state dealt with. It could only be in effect by the death of Christ, because that is the only means of cleansing, whether it be from sins or from sin. Therefore, the two features are found or appear in the death of Christ. The first is the blood, which deals with our sins, and then the water which deals with the state. John speaks in his epistle of the water first.
A.A.T. I notice an interesting reference to washing and bathing in @Numbers 19 about the red heifer. In verse 19 it says, "and he shall wash his garments, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even. And the man that is unclean, and doth not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation". All the thoughts are woven in there.
J.T. They are. The first thought you allude to is what the man who slays the heifer has to do. It was an office he fulfilled, but he was rendered unclean because the thought was defiling. Therefore, he had to wash and be unclean until the evening. And so the priest had to wash, too. These are official thoughts, but the main thought that you mentioned last is the person who touches a dead body. He is not told to wash in the same sense. The point that is made as to him is that his guilt will be if he does not wash, and the water that he washes with is mixed with the ashes of the red heifer. Water is applied mixed with the ashes. It is not that he is guilty because he touches a dead body. Of course, that defiles him, but his guilt would be if he refrains from washing; applying what God provided for his cleansing, which is kept with the people all the time. The
{131}
ashes are kept purposely for that. It is a unique sort of thing and, of course, it enters into this; but we will not get through with our point if we touch all the washings, because Solomon's system had a sea. It held two thousand baths and ten layers, showing how wide the subject is.
R.M. What is your thought as to "he saved us" in this connection?
J.T. It is just to bring out the gospel as Paul intended it to be applied at Crete.
R.M. It is not connected with eternal salvation, is it? It is for the active thing down here.
J.T. We can hardly omit that; "according to his own mercy he saved us". And I think the great general thought of salvation is implied; hence Paul says, "to us who are saved". The word 'saved' here would have that force.
A.R. I have wondered if we do not stress the word 'salvation' too much in connection with our sins before God whereas salvation is more in connection with the earth, saved from things down here.
J.T. It is, but at the same time the word 'saved' here is very wide. It implies that we are just saved from everything from which we have to be saved, so that "he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour". We need that, too. The word 'salvation' is a very wide word. It implies that we are saved from everything we have to be saved from, whether it be our sins or our state or the world, or the judgment of God. We need salvation from the judgment of God.
J.S. Involving a change in position.
J.T. Quite so.
A.N.W. In Luke it is definitely put in connection with the service of God. I am struck with your remark that what you are frowning on definitely hinders the service of God, but we are saved from our
{132}
enemies that we might serve Him; serving Him all the days of our life.
J.T. You can see the word is very wide, and it involves the judgment of God. We have to be saved from that. But what we are at now -- it would be well to confine ourselves to it, because as a rule the time runs away at these meetings and we, perhaps, sometimes miss what we had in mind. This idea of the washing of regeneration is very forceful as entering basically into our moral being; that the unconverted man is defiled in his very words. He is not particular whether he uses a defiled word or expression or profane expression. This principle introduced into the believer changes him and makes him different from the unconverted man, the ordinary worldling.
J.S. You can see a basic change.
J.T. It is basic. It is inserted in connection with new birth in @John 3 and with regeneration in this chapter.
A.N.W. While it is God who does it, is it not the thought of the scripture that it has a purifying effect? It has a reaction on ourselves in regard of what God has done.
J.T. If it is in your being or in your nature, then it shows itself, and if it does not show itself it is either that you are not converted at all or you are defiled.
A.P.T. So that one feels in oneself that in going to the beaches, finding some excuse for it in children and what not, this chapter would show me whether my moral being recoils from the unregenerate character of things present.
J.T. If it does not your conversion is questionable. It is questionable for the moment, anyway; if I am not conscious of the character of the defilement you just question my state. So that the Christian recoils. If he has to go -- well, he has to go and God will help him if he is exercised about it. But if I go there without any exercise like the worldlings I get defiled.
{133}
P.E. To get some practical help for the younger ones, it is not the bathing you are speaking of, but the surroundings.
J.T. It is the surroundings, and all that enters into it.
A.R. You hear people say there is no harm in this and no harm in that, but there is a great deal of harm in bad associations. That is where defilement comes in.
R.W.S. Is regeneration a family thought?
J.T. The way it is used in @Matthew 19 refers to the millennium and, of course, points out the great change that will come about. What a change will come about if this principle is applied to millions of people as compared with what there is now. There is no change at all except in a few individuals, but then it will be general. It is called regeneration as applied in the coming day, the coming world.
F.S.C. Do you connect it here with the word 'man' in verse 4?
J.T. "But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared". It is a question of the philanthropy of God. It is not translated that way, but that is what is meant. It is the love of God to man; not the love of God to angels or cows or any being, but man. That is what is in mind.
J.S. Love unsolicited.
J.T. It would be that. The word 'philanthropy' is a good word.
F.S.C. Does regeneration apply to man?
J.T. It does, but there is more than that here. The word that you are calling attention to -- the expression "love to man" is really philanthropy. It is God's consideration for man. It includes the gospel; that is, what God is doing for man. Some people may show a little philanthropy for men in a town or an institution or something like that, but God embraces the whole race of man in His movement
{134}
in Christ. It was a big thing, you know, but it is a love matter with Him, but love in that sense. It is applied as philanthropy is applied.
R.M. Is there something of that in the scripture mentioned here? Our Saviour God and then Jesus Christ our Saviour?
J.T. Just so. You can see that in verse 6. Salvation is involved in that.
R.M. It is connecting two divine Persons with the thought of the Saviour. How does that apply?
J.T. God has come in in love to man; but, notice, it is love to man; not love to angels, but love to man. He has come in in that way, and the love would take care of everything man needed. It does not rise to the counsels of God but just in the sense of philanthropy.
R.W.S. Are these three items of this philanthropy?
J.T. I would think they are very essential. That is what is stressed; the washing and the regeneration and the Holy Spirit. These are grand thoughts. "Shed on us" is the final word as to the Spirit; it is shed on us. It is like @Romans 5:5, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".
A.R. Would you say something about the renewal of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. That is the third great thing: your renewed state. Of course, the washing tends to renew, and the regeneration tends to renew, but the Spirit is a great general thought in the sense of renewal; the dispensation is freshened and kept fresh throughout by the Spirit.
A.N.W. The pouring out was at Pentecost, as you may say, but throughout the whole dispensation there is the renewal.
J.T. That is the idea. It brings out what a great thing Christianity is; how the philanthropy of God
{135}
considered for Him and in effect brought about the dispensation in its richness.
A.R. Renewal is going on in me all the time; something fresh every day.
J.T. Well, yes. It is the renewal of the Holy Spirit that is going on all the time. The Spirit has not only come in; He has come in for the duration, you may say, of the dispensation. He has come in for the duration, but He is active all the time, and that is what the word 'renewal' implies. It is a freshened thought; but what we are at now is the washing; that the saints get washed. Basically, they are at conversion, but we now want to get the application of the washing which is in the last passage read, "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city", @Revelation 22:14. Notice -- if the brethren have not got the New Translation they will not follow what I am reading. It is not a question of keeping the commandments, but washing. It is a great principle in the book of Revelation, and begins with the Lord washing us from our sins in His own blood, which is very touching. And then we have in chapter 7 a great multitude that no one could count who washed their robes. They have done it themselves, but they have done it with the blood of the Lamb; not with water, but with the blood of the Lamb. Here because it is a question of the believer washing, so that he may have a right to the tree of life and that he should go in by the gates into the city.
A.R. You would think brethren would come into fellowship under those circumstances. People who wash have a right to break bread.
J.T. Quite so.
A.P.T. "Wash their robes". How do you apply "their robes"?
{136}
J.T. The externals, I would say. Robes or our clothes are intended to convey external things, so that anything of that character about you is pure. External things would, refer to associations; not things at a distance but near things.
A.D. Would it be things that door-keepers could take account of?
J.T. Yes; it would. That is a point that helps us, because they have a right to the tree of life and go in by the gates into the city, and of course, the gates have gate-keepers.
W.C.R. If there has been defilement through bad associations or going to the beaches, is it not the service of the Holy Spirit that brings it to bear upon our conscience?
J.T. You ought to bring it to bear yourself. I mean to say, the sense of responsibility is not that the Holy Spirit does a thing. If I am to do it, do it; and you get the material; you get the appliances, what is needed. It is a question of what you do.
W.C.R. I meant the difference in a person in whom there is a work of God and a person in whom there is not a work of God.
J.T. The washing of regeneration in Titus is basic. It belongs to the constitution, as it were, of the believer, but this verse in Revelation says a person is blessed because he washes. "Blessed are they that wash". We cannot just say it is a question of the Spirit washing. It is not that. It is a question of the person. First you think of the materials for washing; the facilities and that, but it is not a question of God doing it for us or the Spirit doing it for us. It is what we do but the appliances are provided.
F.H.L. Can we not link this with @1 Corinthians 11? Would not this characteristic of washing link up with proving oneself in relation to the Supper?
{137}
J.T. "But let a man prove himself, and thus eat", @1 Corinthians 11:28. Yes.
A.N.W. "That they may have right". There is an objective in doing it. "That they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city". The washing has a definite objective in it.
J.T. It is a means to an end. You want to partake of the tree of life. You want to go in, but not clandestinely; not to climb in as some did, but go in by the gates, openly and transparently.
A.N.W. So that the gates may ask questions that they never asked before.
J.T. Quite so.
R.W.S. Would Simon Magus in @Acts 8 be like one who was washing his robes ostensibly but as it says here, did not have the washing of regeneration?
J.T. The idea of regeneration does not enter into this at all. Of course, it is a new man; but that is not the point; nor is it a question of blood here. It is this thing that is done; not that it has been done, but that it is being done. The word is in the present: "Blessed are they that wash". Not that have washed, but that do it. "That they may have right". They have an intelligent reason for it. They are bound up in the thing. They cannot afford, as it were, to be denied these things. I may deny myself of these things unless I wash, but if I value them I will see to it that I wash.
R.W.S. So that the inside and the outside must be consistent.
J.T. Just so. The beginning is God's work; the washing at the beginning is God's work, at new birth. It is a basic thing. You acquire the thought of being clean. It is not exactly holiness; it is purity. God has given you that element in your constitution, and He looks for it. You do have it. It comes up when anything happens in your conversation; lying and
{138}
the like. You discern it and immediately you settle it. But this passage here implies all that, but it implies an emergency condition; a condition that has arisen and has to be settled at once, because you deny yourself of these great privileges; that is, having part in the tree of life and entering in by the gates.
G.L. Had Dorcas neglected the matter in @Acts 9? Washing is applied by others.
J.T. What is your thought? Is it that she was a garment maker or that she needed to be washed when she died?
G.L. I never have been able to understand why the principle should have to be applied to Dorcas in that state.
J.T. Do you mean when she died she had to be washed?
G.L. Yes. Is it a service by others in that sense?
J.T. I suppose it was a necessity for the manner of the Jews, so to speak. It is what they did. Let us see who did it. It does not say Peter ordered it. "And it came to pass in those days that she grew sick and died; and, having washed her, they put her in the upper room", @Acts 9:37. You see there who did that. There were several people around. I suppose it would be the custom to wash a dead person. I do not think there is anything moral in that at all. Anyway, there it is. "But Lydda being near to Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, beseeching him, Thou must not delay coming to us. And Peter rising up went with them, whom, when arrived, they brought up into the upper chamber; and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing him the body-coats and garments which Dorcas had made". Those that washed her would be similar to those. There is no question as to the moral necessity as far as I can see. It was, I suppose, custom. But when he arrived, it says, "But Peter, putting them all out". Of course he does not say, you should not
{139}
have washed her, but what was needed was life. She was to be raised from the dead. "And, turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up", @Acts 9:40. I do not think there is anything in the washing.
G.L. I never understood it. I never thought that we should not be able to apply spiritually any thought in Scripture. Should we not seek a spiritual application? Does not the process of her dying suggest a moral process that might have been consequent upon the neglect of washing?
J.T. I do not think there is anything in it except that it was suitable in the ordinary way. She would have opened her eyes after she had been washed in that case.
J.A.P. We need to value our robes. The robes of the priests had a pomegranate and a bell around the hem of the garment, @Exodus 28:33. The maintenance of that is something precious to the service of God basically; that there should be a good ring and fruitfulness.
J.T. Very good. The pomegranate and the bell would mean when the priest went in or went out he made a sound. All that should be in the gathering when we come in. Suppose we are down at the beach and come into the prayer meeting on a Monday; we do not, I hope, go to the beach on Sunday -- but suppose we go down on Monday and come into the prayer meeting from the beach -- I doubt very much if there will be a good ring of the bell or much pomegranate. Anyway, it is not that it is not possible, for if one judges himself he has right. He can do that if he is right with God, but is there not a danger of damaging the prayer meeting by that? Is not the idea of fasting necessary to avoid any damage to the service of God?
C.N. Do you think we lack in consciousness as to these surroundings that we are apt to be defiled by? In Crete there are conditions there that necessitated
{140}
this washing, and then in Revelation the next verse speaks about these persons that are outside. I wondered whether we are not lacking in being made conscious of these environments that we often have to meet. If you were more conscious of them you would be more intelligent as to the need of washing.
J.T. Just so. If you have to go to the beach or a place like that -- you have to in business matters -- but then, do we have to go? We are endangering ourselves when we go. Here we have the kind of people: "Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one that loves and makes a lie". They sit around there and read novels and maybe make them. I am only referring to one but it is a common thing and we think there is nothing in that. But can you come to the prayer meeting and join in in that?
A.A.T. You are referring to public bathing places, but are there not private places where you are free from the worldly elements?
J.T. I would not like to be legal at all, but I have been here for half a century and I know pretty well what happens. There are not many that you speak of but then if there is, of course, what can we say? Go there and keep yourself clean, by judging yourself, but generally, how can you do it? When the beaches have become what they are today, how can you do it?
A.A.T. I think your word has a direct application to brethren who live here in the east, but in the centre of the United States and Canada there are no beaches.
J.T. Well, they have lakes and they are just as bad. I know some who have been damaged, seriously, too.
A.P.T. Do you think Lot was one that was saved under certain conditions but he would hardly be a
{141}
worshipper? It says, he settled down. Do you think he is one that did not seem to care about the service of God? Do you think he would enter much into the service of God according to the scriptural record? It says in Peter, he settled down. I wondered if his salvation was really only in the blood side in that sense. Would not the scriptural record of his life bar him in the true sense of the word from the holiness pertaining to it?
J.T. It is doubtful whether he would have any part in it. The only thing that can be said to his credit is that he had unleavened bread in his house, @Genesis 19:3. He is the first one said to have had it. It is suggestive that Lot was singled out in that sense. Peter says, "Lot ... tormented his righteous soul day after day with their lawless works", @2 Peter 2:8. But could he not get away from that? That is the question often that comes up in regard to Lot -- his righteous soul. It seems to me the Spirit of God is very liberal and generous in speaking of him as a righteous man, but did he have to remain with them all the time? It would look as if he was a very 'hail-fellow-well-met' with the inhabitants of Sodom.
A.P.T. That verse is just the verse I have in mind. Another rendering says he settled down. I wondered as to whether I may become hard in listening to all these things and not move out of them. If not, how can I take much part in the prayer meeting or service of God? I do not see how I can, effectively.
J.T. I think there are ways and means of getting out of the way of those things. I do not think Lot used the means that were available. For instance, he calls the inhabitants of Sodom his brethren. He seemed to be on hearty terms with them; and when the men of God, that is, the angels come he took them into his house. They were very hesitant about going in, but he constrained them and they went in, and he set
{142}
unleavened bread before them, which is a great credit to him. But why should there be such a state and he not know it was there? They came from every part of the city to attack him when the angels were found to be there. It is remarkable; as if God would expose the relations that he had maintained, and yet God covers him, as much as possible, through Peter in calling him a righteous man.
R.D. As doorkeepers, how much intelligence should we look for as to those coming into fellowship?
J.T. If you are thinking of the city that is alluded to here, the city is glowing with intelligence, glowing with heavenly-mindedness, and everything that you would expect in the city is there. There is nothing missing. Every gate is one pearl. You may be sure that these gate-keepers would be ready for anyone who drew near and would detect any garment that had not been washed. It might be good quality, but the point is not the quality but the washing. Do you not think so?
R.D. I think we need help as to the intelligence we should look for, especially in the young people, do you not?
J.T. I do. The elders would be able to instruct them. The real difficulty is just that -- the gate-keepers, the door-keepers -- they ought to be elders. In truth, that is what they would be and how can we hope to get on together and save the youth unless there are those who know how to detect those elements of unwashed garments? We have to detect them and then to speak of them.
A.R. There is a difficulty keeping them after they get in.
J.T. That is another thing, but this applies, too, even if they are in. This applies, because it is a question of the blessedness of the person. "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have
{143}
right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city". That would be at any time.
T.E.H. Would David be a man like that? After he washed his robes and came into the city, he says, "I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall return unto thee", @Psalm 51:13. He would be a man that washed his robes constantly.
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Is it the local responsibility to insist strenuously on these things, as in verse 8?
J.T. I am sure that is the word; strenuous insistence on these things. I know well enough the difficulty of entering into it because we are all in it, and if we approach it in this sense as the Scriptures require God will help us and perhaps we will lose less, because the losses are rather serious and they come about just in this way: defilement acquired in bad associations, etc., and then we have to say we cannot go on with you.
A.N.W. Genesis says it is the flame of the flashing sword. It seems to be in accord with the gate here.
J.T. Cherubim, it says. It is the government of God.
A.P.T. It is said in @Psalm 87:2 that God loves the gates of Zion. There must be something lovable in our local administration carried out according to Him.
J.T. How pleasurable it is. On care meeting nights -- how pleasurable they are to God. He knows that we are concerned about these matters.
F.H.L. Is it not very striking that this last paragraph comes in between verses 12 and 16, as if it is a last hour challenge?
J.T. Yes; the list of things given of those that are without. How solemn it is that people leave the brethren because they do not find these things there. They go to where they can find them. But how
{144}
remarkable -- the character is that they are without and without forever.
J.A.P. Should we look for this in persons coming into fellowship, that they should know how to wash themselves? A child growing up has to be taught to wash itself.
J.T. Just so.
A.Pf. It applies to every Christian.
J.T. It does, but peculiarly to the youth. We could go over the Scriptures and point out these things, because the Scriptures are full of them. "And remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth", @Ecclesiastes 12:1.
F.S.C. The Lord says He has a few names in Sardis that have not defiled their garments.
J.T. That is another point that enters into this. We are alluding to Christendom. Protestantism really is in mind in Sardis, and the fact that there is such a scarcity of white garments in that church is very suggestive of the conditions that are around us. "I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead ... . But thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy", @Revelation 3:1 - 4.
A.Macd. Do you think this was the secret of Joseph's blessing? As a young man he had no part in evil speaking. He had no part with the evil in Potiphar's house.
J.T. Very good. One has often thought of that, how in the book that treats of fathers -- because Genesis is really a father's book, an old man's book, I mean, they predominate -- you have introduced into that a young man, seventeen years of age, and this is what marks him. How he took account of his own brother's evil communications and then in Potiphar's house he was true to the principles of purity and
{145}
suffered for it. He is an example for us and especially for the young at the present time.
R.D.G. Is there not a difference between the exercise of maintaining one's garments without defilement and then washing them if they become defiled?
J.T. That is good. This verse would suggest that the person in mind has had to do it and does it. He knows something about the defilement, because it is not keeping himself from the evil so much as discerning that he has done it. "Blessed are they that wash their robes". It is that side.
R.D.G. Whereas in Sardis it is this: "Thou hast a few names ... which have not defiled their garments".
J.T. I would think the allusion would be to religious circles or religious associations in Sardis. They have not got the assembly truth, but they are equal to it, ready for it, I would say. No doubt we could, perhaps, discern them in the history of the assembly; the history that we have -- these names; some of them, anyway. Some of them whose hymns we have and who stood out against religious evil particularly. They did not defile their garments. It would appear as if they stood out throughout the whole period.
A.B. In Laodicea they are exhorted to have white garments, as if they were not white.
J.T. The Lord speaks to them as buying them from Him. "I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest", @Revelation 3:18, as if they were not suitable for fellowship, as we speak. It is remarkable in those who have suffered in Revelation how they are recompensed for having to wait a little longer for the final resurrection by getting white garments. The Lord recompenses them; as if awaiting the full result in resurrection He gives them a white garment. He says in
{146}
@Revelation 6:9, "And when it opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held; and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O sovereign Ruler, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth? And there was given to them, to each one a white robe; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while, until both their fellow-bondmen and their brethren, who were about to be killed as they, should be fulfilled". It looks as if the Lord would say, I know you valued the white robe when you lived, and I know you will value the thought until you are raised. So that that is the reward they have for waiting a little while for the full result.
R.W.S. In @Revelation 7:14 to which you alluded, it says, "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb". There is no cleansing agent mentioned in the scripture read in @Revelation 22. Why is that? The blood is used in the two references in @Revelation 1 and @Revelation 7; here it is just the washing.
J.T. Therefore, I think it is implied that it is a continuous thought. It is not the blood but the water. The application of the blood is once for all. "Who ... has washed us from our sins in his blood", @Revelation 1:5. But here the Spirit tells us they did that themselves. They must have acquired that thought of doing it. But @Revelation 22, I think, must allude to continuous washing, which has its own teaching in the Scriptures and it means the water.
T.W. Might that involve something I may see or hear causing evil thoughts? Would that be such an item that would require the washing?
J.T. Your state is the point. Of course, it involves confession and, therefore, it comes under
{147}
the heading of individual sins, but with the sense of being defiled by them. Confession brings relief at once, as in Peter's case, @Matthew 26:75. He went out and wept bitterly. I am sure that brought relief to his conscience. He needed washing, but the Lord saw to that, in appearing to him; and then in @John 21 He probed him so that he is relieved wholly from the thing.
{148}
THE KINGDOM OF GOD IN ROMANS
@Romans 1:1 - 7; @Romans 5:20,21; @Romans 14:7 - 18
J.T. The proposal is to look at these scriptures in order to have before us something of the kingdom, the kingdom of God. It is an ever present necessity to have it in mind, because of the need of rule; the need of it especially in young people, and inclusive of subjection to one another. Therefore, the first chapter is read because it calls attention to obedience, and the kingdom is suggested, too, in the allusion to David. It is said, "come of David's seed". And then chapter 5 was read because it speaks of grace reigning: "go also grace might reign". And then chapter 14 is a formal allusion to the kingdom and what it is. That is, @Revelation 14:16 says, "Let not then your good be evil spoken of; for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit". And then it adds, "For he that in this serves the Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men", showing how practical the thought is in this epistle. We are to serve in it. This epistle being addressed to the Romans is not without significance, because law had acquired a peculiar place in that empire as compared with the other three monarchies, and the Spirit of God would seize the fact to enforce law, only on the saints in the true sense of it. We are told in chapter 12 that love is the fulfilling of the law, but it works out in this wide way.
C.A.M. You were going to stress the matter of obedience in chapter 1?
J.T. Just in relation to that, because it is found several times in the form in which it is seen here: "for obedience of faith among all the nations", @Romans 1:5. It is not simply that young Christians are instructed
{149}
in the principle of law, for that is in mind in the schools and colleges and the like, but obedience of faith. The principle of law in the Roman empire would have subjection in mind but there was no idea of faith, so the kingdom of God is, therefore, introduced and it involves the obedience of faith.
C.A.M. Would you say that speaking in a general way that stands over against the first act of displeasure to God? It was disobedience.
J.T. So that we have the contrast there in chapter 5, have we not? In @Romans 5:19 it says, "For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous".
A.E.H. Does this idea of faith refer to the vital links with God, between God and the soul, and God in that way getting a great place -- a supreme place in the soul, and the principle of reigning works out of that and the judgments are not formed by circumstances that might arise but, as it says in Isaiah, "He shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears; but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity the meek of the earth", @Isaiah 11:3,4? Is that the idea?
J.T. I think that is good. In @Psalm 98:2 it is laid down that those in the kingdom would show that God is righteous. "Because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed", @Acts 17:31. This epistle clearly makes no excuse for itself. It is the introduction of righteousness by faith in us, but the rule is in God. It is God's kingdom. What is required is the obedience of faith. It is God's kingdom and the principle laid down in man is the obedience of faith. It is said that law came in, that is, law in the legal sense -- the law came in that
{150}
the offence might abound @Romans 5:20. That is, that the exaggeration of lawlessness through the law might make it more imperative that God should rule and that it should be on the principle of faith, not of law.
F.H.L. In @Luke 4:18 - 21 the Lord speaks of having been sent forth to announce the glad tidings of the kingdom. Would that be in line with what you are saying as to being in God's kingdom?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. Luke, I suppose, has that in mind -- the kingdom of God.
G.V.D. Would you say Abraham would be a good example of one marked by the obedience of faith as he is spoken of in @Hebrews 11? "By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance", @Hebrews 11:8. Would that be along that line?
J.T. Quite so. He obeyed.
A.R. We have to learn everything from Christ -- His obedience. He said in Matthew, "Not as *I* will but as *thou* wilt", @Matthew 26:39. That is the Model, is it not? Chapter 5 of Romans is the new Head.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord leads in everything for us, and certainly leading as to the principle of obedience. It is the crying need especially among the young. And then not only obedience to God and Christ, but obedience to one another; submission to one another, the whole system -- wives being subject to their husbands and the like. The whole system is disrupted in the want of obedience, and this epistle is to enforce it; but it is the obedience of faith.
G.L. Abraham's obedience is all the more remarkable because the law was not given yet.
J.T. Yes. And, of course, Abraham was accounted righteous on the principle of faith, so that he had a great advantage. It is not said of Noah he was accounted righteous by faith, nor of the others before him. This great principle of righteousness by faith
{151}
came in by Abraham, but then that faith was accompanied by obedience, as has just been remarked.
A.A.T. When David established his kingdom I suppose all the Israelites had the protection of it. Would faith enter in there?
J.T. That is the reason why I thought it should be introduced. It is introduced in the very outset of Romans; David represents not righteousness by faith but rule. He lays down for us the principle of the kingdom, the principle of rule. "The ruler among men shall be just", @2 Samuel 23:3. Abraham had that principle, but David is raised up to enforce it. And, therefore, his introduction here as in the line of Christ is important; "come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God in power", @Romans 1:3,4. That is the Son is Ruler.
J.T.Jr. Matthew's gospel begins, "Son of David, Son of Abraham", @Matthew 1:1, linking both together.
J.T. Very good. That helps, because the assembly is in mind in Matthew, and it is organised rule. Organised rule is in mind in Matthew. So that David is said to be king as he is introduced, and Christ is said to be the Son of David first. "Son of David, son of Abraham".
A.B. Matthew would be the gospel that would help us in regard to our brotherly relations and the maintenance of kingdom principles would be known by us.
J.T. That is why, I suppose, chapter 18 introduces the need of adjustment if there is trespass and the assembly is the final appeal. Matters are concluded in the assembly; things are finalised, which is a most important thing, because the idea is organised rule. Of course, it is in God, it is in Christ, but authority is in the assembly, and even the brethren and the husbands -- indeed all; we are to be subject one to another. I think David would represent the organisation. Of course, Moses does, too. He represents
{152}
the kingdom, too. He was king in Jeshurun. That is to say, he was king among the brethren. There is the idea of consideration -- king in Jeshurun.
A.R. There was certain territory that David took where he had to put garrisons. Why was that? Could the persons not be trusted?
J.T. Well, that helps as to what we are saying. He put garrisons in places, because it is a question of organisation. The garrison would be representative of the assembly. David is said to have established his rule or kingdom on the Euphrates. He went to the limit, the utmost boundary, so that we are not to be limited in the principle.
A.E.H. I would like a little help in regard to this matter of obedience. The question naturally arises, obedience to what? And is the principle to which obedience is to be rendered the idea of the supremacy of God? "But his delight is in Jehovah's law", @Psalm 1:2. Is that the idea -- obedience to that great principle of the supremacy of God?
J.T. Well, quite. But I think what we have said is important, the thing itself, even if it begins in a brother; the idea itself, in whomsoever it might be righteously exercised; in a husband or even in a brother or sister according to what is there. The word 'obedience' here -- obedience of faith is the thing itself; the idea itself exercised on the principle of faith. That is, that I am subject on the principle of faith.
A.E.H. I am helped in my own soul, whether what I am obedient to is entirely in line with the idea of the supremacy of God or not. I am helped in my own soul on the principle of obedience, anyway.
J.T. That is what I am thinking. The idea of the kingdom is up, up, up, beginning at the bottom. Or you might reverse it and put it at the very top, but it is an organised thing, a systematic thing. So that there was the centurion who was recommended
{153}
to the Lord by the Jews. He has built us a synagogue, they said; he is worthy that you should do something for him. And he addresses the Lord and says, You do not need to come to my house to heal my servant; I also am a man under authority. That is, it is delegated authority. I say to my servant, Do this, and he does it. He put that on the Lord. He says, I know you are in that position. That is to be understood. The whole system is impregnated with the idea of obedience, but then corresponding with obedience, rule. There is no use talking about obedience unless there is rule and a ruler, so that we have the two things in this epistle.
A.E.H. I was thinking about what the Lord says to certain in His day. They disregarded the moral proper relationship between parents and children by saying that if their parents were benefited in any way by them, it was on the principle of gift. They owed nothing to their parents. That is what the Lord was striking at there, this principle of disobedience and the setting aside of rule.
J.T. Quite so. I see your point; whereas we owe everything. I mean the system implies that God is supreme, of course, but He is supreme in the system, and what He is supreme in extends down to every person in the system. If it be a brother, according to his ability, he has power to rule. So it is in the army and so it is in business, more or less. The principles are there, but when it comes to children, wife, brother and sister and so on, the obligation is often not recognised.
So I thought we might look at chapter 1 just because of the principle being there; the principle of obedience, without saying to whom it is, and that David is there and sonship is there -- all the qualities that would enforce the thought of obedience. And then in chapter 5, "So also grace might reign". It is not simply ruling but reigning. "So also grace
{154}
might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord", @Romans 5:21. The thing is finalised in eternal life. Eternal life, of course, involves all this. But grace is on the throne, because the word 'reign' implies a throne. The word 'rule' does not always imply a throne, because persons in the system do not all have thrones. But the principle in rule is according to our measure, but when we come to grace the idea of reigning involves a throne, supremacy.
J.T.Jr. Is grace to suggest that it is not an arbitrary matter? Grace enters into the position of rule in the house or any other position.
J.T. Quite so, and if the end in view is eternal life, well, there is a great moral weapon in that. Whatever measures are used to bring about the obedience, the end is eternal life; not to extol someone or elevate someone, but grace is a principle, not a person, and it is not, therefore, looking for honour. God has made it a principle on the throne and its end is eternal life.
A.R. That can be enjoyed in our houses as well as in the meeting.
J.T. Quite so. But you enjoy it more in the assembly. When the thing is finalised, it is the full thing. In this epistle it is the full thing, the full idea of blessing in which all are satisfied. There is no complaint at all. If eternal life is there, there is no complaint. Every heart is satisfied and grace is content with that, because grace is not looking for any honour. It is not a person; it is a principle, and God has enthroned it.
A.P.T. Abigail was not looking for any honour. She was satisfied that the right man should be at the top.
J.T. The right man; quite so. That is good. The right man happened to be the man she loved eventually, but that was not what was in her mind at
{155}
first. It was that the right man should rule, and certainly not her husband. Nabal was his name; that is, he was a fool. We do not want that. Her concern was that the right man should rule, and, of course, David was that. God showed in time that it was that.
J.A.P. When David said to the sons of Zeruiah, "What have I to do with you?" was that grace or was that weakness? Shimei had rebelled against David and the sons of Zeruiah were contending that he should be put to death and David said, "What have I to do with you?" @2 Samuel 19:22.
J.T. That was the point exactly, that he was king and God had ordained that. He had come back to that in fact. The sons of Zeruiah would defeat that. That is an important point because there are those that would defeat that, whereas the principle of the kingdom of God is that it has an end. The result is to be eternal life, but the thought that enters into that is, "Do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?" That is, grace would overcome the difficulties, may they be what they are. It is not mercy; it is grace. Mercy is sovereign but grace overcomes the difficulties and God has, therefore, put not mercy but grace on the throne. Grace takes account of the difficulties and meets them and, therefore, redemption or atonement is brought in to meet them, but the principle is there all the time. The sons of Zeruiah would not admit that, that Shimei could be forgiven and reinstated, but David would do that. He would overcome the difficulties attending Shimei's position.
Rem. The sons of Zeruiah were hard men.
J.T. David had said, "These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too hard for me", @2 Samuel 3:39. That is the kind of men they were, Joab particularly; but even when a man is hard, or a brother or sister is hard, grace attempts to take up the attitude of being able to meet that, and God is furnishing the means of meeting
{156}
that. Redemption furnishes the means of meeting it.
G.L. "My grace suffices thee", the Lord Jesus said to Paul; @2 Corinthians 12:9.
J.T. "My grace", just so. If you put grace on the throne, it will do all in its power, and that power is infinite because redemption supplies the means of meeting conditions.
J.T.Jr. While you say it is not a person, does it not come out in persons?
J.T. Well, it does, but it is put as a principle that the thing might be rightly apprehended; because it comes out to meet you when there are no persons needed. The Spirit of God furnishes things in your soul when there are no persons to help you. The means is in yourself.
F.H.L. Redemption makes it divinely right.
J.T. Redemption supplies the need so that the rights of God are maintained.
A.R. They obeyed from the heart the form of teaching delivered unto them.
J.T. Just so.
A.B.P. Does the principle of justification being brought in in this epistle justify grace, in the sense that while grace stays the judgment, mercy has found a means for justifying the sinner?
J.T. Yes; it is according to mercy. God saves us according to mercy; "but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit", @Titus 3:5. These are the means. Now, in chapter 3 of our epistle it is said, "But now without law righteousness of God is manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets; righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe: for there is no difference; for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth", @Romans 3:21 - 24.
{157}
Grace is the active operational principle. Mercy is, so to say, static. It is a great sovereign element, but grace is the great operational element, and therefore, it is on the throne.
A.E.H. Does grace involve the shining in or coming in of God, revealing Himself in an impossible situation and thus correcting the situation by that unfolding of Himself? Is that the principle of grace?
J.T. Just so. It is, so to say, the static idea in mercy. It is the greatest thing in a sense. But take Pharaoh in Genesis. He was supreme, but he said to Joseph, You will be second to me. Joseph was the operational head and, therefore, the whole system was set in movement, and the result was that all were brought into subjection to Pharaoh. Every person in Egypt was simply bound hands and feet by the operational wisdom of Joseph, and the whole nation and all the people in it were brought into subjection to Pharaoh. And now, if we apply that to Christianity, Christ is the operational Agent; a divine Person, of course, but He brings all into subjection; but it is not to limitation or bondmanship, although that in a certain sense applies, but it is in eternal life. That is, everybody is satisfied. There is no question about it. There is no complaint. Joseph, of course, does not altogether meet it as a type, but it conveys the idea that everybody is brought into subjection to Christ and everybody is satisfied. Everybody rejoiced, because it is not simply subjection but love, and so love is the fulfilling of the law. It is a question of love and love is satisfied.
A.E.H. That is the idea of peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ, which involves a constant and daily and real touch in our souls with Christ.
J.T. That is what the verse says that we have just read. "So also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord".
{158}
A.E.H. Which is not the idea of a static thing or a channel or a conduit, but an operational idea through our Lord Jesus Christ.
J.T. That is it. Therefore, the idea of supremacy is in @Genesis 1 in God coming into His creation. He takes a Name. When it is used first, we are not told, but it is Elohim. Jehovah is added to it, but it was the idea of supremacy, supremacy in the creation; and then the operation comes in. For instance, Noah is a great suggestion of an operator, but it was negative first but resulted in blessing through the burnt-offering, and the whole scene is in principle set up and established for ever in type. "Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease", @Genesis 8:22. The thing is established. That will all be transferred into eternity presently, where God will be all in all. And the Son also is to be in subjection, so that the operational principle remains, but what we have to come to in our souls is the way this works out. We are not a burden to one another. We are a help to one another, and the principle of subjection is permeating everywhere.
C.A.M. I was thinking of what you said about the beginning of Genesis. It was a great help to me when it was stressed in ministry years ago that the second chapter is the filling out of things. There is this static sort of set-up but then this filling out enlarges the whole sphere of things.
J.T. I am glad you brought that up, because chapter 2 brings man in. It brings affection into operation. It is Jehovah Elohim in chapter 2 and man comes in, and God is saying, I am going to ask him to name the animals, as if to give him something to do to show what he could do. God made a creature like that. Well, when that is applied to Christ, it is not a made creature but God Himself in manhood,
{159}
and everything is worked out on the principle of perfection.
A.P.T. "Happy are thy men! happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, who hear thy wisdom! Blessed be Jehovah thy God who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel!" @1 Kings 10:8,9. Is that a filling out of this kingdom idea of everybody happy?
J.T. Just so. The queen of Sheba is brought up. She saw that. They were her own words. She conveys to us what she saw. She is a witness to what was there, and what every one of us should be a witness to -- what there is in the new system. "Happy are thy men! happy are these thy servants".
F.S.C. Does it seem we have to have the dark picture before we get the bright one? It is that way so often in Scripture. Sin reigned; the power of death is mentioned before grace reigning.
J.T. God allowed the dark thing to come up so as to justify the bright thing when it came in. It enhanced it. Why was the law added a great many years after? To intensify the idea of disobedience so that God is justified in setting it aside, and justified and glorified in bringing in the system of eternal life which makes everybody satisfied and happy.
C.A.M. In that light, would it be right to say that God has allowed sin to abound at the present time, and we know that He is stressing eternal life in a very special way as against it all?
J.T. Just so. If there was no eternal life and no blessing in the end in mind, well, what would there be for us? There would be nothing but darkness. But there is light and a world of blessing.
A.A.T. How do you distinguish between the assembly and the kingdom of God, because the features of the kingdom are presented this afternoon, but it is unto eternal life, and I understand that is in connection with the assembly?
{160}
J.T. So it is now. It will not be always just like that, although the principle of eternal life must continue, the principle of it, which meets conditions -- death and sickness and all that, but the assembly is provisionally constituted so as to extend an opportunity for eternal life to manifest itself.
A.B. Verse 19 would help us in what you are saying in regard to it. "For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous". The principle of the kingdom is the constitution; not what is written in the constitution, but what is indelibly written in the souls of the subjects of the kingdom.
J.T. Just so. It is what they are, so that life had to be brought in. That is one of the things set up here in this epistle; the restitution of righteousness and life.
A.B.P. Would it be right to say that if you want to find a truly happy person you must find an obedient person?
J.T. Well, I would say that. The Lord makes a proposition in @Matthew 11. "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek, and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls", @Matthew 11:29. That was what He was. There was no dolefulness about Him. Of course, there was grief and that, but the general principle is the yoke is easy and the burden is light.
C.A.M. Speaking of the happy man being the obedient man, the man in the first Psalm finds delight in meditating day and night in God's law. If it did not act that way, we really would not grow; it would be irksome all the time.
J.T. Well, that is good, to bring up this matter of what you are saying just now, how the brethren are to be happy; but happy in righteousness, and this
{161}
book is to do that, to bring about a condition of satisfaction, to resolve the question of righteousness and then life flowing out from that. Other things, of course -- the Holy Spirit the power in it and so on.
F.N.W. Does what we find in the Lord Jesus Himself and His position in subjection help us to be happy in the kingdom? In Genesis Pharaoh says Joseph is to have the second chariot, and then "Bow the knee!" @Genesis 41:43, comes after he is given the second chariot.
J.T. Yes; quite so. And then, as we already alluded to Pharaoh, he represents supremacy in Joseph's system. We may speak of it in that way. It was Joseph's system and he was given a name which meant he would be the sustainer of the life of the world. Well now, he has brought all into subjection and evidently all are more or less happy. There is plenty of corn, plenty to meet the need of the body. And the question as to his brethren put them, too, in the general position, because we are in the general position and we shall be eternally in the general position although greater and higher than others. But still when the time comes for the supreme to ask something about his brethren, he selects five of them. He did not bring them all, as if he were to show Pharaoh what he could do; what his administration meant. So it is, I believe, that the Lord will bring us forward. He has His own way of bringing us forward before God, before the Supreme. And they tell Pharaoh just the truth, and they can be used because they tell the truth.
A.B. Do you think many of our difficulties are like those in Joseph's father and brethren -- the refusal to recognise in a brother the qualities that were there in Joseph? "Shall we indeed come ... to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?" @Genesis 37:10. It falsifies the position of the kingdom and we find that in our own hearts. The thing is there in
{162}
a very subtle way, not ready to be subordinate to the brethren or to a brother.
J.T. And they all had to come to that. Quite so. These five evidently had come to it.
A.B. They had been despising that.
J.T. The sun, moon and eleven stars, advancing the sphere, the area of subjection, all would bow down to him.
J.T.Jr. The principle of regulation came in there. That idea is to be in the person. "According to thy commandment shall all my people regulate themselves", @Genesis 41:40.
J.T. "Regulate themselves", very good.
A.T.D. Their life depended on it. Would that be typical of eternal life?
J.T. That is apparently what his name was: Zaphnath-paaneah, @Genesis 41:45, which means, 'Sustainer of the life of the world'. It is accepted by those who should know to mean that and, therefore, the whole universe is dependent on Christ, but it is a question of obedience now. Sin exists, but the element of obedience must be there. So it is that Joseph brought all in on that principle.
F.H.L. God will be completely vindicated in the millennium in relation to the One He has appointed.
J.T. Just so. He has appointed the day, and the next thing is the Man, and He has given assurance to all men so that we know about our vote. God has given assurance. If God were to give assurance to this country -- so many millions of people are casting a vote next month -- if God were to give assurance, I mean, if any man were worthy of it! God has given assurance to all men in that He has raised Jesus from the dead. The Man who is to rule -- you are assured that He is the Man and is to succeed in the ruling.
W.W.M. "Submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ", @Ephesians 5:21. Does that suggest
{163}
a subject state in us -- the state that is right for the kingdom?
J.T. That is the idea, I am sure. It is in the fear of Christ, not the fear of the Lord. It carries with it the idea of grace.
I thought with those few thoughts we might look at chapter 14, where we get the account of the kingdom. "For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. For he that in this serves the Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men", @Romans 14:18, showing that the thing is to permeate; approved of men. What you are doing is not only approved of God but approved of the brethren. You cannot despise the brethren in whatever you are doing. This matter of days is in this chapter, which calls not simply for literal rule, literal regulations. The thing treated calls for a wide open mind in the brethren, and each being persuaded in that mind. There is room for the use of our minds; not simply legal regulations but the use of our minds. It is in the end of the epistle and this matter of persons who are weak in the faith -- you are to receive them, but not to the determining of questions of reasoning. And then one man is assured that he may eat all things but the weak eat herbs. "Let not him that eats make little of him that eats not; and let not him that eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him", @Romans 14:3. "Who are *thou* that judgest the servant of another?" @Romans 14:4. The brethren are to be respected and we have to be careful what we say about them, and what we think about them. The word 'master' here is strong: "To his own master he stands or falls", @Romans 14:4. Then it goes on, "And he shall be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand. One man esteems day more than day; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind", @Romans 14:5. I was thinking of that; the mind of the Christian
{164}
-- what scope there is in it; how the Spirit of God operates in it without any formal regulation. "He that regards the day, regards it to the Lord". The Lord has His place anyway. "And he that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks", @Romans 14:6. That is to say, the apostle comes back to real Christianity in this instruction. "And he that does not eat, it is to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks. For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself". So that the very thought of dying brings in this principle. We do not do it ourselves. We are not selfish in it. We do it to the Lord, so that the Lord in this sense is dominating our every sphere and, therefore, it is said, "For both if we should live, it is to the Lord we live; and if we should die, it is to the Lord we die: both if we should live then, and if we should die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ has died and lived again, that he might rule over both dead and living", @Romans 14:8,9. There is the extension of the thing; there is the Person. We have been speaking about the principle, but now it is a Person who rules in the realm of death. He rules over them there as He does over the living. "But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or again, thou, why does thou make little of thy brother? For we shall all be placed before the judgment-seat of God. For it is written, I live, saith the Lord, that to me shall bow every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God", @Romans 14:9 - 11. So that now we come to Persons in the rule and the mention of giving Them their places, at the same time making full room in each other for the Lord having His place with each other. If it is a question of the day or meat, then make room for judgment, for a right judgment about it; for there are some things that are not stipulated in the instructions.
A.E.H. I have been thinking over of late that what makes me break down as a good kingdom man
{165}
is a lack in my soul as to the apprehension and appreciation of the One that I have to do with, so that the great regulatory principle or Person is God -- the supreme idea of it in verse 12: "So then each of us shall give an account concerning himself to God", @Romans 14:12. If we could get an increased apprehension of the majesty and greatness and supremacy of the One that we have to do with, it would all help to make us better kingdom men, would it not?
J.T. Very good; so that whilst we speak of each one having influence according to his measure, yet we are not constituted gods. "There are gods many, and lords many", @1 Corinthians 8:5. We are not gods. There is one God; He is supreme. And then we are told who He is. He is the Father. That is to regulate our minds as to worship, to save us from idolatry. We are to call no man father, but God. "There is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and *we* by him", @1 Corinthians 8:6. That is, He is the great operational Person; the great Operator. There is one Lord. Therefore, we are now brought down to the realm of supreme Persons -- God; the Trinity really. We have to learn to respect the Trinity and revere the Trinity and worship the Trinity.
A.R. Cornelius was going to worship Peter. Peter says, I myself also am a man.
J.T. Quite so.
A.B.P. Was Satan's first effort to break the line of rule? "Ye will be as God", @Genesis 3:5. Was that a subtle motive of the enemy to break the line of rule?
J.T. Quite so; and to dissipate the idea of the deity of God in the minds of men. That was the devil's aim, and while what he said was right in some sense, as the Lord says, "Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?" that is, there was authority there, as judges -- they have that place in a certain
{166}
limited way, still there is the idea of the deity of God. Whoever used the word first, we cannot say. There are more terms to express the Deity in the Old Testament in the Hebrew, than there is in the Greek. But anyway, we have words enough to show that God is supreme and God is the Judge of all, so that we are preserved and worshipful in regard of Him, and yet at the same time maintaining the thought of obedience and exercising authority in so far as God gives us title to do it, so that the system is maintained. I think chapter 14 is intended to work this out in us, because it is not so much as in chapters 12 and 13 what is told us to do, but what is in the system and how there is room for our minds. Each is to be persuaded in his own mind, so that the apostle says, "Hast *thou* faith? have it to thyself before God", @Romans 14:22. You say, Why should I have it to myself? Faith is to God and the brethren ought to know. But that is what it says here: "Hast *thou* faith? have it to thyself before God". So that the thing is there and at times not spoken about, but it is there. It is to impress the idea of the system we are in.
C.A.M. I think it is very interesting. So many things come into your mind as you speak. I was thinking about such great men as Daniel and Ezekiel and Jeremiah. They were all contemporary. You could not say that all had to do the same thing, or behaved in the same way. They had a God and they had power before God.
J.T. Quite so. There were twelve apostles. They were all contemporary. They each had commissions and each had to work his commission out. Paul said, I am persuaded. We must make room for that, having persuasions, and that is to be recognised in every one of us, so that there is a certain latitude left open for love to work in.
A.E.H. The great liberality and magnanimity of
{167}
a Christian's character comes out in @Romans 15:7, "Wherefore receive ye one another". That word really has a very peculiar meaning to it, suggesting being thrown back on the person who does it. It suggests what the system will do in receiving one who does not act just as I say he should act.
J.T. I think from this point on the epistle opens up in affording latitude in the Christian. So the salutations -- whom I salute; that sort of thing. It branches out to make room for the Source. So that it is said to have love in this epistle. I do not know that you find it just that way in any other epistle. The apostle speaks of the love of the Spirit in @Romans 15:30: "But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit", showing what a scope there is for us in this book; how much latitude there is opened up.
C.A.M. That is a very remarkable verse in the last chapter, @Romans 16:23: "Gaius, my host and of the whole assembly, salutes you. Erastus, the steward of the city, salutes you, and the brother Quartus". They are all in one verse, but apparently live in a wholly different sphere of things. They all have their individual place.
J.T. It is certainly fine to get into the realm of salutations to the brethren, because then you see who is who; who is worthy of it. All the saints in Rome are not saluted personally.
A.B.P. In a metropolis there would be a sort of polyglot condition, and would this be the basis on which grace would operate, as having learned grace? Being a metropolis such as it was, people of various nationalities would be there, but the environment would be different. Grace would operate in the presence of this. It is not exactly licence, but according to the enlightenment of the conscience; having a good conscience before God.
J.T. In what we are saying it is important to
{168}
bring up the matter of conscience, because God has given it a place of late years; what a place it has in relation to the claims of the government.
A.R. Would you explain to us the love of the Spirit? I have often wondered about this verse.
J.T. I thought it was remarkable that it should be found in Romans. We have the fellowship of the Spirit in Corinthians. I have not examined it carefully enough to say any more, but anyway it is found here in @Romans 15:30, "But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit". The idea is that you know that, because if he beseeches you by something, you are to know that something that he uses. For instance, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God", @Romans 12:1. You should know what he means, and if he speaks of the love of the Spirit you should know what he means; something we have realised in our meetings today.
A.P.T. The Colossians seemed to have it. The Colossians seemed to be able to move on this line.
A.R. That is love *in* the Spirit; this is love *of* the Spirit.
J.T. It is the personal love of the Spirit that I am speaking of now. Love in the Spirit is another thing.
A.P.T. Do you mean this is the Person Himself?
J.T. Just as if you were to say the Father's love or the Son's love; but the Spirit is out of sight generally, but Paul brings Him in here.
A.T.D. "The Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered", @Romans 8:26.
J.T. That is in Romans, too.
{169}
TEACHING AND ORDER IN ASSEMBLY ADMINISTRATION
@John 20:16 - 23; @Matthew 18:15 - 20
J.T. These passages teach us of assembly administration, and the first is particularly in mind as to teaching. As we know, the word 'assembly' is not used in the passage, but it is in it; it is contemplated, and the thought is that we might look at the teaching that leads up to the instruction in this chapter, at least in this passage. The word 'Rabboni' is the one Mary uses in replying to the Lord. He says to her, "Mary", in verse 16. It is thought that she represents the receptive element. The gospel really begins with the same thought. The two disciples who followed Jesus said to him, "Rabbi, where abidest thou?" @John 1:38. And it is thought that the teaching of the assembly, the instruction as to it is of prime importance at all times, but especially now, and John has this in mind. Not so much to occupy us with official terms but to accustom us to the circumstances of the assembly and the feminine side entering into it; the instruction coming in that connection through a feminine channel. The idea would be among other things that we should be softened in dealing with one another and get adjusted. For she needed adjustment, as did all the disciples at this time, but she represents ardent affection for Christ with certain dark thoughts, unintelligent thoughts, but she became adjusted. John undoubtedly is intended for this, for adjustment. So that she is addressed by her name, of course, which is Mary, but having a meaning somewhat involving suffering, leading to a feeling person. He called her Mary, which is to be noted, undoubtedly meaning that He had intended that her name should be there in this
{170}
particular person. "Jesus says to her, Mary. She, turning round, says to him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which means Teacher", @John 20:16. The two addresses, that is, the Lord's and hers, are of particular interest at this time.
C.A.M. Would you say that addressing the Lord as Teacher shows she had bowed to His lordship? Would that not be a primary thing?
J.T. I think it would show what was in her mind, for she was not heretofore particularly instructed. She is not characterised particularly as one who had received instruction. She is rather characterised by affection, and as one who had to do with evil. Out of her had been cast seven demons. They had gone out of her. She is taken up more with the Lord personally in the early part of the chapter. She was drawn to the Lord personally in affection but now she has this word that is somewhat unusual. She has this Name to use in responding to Him: Rabboni, and we are told what it means; that she has evidently come on to the light of teaching, of being instructed, which is an important matter especially for sisters, because sisters have a great deal to do with matters of administration. Not in a formal open way, but yet they have a great deal to do with what transpires, and what she had in her mind is very important, therefore, that we should have the teaching entering into these administrative matters.
A.A.T. Had Mary of Bethany received the teaching as she sat at the feet of the Lord?
J.T. That would be the idea with her, evidently at an earlier stage than we are treating here. She had laid hold according to Luke of what marked the moment. The Lord had been announced from heaven on the mount of Transfiguration by the Father as One to be heard. Heaven had announced that He was to be heard. That was the order of the day; as in a later day with Lydia; the Lord opened her
{171}
heart to attend to the things spoken by Paul. That is, as it were, another order of the day. Certain things are stressed as needed.
R.W.S. Suppositions may bring damage into the assembly. It says she supposed He was the gardener.
J.T. She was somewhat confused and dark, and it is humbling that there is so much talk in these administrative matters that is found with those who are not receiving adjustment. It is remarkable how many things are said in administrative matters that are not founded on fact. I believe that is the idea here; that that should not be. When she says, Rabboni, she has in her mind that she had been adjusted. Still, she needed more, because the Lord said to her, "Touch me not", @John 20:17.
A.N.W. Does she need, too, to be moved from her individualised position somewhat? I understood that Rabboni has the bearing of 'my Teacher', if I understand correctly, and she calls Him "my Lord". She is concerned about "my Lord". I thought it was perhaps a matter of moving from the individual position to His brethren.
J.T. Yes. The 'my' is undoubtedly there according to what we learn. And now it is the time for her to be used, and then that she should go to the brethren. They were in the Lord's mind. She was in the Lord's mind, too, particularly, for the moment, but now they were in His mind, and the message is to come through one who is evidently coming into instruction, freshly, and would surely convey that in what she might have to say to them. It says, "Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her", @John 20:18. She was not in the position of a teacher and yet she had seen the Lord. That is important, too; and that He had said these things to her, without, perhaps, implying that she quoted verbatim what He said. I would
{172}
think she put His words into her own words. It would not be a formal verbatim message. It says, "that he had said these things", not used these words, but said these things.
A.P.T. Does Chloe indicate feminine understanding of the position somewhat in Corinth? "For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of the house of Chloe, that there are strifes among you", @1 Corinthians 1:11. Does that indicate the feminine idea functioning in that meeting?
J.T. It would be in a similar way, similar condition; the house of Chloe; someone of her house. It would be informal, too, but still evidently carried in a very circumstantial way.
C.A.M. The Lord says "my brethren" in speaking to her. The Holy Spirit records that bringing the word was to the disciples. The disciples would involve we are learners, would it not?
J.T. Well, it would. You mean he does not call them apostles, in keeping with John's line. But the word would intimate that they were learners. They were disciples but they were his brethren.
C.A.M. I was impressed by what you said that He did not distinguish her as a teacher in speaking to her, but what she said would go with His own authority.
J.T. Yes. "That he had said these things", would clearly convey that she thought He was in authority; that He was a Teacher and He was her Teacher. She did not suggest that somebody else had something else. She did not suggest that in her message; that some other person had said something else. It was what He had said.
P.E. Was it weakness on the part of Peter and John that they were not at the tomb to receive this communication? They were at the tomb but they went home and Mary stayed.
{173}
J.T. That would show that they had already laid hold of what was there and the facts, but they were content to go home with the facts. They could stay at home and rehearse the facts. In Malachi it says, "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed it, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name. And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare", @Malachi 3:16,17. Peter and John, I would say, would be content with less than Mary had; with the thought of speaking often, rehearsing the thing together. They laid hold of the facts, I would think, because they had gone in and seen how the linen cloths lay, as if they learned by what they saw in the sepulchre, which is important, too, but certainly not so important as a communication directly from the Lord, which she had. She had looked into the sepulchre, too, but they had gone into it; one of them, and undoubtedly laid hold of the facts, so that they would on the way home, or as they got home, say, we are assured that He is risen. The facts show that. Where the linen cloths are lying and how they are lying would show there was no struggle at all. He could not be taken away in any clandestine way. The linen cloths were left just as they were when they were on His body, which was remarkable. And yet they did not get the communication from the Lord which she did get.
J.T.Jr. Is there some instruction in the fact that the angels say 'Woman'? The Lord says 'Woman' first; and then 'Mary'.
J.T. Well, I would think the feminine idea is stressed, but when He calls her by name, then she is on a higher level really. He calls His own sheep by name, not by such a classification as 'woman'; but still that would mean that the feminine thought is stressed, in such circumstances as that, which, as I
{174}
said, I believe, bears on John's way tending to the softening of our feelings.
A.I. Is that not seen in the Lord? According to this verse it says, "Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her". Is not seeing the Lord an important matter in relation to bearing testimony?
J.T. It certainly is. That is just the point in it. She is qualified to bear witness; she had seen Him.
C.A.M. Are you looking at Mary as an element among the saints rather than differentiating between brothers and sisters exactly? Would it be right to look at it as an element among the saints that is submissive to the Lord's will and impressionable, and in that way bears spiritual, feminine features?
J.T. Yes; and a clear witness; a competent witness. She had seen the Lord, she regards Him as a Teacher, and that she had been taught by Him, so that she is a competent witness, seeing the Lord qualifies her to be a witness, but then the fact that she is taught is further evidence that she is capable of witnessing the matter in hand, because nothing needs more teaching than having part in the assembly. We are told that angels desire to look into what goes on there, and if we deal with those matters we not only can say we saw the Lord, or she could say she saw the Lord, but she apprehended Him as a Teacher, meaning she had learned something immediately from Him, and that something would bear on the whole matter, because we are coming to assembly facts, and the very highest of them; namely, that they were to be entrusted with something. Whatever they forgave would be forgiven by the Lord. That was most important, because the Lord was entrusting them with something, leaving it with them -- what they should do.
J.T.Jr. It does not say the woman comes, but
{175}
Mary of Magdala; that is, the person of that place.
J.T. That enters into witness. She is identified. There were other Marys but there can be no question as to who this Mary was.
J.A.P. The two messengers that Joab sent to David about the death of Absalom showed that the man that was not adjusted did not give right testimony and the man that was right was suited to the message. Does that bear on what you say?
J.T. Just so. Ahimaaz wanted to run. He wanted to do it. He wanted to have part in the thing, and perhaps, more or less in a personal way, but he had to wait for the Cushite. David says, Turn aside and stand here. He just had to wait there. He was really put to shame in that he was not competent. The message was not suited to him, Joab said, but this news is perfectly suited to Mary. She is a suitable person to relate it. She does not relate it with any confusion at all.
A.P.T. In @2 Corinthians 13 it says, "In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every matter be established", @2 Corinthians 13:1. There is a note there that refers to the word 'matter': it means 'utterance'. I suppose that is what you have in mind: to hear. You are able to hear and report it correctly.
J.T. Yes; because in court witnesses are all examined and all challenged. They are challenged as to whether they are competent, and that is the idea, I think, here. She is competent to bear witness from various facts that are mentioned. She has been taught of the Lord and she has seen Him. She has already been told. She regards herself in that way. Now she has seen Him and has heard Him saying certain things and they were for the brethren. They are of the highest order of importance, because they are "my brethren". First He says to her, "Touch me not", meaning she is to be under restrictions, "I have not yet ascended to my Father; but
{176}
go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God". The message is of the highest order, and yet, as we were remarking, she does not intimate that she is giving it verbatim, but in the sense of things, for there is really more in it in that sense; more substance, the word 'things'.
J.S. Would the message, "Go to my brethren" involve His counterpart?
J.T. I do not know that the word 'brethren' goes that far. You are alluding to the assembly as His counterpart. John is not exactly using terms in that way. He is dealing with individuals. It is the brethren as so many persons; so many persons related to Him. You are in the middle of circumstances right through and now you feel you are in the midst of assembly circumstances of a feminine kind; but yet the term 'brethren' lifts them somewhat; 'My Father, and your Father' too. The whole matter is lifted up through these words, and yet she is great enough to carry them and speak of them, not as words but as things. That would mean they are substantial and capable of enlargement, of expansion, because the Father did come into it. "I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God". Whatever is to be deduced or worked out from what she said is substantial; it is very capable of being enlarged. But the words, the formal words, terms of the most exalted character are there, and they are to be carried into all the subsequent matters, that is, the matter of administration.
R.W.S. Does the official side involve more what is formal and ordered, but this side that you are bringing forward in Mary requires spiritual sensibilities, so that you understand there is more in the matter than appears on the surface?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. Things are
{177}
substantial. Words -- if we are to analyse them, we will have to go to the dictionary as to words, what comes out of the mouth. Words are formed in the mouth, the vocal powers; but things -- well, they are of another classification. Things are substantial and capable of enlargement, and there is more elasticity to them. They are less formal. Therefore, anything that comes up, we think of what may be put into this word 'things'.
C.A.M. It must be very great, because the expression 'all things' is used. We can see in a moment it is not the same as 'all words'.
J.T. Quite so.
T.W. The same expression is used in the end of Luke: "And as they were saying these things", @Luke 24: 36.
J.T. Quite so.
A.N.W. Would you say a word as to why what is done is so effective in bringing the disciples together from their homes to this one meeting place? Why is it so effective, with the exception of one at least?
J.T. Well, there is no doubt it is the same incident that our brother just now has alluded to in Luke. It is the same incident and another train of things comes up. It was a gathering time which would be in keeping with Luke's line of things, that the Lord had gone with them all the way and even submitted to their constraint, confirming what we have been saying as to things. He submitted to their constraint at Emmaus: "Abide with us", @Luke 24:29. He submits to that and goes in with them and then vanishes. Of course, a great deal occurs and a great deal that is unwritten occurs, and they would carry all the things in their hearts on the way back to Jerusalem. And when they came there and found the eleven and those that were with them, they were saying certain things: that the Lord was risen and had appeared to Simon, etc.
{178}
A.Pf. At the close of John he says, "This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his witness is true. And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written", @John 21:24,25.
J.T. That is good. The word 'things' is stressed. We can see how elastic they are. How much can be enlarged on in them. It is not a retailing of words, the creeds, but the truth of Christianity is set out in things, in persons; things connected with persons.
G.V.D. Would it be right to say that John's presentation is along moral lines? As you said, Mary, and then the disciples, were in a moral state that was suitable. Where they were would suggest what is moral.
J.T. Yes; where they were. It is not even called the upper room. The stress is laid on the importance of these persons. I think that is the way the Spirit of God uses John; the importance of these persons, that the Lord came where they were. For instance, suppose we wanted a meeting-room, referring again to assembly matters, because the procuring of a room or giving up of a room is an assembly matter, and these words would bear on that. Where are the brethren? Because we must be governed by where they are. So that it says, "When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first day of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst", @John 21:?. That is to say, they are where the disciples were. That must govern any matter, any physical side as to a room.
C.A.M. John's geography seems to depend on where the people are. Bethany was made up by certain persons.
J.T. We have the distance from Jerusalem to
{179}
Bethany mentioned, and the distance from Jerusalem to the mount of Olives is mentioned in @Acts 1. The disciples were at Bethany. There were particular ones there. And it aids and supports what we are saying about the importance of the disciples. That is, we are now in assembly circumstances, and we are not, of course, speaking of a room, but we are speaking of the disciples. We have passed on from Mary. She has done her service. It is said they were there. As we connect this passage with @Luke 24, there would be a sort of gathering principle going on, because Luke says that the Lord Jesus stood in the midst while they were speaking. He does not say they came. He does not say the Lord came. It would seem as if there is no question of His coming or how He came, but He is concerned about the disciples as gathered. John is not saying that. He is not saying anything about gathering, but Luke says they were gathered, and the Lord is concerned from that point of view; where we are gathered. Matthew stresses the word 'gathered' saying, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", @Matthew 18:20. Luke borders on that, because while they were saying the things He stood in the midst. But John says, He came and stood, making more of the persons; where the disciples were. The circumstances are now on a high level and what happens is to lead up to this matter of administration, because the idea is introduced in what is recorded. So He says, "Peace be to you". Certain things are said. "And having said this, he shewed to them his hands and his side. The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord. Jesus said therefore again to them, Peace be to you:" meaning that what is in hand, what is in the Lord's mind is important, and it is important, too, that they should be in the state to deal with the things, to make them concrete and useful. So that He proceeds
{180}
after the reference to peace saying, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you. And having said this, he breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit: whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". That is the finish. Thomas now comes in, but what is in mind mainly is these remarks which the Lord makes: that He had breathed into them and the other things, all tending to sober them and spiritualise them, make them spiritual and then to be inwardly affected by His breathing. "Receive the Holy Spirit", and then putting it on them to forgive. "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". Now, the passage in Matthew says, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven", @Matthew 18:18. It might be considered casually to be the same thing, but it is not the same thing. It is a question of binding and loosing, but the binding is put before the loosing, whereas this passage places the remission before the retention of sins. "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained".
C.A.M. It must be a very spiritual thing. The Holy Spirit is just mentioned. "Receive the Holy Spirit". The 'the' is really not there. That prefacing this statement would seem to indicate it is a very spiritual matter.
J.T. That is just what I was thinking. Exactly. It is a spiritual matter. We are in assembly circumstances; that is, the persons forming the assembly being in mind, and instead of the Lord waiting for the descent of the Holy Spirit, He breathes into them Himself immediately so as to bring about conditions which the instruction that He had in mind could enter into, and conclude, you might say. It was a
{181}
finished matter; the part of assembly administration that refers to forgiveness of sins or retention of sins, and it is left to the brethren to do one or the other.
C.E. Do we see the power connected with @Matthew 18 in the loosing and binding?
J.T. Yes; it is more formal and official.
A.N.W. Is it not abnormal for John to deal with administration? Is that fair to say?
J.T. I do not just know why you say that.
A.N.W. Well, I thought that administration stood in relation to church matters. I thought John's was not quite that line.
J.T. Oh, I think he deals with administration, only he deals with it in his own way, and I think this is an illustration of how he deals with things.
R.W.S. It is a great expression of confidence. There is no modification at all in the Lord's statement.
J.T. No. There is no suggestion that they should ask Him about it. It is just that the Lord intends to convey that He has confidence in them, and confidence in them in regard of forgiveness of sins or retention of sins. He raises no question, so to say. Whatever they do He accepts and confirms. "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". Notice, it is not 'they will be'. There will be no need for anything else. There is no need for any other action. The thing is settled by their decision.
J.H.E. Would Stephen be a good example of this? He said, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge", @Acts 7:60. He was full of the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Well, he was full of the Holy Spirit. Yes. The idea here is these are people that heaven is concerned about. The Lord is concerned about them. He came to where they were, and we are told the day. It was the first day of the week. That is another thing to notice, which is intended to affect assembly matters, and certain things are said as to what He
{182}
did. He showed them His hands and His side, and they were glad. They rejoiced. He said, "Peace be to you", twice, and then He speaks about sending them as the Father sent Him. "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you. And having said this, he breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit: whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". There is nothing more, intimating the thing is settled. It is settled by what they do in this matter of forgiveness or retention of sins. 'Remitting' is a well-known word. It is a final sort of word and settles the matter.
W.C.R. When does this remission take place in a formal way? Sins are retained in a general way in an assembly meeting of withdrawal, but in what formal way does this take place -- this remitting?
J.T. Well, other things enter into that, but the general position here is it is a question of what the disciples decide to do; whether they are free to remit matters as soon as they have been committed, or whether they decide to retain the sins that are committed.
D.P. Does this mandate extend beyond the apostle's time? Is it workable in this broken order in which our lot is cast?
J.T. Oh, yes. It is a love question. It is a question of what enters into Christianity, because we cannot go on, we cannot really go on in assembly order and service aside from the dealing with matters, matters of sins. These matters of sins have to be dealt with. It is not here a question of primary forgiveness, as it is called, because it is a question of persons who may have sinned and may be in the assembly themselves. Take the case of Ananias and Sapphira. Their sins were not forgiven; not in the sense of administration; whereas you may have a case where the sins can be forgiven. The Lord is
{183}
saying here, It is a question of your decision, and He is, of course, implying that He has left you down here to deal with these matters. You know the facts. At the same time He is trusting you with them, and He will accept your decision. Their decision would be final. There will be no need to bring it up again.
W.C.R. What is the basis for retention of sins?
J.T. That is a question of the state of the person. The disciples are supposed to know. For instance, John says about that in his epistle, "There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request", @1 John 5:16. It is a sin unto death. I do not say that you should ask. He does not say it should *not* be asked for, showing how elastic this thought is among us.
F.S.C. Does not the verse "whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted" imply we are apt not to remit? We remit and yet there is the danger of not actually doing it. One has felt that the brethren feel the thing afterwards even after it has been forgiven.
J.T. Maybe you would enlarge on your thought.
F.S.C. I was wondering whether some do not feel after they have been restored that they are not fully forgiven. They feel that the extent of what they have done is not fully forgiven them.
J.T. I see what you mean. I have often had to do with that sort of thing, but the Lord is saying here, I am leaving it with you; but you can see it is preceded by so much that they are rendered quite competent to judge right away whether the thing shall be forgiven or not.
A.I. Have you in mind in the thought of remitting and retaining, that the disciples would do things in accord with the mind of the Lord?
J.T. He assumes that they would do what He would do, because they are taught. The idea of teaching enters into the matter before we have these facts stated.
{184}
A.A.T. Is it not so that at Corinth they were very slow to bind and very slow to remit?
J.T. The second letter stresses that they should forgive him lest he should be swallowed up with over-much sorrow.
A.N.W. Are you suggesting that if the action is not flagrantly an error it should be received and accepted indisputably?
J.T. I would say that. We have to take account of what the thing may be. The Lord is making it plain that there are certain ones He has confidence in and He is leaving things with them, otherwise there could be nothing done on earth. Everything would have to be referred to heaven, whereas the divine thought is that Christianity is set up here with persons having a final word in settling things. There are such persons that the Lord can trust.
J.A.P. Are there gradations of sin, from what you say about John? He says there is a sin unto death and, therefore, are we to distinguish between sins?
J.T. Oh, well, we are. We read of persons worthy of few stripes and more stripes. And then John says in his epistle, "If any one sin, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous", @1 John 2:1. And "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness", @1 John 1:9. All these things enter into what we are saying.
A.N.W. Has it to be borne in mind that if it is necessary to retain sins, there is the possibility and probability that the sin may be remitted? There is the remission as well.
J.T. There is. The Lord surely is making much of remission because He mentions it first; and especially in the freshness of the Spirit's vigour in early days, one would think there would be a readiness to
{185}
confess sins and correspondingly a readiness to remit them.
A.T.D. The exalted nature of the teaching would have a bearing on the way things are administered.
J.T. Just so. The Lord is contemplating here the best possible instruction. These disciples have had the very best instruction and now He is adding to that. Mary is saying she has been instructed and that the Lord was her Instructor, and so is He the Instructor of all the disciples. Therefore, there ought to be a readiness to conform with what He would wish; therefore, he is thinking, clearly, of a hard situation that is difficult to overcome, but the freshness of the work of God in early days would suggest that there would be a readiness to judge sins, to confess them, and on the other hand a readiness on the part of the disciples to forgive them.
J.T.Jr. There is a remarkable reference in @2 Chronicles 15 in regard to conditions in Israel. "Now for a long while Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law", @2 Chronicles 15:3. Are not those three things connected with administration: the true God, the teaching priest and the law?
J.T. That is very important; whereas we have the teaching priest here with the Lord and we have one who recognises Him; that is, Mary. And now the disciples have a message through her which ought to help them further as to this matter of forgiveness, and, I believe, that is what is in mind: the conditions of forgiveness among the brethren. Are we ready to forgive?
A.B.P. Would you say that in the case of Ananias and Sapphira Peter seems to make a difference? He spoke to Ananias and when he concluded what he said, Ananias fell down and expired, but when Sapphira came in he asked her a question. If she had been honest and opened up to the matter, the
{186}
outcome may have been different. There seems to be the implication that Peter made a difference. Would that be right?
J.T. I would think that. She is given an opportunity to adjust herself, I would say, but conditions for forgiveness were not there. These two persons were in collusion. If they are not in collusion we must make allowance for that, but if there is collusion then it is more serious. But the Lord is contemplating here that there is a state, there is a readiness to forgive if forgiveness is warranted; if there is anything to warrant it.
R.W.S. The freshness that you allude to of the Holy Spirit would promote spiritual feeling instead of personal feelings, would it not? I was impressed with what you said about the freshness of the Holy Spirit. The very first words the Lord uses after breathing into them the Holy Spirit is in regard to remitting.
J.T. It looks as if that is the setting. The Spirit is just freshly given, not in any official way because the official was at Pentecost. The unofficial ways are usually softer and more immediate and there is more spiritual sentiment involved in them. You would think twice, you would hesitate before you would confirm that the thing was right.
A.P.T. You mentioned the first day of the week. Would that help in this matter? There is a danger of overlooking that the assembly really has its start there.
J.T. I think that is good to bring that up. It is the second time the first day of the week is used in this chapter, which is important. It is used in @1 Corinthians 16 also in regard of sentiment; that is, the collection; the collection on the first day of the week; as the Lord has prospered him, so let him put by on the first day of the week in view of the collection, that there may be no collections when I
{187}
come. The apostle, I think, means he does not wish apostolic authority to enter into this matter of a collection, and so in regard of forgiveness of sins. You are disposed to be liberal, as it were, for James says, "He that brings back a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins", @James 5:20. That is a liberal thought. There is such a thing as that, to be liberal in dealing with a soul if he has sinned. And again in Galatians it says, "Ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness", @Galatians 6:1. It is an important matter to get the persons right that do it.
A.P.T. Eutychus seems to have been helped on this line. He was in a pretty bad way apparently.
J.T. He was. He was looking out the window when he should have been listening to Paul. He did not do what the brethren were doing. And many young people are not listening to what has been said, and things are not too good with them. But still the government of God overtook Eutychus and Paul was ready to go down three stories to enfold him in his arms, and he says, His life is in him, @Acts 20:10. He is not dead, as if there would be recovery. And then they went up after the recovery and had a conversation and broke bread, too, and they brought the boy away, not a little comforted. That is what I would say is Christianity.
A.N.W. Whereas as regards Matthew is it not observable that the binding precedes the loosing immediately following the case of the man who does not listen to the assembly?
J.T. He is manifestly a hard man; a brother whom he has trespassed against speaks to him about it, and two or three besides speak to him about it, and they tell it to the assembly and he does not listen to the assembly. That is a hard case. That is for binding. "Let him be to thee as one of the
{188}
nations and a tax-gatherer". Some are bringing up a lot about this matter, about the time of shaking hands. There is nothing like that in Scripture; "let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer". That is to the person who is sinned against. Others may have to do with him, but as far as you are concerned, his case is settled.
A.T.D. What does that mean: "as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer"?
J.T. It is just a figure to show that he is not fit for fellowship at least as far as you are concerned, because that passage does not imply consummation of the matter. The consummation is what he is to you, and it is not because he has trespassed against you, but it is because he does not listen to the assembly, bringing out what the assembly is; that the Lord is saying to us, I am thinking of the assembly. "I speak as to Christ and as to the assembly", and we should be speaking of it and thinking of it, and if any matter comes up, let us see we do not ill-treat the assembly, treat it with contempt in any way.
A.T.D. The individual trespassed against would merge with the assembly if further action had to be taken.
J.T. It looks to me as if the Lord is thinking of the man who is sinned against. He is to be taught what to do. He knows what to do, and he should know what to do, but then if there is any contempt of the assembly, any disregard of it, the Lord does not like that. It is a greater matter to him than the forgiveness of the sinner. He has set the assembly here for Himself, to represent Himself, and if there is a case where the assembly can act and has ground for acting, they should act; and if they do not, they fail in the function belonging to the assembly.
J.A.P. Would you say that a man like Ahab who characteristically was wicked, heeded what Elijah said, because it says he humbled himself?
{189}
J.T. "Seest thou", says Jehovah. And he was a very wicked man really. But Jehovah says, "Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me?" @1 Kings 21:29. That is important. Make the most of it. There is much he should have done, but what he did has to be recognised.
S.M. I was thinking of that. It says he walked softly.
J.T. Just so. He walked softly before Jehovah. I think it brings out what heaven is in these matters. How liberal God is, and is ready to make allowance for everything. That is every good thing as Paul says to Philemon: "every good thing which is in us", @Philemon 1:6.
A.A.T. Is it not so that every case has to be handled with wisdom? I was thinking of Solomon. Immediately after David's death there were certain cases that had to be adjusted before the thing came to a climax in the temple. Shimei had special grace extended to him.
J.T. He had. And the point there as to Shimei was that he was guilty really of great contempt, but David put it on his son Solomon to see to him, which he did. But, at the same time, when David was returning it was a favourable time, and that is the point of the Lord here. It is a favourable time. It is an assembly time but it is a favourable time. It is a time for the manifestation of favour, of kindness and goodness toward all. So one of David's men says, "Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah's anointed?" @2 Samuel 19:21. True enough. But David says, "Do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?" That is the point. We have to recognise the function of the assembly and see to it that it has full scope. David says, I have full scope to act as king and I am acting as king and forgiving Shimei for the moment. Well, that is important.
{190}
So that we assert the Lord's authority in its direct application or working in the assembly.
T.E.H. I was thinking of Hosea in chapter 14, he outlines that the people had sinned and he says, "Take with you words", @Hosea 14:2. He outlined what they should say as if it was a favourable time to come back in.
F.S.C. Would this scripture imply that the Lord is present, whereas the one in John would imply He is absent?
J.T. Matthew really is more formal. Quite so; more official. The Lord is going to be absent; but Matthew is treating of the Lord being present. Quite so.
A.B.P. Does the procedure in @Matthew 18 include what we speak of as an assembly meeting? I have in mind verse 17.
J.T. I think so. The order is this matter of binding and loosing. I am just going to read it; the question of the binding on the earth and the loosing on the earth. Well now, that runs down to the end of verse 18. You are speaking of verse 17?
A.B.P. Yes. My inquiry is, does the procedure which is given through verse 17 include what we speak of as an assembly meeting?
J.T. I was just going to seek to get the order in which the whole matter is set. Verse 17 reads, "But if he will not listen to them, tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer. Verily I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven". That is a finished part of the instruction. It is a subdivision, as it were; finished. Then he says in verse 19, "Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them
{191}
from my Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together unto my name there am I in the midst of them". "Again I say to you", would mean, I would apprehend, that we have come down to another stage in the assembly's history I was only thinking that before the thing could be really answered we have to get this whole paragraph. That is, the 'again' in verse 19 contemplates another stage in assembly history, and that stage implies that we are not exactly in the pristine conditions of the assembly when there were many, but only a few If we are now dealing with a matter of this kind, it is brought down to two or three; "two of you", which is also to be noted, and then "two or three". That would, I understand, bring the matter down to our conditions where there is a scattering and a smallness and a divided condition, but yet there is the idea of "two of you"; and then the two or three gathered not simply two or three persons, but "two or three ... gathered together unto my name". The thing therefore, becomes varied with these conditions. There are two of the assembly; the Father hears them; and then there are two or three of the same gathered together unto the Lord's Name. The first relates to the Father and the second relates to the Lord. Therefore we can deal with matters of this kind and finalise them, too, on this principle.
A.B.P. But, if in taking matters up we look for a scripture that would guide us in the procedure in carrying through, do we consider this scripture through verse 17 of @Matthew 18 as the complete procedure, or do we have to go to @Acts 15 for a fuller outline of how things are done?
J.T. The passage up to verse 17 might be applied now. That is to say, up to the word 'again'. The truth is always the truth, and I think we would rightly proceed according to the early part of the passage in dealing with the trespass, for instance.
{192}
And then the question comes up as to whether we are really proved to be of the assembly in what we are doing, and whether we are gathered unto Him, unto the Lord. These are additional thoughts that must be clarified.
C.A.M. I think that is very helpful. There are two sections and they correspond with the light of Timothy and 2 Corinthians, put together. Would you agree with that?
J.T. I would indeed. Therefore, twenty-five years ago when the matter came up about withdrawing or putting away, it was remarked that someone said, Well, which shall we use? Shall we have 2 Timothy or @Matthew 18 or @1 Corinthians 5? Which applies today? Well, the reply was really at the time, Both apply. Both are Scripture and both have an application in the souls of the persons who are dealing with them; but in outward conditions and forms you want to be in accord with the time of humiliation within; the smallness of the times and the disjointed or dislocated conditions, so that you feel it is better to say, We withdraw. It is happier and more consistent than assuming to be acting as they did at the beginning.
A.A.T. In @2 Timothy 2:19, is that not assembly iniquity?
J.T. I would think so. You would not like to say absolutely that it was not any other, but I would think it is religious iniquity, ecclesiastical iniquity.
A.A.T. Why do we use that scripture when a brother is on a wrong course and has nothing to do with anything religious?
J.T. We cannot strictly say it does not refer to any other iniquity, because the word 'iniquity' is unqualified. "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", @2 Timothy 2:19. It is just the meaning of the word, whatever iniquity it is. We would be led to think, but not to insist on
{193}
it or assume that it is just so, but I would think ecclesiastical iniquity is in mind. The apostle is instructing Timothy as to that point. There was a great deal of it coming in at that particular time.
W.W.M. Do you think in @Matthew 18 that the Lord is stressing to everyone the confidence and authority that He has placed in the assembly?
J.T. That is the thing. The Lord is always jealous that the assembly should have its place. Just as David says, "Do not I know that I am this day king over Israel". This brother that was questioning him -- he was not thinking of that. David had been deposed from the throne but was now back on it. The Lord has a place in the assembly and that is the thing to keep before us: the authority that belongs to the assembly.
J.A.P. Do you mean that David's counsellors were trying to make the assembly a vehicle for their personal feelings?
J.T. Just so. That was just it.
{194}
THINGS THAT ARE DOUBLED
@Genesis 41:32; @Genesis 41:50 - 52
I have read just these brief passages on account of the references to double; double occurrences and double fruitfulness. I have selected Joseph to bring out the significance of the references to these words. They suggest or foreshadow or mark the history of Joseph. Other references in his history of a similar kind being available; and they point, as the sequel shows, to a man of affairs, a man of great things; things that could be doubled and, for that matter, tripled. We all know how the crops brought forth bountifully in handfuls in his day, so that he became great; prophetically announced, but he became great actually, and he marked the import of times in the history of the world; for, indeed, he was a world man; not a man of the world; far otherwise, but a man who had to do with the world and affected it very much for good. Indeed his name, the name he acquired, or rather which was conferred upon him implied according to the facts we have, "Saviour or sustainer of the life of the world", @Genesis 41:45. So that we have much scope for our subject involved in the word 'double'. I should insert here that as the world moved on after the deluge many things happened; it was a time of many things happening without any definiteness to them, although a few men regarded it in that light; a few, and outwardly unimportant, but really very important. They inaugurated certain things that were to be guides afterwards, and Joseph was among those men that had part in the history of the world in that sense. It was a provisional time in the history of the world, meaning that it was not ordered politically very particularly. Politics began to take form in it, but things were very irregular and
{195}
intended to be. Withal, those few that were especially noted, some of them called prophets, made impressions in the course of things, and these impressions were to grow and to last. Hence, all others, as it were, were lost in the general position. How many myriads there were, who can tell, but still certain things were being built up that were to continue and others were to come in and take part in them, and as I said, among these was Joseph coming out in Genesis as a youth; but marked off already, even then. Even in his infancy he began to make impressions just as John the baptist did before he was an infant, before he was born. That is how God works and, at the same time, He is not committing Himself to anything formally, but things are happening that He is taking note of and giving them place. They are to shine in the coming world.
And so, Joseph, as I said, is one of these and he comes into prominence in Egypt. His life really was spent, we may say, in Egypt. From the time he was a young man his life was spent in Egypt. He died when he was one hundred and ten years of age. He was a family man. God was working on those lines, taking note of family men, and Joseph came into note here. He came into note in the prison. Such was he, that adverse circumstances could not drown nor overwhelm nor cause him in any way to be out of the mind of God or out of the mind of the people of God, however few they were. He had buoyancy and spiritual persistency, so that his mark was made according to God. He nourished all the time. God made him to prosper throughout, we might say; even when he seemed to be in the most adverse circumstances he prospered. I need not reflect on that, that we are living in such times, and yet those who are of God are prospering. This chapter is a marked chapter from Joseph. Something occurs, not in ordinary people or an ordinary person, but
{196}
in the leading monarch, the leading man of the day. I think God is helping us to keep an eye on things and persons whom God is affecting even although they may not know Him, like Cyrus, because His people are to come before great men. That is His thought; not mean men but great men; great men in man's idea even.
And so, certain things happened; a certain thing indeed happened, and it brings out this word 'double' that I am speaking of. It was a remarkable occurrence. There were really two occurrences in the dream. It was a dream. There were no threats in regard to the non-revelation of it such as there were in later days in Daniel's time. Pharaoh was monarch and he takes a hint from an ordinary man in his house; the butler of his house. He says to him one day when this matter of Joseph came up, "I remember mine offences this day", @Genesis 41:9. He should have been reminded of Joseph every day really, for Joseph gave him a sign, an indication how he could recall or remind himself of Joseph, but he did not. He forgot him. But still this notable day in Pharaoh's history came and the butler was reminded of his faults. It is very wholesome when we are reminded of our faults if we have not been accustomed to remind ourselves of them and judge them before God and before the brethren, too. But he was reminded of his faults this very day, and he is ready to tell Pharaoh about Joseph. He was the man Pharaoh needed. Pharaoh sent for Joseph, so that the matter was brought out. What was it? It was a double matter, like the Lord's supper; a double matter, like many other things. There were two dreams really. He had an awaking in the middle of them which made them two; not two dreams at once, but one dream at a time; and Joseph explained to Pharaoh that the dream was one.
So that we are reminded of the importance of
{197}
reduction in these matters, especially in ministry. Instead of dividing up sometimes we have to contract, reduce, to get the point. And so Joseph tells Pharaoh that inasmuch as he had a double repetition of the dream, the meaning is that it is certain. That is to say, the interpretation is in the thing that happens. Pharaoh knew there was a repetition of it, a double repetition of it; he did know that, but he did not know the meaning of that. And that is what I am here tonight for, dear brethren, to seek to give some little understanding of things, and there are many things happening. Some of them are more than double, more than triple, but having only one significance, as if God would teach us to reduce and learn the thing well; not to spread out too much. So Joseph says, In that there was a double repetition of it, the meaning is that it is certain. "And as regards the double repetition of the dream to Pharaoh, it is that the thing is established by God, and God will hasten to do it", @Genesis 41:32. Great things are happening, as I need not say, and occasioning great interest and inquiry, but God can reduce them; make them one. The fact is directed or pointed at the brethren. We may be sure of that, however few we are, that they are the ones, and that these great matters -- however many they seem to be -- the dream is one. God is saying, I am thinking of you. There is, of course, ministry, but nevertheless, the dream that Pharaoh had, not what Joseph had, was one; and God had in His mind that it was one; just one, one idea. It is for us, dear brethren, to inquire, because the explanation of what seems widespread and far beyond human control even is really very small in God's mind. It is one matter. But then he says there was a double repetition and that was for you. That was what Pharaoh had to know, meaning that the thing was certain; that God was dealing in certainties, not in fancies nor imaginations.
{198}
God is dealing in certainties and these certainties all point to the Christian, to the believer, His own which are in the world. The world is dragging along in its own way, but something is going on in relation to some and it is just one matter; and that matter is to be determined by the facts and the occurrences, that is to say, of the dream. There were two dreams, as I said, but they were one. The dream was one. So it is that we shall find out -- there can be no doubt about that -- we shall find out that the dream is one; that God is going on with one thing and all is converging on that. Nothing can happen save as it affects that.
And so he says to Pharaoh, the double repetition means that the dream is one and that it is going to happen. It refers to seven fat and flourishing years and seven lean ones. It is a world matter. It is a world history, for God is not dealing with small things. He is dealing on a wide platform, and His people are on it or operating in it, and they are being affected. Whatever else may happen, they are being affected. They will stand when others have gone. So the dream was one and, as I said, Joseph's history is full of this thought, of double; because he is going to be in charge of the fruitfulness. The name of his second boy Ephraim was "double fruitfulness" and things are not left loosely with God. Administration is a great feature with God and He is going to have His administrators or administrator, and that administrator is going to have plenty on hand. So that we are to awake and see what is going on and see to it that we are not short; that the brethren are not short; at least, they should not be. God intends us to be doubly fruitful. You might say, I do not see much sign. That may be. I would readily admit that, but not altogether, because if there be not double in numbers, increase in numbers, there is increase in quality, and that is more important. And
{199}
I would urge every one, young people anyway, to see to quality. Those who are content with being in the right position outwardly are very apt to leave it or be taken out of it, snatched out of it. We want to be well off. God has the world under Him and He is using it. It is available to His people. Be where they may, God is seeing to it that they are not short. We should not be. This word 'double' is going to go down this line, the line of Joseph.
And so, when Jacob would send some of his sons the second time to Egypt, he says, Take a present to the man; a little so-and-so, a little so-and-so, but the very best. This was the lord of all Egypt and these were poor shepherds ostensibly, but they were to take a present to him. He says, you took some down before; take double money with you this time. They might have said of their father Jacob, He is ready to perish. That is what one said about him later on: a perishing Aramaean was our father and he came into Egypt with a few, @Deuteronomy 26:5. Well, they prospered enormously. The land was full of them. The devil did his best to minimise them, to reduce them, to drown them in the river -- the males. But no. And so it was that Jacob said, Take double money. They say, Well, we have not got much. But have you not? God has much. When Israel left Egypt they came out with great property. You say, Did they have any before? They did. Jacob said he had his wages changed ten times, but still he had something. Here he says to his sons, Take double money with you. I am not now suggesting that we should make much of our salaries, because there are big salaries going about and they are very tempting, but they do not make much of our spirituality. They will reduce our spirituality. But Jacob had passed that time. Joseph had been born in the meantime and the name of Joseph meant that God shall add; not diminish but add. And now Joseph is here.
{200}
But the meaning of Joseph's name did not refer to addition to him. It referred to Jacob. When he gave names to his own sons the effect referred to him, referred to Joseph. Double fruitfulness referred to Joseph, but, as I said, Joseph had come in and things were doubled in Jacob's history; not in Joseph's history. The point was Jacob would have things doubled to him and he did.
And so, dear brethren, as I said before, we get principles in these men beginning with Abraham particularly, even going back to such as Melchisedec, a mystic sort of man. The world does not give us much help as to what he means or who he was, but the Spirit of God does. And there was Noah. What a man he was! A man not of great property, but a man of great ability to do things. What your hand finds to do, do it with your might. That is Noah. But these men, as I said, made impressions, and above all Joseph -- this doubling-up of things. What a man of means he was; he was a man of affairs, he came in early, he came in one day; he came in at noon, meaning that he had great affairs; he had very little time, but he came in at noon. He wished to be with his brethren. The matter was a matter of the brethren. He saw Benjamin and his bowels were moved for him. He was a man of affection. That is the idea. That is the kind of thing that is going on in the world. These men are not many in themselves, but they have quality and they have affections. They are ready to waste even, if it be apparent that they are wasting, to let love have some scope. If a man should give all that he has it would be nothing. Love is everything. Without love I am nothing. These men that are going about now, strutting about this earth -- I am not wishing to speak disparagingly of them -- what does it mean? Seven thousand names of men were overthrown in one city. Seven thousand names;
{201}
that is, great people. They are destroyed in the destruction of the city. How many cities are being destroyed now. It is a very humbling thing to have to say, and a sorrowful thing, too, for our fellow-beings. But there it is. It is a remarkable thing, the destruction of cities and yet it is an era of cities, great cities, big cities, many of them, and now the destruction of them. And still they are there. They are there whom God has His eye on, and they have love. And may I say, double love? Is there any such thing amongst us as twice as much as we used to have? Well, there is the means of it, because in the book of Romans the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us. What a basis for love! If a man were to give all that he has for love, it would be utterly contemned. It is not acquired that way. Love is acquired by the Spirit. It is a scarce commodity outwardly, but still it is there and growing, more and more -- that is the thing -- double, anyway, like Job's cattle. He did not have a double number of sons and daughters, but he had a double number of cattle, sheep and the like. And so, I should like to be great as one who had something doubled; something that is of God that is doubled. There is room for it, you may be sure, and if we get the doubling of love we shall get the doubling of the size of the meeting. It is a question of the love, you may be sure. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13:35. That is how it is to be now. Love one for another. No party love. Partisanship is abominable to heaven, to God, and to Christ, and to the Spirit and to all true brethren; baneful. It is love amongst ourselves. Let it be doubled and tripled. There is a means of doing it. The basic thought is there in abundance, but it is the Spirit Himself that is the basis of it, but it is worked out in human hearts. You hardly ever get the love
{202}
of the Spirit mentioned. It is mentioned, and, of course, I am not saying that He is not God. He is. The Spirit of God is God, but He keeps Himself out of sight and He is telling us that He is making love; that His position is to promote love, and that promotion is in our own hearts, the hearts of Christians. He takes His abode up in our hearts, and it is to cause the love to grow, and that kind of love. Love amongst ourselves. And so, to show you how this matter of doubling happens, Ezekiel had to do with it. It was brought to his attention in a remarkable way. He describes to us in @Ezekiel 47 a river that flowed out from the house of God. It flowed eastward and it became a great river; a river that could not be passed over. It began very small, but it grew and it could not be passed over. He could not pass over it or swim over it. It cannot be passed over. That was a matter of light that he got; what you might call objective light about that river. How much he could have said about it! If he were asked to give an address about it, he could have done it well. But he had traversed the river from the ankles up, and he tells us it was a river that could not be passed over. Well, it doubled, and so he went on. He does not say much of what he saw, but he sees much apparently, as if it were a thing to be apprehended abstractly without the concrete thing. A river we will call it; a river that cannot be passed over. Plenty of water in it, but it seems to be more abstract in his mind, though he says, rivers to swim in. But he turned around. He was on this side. He turned around, and that is important. The brethren are running along on one line and doing well, making a little, but on the old line; on the line of old things, making money. There is nothing new in that at all. Jacob knew that, but he got turned around and saw things differently. I have often spoken about this before, but he looks this way; he turns around and
{203}
looks this way and there is a double river, another one, much greater than he thought it was. That is important. What a man Ezekiel was! What experience he had now and he tells us about the fruits that were there, and what the river was going to do, going to spread abroad. It is going to go east, he said; not going to the west. It is not like the Mississippi. It is going to the east. It is going to the Dead Sea. It is going to heal the waters. That is the kind of thing. It is a double one. So that you can see how we are getting larger inwardly on those lines; so as to many other things that I could speak of. We see an elder. Well, you say, what does that mean? I thought there were no elders now. But there are. Thank God there are. I see several of them here. And what are they doing? Where are they living? Well, I could tell about them too, where they live. Maybe the gathering is not growing where they live; maybe it is saturated. I am not accusing; I am mentioning facts. We do not want to reach saturation in anything. If the meeting is too large and unusable, divide it and make another. I am saying that by the way, for Paul speaks of elders that rule well. You say, Rule? We are living in a democratic country. Yes. But rule is the order. In spite of the democratic principles, rule is prevailing in this country. Thank God for that. I always thank God for that. It is prevailing now, too. God is not allowing a man to be taken out of His hands for that purpose. He has seen to it that the man He wants is going to stay, however long or short a time. God will have His way. But I am speaking now of an elder. Does he rule well? Paul says, If he does he is worthy of double honour.
So it is for us, dear brethren, if we want good meetings, healthy meetings, ordered meetings, meetings that can be doubled, let us have rule. Let us have this rule and if those who do it are doing it, let them have double honour. Do not be stinted in
{204}
the honour you pay to the brethren who are serving you well. Of course, not that they are saying that, but there is such a thing as getting degrees. Stephen got a degree. He purchased to himself a good degree. Men purchase honours by money, you know, get titles in certain countries, but that is not how it is to be reached at all. Stephen did not reach it that way. He purchased to himself a good degree as if there was not another -- as an individual man. There is not much made of Stephen as to what he did for the brethren; as to his gift, not much. But he represents individual Christianity in a certain sense, which is important. Christianity is never to be understood save in relation to its collective character, but still individual Christianity is a right thing, too. So Paul says, for instance, If you have faith, have it to yourself, @Romans 14:22. Now tell me what that means. You say, Well, I would be glad to tell the brethren I have faith, make it known to the brethren. But Paul says, If you have faith, have it to yourself. That is to be understood, that I can get on in a secret way to a certain point on my own account with God. Are there not Enochs today? Is the idea of Enoch given up? Not at all. A great servant of God that is often talked of amongst us, said, Rule will improve the world by one man. You say, Well, I want to get on with the brethren. Of course you do. So do I. But I want to do things for God. If there is nobody else to do it, I want to do what I can for God. So Stephen was like that. He purchased to himself. You say, Why does it not say with others? Scripture does not say that. He purchased to himself a good degree and much boldness in the faith.
Well, am I throwing things out in handfuls as if they did not exist? But they do exist. And it is for each of us to understand the Scripture, make use of it and grow in it and help others. And so it was with Stephen, as I said, he purchased to himself a
{205}
good degree and much boldness in the faith. So if there is an elder let him rule well. The idea of elders is usually that there are two or more. The appointments for eldership in Paul's day were in twos or more; appointing elders in every city; not an elder, but elders. But still, if one of them rules well, let him be worthy of double honour. So that we have something to notice -- what God is doing in the midst of this irregular, disordered, as we might say, troubled world. God is moving on quietly, systematically, I might say, too, with definiteness. He is reaching an end, and He is seeking to call us into it, every one of us; into what He is doing. "In quietness and confidence shall be your strength", @Isaiah 30:15. And so, if a man is ruling well, just one brother -- there may be several elders in the gathering, but he is ruling well, let him be worthy of double honour. I will not go on any further. I am somewhat irregular in what I am saying, but it is important. I hope all will take it to heart, that you will get into line with what Joseph inaugurated in this way. How well off he was! How he led in helping others. How he saved the world. He became the very sustainer of the world by the corn that grew through his means under God. May God bless the word!
{206}
THE WORD OF GOD AND THE PRIESTHOOD OF CHRIST
@Hebrews 4:1 - 16
J.T. The apostle and high priest of our profession having been touched in this section open up the way for the word of God and the priesthood of Christ. They go together. So that the subject for this reading would be the word of God and the priesthood of Christ; the word of God calling for hearkening, and the priesthood intended to help us in hearkening and in obedience. The two chapters so far, that is chapters 3 and 4, are one in this sense; it is the same subject only that @Hebrews 3 is more severe as to hearkening and its consequences. @Hebrews 4 is less severe and points out that we may be near to the accomplishment of an end and yet miss it. So that it is, "Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed of it". So that what is alluded to is more negative in chapter 4, for God would Himself feel that we should miss what is so infinitely important, namely the matter of entering into the divine rest; yet we may come short of it because of not hearkening to the word, not mixing it with faith. It is said, "Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed of it. For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard". Not being mixed with faith; so that the mind may become active in taking in the mind of God but void of faith, it fails.
A.B.P. Do you connect the ministry of the word with the apostleship of Christ?
{207}
J.T. That is what I thought, and the high priesthood is the support of those who are spoken to, so that they may not come short.
A.T.D. Is this rest a present thing?
J.T. It is, only what is stressed is that it remains. That is, it is open. It is still an open matter. The door is not closed. "There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God". And it is said that we who have believed do enter into it. There are some who do, and the question is how many and whether any might fail of it, so that, "If they shall enter into my rest", @Hebrews 4:3. That is a question which implies a negative, "although the works had been completed from the foundation of the world. For he has said somewhere of the seventh day thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works: and in this again, If they shall enter into my rest. Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it". The matter is dealt with very cautiously and skilfully, and yet firmly as to the possibility of missing a great opportunity in failing to hearken to the word, in failing in faith.
A.A.T. "The word of the report", @Hebrews 4:2 -- is that the report that the spies brought down?
J.T. That is right. It is the report that they brought down, because it was a true one. All of them fell in with that, with the report that the spies brought down. They are all in it, and now the fault is that some fail in not hearkening to the report.
A.I. Would this report that you are now speaking of connect with present ministry?
J.T. Yes; it is a question of what is ministered; what God is saying; we get help in referring to the historical reference in @Numbers 13. The twelve spies had been sent up by Moses and they brought down a true report, but presently someone came in and added something that seemed to deny or set aside the general report.
{208}
A.A.T. Is it not remarkable that that report came through ministry, through the spies, and not right through Moses?
J.T. They were really witnesses of the land. They were witnesses of what they reported. It was not a matter of mere hearing, something they heard. They saw; they brought down the grapes.
A.R. How do you link that thought up with the authority of Moses, or the authority of Christ as today?
J.T. The primary commission, for it was a commission of twelve men, was sent out by Moses and authority was attached to it. "Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed of it. For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard". It was mixed with faith in some but not generally.
Ques. Would refusing the report mean they refused Moses?
J.T. It really amounted to the authority of God, because that is what is in mind: the apostle and high priest of our profession who is Christ, and chapter 3 shows that the Speaker is God.
A.P.T. Does that mean it is not only what is said but who says it?
J.T. Just so. That is the point in this whole epistle. "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son", @Hebrews 1:1, or merely "in Son". That is God Himself speaking only in the character of Son, and that is what this chapter takes up.
A.N.W. It is not exactly the report, but the word of the report -- what God would convey in that report.
J.T. Just so, "the word of the report".
{209}
J.A.P. Is it interesting that there were two versions, but the Spirit of God calls the one that Caleb and Joshua gave "the report"? Would you say something about that?
J.T. That is a good point, too. The report is, it says, well-accredited, accredited by witnesses who saw the things that they reported. Therefore, the whole matter turns on the authority behind Christianity, for Christianity is in mind, but Christianity over against Judaism. Through Judaism was the attack. The word came through the report, but there were those who denied it, or if they did not deny it they did not mix it with faith.
T.E.H. Would the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews be a prince in that sense? Every one of the twelve that went up was a prince. I was wondering if the writer of the Hebrews would be like a prince in character.
J.T. Just so. The characteristic one would be Joshua whose name was changed to a name that indicated 'Jehovah, the Saviour'. That is, it is really our Saviour we are dealing with; the One who is speaking is our Saviour.
F.S.C. Would God taking hold of the seed of Abraham link the spiritual and the natural together?
J.T. Yes; it is to bring out the humanity of the Lord, and that His deity is not altered by it. The addition of His humanity does not alter His deity, because the beginning of chapter 3 says, "For *he* has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house. For every house is built by someone; but he who has built all things is God. And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after; but Christ, as Son over his house, whose house are we, if indeed we hold fast", @Hebrews 3:3 - 6. So that the point is that the Speaker is God and the Builder is
{210}
God. All that is to bring out what the Israelites were doing in refusing to hearken to the word, in failing to hearken. They were failing to enter into the rest of God, for that is what was involved. The rest was to be entered into, not on the ground of promise only but of hearkening to the word.
A.B.P. If authoritative ministry is given as bearing on a matter and there is uncertainty in relation to it after the ministry is given, is it a safe course to follow to obey the truth?
J.T. I would think that. It is a question of who the speaker is, and there can be no question, therefore, of what he says. What they are up against is what has been said and who says it, not simply the spies but the apostle here. The beginning of the section is on the apostleship of Christ, and therefore it is that the One who says it is pointed out as having built all things, and of course God did that. God did that and, therefore, God is the Speaker, hence, the serious responsibility of not hearkening. It is not simply refusing it but not hearkening.
A.B.P. The indication of lack of faith in those who heard the Lord in Nazareth is that they began to use human reasoning.
J.T. Quite so. We can well discern, in looking back on the history, what was involved in the way that Christianity was spurned in the early days and hence the entire rejection of the Jewish system, because that is what really happened after this epistle. The epistle implied the word and the One who spoke it; hence, there is no forgiveness in Hebrews. Sin is wilful.
C.A.M. It seems to be a very large matter, because in verse 4 it says in connection with God's rest on the seventh day, "from all his works". Faith seems to connect all that immense matter in the beginning that you alluded to in your prayer with these matters that we are speaking of now.
{211}
J.T. The linking up of that with the book of Exodus is significant, because it is a question of Moses, and the Lord makes the issue between the Jews and himself, and between them and Moses, identical. The Lord says, "But if ye do not believe *his* writings, how shall ye believe my words?" @John 5:47. That is, He links up His own authority, God's authority, with Moses, because it is a question of not only what is spoken but what is written.
C.A.M. It gives you a great sense of what a mighty thing this matter of faith is, to be able to link up these things spiritually, does it not?
J.T. It is a manifest fact here that "we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also". Notice, it is not simply information or history but glad tidings, as if God were to couch His thoughts in that way, make them attractive, fitting in with the evangelical feature of the inauguration of Christianity. It was a question of glad tidings. This section is not simply the glad tidings of our salvation. That is mentioned earlier in the epistle, but the glad tidings about heaven, by those who witnessed the thing.
J.A.P. Peter says, "Simon Peter, bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have received like precious faith", @2 Peter 1:1, and then later, "use diligence to make your calling and election sure", @2 Peter 1:10. Does that call for exercise on my part to be in the good of what Peter is saying about partaking of the divine nature?
J.T. Just so. He says in his first epistle that those who preached the glad tidings to you preached it by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven. The Lord Jesus preached it as come down from heaven, but the Spirit is seen as sent down from heaven. He says, "those who have declared to you the glad tidings by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven", @1 Peter 1:12. I think it directs us to the feelings of
{212}
God, the feelings He has, the tender feelings He has in making known His mind, that He couches it in glad tidings and in the preaching by authoritative persons by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven.
C.N. Could the assembly in any way be regarded as God's rest? I was thinking of the revelation to Peter, and the Lord saying on that account, "On this rock I will build my assembly, and hades gates shall not prevail against it", @Matthew 16:18. I just wondered if, in thinking of God's rest, the assembly could be looked at in a typical way.
J.T. The assembly is constituted in that way, as affording provisional shelter and conditions for the thoughts of God. What are hidden in the form of promise or purpose are now made provisional by the Spirit come down from heaven. The things are made provisionally available in the reality of them by the Spirit, for He is the earnest of the inheritance. The things are made substantially available in an order of things which we call the assembly. It is such, it is so constituted as to make available the promises and purposes of God in a tangible way to us. I think that is the way it works out -- the tangibility of the things that have been in promise or in purpose are now available to us in this institution called the assembly, because of what is said of it when the revelation was made to Peter, how intact it would be in carrying down these things in a provisional way until the time of the things being completed when the Lord comes.
C.N. So that the highest order of speaking would be expected from that vessel, would you say?
J.T. I think from the way it is presented to us in the epistles, the apostolic epistles, and again in Revelation we can see how trustworthy it is, just as the ark was of old; how trustworthy it was for the purpose for which it was made, to carry things through. So it is that the assembly may be depended upon to
{213}
carry things through in a tangible sense, in a provisional way until the time comes for the absolute fulfilment of them; for the rest of God is in heaven, of course, for us, but the thing is available to us while we are moving on to the light.
D.P. Is the entering into His rest a collective idea?
J.T. I think what we are speaking of is a collective idea. It is formed of the saints. It is important to bear in mind what they are, as typified in the material that formed the ark. It was made of acacia -- that kind of wood, reliable wood, for a certain purpose, but presently going on into an eternal state of things, because things changed. After the tabernacle we have another order of things, but the same idea, in Solomon's building. It represented the full or complete thing; Solomon's building contemplated the complete thing in type, whereas the tabernacle was a type of the durability, the lasting character of the thing, and how available and near it was brought to the saints.
C.A.M. Referring to what you said about the assembly and what we reach in the assembly, is it not remarkable that the first rest alluded to in the scriptures in the beginning of Genesis was reached when God brought in manhood? The rest in Numbers was the heavenly inheritance. Both these things are in the assembly, are they not?
J.T. The rest in Exodus is connected with God Himself being refreshed. It is connected with the refreshment of God. That adds to what we are saying, that the provisional state of things is said to be in the Spirit, because He is the earnest of the thing, the earnest of the inheritance. He is the earnest of everything, whether promise or purpose. He makes good everything, but there is added in Exodus to what is said in Genesis, that God was refreshed on the seventh day, which would point now to what is available for us provisionally, the
{214}
idea of refreshment; that there is refreshment, for instance, at a time like this; as we start in we are poor in a way and disjointed and we are really not fit to form an intact position. It takes time to merge so that the Spirit gets His place amongst us, and as He does the thing becomes fixed. It is a permanent thing provisionally. This all adds to what God is in His consideration for us, how He considers for us in the little while that enters into the passage from Egypt to Canaan. There is no time lost.
A.P.T. As they came out of Egypt, although they did come out in rank, there was the possibility that they carried a lot with them that God was not pleased with. That is the danger. One feels oneself the inability by not taking the word of God to allow it to cut off all that we should not bring with us, in order to have right function.
J.T. Quite so. Then as you say, they went out arrayed five in a rank. That is so much to the good, but it was only very little as against the conditions they had to meet, so that the time of passing through the Red Sea itself and what happened after that was always, as it were, settling in. There was so much to be contended with that needed to settle in. Then you have the great stress laid on keeping the commandments in @Exodus 15, and the statutes and judgments, and added to that what would tend to buoyancy and victory but all preliminary before we reach the final thought of organisation at Mount Sinai. We have to wait for certain things. Therefore, the twelve springs of water and the seventy palm trees added greatly in the settling-in condition. Then what follows after that is the manna coming down from heaven.
Rem. They encamped there near the water.
J.T. They did, but they went on after that. After the manna they went on and encamped in the wilderness of Sin that is before Sinai. They encamped there and the battle of Rephidim took place there;
{215}
that is to say, to make room for the Spirit. The Spirit was not yet fully recognised typically, but that battle seemed to settle it. God says, I am going to settle this matter of distraction. From generation to generation I will make war with Amalek. It is the settling-in that we are slow in forming in our meetings. We often wait for five or ten minutes and there is no need for it. There is the lack of settling-in and the enjoyment of assembly conditions is deferred to that extent.
T.E.H. Would the grace of the High Priest in that way aid us in our desires to be amenable to the word?
J.T. Just so. I think of the journey from Egypt to the Red Sea, before they reached the Red Sea and crossed it, and then after they crossed it -- the many things that took place there, particularly the twelve wells of water and the seventy palm trees. They encamped there. That was a place of settling-in comfortably and happily; so that we are together not under the rays of the sun which would tend to irritability and impatience. We are not settled in yet, because we have just left conditions that are not assembly conditions, and this settling down by the water, twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees, would imply refreshment and shelter, and the sense that we are gaining; we are not losing.
C.A.M. Otherwise we might miss the rest altogether if we did not come into the sense of that.
J.T. Just so. We have to come into it gradually, and hence the necessity of coming in time, settling-in in time so as to give opportunity to the Spirit to form, to settle in.
Rem. You referred in your prayer to "when the hour was come".
J.T. That hour had to await in the wilderness journey what was before Mount Sinai when the law was given, because we must come under law. We
{216}
must come under the thought of obedience; I mean, the thought of the law. Obedience must be there, and it takes time to come into it, because we come out of conditions that are not marked by obedience even in our households. There is very much contrary to obedience. All that militates against the provisional state of things that God has provided for us in the meantime before we get into Canaan. And now Paul or whoever wrote this epistle is saying there are some who did not enter in; that the time for entering in is still ahead, and properly the time for entering is now; it is still ahead, but the assembly affords the provisional time.
A.I. Have you in mind in any way to link up the thought of the rest of God with the first day of the week?
J.T. Quite so. We come into it. We that believe do enter; not *shall* enter but *do* enter. That is the provisional side. The thing is applicable, but as regards the actual final thought it is yet future. We who believe do enter into it; therefore, the first day of the week brings in authority, every week. But it takes time to come into it and I believe that is why the Lord is so prominent in the beginning; it is the Lord's supper, the Lord's day.
A.I. In that way, do we not need to come under the lordship of Christ during the six days?
J.T. We do. That is the fellowship. The fellowship implies that in chapter 5 of 1 Corinthians. The lordship of Christ is asserted there, "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth", @1 Corinthians 5:7,8. All that comes in before the Red Sea is crossed, the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth; therefore, the settling-in in Mount Sinai or Horeb is a fixed state of things and the ordering of the camp is there.
{217}
A.P.T. To follow that up, is the position after they left Egypt and also the truth here in Hebrews a crisis? Is that the idea? There is something hidden that if we do not get now we will lose it completely.
J.T. That is the idea. You come to the very point of it and you miss it. Israel had to be reminded of that constantly: to keep to the truth, and when they came to the time of the spies that was the test for them all. The test became so severe that God says. You are not going to go in at all. You are going to fall in the wilderness.
A.B.P. What is the force of this word 'mixed', being mixed with faith; not being received with faith but being mixed?
J.T. The idea of mixed constitutionally. Even in eating, the saliva, if one may be simple about it, is the same idea. It affords means of what happens down below after the eating. You have the jaw bones; they are for mastication, but then there is something after that. The stomach is another thing. The jaw bones and the stomach were to be the priests food. They were given to the priests because the priests had to lead in all these things. The people have to hear the law at their mouth; the maw and the jaw bones; the power of mastication and the power of digestion -- the power really of assimilation. The stomach is an organ of assimilation, so that the system absorbs and builds up itself in that way. That is what is so much needed.
A.N.W. Are there not two sides in that way in regard of the Spirit? He is given on the one hand but received on the other. God's word is from His side but receiving is on our side.
J.T. Just so; mixing it with faith. Paul gives credit to the Corinthians saying, "But I make known to you, brethren, the glad tidings which I announced to you, which also ye received, in which also ye stand,
{218}
by which also ye are saved (if ye hold fast the word which I announced to you as the glad tidings), unless indeed ye have believed in vain. For I delivered to you, in the first place, what also I had received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures", @1 Corinthians 15:1 - 3. They were set up rightly because they had received the thing -- as it were, taken it in and appropriated it in the sense of digestion. Therefore, if anything happened after that it became very serious.
A.B.P. Those who said, we will hear thee again on this matter, lost it.
J.T. Just so. How many take that attitude even in regard to what is ministered, not only through the gospel but what is ministered amongst us. That is what the writer is aiming at, that the thing should be received, mixed with faith.
F.S.C. Chapter 11 does not mention faith at all in the wilderness.
J.T. That is to show what the thing really means. It takes you all the way. It is faith in display. It is that grand thing called faith early here as seen in display in chapter 11. It is seen in display in persons who are glorifying it. The idea is glorified. It is hardly spoken of in the Old Testament at all. You only get it about once, but in the New Testament it is very much spoken of, because God is setting it up in display, the thing called faith.
D.P. Would the entering into rest here require soul history on our side?
J.T. Yes; it is a question of whether you do, because that is the idea. You are doing it, then you know something of what it means. How often we have noted the great recurrence of the word 'rest' in the hymns of Mr. Darby. "Rest of the saints above, Jerusalem of God", (`74:1). It is one who had entered into it on the way. It is the provisional side that is the test, because you have the thing really in the
{219}
earnest. You get it by the way. Hence, the arrangements of the week, I believe, are intended to furnish us with the thing itself, which God has for us every week; so that we can say we do enter in. It is not a matter of the mind or what we speak of at the readings, but we who do enter in.
J.A.P. In @Exodus 24:4 Moses rises early in the morning and sets up the altar and the twelve pillars. Should they be in our minds on the first day of the week? When we get up we should think of these things.
J.T. Just so; getting up early in the morning -- you always find it with great men. Perhaps we do not get up early enough on the Lord's day. Perhaps that is the trouble. It is very often 'a long lie and a tea-tray breakfast'. Somewhere they say something like that. That would mean we do not enter in; but it is we who do believe enter in; those who really do it. That is mixing the truth with faith.
T.E.H. Would David be a man who would help us in our apprehension of it? God had given him rest from all his enemies, and he went in and sat before the Lord.
J.T. Just so. That is where you get the greatest tributes in the way of title from David to God, at that particular time, when he went in and sat before Jehovah. He says, Thou art that God; there is no other, @2 Samuel 7:28. The New Testament says, "To us there is one God, the Father of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him", @1 Corinthians 8:6. It is when we get into that, you know, that we are able to speak freely and eloquently by the Spirit of the names of divine Persons. "No one, speaking in the power of the Spirit of God, says, Curse on Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", @1 Corinthians 12:3.
{220}
C.N. As regards the word "not being mixed with faith" there are a few verses in @Psalm 119. "Remember the word for thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. This is my comfort in mine affliction; for thy word hath quickened me. The proud have derided me beyond measure: I have not declined from thy law. I remembered thy judgments of old, O Jehovah, and have comforted myself. Burning indignation hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked who forsake thy law. Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. I have remembered thy name, O Jehovah, in the night, and have kept thy law. This I have had, because I have observed thy precepts", @Psalm 119:49 - 56. I just thought that this furnishes the ground according to Hebrews for entering in: believing the word. They did not enter in because of unbelief. Does that help?
J.T. Quite so. The distinction that has been made between chapter 3 and chapter 4 is suggestive in that sense, because chapter 3 is severity. You have such expressions as in verse 7, "Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts", @Hebrews 3:7,8. God is bringing up historical things that refer to severity and the terribleness of our disobedience. He is bringing up these things, but in chapter 4 it says, "Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed of it". That is, you are coming almost to the edge of it and you may miss it. You are coming down to a certain softness in His dealings with us and He is bringing in the priesthood at the end of the chapter to help us appropriate what He is saying. It is grace, I think. So that we are enjoined in @Hebrews 4:16, "Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help". Chapter 4 is a tender appeal to us and yet a
{221}
firmness of warning, because we may come to the very edge of the thing and miss it.
A.A.T. Holding fast the confession -- what is that?
J.T. That you do not let it go. I suppose the Jewish Christians were in danger of letting it go.
Rem. The word of God as seen in @Hebrews 4:12 -- is that to regulate us? "For the word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart".
J.T. It is like the cutting up of the offerings, the cutting up of the pieces of the offerings, bringing out the holy inwardness of them. Now the word of God affects us that way. That is intended. It is intended for it, to let it have its own way with us and the character of a two-edged sword for the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is a process which belongs to the flaying or slaughtering of the creature, the offering; so that the motives behind the thing are discerned, what motives are influencing us in the offerings.
Rem. You have to be transparent.
J.T. Quite so.
A.N.W. Would you say a word as to how far infirmity goes in the matter? The high priest is in relation to infirmity, whereas according to chapter 3 it is a wicked heart of unbelief which is not supported by the high priest.
J.T. I think that brings up much, first as to the word in verse 12, and then the high priest. "Let us therefore use diligence to enter into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word. For the word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the
{222}
thoughts and intents of the heart". All this would enter into a meeting like this, or a meeting for the gospel, or a meeting for ministry. It is all a question of the word, the action of the word, the word of God applied as we are ready to listen. And then the support we get from the Lord at the same time in verse 14: "Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession. For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart. Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help". It seems to me that chapter 4 is to lead us on in the ministry, or in such a time as the present to what God is saying; to lead us on in it and discern that God is gracious with us, and making things, as it were, easy for us if we accept the state of things that we discern by the word, and then the liberty to approach; that we are made sensible as the time goes on to the thought of approach. "Let us approach". God is looking for that. It is leading up to chapter 10 where we have the entrance into the holiest spoken of. This is really leading up to that. It is a question of the action of the word on us and the gracious support of the Lord Jesus. He is sympathetic with us so that we might draw near to God.
Ques. Why is it called the throne of grace?
J.T. Because it is what is needed as we have said already. It is the graciousness of God in dealing with us seeing we have come so near in the truth of Christianity. Why should we go back again to Judaism? Why should we do it? Therefore, he brings in the idea of grace. Really, we are on the same platform as we are in Romans. "Grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord", @Romans 5:21. Here it is not
{223}
eternal life but rather that we should be in the service of God and enter into God's rest.
T.E.H. These saints had been better off in earlier days. How do you account for their slipping back so far?
J.T. That is what the epistle was written for, and the severity of the words in it. They are very severe. We should see it in chapter 6. If we sin wilfully after we receive the knowledge of the truth there is no hope for us. God touches on severity. But in this chapter He is rather tender and speaking to us who have already heard the word of God and tasted of the good of the word of God: do not stop short of it. Go on to it. It is not far away. It is very near. That is the way of it, and it ought to appeal to all the young people lest you might slip away.
Ques. Is it something we might have recourse to?
J.T. The mercy of God is the greatest encouragement you can get, because God is compassionate with us. He is not bearing with our sins but He is bearing with our weaknesses.
A.A.T. It is right at the end of a meeting, whether it be a meeting such as this or a meeting for ministry, to turn to the Lord at the end of the meeting for priestly help.
J.T. Just so. Why should you miss it? The passage is saying that: you come to the very edge of it and yet you may miss it. Hence, you have the word 'slip' in @Hebrews 2:1: slip away. And here, the entering. Are you going to miss it? And so all the way through this remarkable book, the things that God has for us are just at our hands. Why should we miss them?
Ques. You say God takes account of our weaknesses here. Is that why the high priest is brought in?
J.T. That is what it says. "For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities". That is just what He is able to do, and He is
{224}
above all heavens. There is nothing beyond Him.
A.B.P. One was struck with what you said about the word; you were opening up about the mixing; the effect of the word as received as being mixed with faith seems to result in the dividing between the soul and spirit and joints and marrow, and the discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart. It seems as though it clarifies the whole situation. It removes the feelings that might be connected with the soul from the intelligent discernment of the spirit, and separates and makes clear what right thoughts should be instead of having thoughts regulated by intents and motives. Would that be right?
J.T. So that the word of God is like a big illuminant put inside of us. The doctors, of course, do that now and all these scientific men depend on light. They all use light on their foreheads. They get the benefit of it, but the whole area that is affected is illuminated. You can name the things that are there: soul and spirit, and joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents. Who can distinguish that -- the thoughts and intents of the heart?
W.W.M. There is an interesting verse in @Hebrews 6:9. It says, "But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus". Would that be to encourage them to come into the good of the thing?
J.T. That is just what the apostle is speaking of: how God is appealing to us after the severity of chapter 3. He is appealing to us in chapter 4 ending up with "let us approach". Why should you stay away? God is your best Friend. If you take the history of the wilderness, see what He was to Israel. If their clothes grew old they were still usable. The manna was there every morning. The shoes were there to tramp every step of the way. God did that. Think of the conditions or the elements that were
{225}
brought into play every day in Israel with all these two million of people to carry through. What elements were brought into action every day to supply those clothes and those shoes and that meat from heaven. That was God. God was operative all the time. There was no need of men doing much; no need of tailors, no need of shoemakers, no need of butchers. The food came down. There never was such a time in the history of the human race as men, women and children doing nothing and yet getting everything from God. God was doing that. That is the idea we are to get into in Hebrews, so that we have no excuse at all.
D.Macd. Does it not say that God nourished them?
J.T. Just so; for forty years.
T.E.H. They did not realise what it was for God to take over one-half million people out and feed them every day and care for all their needs.
J.T. Moses says we have not cattle enough for that. He challenged God as to what He said that He was going to give them meat, but God did give them meat.
A.P.T. It seems to me that faith enters into this subject a good deal. Chapter 11 says, "For he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who seek him out", @Hebrews 11:6. Possibly we do not do that.
C.A.M. A man's spirit itself would have a lot to do with it. It says it is the lamp of Jehovah; in connection with all this inward discerning, God knows everything that is going on inside of us.
J.T. Very good; the inner parts of the belly. All the inwards are spread out before you so that you can name them. It takes some of us a long time to name all these things, but we can name them by the word of God.
J.A.P. Does not the book of Esther expose the inwards of the persons such as Mordecai and Haman?
{226}
At the end of the book you see what marked them inwardly. For instance, Haman's secret motives in seeking to get rid of Mordecai all came to light at the end. These things will come to light, will they not?
J.T. The gallows he made for Mordecai were used for him. His motives were disclosed. Well, I think this epistle is to bring us back to the gospel, only it is the gospel of heaven rather than the gospel of the kingdom, because the first part of this epistle refers to the gospel of our salvation. But the gospel that is spoken of here is the gospel of heaven; what the spies spoke of; not what the apostle spoke of but what the spies spoke of. The spies are persons who have been to heaven. Paul speaks of having been to heaven himself. That is, of course, only a suggestion. It is by the Spirit that we get into heaven normally. "And see, the Spirit's power, Has ope'd the heav'nly door, Has brought us to that favoured hour, When toil shall all be o'er", (`74:5). If we have been brought there then we can speak of it.
Ques. In regard to what you were saying about God caring for us, is that seen in regard to the good Samaritan?
J.T. He brought everything the man needed. That is what we are talking about. God had everything: clothes and food for the two million people every day.
A.R. Why does Paul speak of Timothy being set at liberty at the end of the book?
J.T. That must be written for the young men of the present war and the last war. We are all missing them. We miss them at every meeting. We need them, because we need freshness in the meetings. Where the word of God is dealt with in the great Psalm called @Psalm 119, it begins with this, "Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his path? by taking heed according to thy word", @Psalm 119:9. That is the present
{227}
time, and I believe it is our Timothys that are in view, that the word now may be available to them as they come in from these conditions and join with us in the service -- join with us freely in it. I think that is what is meant. I remember myself twenty-five years ago, or more, when the dear brethren were relieved from the last war, we had a large meeting in Glasgow and I remember very well how it came home to us: "Know that our brother Timotheus is set at liberty". That came with the authority of Paul, the writer of this book. They were set at liberty, and many of them are shining today in the ministry, and we hope that many of our brethren who are now in the service will shine in the ministry. It is when they are set at liberty.
{228}
AUTHORITY, ADMINISTRATION AND DISCIPLESHIP
@Luke 22:14; @Matthew 26:20; @John 18:1
These scriptures are closely related. They are intended to teach us as to the Lord's service as here in the flesh, pointing to higher levels, namely, those that we have part in by the Spirit; that is, levels in which we are. The disciples of the Lord at the beginning are seen as associated with Him for typical purposes, first, as to authority, second, as to administration, and third, as to discipleship, or following. The Lord is seen in these three scriptures as associated with his disciples in these three relations. He calls His disciples to Him, "whom he would", it says in @Mark 3:13; He made His selection sovereignly for these purposes. He called whom He would, we are told in Mark, that He might send them forth to preach and heal diseases; but also now for these purposes already indicated: that is, to be first of all authoritative in their representation of the Lord. It may seem singular that He should begin with Luke, for his line of things would be more order and comeliness than authority. We might turn rather to Matthew for authority, but Luke is selected for that purpose, and doubtless because he was a man calculated to be gracious. Hence, the Lord selected him, known to be gracious and intended to be gracious, intended to be used to set out order and comeliness but so that the idea of authority should never be lost. And hence, the Lord Himself spoke with authority. That is said of Him, and it is said, too, that He gave His bondmen the authority. They were His bondmen and it might be thought that they should be just servile not only to the Lord but to others and make things common, which is often the case. It is not divinely intended
{229}
that divine things should ever be common or ordinary; they are not ordinary, they are extraordinary, and this extraordinary feature is intended to be enforced at times, not always but at times, by authority. Luke is selected for two great works. The first is his gospel, as we call it, this one that we have read from, and the second one is the book of Acts. He is the author of both. It is formally said by him that Acts is the second treatise; there is the first and the second one. The first one he said he had written to Theophilus. He had written that one so as to set out the order of the truth of the gospel as it came out in those that were not only with the Lord, but in those that were His companions or fellow-workers in the service. It pleased the Lord to associate certain ones with Him and Luke is among them. He wrote with method, which is important for us as students, but authority is more than that; it is more than method; authority is enforcement of the thing with power, and it is often very necessary.
And so this matter of apostleship is attached to the Lord's disciples. They are called in this passage I read the apostles. The word 'twelve' before it is possibly not in the original. The point is not administration; twelve is administration; but the word 'twelve' may be omitted in the original, and evidently in view of stressing the thought of authority. Twelve is administration, and the Lord is not intending to stress administration in this verse, but to stress authority. It is often necessary to do this when things happen that seem to deny it and to set it aside, to negate it. What was in mind was the Lord's supper, the Spirit knowing, or the Lord knowing well what controversy it would occasion. Nothing, perhaps, has occasioned more controversy as a scriptural subject than the truth of the Lord's supper, and what has to be used to enforce what is right is authority; and that was needed because of the much discussion
{230}
and much error, and I may add, alas, much blasphemy as attached to the Lord's supper; I mean attached to it by evil teaching, an evil system of teaching. One of them modernly is that the supper may be kept in a cupboard or in a box or in a desk so as to be handed around at will, carried to people's beds of sickness, which is a very dishonouring thing. I am just mentioning that on the way, and what is needed in regard of it is authority. There is no authority for anything like that. What is meant in that is that the saints would stay at home and expect the Lord's supper to be brought to them, which was never intended. It was never intended to be anywhere else than in the assembly. It belongs to the assembly, and if we stay away from the assembly we can never get it, and that shows how serious it is to stay away from it, to neglect the assembling of ourselves together.
Now, as I said, the matter of authority was undoubtedly in the Lord's mind. It is simply that the apostles were there. And then, where were they? What position? What posture? I am seeking to lead up to something expressed already today in the idea of settlement or grounding in the position and relation in which the saints are; that we should be not only there, but there at ease, and in comfort, so as to be free to use our minds, and if we are dealing with great matters we are able to take them in, to sit down to do it if necessary. One thing that comes to my mind is that the Lord Jesus according to @Mark 16:19, sat down at the right hand of God. He sat down. You say, Well, is He there doing nothing? No. That is not the point. The point is He is taking plenty of time in regard of the great matters that are in His hand. They are all attended to in this wonderful dispensation in which we are, for it is said that the heavens must receive Him, meaning that it is an imperative matter. The heavens are obliged to receive the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, until the time
{231}
of the restitution of all things. The book of Revelation tells us that when the dragon sought to destroy the little child that was born, the male son, the Lord Jesus -- when Satan sought to destroy Him He was caught up to God to His throne, meaning He was securely there. The dragon will never get there to touch Him. He is securely fixed there. He is not simply idle there. He is carrying on this very meeting we are in tonight. It is His business. The Lord makes it His business. The Father has loved Him; the Father loves the Son, He loves Him, not He *loved* Him, but He *loves* Him, and has given all things to be in His hand, and among the all things at the present time are these meetings of the saints, gospel meetings, too; meetings for the service of God, of course; meetings for the Lord's supper. All these are in the Lord's hands. And as I said, He was caught up to God and to His throne. We read of great personages now just meeting together in conclave, in military and political conclave, taking counsel together and they are well guarded. We are told specifically they are well guarded, which is the divine way. They should be; but how much more, beloved brethren, should the Lord Jesus be well guarded. When Judas and his band came to take Him, they all forsook Him and fled. That is very solemn. But He was able to guard Himself. His would-be captors went backward and fell to the ground. He had already said He could ask the Father and He would give Him legions of angels to look after Him, but He did not do it. He looked to the disciples, but they forsook Him and fled, sorrowful to say. And we are not to say we would not do it. We must not say that. If the disciples did it, let no one of us say we would not do it, because we would be just as capable of doing what they did, whatever it was, in that sense. So that the Lord is able to take care of Himself. When they all forsook Him and fled, the would-be
{232}
captors went backward and fell to the ground. They could do nothing. Thank God for that. We may be restful in regard of all such things.
And so, as I was saying, He was caught up to God and His throne; and heaven is presently to be aglow with military affairs, but not yet. Heaven is occupied with gospel affairs, with church affairs, assembly affairs, but they are great affairs, greatest of all. The greatest of all are assembly affairs and gospel affairs, and heaven is aglow with these. Heaven is in attention now to what we are saying, and other places, too, where there are like things going on. The Lord is in charge.
Well now, as I am saying, Luke is selected in this matter of authority and it links up with what we have been already remarking as to being settled. When we come to meetings like this we are often late. You will pardon me for alluding to commonplace things, for things are often alluded to and rightly. It seems that the brethren are very thick-skinned in regard to these matters. The brethren do the same again: come in late, and the meeting, of course, is delayed. I go to meetings every week and it is very rare that one sees a meeting open as it should be with order and precision, and hence the matter is put forward. The thought in mind is not reached in time. We read of the Lord loving the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. That means He has more enjoyment in the gates of Zion than He has in our houses. The gates of Zion are the most interesting gates in all the universe to God. There will I dwell, He says; I have loved it; I have desired it, @Psalm 87.
Well now, this matter of settlement is what I am aiming at; that is, of composure in settlement; to be what I should be in the abstract sense in the meeting. The meeting is in conclave; the assembly is in function. How can it be if a good proportion of it is on the way to it? It cannot be. It is simply
{233}
disorder, and hence the need of being settled. So Peter in his epistle urges that, that God would strengthen and establish and settle His people. That is, they should come to this; come to the idea of being settled in the thing, composed in the things of God. We have had today that Israel did not reach it until Sinai. God had to resort to His own authority. You get great things said and done at Sinai that you do not get before. God is impressing His people with His authority and with His dignity and with His greatness and with His grandeur. He says later, I am a great King, in the last book of the Old Testament, @Malachi 1:14, and that is to point out that people are reducing His things to commonplaceness, bringing lame things to God. Think of that! God says elsewhere, If I were hungry I would not tell you, @Psalm 50:12. He is so indignant at the treatment He receives at the hands of those who profess to love Him that He says, If I were hungry I would not tell you.
Well now, as I said, Luke is engaged with this matter of authority, and hence it is that the Lord is seen here at a time when He is going to institute His supper; when the hour was come, He placed Himself at table. That is in the order of Luke's way. The word 'placed' belongs to Luke's order. It is a matter of order, and then we are told that the apostles were with Him. What will Peter say if someone comes in late? He will say something, and all the others would say something. The apostles were with Him. Things are not being allowed to go for nothing, if they are irregular or disorderly. The apostles are with Him. The Lord saw to that. It was no accident. They did not straggle in later than the Lord did, you may be sure of that. There they were. The apostles were with Him; and obviously it was necessary in view of the centuries that have passed of irregularity and, as I said before, of blasphemy attached to this glorious and precious institution we call the Lord's
{234}
supper. Right down the ages, almost from the very beginning, with Corinth it says they did not behave themselves properly, so that Paul says, "Do ye despise the assembly of God?" @1 Corinthians 11:22. That is what they were doing. "Do ye despise the assembly of God?" They were eating and drinking, and you might say, carousing, drinking. That is what they did at Mount Sinai; or at least at the mountain; when Moses came down he heard Israel and they were singing. They sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play. That was a desecration in the presence of God. That is what they were doing. Well, you say, I am rather severe. What I am saying *is* severe. I do not want to be pretentious or arbitrary or unduly taking liberties, but in truth it is necessary to be severe for the Lord's sake in matters, and what I am saying requires that I should say these things. The apostles were there. The Lord saw that they were there. They were, as it were, His equipment for that moment. He was going to institute His supper and to introduce into it all that belongs to it in the sense of order and accuracy and regularity and the apostles were all there. That is the idea.
Now I leave that so as to go on to the next point, and that point is in the number twelve. They are the same persons. You might have expected that Matthew would have used that word 'apostles' in this position, but no; the Lord used Luke, as if the Lord would say, You may expect Matthew to say that, but I am not going to use Matthew for that point. I am going to use Matthew for another point, and the other point is administration, so that we know what to do. When matters arise, and they do arise constantly and unexpectedly, we fail in administration. We do not know what to do, and if we do not know what to do and are not restful, we shall do what we should not do. We are so prone to do what we should not do unless we are restful, so that the
{235}
thing is to be sure, to be restful and wait on God. Hence it was that Saul the king could not wait. Samuel had told him to do so-and-so, and so-and-so, and so-and-so, and Samuel says, I am going to meet you there, @1 Samuel 13:8. I will be there. There is no doubt about it, some may say, but Saul could not wait for that. He could not wait for Samuel. He says, I forced myself, @1 Samuel 13:12. What could he do? Could he keep the commandments of God by forcing himself? No, he could not. He did the very opposite. He lost the kingdom by it. You say, That is a very small matter. It is only an item you are talking about, but he lost the kingdom. That is no small matter. So that things that we do, we take on in times of stress and times of emergency. We can do this. Maybe you were among the Presbyterians. They do that. The Episcopalians do this, and presently we do that, or something like it.
Well, you see, Matthew says, Now be careful. You be careful what you are doing. I could name a lot of things that the brethren have done. Emergency has brought them up and they were prompted to do something, and they did something and they did wrong. That was what Saul did. God is God, you know. He says, I am a consuming fire. He is more than that, you know. He does not care about that title, I am sure. I mean to say, God prefers to deal otherwise. But we are in a confused world; we are in a dark Christianity and all kinds of things are being done at man's will, at the behest of man's thoughts and devices. And so Matthew is the administrative gospel, and he tells us in the chapter I have read in verse 21, "And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve". He sat down with the twelve. How often it is we suggest sitting down with the brethren: let us have a cup of tea together. Let us be comfortable. Well, that is quite all right. The Lord meant that here. He sat down. When

even was come He sat down with the twelve. One can understand how the Lord will sit down with us in heaven. He loves to have us sit by Him, and revert to old things, ancient things, to things that happened before, the happenings of love, always happy to talk about them. But when we are in the presence of administration and the order of the house of God, and the order of the assembly and what is to be done under these circumstances and other circumstances, then we have no time for mere talk. We should be restful. I believe it is the divine idea here in these positions that we are speaking of, that God has pleasure in us to be restful. He has pleasure in our company, but He has pleasure in us too, in our counsel. He speaks of taking sweet counsel with some, with the betrayer to be sure, but we may be sure that He loves to do it with His brethren; to take sweet counsel together. How many of us have proved it and I hope we shall prove it more, perhaps more than heretofore, for we are learning to prove God in our so-called care meetings, so that when the thing comes up -- well, what are we to do? Let somebody lead. God's way is to do that. A man who has the word of wisdom should be allowed to speak. If he has the word of wisdom let him speak. Let him have plenty of room to speak. Let him give advice. Hushai the friend of David gave good advice to David's enemies. The advice he gave meant their undoing. Often it is that Satan's work is undone by a good word of advice. It is not anybody talking; not that we should all not be there as brothers, but if a man has the word of wisdom, let him have room to speak to set out what he has in his mind. Even if he is not local he can do that, because the word of wisdom is a gift from the Spirit to be used anywhere, at any time to promote the interests of God. That is what belongs to Matthew. Matthew tells us that the Lord sat down when even was come with the twelve.
{237}
The wisdom of the universe was centred in them; it is centred now, too, where the Spirit is. There are those whom God has fitted to take counsel in regard of the greatest things and to reach conclusions, too, the conclusions of wisdom and love; so that the right thing is done and that thing is helpful. It is edifying; it is assuring; it settles us. I revert back to that word 'settle' because we need to be restful; to learn to be restful in the things of God, sit down together and be restful in them. God has in mind that He is to take us in. The word is, "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The place that thou, Jehovah, hast made thy dwelling", @Exodus 15:17. It is what God has made for Himself to dwell in. Wonderful! It is akin to Zion, but Zion is only a temporary matter in view of administration here on earth; but it is the place for God Himself to dwell in. That is the idea; the place which He has made for Himself to dwell in. What skill there must be in that dwelling, and then it adds, "The Sanctuary, Lord, that thy hands have prepared".
Well, you can see how important it is to learn these things, and Matthew would say the Lord has it in mind to teach us these things and to settle us in the provisional time, to place us where we are comfortable, where we are at ease in a spiritual way and where we can talk with liberty and with confidence and where we can understand each other and wish to do it, love to do it. It is the promotion of love, dear brethren, I am aiming at. The pressing for all these things that I am speaking of really has in view the promotion of the working of love which is to go into heaven and be in heaven forever and forever; for what we are going on with now in the provisional period is just working out things, showing how God can help His people who do things in spite of difficulties. Then it will not be in spite of difficulties. The
{238}
surroundings will all tend to promote and enhance what is being done, but today what is being done is surrounded by all that is antagonistic. The enemy would make the work as hard as possible. God is saying, I will help them to do it. The Lord says in Matthew, "And behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age", @Matthew 28:20. Not eternity, but to the completion of the age, while the difficulties last. That all enters into this word 'twelve'. He sat down with the twelve. Let you young people all think of this, when you think of going out on an evening to see some friend, to spend it with a person that will not do you any good. Think of this. Think of being with the twelve, the greatest persons in the universe, as I was saying, next to the Lord Jesus. They are administrators; they are intended to be. They know what to do when the emergency arises. They take time to do it, too. They do not rush. They sat down. That is the idea. He sat down with the twelve.
Well now, I go on to John. I, of course, wish to speak as John did, as the Lord would tell me to do in John. It is a question of the disciples. They are the persons who are characteristically learners from Jesus. The school is there; not the school of Tyrannus. That is scriptural, too; that enters into what I am saying, but I am speaking of John's school. The first disciples were disciples of John the baptist. That is to say, they had learned something. They were not raw recruits. They were already qualified for a grade above the ordinary, above number one. We get them in @Acts 19. There were there twelve men, we are told, and they really fit into what I have just been saying. They were twelve men, they were disciples of John. They had learned something; just as we do in the schools -- if you go from one school to another, well, what grade do you qualify for? Where have you been? What do you know?
{239}
Well, the disciples of John knew something. John knew something. John the baptist was an admirer of Christ. Many of the teachers of today are not; far otherwise. They speak terrible things against the Lord Jesus, discrediting Him. They discredit His words. They may tell you that the book of Jonah is a fable and the book of Genesis is a grand poem. They are lies and yet they teach them in the schools. It is most serious, and you young children are listening to them and you are apt to imbibe their thoughts. They are not lovers of Jesus, but you ought to be, and if you want to be one make much of John the baptist. If you have no other teacher than John the baptist, you will make the most of what you learn from him; so that the twelve men were disciples of John and they did not know that the Holy Spirit had come. Well, that is poor teaching, you know. Still, John did not undertake to tell them that the Holy Spirit had come, because He had not come in his day. The fact was that John was beheaded before the Lord Jesus properly entered on His service. Therefore, if the disciples of John did not know the Holy Spirit had come, that is just what you might expect and your class in the new school must be determined in that way. If you do not know about the Holy Spirit you will hardly be fit for more than the first class, the ABC class in Christianity, and you know there are a great many like that. It is really painful to hear the brethren talking sometimes -- what they say. But these men at Ephesus, there were twelve in number, and they said they did not even know that the Holy Spirit had come. Paul did not set them aside for that. He did not say, Stand aside; I want persons that I can put into the school of Tyrannus. He did not say that. There was a school at Ephesus, you know. It was a school where the master would demand the truth. They would not be satisfied with John's teaching, and hence it is
{240}
that Paul set to work immediately to teach them about the Spirit and he laid his hands on them and prayed for them. These are things to be noted. You say, This is not much. But it is much. And the lack of these things that you think are not much means you are ignorant of many things, and you are not supposed to be as a Christian. Paul says, "I speak as to intelligent persons", @1 Corinthians 10:15. I love to speak to people who know something. "I speak as to intelligent persons", he says; and again, "The Lord will give thee understanding". If you are defective, the Lord will tell you. Ask Him anything. He will tell you. But if there is a servant of His, maybe, and you can get to him, get to him. He will tell you. Ask him. That is how the Lord Jesus would speak now. He has His servants. He has gone up away beyond all the heavens to give gifts to men. He has done all that and has these gifts down here so that you should not be ignorant. That is their work, to teach the brethren.
Well now, as I said, John is a disciple. It is a very good word. The word 'apostle' is, of course, a very good word, too. That is Luke's word. The word 'twelve' is a very good one. That is Matthew's word, but the word John has here is 'disciple'. Luke's apostles were sitting with the Lord at the table. That was their honour. The twelve were sitting with the Lord, too, at even. They were going to have a meal, showing how privileged we all are in these circumstances and then John, well, what about him? He is in the garden. You say, garden? Is that Christianity? I do not think it is. I do not think a garden is characteristic of Christianity, but it was characteristic of the Lord to go into one occasionally. He was accustomed to go there. It had meaning in those days. It had a meaning in chapter 2 of the Old Testament. Jehovah Elohim went to that garden in the cool of the day. We have
{241}
to learn something -- link up the garden of Eden with the garden into which the Lord went. I do not say Gethsemane, because it does not appear here. It is not the place of sufferings here. It is the place of comfort, where He and His disciples often resorted, and they are there now. That is why I have read @John 18, so as to show how the idea of learning, of disciples, of learners, is seen as connected with the Lord in His ministry down here, in order to teach us now that we should be learners in the right sense and not simply content with being followers of the Lord or known to be believers, as we say; but that we be persons who learn from Him. He says Himself of His Father, "He wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the instructed", @Isaiah 50:4. That is the idea, and the apostles would learn that. They would know about it, and they would say, I would like to learn about that.
So it is that John in the first reference to teaching tells us that the learners, the disciples who had already been with John knew something, but they preferred Jesus to John. They left John and came and followed Jesus. They were followers, but they were learners and they call Him Rabbi. In the old country we used to always call the teacher the master. That was the word that was common in my time. The man who looked after the school was the master. That is what they called the Lord. John's disciples who followed Jesus called Him Rabbi, meaning He can teach them something; but it is not teaching they are after. They wanted to know where He dwelt. That fills out what I have already remarked. It is not only the particular thing in mind but the comfort, the ease, the restfulness, the settlement that belongs to the followers of divine Persons; so that we may know how to behave as there and be contributory as there. So they say to the Lord, @John 1:38, "Where abidest thou?" He says, "Come and see". How the Lord
{242}
appeals to us in these matters. If you want to know Me, I am worth knowing, but I am ready to be known at My best, and that is where I live. Why not? It is available to us. Where the brethren are is where the Lord is. "Behold, I am with you all the days". Well, John, He says, I will come to you; I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you. That is another beautiful touch, that there is a circle of people here on earth that the Lord comes to at times, regularly. I do not mean at any particular time, but He says, I am coming to you. It is an open matter, and I want to be there when He comes. I want to go there and hear that Man. "Never man spoke thus", @John 7:46. That is how the Spirit of God would teach us, that you are hearing Somebody that you never heard the like of before. That makes us what Christians ought to be. We learn how to speak by hearing Him. That is what John has in mind, so that the Spirit of God says, "Jesus, having said these things", @John 18:1, they are all put down for us; eighteen hundred or nineteen hundred years ago, and it is there for us to be talking about it tonight. The divine eye looked on to that, and these meetings are of extreme importance to heaven, because they are the making time of the heavenly family. These are the making times of the heavenly family and it is for us to lay hold of the opportunities and be in time. Do not miss them. It has pained me many times. I have been in New York for over fifty years and seen people coming and going, and coming and going, and more going than coming. It is very humbling to say that. People come and they like the meetings and like to listen to the word of God and are happy to be at your house, but off they go and they never come back. It is very humbling, because there is no real appreciation of the thing, the real thing that God is presenting to us by His Spirit, for the Spirit of God is verily here. The Spirit Himself is here to
{243}
teach us these things, and so, as I said, one is often humbled. They are coming and going and more going than coming, as I said; but these two came to the Lord and said, "Where abidest thou?" And they abode with Him that day, and we are told what hour it was. It was the tenth hour. It was John's time. I mean, the kind of time that he uses in his gospel. That is another thing to understand: what time or regulation by time may have been used in Matthew or Mark or Luke or John. It is for us to understand. It was the tenth hour. Do work out what hour that was according to our time today, this evening. You can work it out. That is all I had to say and I think, dear brethren, you will not fail to see there is a great deal in it. Especially now as to this matter of discipleship, which means not only that you are learning, but after school-time is over you go to where the Person is, your Teacher. You like Him; you like your Teacher; He is likeable. He is indeed. He is a divine Teacher. As we said, who speaks like Him? We may well say, who teaches like Him? None like Him. He is the great Teacher. "They shall be all taught of God", @John 6:45, and that means that Jesus teaches. He is the Teacher; He is the divine Teacher. He represents God; God the Father is in Him and He in the Father. May God bless these thoughts to us!
{244}
EXCELLENCE
@1 Corinthians 12:31; @Philippians 1:9
One is impressed, dear brethren, with the grace ministered to us from heaven at this time, so that we feel a little rich, not in any pretentious way, of course, through grace, but rich as according to our calling and according to our companionship, according to our heavenly relations. We have the sense of the Father, of whom every family in heaven and earth is named, having to say to us and working in us, so that there is a state of buoyancy and victory, which is becoming; becoming, however, in humility for the Lord resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.
Now I wish to speak of these verses having the word 'way' in mind and love as entering into it. You will all know that the word 'way' is used to indicate Christianity. It is said to be '*the* way' which would mean really that there is no other, no other of value. And then, too, it is called the way of God, which would mean that it is of a moral character as exhibiting the divine way; the way God is in as in revelation, the way He takes, what marks Him. This is of extreme importance, I need not say, and it is found, and we have already dealt with it today -- the way of God. Then there is the way of the Lord, which we have already noted, involving not simply a way but a military way, and we are enjoined to be in that, too; to know how to be good soldiers of Jesus Christ, and properly armed and equipped with suitable weapons, or at least a weapon, which is the sword of the Spirit. The sword of the Spirit is not simply a defensive sword; it is an aggressive one and, therefore, the word 'Lord' is rightly connected with it: the way of the Lord. And then we have also 'the way' which, as I have said, indicates that
{245}
there are no two ways spiritually; there is only one. We read of the Lord Jesus as here taking a certain way and that certain followed Him, and they followed Him in the way, as if there were no other.
Well now, these are all important suggestions and definitions and they lead us to what I have read in @1 Corinthians 12, namely, the more excellent way. The apostle says, "But desire earnestly the greater gifts", @1 Corinthians 12:31. That is, as having and rightly having desires to serve, we are entitled to desire gifts. Some have them. There is a very fair distribution, one may say by observation, of gifts among the brethren, and it is quite right and legal spiritually to desire them if we have not got them; not to make play toys out of them as, alas, the Corinthians were doing, but to use them with dignity. They are not greater than the persons who have them although they come from above. It is said that the Lord Jesus ascended and passed beyond all the heavens. Think of that elevation! And He has received gifts there. He has received them up there, received gifts, as the original of the old text would say, gifts in man, for men in man. The One who has received them is a Man Himself, and exercised them all and maintained them all; but He received them and has distributed them to men here below so as to use them. They are to be used, moderately and effectively, of course, but they are to be used in love. And the apostle in saying that proceeded to something: "yet". The word 'yet' would be somewhat suggestive that he wanted to say something else, and that there was something better, something to be coveted more, and it is to be shown and demonstrated how important it is. Hence he says, "a way of more surpassing excellence". Now that is what I would rest on for a moment. It is shown. The apostle is not saying he is giving it to the brethren. It is shown. He is showing it to the brethren, and it is for them to aspire to it if their
{246}
feet are not on it yet. Possibly some here have not got their feet on it. As soon as they get out of this hall they may place their feet elsewhere and, of course, one would rebuke that if one had the power to do it, because it is a difficult way, whereas here the apostle is saying that there is something that I can show you, and it is a way of surpassing excellence, which would plainly indicate that it has no rival. There is really no other. I am mentioning it now hoping it will become attractive to us and that we will get our feet into it. It is a way of more surpassing excellence.
Well now, that way is enlarged on. It is as if the apostle, having touched it, proceeds in chapter 13 to define it. Someone has called it the picture on the wall in this book, and we are not just content with pictures on the wall. We want the things that are spoken of, not pictures on the wall but pictured in Christians, pictured in those who value what is excellent. No picture on the wall is excellent; it is the person that is depicted that is excellent. The way can only be in the person who is depicted, and that is the next chapter. The apostle brings in the abstract in a very full way and he speaks of love, which is the thing he is talking about in chapter 12:31, "a way of more surpassing excellence". In having come to this point I am reminded of Philippians. That is my next epistle, the only one I have read from besides the epistle to the Corinthians, but the epistle to the Philippians suggests other epistles, that is, others like itself; and I would name Hebrews. You get the idea of excellence there. It is a delivering epistle. If I may be simple, it is a 'get-out' epistle. If you are in anything unworthy of you, Christian brother or sister, if you are in anything unworthy of you, whatever it may be, whether it be social or business or educational -- if it is unworthy of you the thing is to get out of it; and the epistle to the Hebrews is a 'get-out-of' epistle. A great many Christians
{247}
remained in what is called the Hebrew fellowship; that is, the Jewish situation in the early days of Christianity. It was unworthy of the name Christian. It had lost its right to it. God patiently waited on the Hebrew Christians at first, waited patiently on them and allowed His heavenly people and the apostles to go back to the temple, and they moved in relation to the temple for a while. God honoured them and supported them, but the day came when He led his servant Paul -- for undoubtedly Paul was the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews -- to write an epistle so as to unsettle the persons who really belonged to heaven, that they should get out of the Jewish or earthly and legal situation. It was unworthy of Christianity. That is really the whole point in the epistle to the Hebrews. And, hence, you have words denoting excellence by way of contrast. It is a great book of contrast and, dear brethren, if we are in any of those 'isms' that are too small for us, or that are unfit for us because of our heavenly calling, the thing is to move out, become unsettled. Let yourself become unsettled; not let others do it, but become unsettled by prayer and by reading the Scriptures, and companying with spiritual people and learning from them. Become unsettled. Do not stay there.
Well, I was saying that I was connecting Philippians with Hebrews, because Hebrews is so full just in that sense, full of contrast; some words denoting excellency brought by contrast over against what would defile them, so as to unsettle the persons who have read or who read the epistle to the Hebrews. Then I was thinking of Peter. He is a great person, a great writer, a great servant called an apostle for better things, for greater things. One of the most striking words he uses is the word 'precious'. He speaks of the precious blood of Christ, @1 Peter 1:19 -- and other things that are precious. And when he comes to his
{248}
second letter, for the first time in his ministry he refers to the sonship of Christ. Now, the sonship of Christ has acquired a peculiar place in the hearts of the brethren during recent years, and the thought of it grows amongst us -- the sonship of Christ. And Peter for the first time uses it in his ministry, a remarkable thing, although the sonship of the Lord Jesus was revealed to him by the Father. It was a revelation; not simply that he heard it from others. It was a revelation from the Father. And as we think, you would expect that he would say a lot about it but he does not. He does not speak of the sonship of Christ except, as I said, in the second letter when he was about to put off his tabernacle; and it looks as though the Spirit of God caused it to come into his soul in freshness and power in his second letter. And in that second letter he would seem to bring forward the excellency of spiritual ministry in which the idea of sonship has become exalted and extolled and magnified. John says in his gospel, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", @John 1:14. Let us think of that, as to whether we have ever sat down and contemplated the glory of Christ as Son. That is how John was impressed to speak of it. "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father". It is not the Son simply by Himself, but the Son as an only One; not with all the other sons, but that only Son, the supreme Son, the Lord Jesus, God Himself, but in the relation of a Son with a Father. That is how John speaks of Him. I was speaking of spiritual ministry -- how God has granted to us in our times such a ministry, away back for one hundred and fifty years nearly. We become accustomed to spiritual ministry. Earlier, of course, there was ministry; there was ministry from the time of the Reformation, remarkable ministry, and men were converted and women were
{249}
converted, and children were converted in thousands, thank God. Away back in the eighteenth century and the seventeenth century and sixteenth century they came in in thousands. God wrought in that way. In the German Reformation and in the Swiss Reformation and in the British Reformation and the Scandinavian Reformation and all the other reformations, the Spirit of God wrought in men; many with D.D. attached to them. They were below their dignity with such initials, but still God used them nevertheless. God uses what is available to Him, but later on we become accustomed to more spiritual ministry and that ministry involves the glory of the Son of God. It will not stop until the Son of God has His place, and I believe it came into Peter's mind before he put off his tabernacle that he would exalt the Son of God in his ministry. And alongside of that he makes a reference to the man who afforded the best ministry, the most spiritual ministry, and that was Paul, and he calls him a beloved brother. That word 'beloved' became very familiar in the years I have just alluded to when the word 'brethren' became elevated and used for communications between brethren. Dear brethren, that is an important thing, that our communications are couched with suitable expressions, expressions that refer to the dignity of the saints. There are no others as great as the saints of this dispensation, not even angels. And so Peter, before he put off his tabernacle says, 'our beloved brother Paul', and he likens his ministry to Scripture. Of course, it was Scripture and Peter's epistles are Scripture, but he speaks of Paul, a contemporary with himself, as a brother and implies that his ministry was as great as Scripture. He would exalt Paul. That is to say, he would exalt spiritual ministry and Paul was a representative of that in practice and habit. He represented the great idea of spiritual ministry and that ministry will exalt Christ supremely.
{250}
He will make Him supreme, and hence it is, as I said, that the glory of the Son of God and Paul were bound up together in the last epistle of Peter before he put off his tabernacle. Therefore, I venture to link up these epistles, that is, the epistle to the Philippians besides the epistle to Corinth -- not that it is characteristically linked up. The epistle to the Corinthians is a low-down epistle, so to speak, although having the highest truth, but, as I said, like pictures on the wall, because they were so low-down in their souls. They had not advanced, and the apostle is afraid of them. After a short time, on his leaving them, he has to write this epistle to them in order to save them and he uses the strongest language but yet the most gracious language; but it was to save them. It was in love. And now he is saying, I want to show you; he is not saying, I am going to write you about the more excellent way. I am going to show it to you and no one on earth could do it as well as Paul. If anyone wished to see it, they only needed to go about with him, and if anyone talked to him about the Corinthians, he would say, They are wonderful. That is what he would say; known and read of all men. The Corinthians acquired a reputation that no others had, because Paul spoke of them everywhere he went. He extolled them. Let us learn, dear brethren, to extol the saints; let us learn to love them. Think of raising questions of years back to discredit the saints. It is not our business to do that. Our business is to exalt the brethren, and they are to be exalted. They *are* exalted. They are the greatest of all the families of God. They have the heavenly calling; that is what Philippians tells us: "the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus", @Philippians 3:14. And that is why I have spoken at length as I have on this remarkable epistle of Paul to the Philippians. And then I have spoken of Peter's epistles, particularly the last one. I have spoken of the Hebrew epistle,
{251}
and I do not need to go further. Paul is dealing with divine inspirations and it becomes us to be very lowly and reverential and humble and simple in dealing with divine things so exalted, so precious and so holy.
And so I come back to my first scripture, and that is the more excellent way, and as I have been saying, it is the way of love. One is impressed to say that if we have not got love we are nothing. In the language of Paul here we are simply nothing, parading about knowing the saints and this, that and the other thing, and yet we have no love at all. He is saying in this whole chapter that if we have not got love we are nothing; not only are we naughty but we are nothing, and we do not want to be nothing. It is a question of relative quality and distinction, but to be nothing is to be nothing. If I am not converted and not redeemed and have not the Holy Spirit, I am simply nothing because I have not love. And so this chapter 13 is full of negative instruction, I might say, and it is, as I said, a picture on the wall when it should be in the saints; when every saint at Corinth should be marked by it the apostle simply has to put it down in writing. But then it is not simply that although he says I show it. If anyone wished to see it they would have to go around with Paul for a little while at least. Some did go around, and in some epistles it is mentioned that several persons moved about with him. Indeed, it is called 'Paul and his company', @Acts 13:13. Everyone in that company would have an opportunity of discovering what the way of love was. It was in Paul; that is where it was. It was there par excellence. Not that it was not in any others, but certainly not to a very great degree at Corinth, and now it is a question of each of us challenging himself as to whether he has the thing, that is, love; whether he has it. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if he have love amongst yourselves", @John 13:35; those people
{252}
you keep company with, that they have love. What kind of people do you keep company with? People who have not love? They are not fit for you. Renounce them; separate from them. It is where love is, "amongst yourselves". Therefore, I have to look about and see the persons I am keeping company with. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves". So that we seek their company. The brethren seek their company characteristically, and that is the reason they separate from others. "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", @2 Timothy 2:19. And then God says He is becoming their Father. "Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and touch not what is unclean, and I will receive you; and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty", @2 Corinthians 6:17,18. Is it not worth while? Come out from among them. You cannot carry love there. I mean to say, it may be in you but the unbeliever has not got it at all, and yet you are keeping company with them and heaven is looking on and you are not in the excellent way. That companion does not belong there, and you must leave him or her, because it is an excellent way. It is a way of surpassing excellence. Paul is the very servant who tells us to come out from among them and be separate, and that God will receive us. "And I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters". You may say, He is a business friend of mine, and I do not like to cut him off. But you can get along without him. He is not essential to your existence, nor even to your food and clothing. God can supply them. He supplied them in the wilderness. There were not any tailors in the wilderness, because none were needed. There were no clothes needed. Their clothes did not wear out. God did that; He can do
{253}
it yet, so that you do not need that companion who is not a Christian. Give him up and be with the good company, be with the company of heaven, the associates of Christ, the brethren of Christ. It is your privilege, and it is due to them and due to you to mark all these things.
And now I want to go on to Philippians just to enlarge on what I have said, because it is a matter of prayer. Paul prays in verse 9, "And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day, being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which is by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise", @Philippians 1:9 - 11. That is a prayer. Now notice, dear brethren, it is love he is talking about and love is to increase in all these characteristics; and he is praying about this. I have already pointed out he is not able to do that in the letter to Corinth. It was simply a picture on the wall although he said he would show it and did show it, but he could not pray about it like that at Corinth, the conditions did not warrant it. He had to take a rod, or at least the spirit of the rod in writing to them to correct them. But he did not have to do that in writing the epistle to the Philippians. And so as I said, it is love he is praying about in a certain sense. "And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day, being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which is by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise". Now in order to help further I will read the note on these verses. It is at the bottom of the page under the letter *h*. 'It is a question how far the abounding applies to the love itself; or,
{254}
supposing the love, that it should grow in these qualities. It is, I think, determined to be the latter by @Ephesians 1:8. It means "grow in these", yet love that would grow in them'. These remarks are important, because it is emphasising the matter of love, almost impersonating it; and, indeed, we sang a hymn here this evening which implied that. 'Love divine, all praise excelling'. It is as if the quality is personified, and in truth it is love in the sense in which God is love and Christ is love, and in which the Holy Spirit is love. 'Love divine, all praise excelling'. So that these verses are to the end that this great thought of love that the apostle wrote about as the more excellent way should be amplified in these Philippians. He prays about them, and I would advise everybody here to pray about them as to this matter of love and how it spreads out. We were speaking this afternoon of Christianity: how it carries in itself what sustains it and magnifies it and purifies it. It is a development. Through the Spirit of God in us things develop and spread out into glory. So it is that Aaron's rod budded. That is the way it is spoken of. That meant life operating in the rod. It was a bare stick or staff and it budded. Are not the saints liable to be like that? They are that. They bud and bloom and blossom and bear almonds. Buds indicate something further. That is the idea.
So, dear brethren, you see the possibilities of Christianity. There is nothing like it. There never has been and never will be. Christianity excels in every sense, and so love is the very basis of it, for God is love. Love is in God. I am not in any way deifying love. It is a quality just as wisdom is a quality, but at the same time it marks Christianity. It is a vital thing in Christians, and only in Christians. No one else has it. You say, That is not so, because we know very well that the idea of love is prevalent,
{255}
but is it? How has it become known? You search your books or your reading and see how love became known first. In whom was it seen first? "Hereby we have known love", @1 John 3:16. We have known it. How? Because Jesus laid down His life for us. That is how. That is Christianity. You cannot get it in any of the eastern religions. It is not there; nor in any religion except as we call Christianity a religion. We only get it in Christianity. It is in God. It is in Christ and the Holy Spirit. And, of course, I would not deny that the angels are marked by love. No doubt they are, but not as Christians are. Christians are like Christ; they are the working out of Christ, the amplification of Christ. That is the idea. So we have known it in Christ. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13:35. Not simply that you are a lover, but that you have it in a company that you love and who love you. It is a thing by itself in the Christian company, and you can see from what I have read how it works out. "And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge". Notice, it works out in persons who know. Paul says, he wanted the Ephesians to understand his knowledge of the mystery. That was because he loved at the bottom of it; basically he loved. How can one speak of the mystery of the assembly save as he loves God, and loves Christ, and loves the saints? That is the first thing, "that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge", not partial knowledge but full knowledge, "and all intelligence, that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day". Now you can see, dear brethren, that if you have the thing called love, it is going to enter into all these things, whether it be knowledge or intelligence or purity or completeness. It is a thing that is working itself out in all
{256}
these qualities. You can see how great it is. It is not a mere accidental thing that you find in a book and leave it there or carry it in your head. It is a growing thing and works out in all these beautiful branches in all persons, for it takes the whole assembly to see Christ coming out in all His glory. She is His body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all.
Now you can see, as I said, how love is to be nourished. Let it be nourished and it will work out in these beautiful features called intelligence or judgment or discernment or purity. There it is; nothing else but love basically in all these things. It is what I might say, the basic thing. If I might use a technical term the basis is love. It is the basis of everything. God is love. That does not mean that God is not other things; but He is that. God is love. What a great thing that is. God is light, too, but He is love. Love is unlimited; it is what God is infinitely. And here we are, dear brethren, a few of us here. There are thousands more in this country and in all countries, in so-called Christian countries, and the principle of love is there, and it is to be nourished. These beautiful branches are all spreading out and purifying the person and everybody around too. That is the idea. That is what Christianity is, and what I am saying, although very poorly, no doubt, but what I am saying is the kernel of things, and it points to each of us making much of the truth, of the ministry, what there is available to us, whether written or spoken, and then, too, the fellowship of the brethren, the company of the brethren, the companionship of the brethren, those with whom I live and move and have my being, so to speak. Where that is these beautiful things will develop and the apostle will have his result, as he says, "in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day", @Philippians 1:10. For it is a question of glory and shining in it; "being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness,
{257}
which is by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise", @Philippians 1:11.
Well, I thought I could not do better than to take up these two epistles tonight, linking on the others I have spoken of and enlarging a little on the wording of the verses read, so that each might settle down in the position, get into the setting of it, because there is the idea of setting, like the precious stones in the tabernacle. They were set as in the breastplate, for instance. We are all set, set according to God so as to shine in the position, and the shining is not a fixed thing. I mean to say, it is a development; it is an increase. I do not say that we grow on eternally, because that would make us a monstrosity. That would make us like God. God did not intend that ever. We are always in creature limitations, so that the apostle says, "the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God", @Ephesians 3:18,19. That is, we are always creatures, and the growing time is now, say sixty or seventy years for each of us or much less in many cases -- the growing time is very limited, and hence there is no time to be lost. We are to purchase the opportunities, buy up the opportunities so as to grow, not miss anything, that we should be full grown and be perfect and complete in all the will of God. You do not want to be undergrown. There are lots of them on earth, but God does not intend them to be in heaven. But then we must make allowance for what God can do in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. But at the same time, the obligation on each of us is to go in for these things and grow yet more and more, and it is to the end that we should be perfect and complete in all the will of God. May God bless the word to us.
{258}
THE BEGINNINGS OF THE WORK OF GOD AT EPHESUS
@Acts 18:18 - 28; @Acts 19:1 - 20
J.T. I was thinking of the work of God at Ephesus in its beginnings. The place that Ephesus has in the history of the testimony led to the thought of having it as a subject, as worthy of it, being, one may say, the very acme of Paul's ministry. It is important to have such circumstances in our mind as indicating the character of God's work, the character it takes on especially if there is anything in the nature of a beginning or an inauguration of the work of God at any time or at any place, because it bears certain features which are general. So there is here first of all the idea of links formed as the work proceeded. Hence, Aquila and Priscilla appear here as linking on with Corinth, increasing in their importance, these two persons; and then Apollos also having come from Alexandria, from Africa, forming a very important link in the work in Asia and later at Corinth. And then another feature here arising out of the work in its ordinary course of procedure is the idea of administration, of the work itself; not only what marked it inaugurally, but the work itself as it proceeded, affording administrative material in the twelve men that are spoken of at Ephesus.
R.W.S. So the personnel in a place whom God is using bear upon the place itself. Is that your thought -- what God will do in the place?
J.T. I thought so; what may afford the general principle to the end of the dispensation, or general principles, because the principles go through.
J.S. How would you link this on with the early church in Jerusalem? It was laid in the twelve, and this is not an independent work, is it?
J.T. I thought we would come to that. We may
{259}
see in these twelve men the idea of the continuance of administrative material always so necessary. The beginning of the work at Jerusalem, of course, was marked by the number twelve. It is said that they continued in the apostles teaching and fellowship. It is a question of the apostles, that kind of fellowship and teaching.
A.R. There would be a difference between the beginning of Acts and @Acts 18. I mean the twelve disciples in @Acts 2 and the twelve men here -- is it a higher level in that sense?
J.T. There is, no doubt, the suggestion of a higher level, because Paul came in through the upper quarters, we are told. No doubt, we are on higher ground morally at Ephesus than we are at Jerusalem.
C.A.M. Referring to Aquila and Priscilla, you were linking them with Corinth. They really came from Rome before that. Would that be a link between Rome and Corinth and Ephesus?
J.T. It would be in a personal sense, but whether they were really Christians when they were ordered to leave Rome is a question. They left because they were Jews; they were called Jews. I am not saying they were not, but it is just a question.
C.A.M. I can see that is an interesting point.
A.N.W. In choosing Aquila and Priscilla as the first persons to leave at Ephesus, is there any significance in the fact that he had been with them, all three working together as tent-makers? Is that instructive to us?
J.T. I think it is. They evidently lodged together, which is remarkable, and undoubtedly they came into the truth through Paul and have honourable mention throughout afterwards; so that they become characteristic links in that sense. As has been remarked, they came from Rome and earlier they came from the east, somewhere in Asia Minor, but as
{260}
Christians they are marked off at Corinth. Then they are at Ephesus and they are at Rome again afterwards. They had the assembly in their house, so that they become characteristic links, I think, and it is very suggestive and enjoyable to meet with brethren who are characteristic links among the brethren. They carry their status with them and increase in it.
C.A.M. Speaking of moving from one place to another, would you say that we might in our early days be somewhat victims of circumstances, but our later movements should be governed by the testimony?
J.T. I think this country and Canada -- those of us who are in fellowship, are largely classified in that sense. We are victims of circumstances. Certainly I was, although coming to this country and Canada for the fellowship. And so were you, I think. Many of us here may be classified in that way, and it is very encouraging that there is increase, increase in knowledge and increase in identification with the testimony. I think Aquila and Priscilla may be taken as typical.
G.V.D. It would seem that the movement in the beginning of chapter 18 was ordered governmentally. That is to say, the Jews had been ordered to leave Rome. Would you say God works things in that way in relation to the testimony?
J.T. Apparently He did. The use of the word 'governmental' is good because they did not leave for any monetary reasons or any advantage to themselves. It would be the opposition, I would think. So it is said, "finding a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by race", (verse 1). Notice that. Pontus would be in Asia Minor. The word 'race' is taken not from the fact that he was a Jew, but rather from his local position at Pontus. Then he had, "just come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome)", then it says Paul, "came to them, and because they were of the same trade abode with them, and wrought.
{261}
For they were tent-makers by trade". They are all governmental circumstances, and the trade and political position at Rome and the racial position at Pontus, and then the succeeding parts of their history bear all this out. They became definitely persons identified with the testimony.
A.N.W. It makes it very interesting when that governmental restriction at Rome was lifted that they should return there as assembly material for the place.
J.T. That is very nice. The restriction was lifted apparently, because they are back again without any restriction or difficulty.
R.W.S. Are you linking these two and others on with the work of God at Ephesus?
J.T. Just so. That is how the matter appears. After the Corinthian part of Paul's work is finished, at least this part of it, "Paul, having yet stayed there many days, took leave of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow; and he arrived at Ephesus, and left them there", @Acts 18:18,19. Then we get the appearance at Ephesus of Apollos, whose name is seen largely in connection with Corinth.
W.F.K. Would you say something about the vow that Paul took? Was that necessary to help in the work?
J.T. I should not think so. The vow might be right, but the shearing of his head would hardly be right. It was hardly necessary.
J.A.P. Why are there no households mentioned in Ephesus, such as we get at Philippi and Corinth? When Paul approached those cities he came to households.
J.T. I think what is prominent are these twelve men, as marking off what we are saying as to administrative necessities; the great necessity of administrative ability in view of the importance of the work at
{262}
Ephesus, and it arises now because there is so much need of this administrative ability amongst the brethren.
G.L. Is it a good promise for the locality that such as Aquila and Priscilla are moving there? Is it boding good?
J.T. You can see that, that they are not only persons who might entertain as they did, and persons who would suffer for others, because that is another thing about them: the ability or disposition to suffer for others; that is, Paul says of them later that they laid down their neck, "Salute Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus (who for my life staked their own neck; to whom not I only am thankful, but also all the assemblies of the nations), and the assembly at their house", @Romans 16:3,4. So that they become peculiarly advantageous to the testimony, especially the apostle himself, that they stake their own neck on his account. The assemblies all became their debtors. This is a very encouraging side of the subject: the assemblies become debtors to such persons, to these two persons.
A.B.P. Would their labours in any way contribute to this higher level which is brought in with Paul's return?
J.T. It would look as if that is so, because they are seen in connection with Apollos, and their work proved beneficial for it says, "For he with great force convinced the Jews publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ", @Acts 18:28. This was after the service rendered to him by Aquila and Priscilla. It is said, "And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to them and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly. And when he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples engaging them to receive him, who, being come, contributed much to those who believed through grace", @Acts 18:26,27. So that it would seem as if
{263}
Aquila's and Priscilla's work contributed to the perfecting of Apollos, and, of course, he contributed, as we are told here, to the saints. Therefore, I would think that they were already serving on this high level. It is not a Corinthian level; it is an Ephesian level really.
R.W.S. Was there some change in the minister, too? After having come into Jerusalem and having kept the feast, it says in verse 21, "I will return to you again, if God will: and he sailed away from Ephesus. And landing at Caesarea, and having gone up and saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch. And having stayed there some time, he went forth passing in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing all the disciples". I wondered if there was something in Paul himself, whether he used the Spirit of God to bring out the work of God at Ephesus, whether the Jerusalem side was really a hindrance at that time.
J.T. It would seem as if the general position is the extension of this idea of links. Jerusalem, of course, extended far east from these parts, but Paul's journey to it and elsewhere and then returning to Ephesus would seem to be the establishing of links. Indeed, it marked Paul's movements generally, the establishment of wholesome links amongst the gatherings.
A.R. Do you mean over against local independency?
J.T. Just so. It was important that the beginning of the work at Ephesus should link on generally because it was destined to be the leading work of Paul, and it was no accident that he just moved out from Corinth and Ephesus to go to Jerusalem, and from there as we read, "And landing at Caesarea, and having gone up and saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch. And having stayed there some time", (these words 'some time' would mean he
{264}
stayed long enough to establish what was needed in the sense of good influence linking on the work of God), "he went forth, passing in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing all the disciples".
C.A.M. Would you say that the reference to the words "feast at Jerusalem" in verse 21 was a sort of grace linking on what was there -- the spread of the testimony -- or would you think that was just a date?
J.T. He says, "I must by all means keep the coming feast at Jerusalem". That seems to be interpolated, but it is put in there as if it were so. Whether the appearance at that feast at that particular time had any reference to the vow he made and the shearing of his head, whether these were not Judaic touches, whether they really added to the position is a question; but in general he was establishing the saints.
C.A.M. I just wondered whether we should be right in thinking it was linking the Old Testament set-up of things in any way.
J.T. Just so; but you just wonder about the shearing of his head. The vow might fit in but it seems to be one of the things that happens in the blessed apostle's life that is just a little below par. He got into trouble in that same connection later.
A.R. In establishing the saints do you think he had in mind the making of a circuit, that Ephesus should be thinking the same thing as Corinth; the same principles should be working in every place?
J.T. That is just what I was thinking. He was establishing the disciples and he really made a circuit, as you say. He uses the very word only in an extended sense. He later went on to the Adriatic, he says; from Illyricum round about to Jerusalem he fully preached the gospel of Christ, and in that way established the saints by personal presence in the places, which is a most important thing in the furtherance of the work of God -- personal influence.
{265}
A.P.T. Would a good healthy household like Aquila and Priscilla contribute to the work of God?
J.T. That comes out. The link at Rome again shows that they were influential in that sense. There was an assembly in their house, which would mean there would be visitations to them. In fact you might think certain hospitality marked them in the way that Paul joined them at Corinth. They evidently resided in the same place. Undoubtedly Priscilla would be more or less hostess, and there is further evidence in the fact that they took Apollos; they took him to them. Aquila and his wife Priscilla took Apollos to them, which I would assume to be to their house or lodgings, so that they could speak freely to him.
A.N.W. I wondered whether that was why Priscilla takes precedence over Aquila in going with Paul from Corinth to Ephesus, but in dealing with Apollos Aquila takes precedence over Priscilla. She seems to be honoured; it says, "and with him Priscilla and Aquila", in @Acts 18:18. Is that saying too much?
J.T. I do not think so, because the facts show that the two names Aquila and Priscilla are equally used; something like six times equally used in the reference to them by the Spirit. It is a remarkable thing that the wife should take as much precedence as the husband. It would seem that the Spirit of God is telling us that a wife may arrive through exercise to a level with her husband.
A.R. Like the Song of Solomon -- is that the idea? You do not know who is doing the work or who is speaking sometimes.
J.T. Just so; the feminine and masculine speakers are not always clearly distinguished.
W.F.K. Had Apollos been under poor teaching and needed this instruction like many Christians today?
{266}
J.T. That leads to the whole matter coming up. Apollos had the same teaching as the twelve men at Ephesus, but Apollos made much more headway than they did, and that is a matter that may come before us for profit. Some learn quickly and others are slow. Apollos evidently had kept pace with the truth save that he needed adjustment, whereas the twelve did not keep pace with the truth. The truth of the Holy Spirit had been current for many years before then, and yet they say in chapter 19, "We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come", @Acts 19:2. That shows very great carelessness or neglect, because the truth was long current and the Spirit of God was speaking of Himself in the ministry for a long time, and John the baptist himself had made a point of it that the Holy Spirit came upon the Lord Jesus as He was baptised, and that He was the One that should baptise with the Holy Spirit. Why did they miss that important point in their education?
E.H. Both in the first visit and the second, the word 'reasoning' is used by the apostle; not preaching but reasoning. Would that be indicative of the kind of soil that was there? "But entering himself into the synagogue he reasoned with the Jews", @Acts 18:19. "But when some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he left them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus", @Acts 19:9. Would that be indicative of the kind of soil the apostle had to deal with?
J.T. I would think so, bearing on Ephesus particularly, that the mind has a great place in the ministry: the idea of reasoning and the mind being recognised, not in any bad sense, but the reason of the mind just. The mind is taxed in the education.
A.R. You spoke about Apollos learning quickly and the twelve learning slowly. Why is it we are so slow now?
{267}
J.T. That is a good question. You can see that here in these two cases that are given and it is rather important that they are breaking away from an inaugurated position, a position having a status at one time; that is, John's baptism. It had a place at one time, and these two sets of persons, that is to say, Apollos and the twelve men, as the facts show, through Paul's ministry, Aquila and Priscilla included, broke away from an inaugurated position spiritually. They broke away from it. That marks the present time. So many have had to break away from positions that are not fully warranted scripturally, and the question is whether they learn after they break away; whether they sever themselves fully from the position once held. It would seem as if Apollos made a clean break because he knew only, we are told, the baptism of John, but he was very remarkable in his education. It is said, "But a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by race" (the meaning of the word 'race' there being the same as that mentioned in Aquila's history) "an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures, arrived at Ephesus. He was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in his spirit, he spoke and taught exactly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to them and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly", @Acts 18:24 - 26. It is clear that he had made much more headway in the truth than the twelve men had, and so we have to take him as a methodical and quick learner, ready to take in the truth as it came to him.
W.F.K. Would the eloquence be gift?
J.T. It was ability, anyway.
C.A.M. Would you say the knowledge of the Scriptures was greatly in his favour?
J.T. Certainly. The point I am making, and I
{268}
think the brethren should pay attention to it, no doubt you are, too, is that we break away from what we have been in definitely for something better, and proceed in that something better, so that we acquire a place in the real testimony of God. That is a most important tiling, to get brothers like that. Whereas although the twelve men learned quickly as they came into touch with Paul (Apollos did not come into touch with Paul at first, but these twelve men did come into touch with him at first) it says after they say they did not hear about the Holy Spirit, the apostle says to them, "To what then were ye baptised? And they said, To the baptism of John. And Paul said, John indeed baptised with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him that was coming after him, that is, on Jesus. And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus. And Paul having laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied", @Acts 19:3 - 6. They have learned quickly now evidently under Paul's influence and energy, whereas Apollos did not have that advantage.
R.W.S. Would he have had the Spirit before, do you apprehend?
J.T. I think so; I think the case is just left as the eunuch's case is left without mention. He is not said to have received the Spirit neither is Apollos said to have received the Spirit, but we have to learn by inference. The Scriptures contemplate that, to learn from circumstances and inference, and I believe both Apollos and the eunuch had the Spirit, otherwise they could not have acquired the position they had in the testimony.
G.V.D. Speaking about quick learners, it is encouraging to have that kind of material added to us, taking on the truth of household baptism, for instance.
{269}
J.T. I am glad you bring that up because household baptism was put on the shelf fifty years ago. Most of the leading brothers put it on the shelf and refused it and suffered accordingly, most of them; whereas the Lord has broken through and the Spirit of God has led the brethren generally to that point, because Paul's doctrine requires household baptism. I do not think the brethren will get on with Paul's ministry unless they acknowledge the household. Therefore, slowness of learning is a great detriment and we might as well be aware of that fact. If we are missing some particular point of the truth that ought to be learned, we are sure to suffer.
A.N.W. We should not let our minds be disturbed by people injecting what they call infant baptism into it. It is household baptism.
J.T. That is right. It is not infant baptism at all that is being advanced; it is household baptism. It is not that infants are of importance, although they are said to be holy -- the infants of Christians -- but it is the household. The influence is not in the babe, the influence is in the parents; the forming influence is in the parents.
A.A.T. Is your thought that the twelve made faster progress after they broke away from the synagogue?
J.T. I think they did. I would attribute that to the extraordinary energy of the apostle Paul, the way he was used.
Rem. The jailer at Philippi gave a good lead in household baptism.
J.T. He did. Very good. He was baptised that same night; but then he had a good lead in Lydia. She also opened her house. She had her household baptised. The Lord opened her heart before, though. All these show how the work of God progresses, especially when there is anyone of special energy in the service like Paul. You can see these twelve men
{270}
made more rapid headway even than Apollos did.
A.I. What would you suggest about the apostle laying his hands on them before the Spirit came upon them?
J.T. That brings out what Paul was, as we were saying; how God furnishes persons who can be not only links but in a special way to impress other people, so as to make them vessels as he was in measure. And so it was that a woman of Samaria, for instance, came under the Lord's influence, the greatest possible influence, and she left her waterpot. He did not suggest to her to do that, but she did; she, "left her waterpot and went away into the city, and says to the men, Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?" @John 4:28,29. That is to say, she became part of the divine system of service. That all illustrates what we are saying: the importance of learning quickly and proceeding in it.
A.I. In relation to this high level you were speaking of, do you regard Apollos as a man who was effective in it?
J.T. That is what we said a moment ago. He was effective in it; almost on a level with the apostle, you might say. "I have planted; Apollos watered", @1 Corinthians 3:6. That is how quickly he got into prominence in the divine system of service.
T.W. Would you say something more about the comparison between this and the administrative position at Jerusalem despite the fact that the apostles were there?
J.T. The apostles were there first and worked well. You have perhaps greater work in those men than any twelve men afterwards, but it is striking that the first subjects of Paul's ministry became administrative. They became administrative, you might say, at once, because it is said, "And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of
{271}
the Lord Jesus. And Paul having laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied". They became effective in the ministry immediately.
F.S.C. I was wondering if the teaching had not been as much at fault as the hearing.
J.T. I think that is a good point. That is what they said. "We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come". Well, it is just remarkable that they did not.
W.W.M. It says, "And when they heard that".
J.T. It is the point of what Paul is in the ministry. So with Lydia -- the Lord opened her heart and she heard the things spoken by Paul.
W.W.M. Would you say in regard of Apollos, there was skill with the man in taking it on, but there was a subject state with him instead of a teaching one?
J.T. I would say that. The Spirit of God has put these jewels coming up almost immediately in the service, especially in relation to Paul. It is very refreshing to see how they joined in in the service, in the economy of God. They are in it effectively almost at once. I believe it leads us on to Mark's gospel, because his gospel is on the principle of 'immediately' -- things being done quickly and effectively, not poorly done but well done. He is the one that tells us that the Lord did all things well, but they were done quickly.
W.F.K. Is Apollos humble in submitting to teaching by Aquila and Priscilla?
J.T. Exactly. They became his teachers in a formal way, because they took him to them.
C.A.M. You were mentioning Mark's gospel. That is interesting, because they spoke with tongues and prophesied. It came very rapidly.
J.T. It says in @Mark 16:19, "The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into
{272}
heaven, and sat at the right hand of God. And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs following upon it". The thing is immediate. That is Mark, and his teaching and his gospel enter into what we are saying as to the work at Ephesus.
E.W.S. The Lord has favoured us in this area especially in the last five or six years. This country and the whole continent have been favoured with gift. Is this a challenge as to whether we are taking it on and are acting in administration in line with the gift that has been given us?
J.T. The great need is administration: what is to be done and how it is to be done; to do it well. All that enters into administration and hence the importance of these twelve men, because their number is not mentioned until everything is done for them. They are full-fledged when they are said to be about twelve.
A.R. I would like a little help in what is the difference between Jerusalem and Ephesus in the idea of administration -- this high level -- how we do things in our local meeting.
J.T. There must be a difference. I would say you could hardly exceed what was at Jerusalem, because it is what has an abiding position eternally, that is in the city. The twelve apostles are seen in the foundations, the twelve foundations of the walls of the city, so that it would be hard to say that that has been exceeded. But, at the same time, we have to go by inference and spiritual intelligence and see that Paul's ministry exceeds in the sense of inwardness, of developing love in the administration. So that he laboured more than they all, he said, and the Lord was pleased to give him more than they had. That is, the Lord was pleased to give him, as he says, to complete the word of God, and the ministry of the assembly and the ministry of reconciliation and the
{273}
ministry of the new covenant. Therefore, we are bound to recognise by discernment, by intelligence that Paul would exceed them, but only in the inner, you might say, beautification and completion of the work in the assembly.
J.A.P. We need to give greater room to prophecy in administrative matters.
J.T. You see it here, how it is seen almost immediately, and it is in the early days extended to sisters. There were four women of whom we are told that they prophesied. They were not simply prophetesses; they prophesied, which would mean that the work was extended in that sense.
A.P.T. This thought of influence is helpful. In the same chapter, chapter 20, they brought the boy alive after Paul embraced him. Would that be indicative of the normal working out in our local settings of the ability to recover? Love? I suppose we lose a lot; one feels it.
J.T. You are speaking about the recovery of Eutychus?
A.P.T. Yes; you were speaking about love. One believes it is most important; the ability to hold persons who are slipping, hold them and retrieve them. Is that Paul's line?
J.T. I would think that is right. One would like just to link on there some of the things that would prove it; the way Peter speaks of Paul -- I think he would represent the twelve of whom we have been saying that they could hardly be exceeded from the fact that they have the place eternally in the heavenly city. They have the place, the most public place eternally. But that does not militate against the inward side with which Paul had to do, that is, the inward side in Christ's affections -- Christ's body.
C.A.M. Talking about the administrative side and inwardness seems to be a great help, because in working things out administratively we might be
{274}
liable to go by rule, or what was done in some similar case, whereas inwardness would require a sort of instinct for a given position.
J.T. Yes, and the evidence of divine support in it. Hence he is the only one that says, "ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery of Christ". No one could say that but Paul. Peter refers to Paul with this distinction: he regards Paul's writings as Scripture, and that persons who are uninstructed resisted it to their own destruction.
E.H. Where do you place Paul's ministry in relation to the heavenly city?
J.T. I think it is all inward. I would think it is the finishing side. He speaks of completing the word of God and presenting every man perfect in Christ. I would think the Jewish Christians came in for all that because undoubtedly he wrote the book of the Hebrews and that was to the Jewish Christians.
A.R. @Acts 20 is a chapter of embraces. In the first verse it speaks about his embracing persons. He embraced the disciples before he embraced Eutychus and then in the chapter he is embraced. That might suggest inwardness.
J.T. Just so. It is a love chapter; you begin with it and end with it and have it in the middle.
E.McK. He has the inner man in mind.
J.T. That is just what I was thinking, that the Father might strengthen us in the inner man.
R.D. Does this administrative matter carry through in @Revelation 2 despite the fact that they had fallen away from the original position and their first love? How would you account for that?
J.T. That is what the Lord discerned, but it only supports what we are saying, because Paul had left that church in its completeness. He tells us that he perfected every man; to present every man perfect and his prayer for them according to @Ephesians 3 is that they might know the love of Christ which passes
{275}
knowledge and be filled unto all the fulness of God. It says, "In order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God", @Ephesians 3:18,19. It seems as if that is the fulness, that is the perfection. The assembly according to that is left as the vessel in which the Father is to be glorified throughout all generations of the age of ages. Therefore, the assembly seems according to the Ephesians to be perfected, left as it should be. Therefore what is seen afterwards as seen in @Revelation 2 is what time has effected. How much time may wear us down and how much we may become depreciated in time. On the other hand, we may advance in time, but alas! there was a down-grade and hence the Lord does not say they are to be restored to that, but that they might do the first works. The works would be something, anyway, if they did them -- the first works; because these works, according to @Ephesians 2, were ordained that we should walk in them.
J.S. Is he like David here, building a habitation for God in the Spirit?
J.T. That is just what happened. The epistle contemplates that Paul had come on that way before he wrote the epistle, that the work was growing to a holy temple in the Lord. It was a final thought, but the effect that time had on it in the sense of deterioration is a sorrowful thing. That is what Revelation contemplates. The deterioration is acknowledged by the Lord and placed upon the assembly at Ephesus as on the others, but there are the first works. They are not to be given up; they can be specified. They were ordained by God to walk in, but the general position that Paul left was perfect.
E.McK. The high place that they had first -- the promise to the overcomer would bring that about.
{276}
J.T. We have often spoken of that -- the tree of life in the paradise of God -- you could not get anything higher nor anything more enjoyable. That was there.
R.W.S. Paul says in @Acts 20, "Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I ceased not admonishing each one of you with tears", @Acts 20:31. Would that be the element in which this work was perfected?
J.T. I would say that fully, and then the reference to love running through that chapter, not only at Ephesus. It is the love chapter, and it is, I believe, the greatest chapter in the Acts, chapter 20, because of the presence of love in so many different places. And you have men that accompanied Paul as evidence of his work, and the many lights in the upper chamber, and the power in the apostle himself to go down and enfold someone in his arms and resuscitate him in that sense and bring him up again, and he becomes a comfort to the brethren. He was just a boy.
G.V.D. Would it be an indication of defect in the administration that when Paul had to write to Timothy he begged him to remain there because of what had come in?
J.T. Just to finish off and complete the thing.
G.V.D. He says, "But the end of what is enjoined is love out of a pure heart", @1 Timothy 1:5.
J.T. Anything that was left unordered was to be ordered by Timothy. That is a good point, because God never leaves things undone. They are always finished off. We have often remarked about @Psalm 133:2; the finish is there in that the ointment ran down to the hem of the garments, which means there is completion.
A.P.T. Does the work of God prosper only under the conditions of holy love? I mean to say love operating amongst the brethren makes way for the work of God.
{277}
J.T. It is the normal way, because love is of God and God carries on his work on that principle.
A.B.P. Did the apostle have administration in mind when he exhorted the elders to remember the words of the Lord Jesus that it is more blessed to give than to receive, @Acts 20:35. Is that administration?
J.T. Very good; giving and receiving. That is what Paul alluded to in the Philippians. I mean, not that it was more blessed to give than to receive, but he speaks about none communicating with him in regard of giving and receiving save them only; as if that should be something that should mark us at the present time, because I never knew of a time when the brethren are more ready to give than they are now, and the next thing is how it is received; whether the receiving does as much good as the giving. It ought to be a matter of circulatory principles. If you get something, you receive it, but why? What is to be done with it? It is to be put into the circulatory principle with God, the great circulatory ministry that is going on; not simply giving but receiving as well.
F.N.W. Paul says, "in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God", @Ephesians 3:10. Would that be the height of what is reached in the assembly along administrative lines?
J.T. That is a good suggestion. The angels desire to look into that. God has a thing that is worth looking into and worth looking at and even the heavenly beings look at it, and that brings out how great the assembly is.
D.P. This work going on outside of Jerusalem would be a great cheer to the apostle.
J.T. Quite so. Of course, his work was outside Jerusalem properly. "Lo, we turn to the nations", he said. He was sent there. But he went back to
{278}
Jerusalem, perhaps to revive things there, but the fact of the shearing of his head did not seem to help much.
F.N.W. Would the relation of the twelve foundations of the walls of the city in the Revelation and the twelve pearls refer to administrative principles in the twelve being basic, but it refers to the ministry worked out in localities -- the pearls and the gates?
J.T. The idea of administration extending to the twelve gates.
T.E.H. Is that what you see in Daniel when he has gone through with the interpretation of the king's dream? He is given his administration to be over the province of Babylon and he takes with him his three friends. In our localities where we may be only two or three we may reduce the number twelve to three and act in the light of it.
J.T. It is a very divisible number; twelve is the most divisible number, so that Daniel may be compared with Joseph in administration in how they linked up their brethren or their companions with them in it. What better could they get than companionship?
J.A.P. It says Joseph taught his senators wisdom. Would that be like the school of Tyrannus?
J.T. That is good. This man Tyrannus would dictate. He would be a man that was exact in his education, which is important. You are not allowing the scholars to be loose and do as they please in the school. There is no doubt that the introduction of this particular item is to confirm the idea of education in Paul's ministry.
A.N.W. Even in the household of Aquila and Priscilla they were 'more exact'. Apollos was exact but they were *more* exact.
D.P. Do you carry out the idea of administration in manhood?
J.T. I think that is the thought. They are called
{279}
men. "And all the men were about twelve", @Acts 19:7. That is what you mean? We are told to quit ourselves like men, which would be in keeping with this.
R.W.S. The word of the Lord -- is that a characteristic word at Ephesus in connection with administration?
J.T. That is another thing that ought to enter into what we are saying. At Corinth the stress is laid on the word of God, but in Ephesus the stress is on the word of the Lord, which would mean, I think, that military operations were contemplated as needed, and we knew it was so. The epistle shows that military operations were contemplated and the whole armour of God was enjoined.
R.W.S. What do you mean by military?
J.T. 'The Lord' is a military term. It is authoritative. This system of teaching here does not brook any looseness or carelessness or optionalism in the thing. You must go through with it and go through with it well, it is a school. The word 'school' is used and the master is a tyrant. He is one who would exact things and demand that you do things well and learn well. How many come to these meetings and how many could give an account of what is ministered? If one takes it in according to the school or principle of Tyrannus they could give an account of what they have learned.
C.A.M. We have a terrible conflict following this; as we gain strength, do you not think it awakens the terrible power of evil in a military way?
J.T. That is another thing that comes up here. I am glad you mention that or we might have passed along without it. We were speaking of the twelve men; now we have seven men in the enemy's camp, @Acts 19:14. It is a spiritual number for good or bad. In this case it is a spiritual number for wickedness. They were seven men, sons of Sceva, and they were under the influence of the devil. That shows we are in the
{280}
presence of the enemy's camp and it is a military matter.
C.A.M. I was thinking how it fitted into the Ephesian position, this spiritual wickedness. The more advance that is made the stronger we have to be.
J.T. Just so. This was a remarkable battle and the result was triumphant because of the presence of the books and how they were all burned. "And many of those that practised curious arts brought their books of charms and burnt them before all", @Acts 19:19. It seems to me that is a great triumph. "And they reckoned up the prices of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. Thus with might the word of the Lord increased and prevailed".
A.P.T. That is like the standard is up and is going to stay up. We need that in our local settings.
J.T. Quite so.
W.F.K. Is that a sure sign of the work of God, when the enemy works like this?
J.T. Just so. That is, it was remarked about Mr. Darby, when they went out to preach on the street and came back, Mr. Darby said, Did the enemy do anything? If there is anything of God going on the devil will be there if he can. "Satan also came", @Job 1:6. But he came here to be entirely overwhelmed.
D.P. I suppose previously these books may have been a great treasure to them, but it was nothing to burn them.
F.N.W. Would this account be an encouragement to us in our localities that if administration is functioning according to the teaching of the Lord we can count on this battle in relation to Satan taking place outside of the assembly? This does not take place in the assembly. It peters out in the man that was possessed.
J.T. The town clerk had to do with it, showing that a settled or orderly government usually subdues
{281}
what is against God. The settled government is in favour of what is right at the moment. It is said in @Acts 19:35, "And the town clerk, having quieted the crowd, said, Ephesians", etc. He quieted the crowd. It was not a question of doctrine or what the present day leading men hold, but the Spirit of God is leading indirectly at least, to support His work and make room for it.
W.F.K. This good state in Ephesus is responsible for the epistle to the Ephesians.
J.T. Just so. Paul had to speak the very highest things to them.
W.F.K. You could not write the epistle to the Ephesians to the Corinthians.
J.T. You could not, indeed.
{282}
"A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE"
@Luke 16:1 - 13; @1 Timothy 6:17 - 19
J.T. The word in mind is: "Laying by for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of what is really life", @1 Timothy 6:19. We are apt to be diverted now by what is in mind in the present situation, the establishment of 'peace' so-called, and as usual after conflict in the world, there is an era of physical prosperity and money-making, so it occurred to me that these scriptures would help to save us from any such inclinations. And Luke, beginning with chapters 15 and 16, contemplates the importance of money, and the parables involved show the folly of trusting to it or making much of it. The prodigal, as we know, thought of what came to him -- the portion of goods that fell to him from his father and his father's estate. Chapter 16 contemplates this incident of which we have read, and the following one, too -- the rich man and Lazarus, the former representing richness; and the latter, poverty. Here is opened, indeed, the door into the unseen world for us so that we might see how the two principles work out in the coming day. It seems as if we might be helped in looking at this section of Luke and seeing how material things may be turned into good account so that we might lay up a foundation for the future with them; hence the lord of the steward speaks of him as worthy of praise because he did prudently, for the Lord says, "For the sons of this world are, for their own generation, more prudent than the sons of light. And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails ye may be received into the eternal tabernacles", and then He introduces a thought, saying, "He that is faithful in the least is
{283}
faithful also in much", @Luke 16:10, meaning that the "least" would be material things, and he that is faithful in the least will be faithful when God gives him spiritual wealth to distribute. And then He says, further, "And he that is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who shall entrust to you the true? and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's, who shall give to you your own?" meaning what is our own that is spiritual, and that what we have of this world's goods does not really belong to us. So that if we are not faithful in the world, we are apt to be short of the spiritual, if not devoid of it altogether. I thought we might be helped in looking at these practical things at this time and linking them on with 1 Timothy in which we have much of that kind of instruction.
A.A.T. In our prayer meetings, we often pray for the oppressed, for those that are going through pressure, but the exercise this afternoon apparently is to pray for those that are succeeding.
J.T. That is right; they need being prayed for. Of course, we all need to be prayed for, but those who are succeeding in this world's affairs are always in great danger.
A.B.P. Would the prodigal and the rich man represent two extremes -- the one who sinned in wasting substance; and the other, misused it in centring it upon himself? The prodigal said, "I have sinned against heaven", in wasting what he had, spending it in debauchery; whereas the rich man focussed it all upon himself apparently -- "he lived luxuriously".
J.T. The end of the misuse of wealth in the sense in which the rich man misused it is a terrible contemplation. It is said, "And in hades lifting up his eyes, being in torments", @Luke 16:23. The prodigal misused
{284}
it, too, of course. We would all say that he misused it, but perhaps all of us would not say that the rich man *misused* it. He became rich and the government of the country would think he was a valuable asset and no doubt share in it in taxes and the like, but the prodigal misused it in debauchery, wasted it in riotous living. Evidently the thought is that he did no good with his wealth, but did harm to himself.
R.W.S. This steward must have faced the fact that he was going to have a rough time with his master, but he is prepared to sacrifice that, I suppose, for future gain. Is that the point?
J.T. Well, that is the point. The Lord when here connects prudence with the sons of this generation, and contrasts that with the prudence of the sons of light. He says, "For the sons of this world" -- notice, it is not 'children' of this world, but "sons", those that are grown up and mature -- "are, for their own generation, more prudent than the sons of light", @Luke 16:8, whereas in John's gospel He says, "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light", @John 12:36, that is, he would meet the discrepancy in the sons of light here by believing, increasing our faith in light that we may become sons of it.
W.R. So the basic feature of the believer in seeking after monetary return in the way of his pursuits would be righteousness over against the unrighteousness that is mentioned of this steward?
J.T. That is what the sons of light would seek. You mean they would seek righteousness -- "but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you", @Matthew 6:33. His righteousness -- I suppose all that would be linked up with the idea of foundation, how we are to meet the coming day, for that is the point here. It is what is future yet, how are we prepared for future
{285}
events, each having it in mind, what he is himself, what has he gathered up in store in view of the future?
A.N.W. It says in the verse read in Timothy, "Laying by for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of what is really life". Is that laying hold of what is really life, what is altogether future?
J.T. I would say so. In what Paul says to Timothy, of course, it is eternal life; "lay hold of eternal life", and that would be really life, I would say, as over against what we have in a natural way, a natural life such as Adam has and which he lost as to eternity. What is really life would now have in mind the overcoming of sin in our circumstances. We should really live, but that is I believe in view of the future.
C.A.M. It is a remarkable thing the way that Paul behaves: I mean, his manner of life in connection with money; that in the epistle to Philemon which was so linked with spiritual things, he was able to discharge every kind of debt, it would seem; even material owings to Philemon he was able to discharge in some way.
J.T. That is, he would set him up. He was in debt, you mean, the slave had become indebted to his master?
C.A.M. Yes.
J.T. And Paul would liquidate that, you mean?
C.A.M. Yes; he seems to be so qualified on this matter, do you not think, that material things in a secondary way were easily taken care of?
J.T. It is a remarkable thing that the apostle should have worked with his hands. It is said, "Yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my wants, and to those who were with me", @Acts 20:34, that he should suffer, too, really to
{286}
cover the indebtedness of Onesimus. It seems remarkable that a man actively engaged in the Lord's service should have enough to meet the need or shortage of Onesimus. He says to Philemon, "Put this to my account", @Philemon 1:18. It seems remarkable that the Lord should have it come down to us in that way; that a man given up to the Lord's service and ready to accept the bounty of the brethren in meeting his needs should have enough to pay the indebtedness of a poor slave just converted; instead of putting it off on some rich brother or someone else, as if it would be no business of the servant of the Lord to meet such an obligation. Paul suggests to Philemon to put it to his account.
C.A.M. It speaks of himself as a steward: "Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God", @1 Corinthians 4:1, but his stewardship covered everything, did it not?
J.T. I would say so. I have often thought of the practicalness of a brother engaged wholly in the Lord's service not putting over any such indebtedness or obligation on the brethren who might be regarded as having it characteristically, but that he might do it and not hesitate to do it, as Paul told Philemon that he could adjust the matter. There was an account, I think, between Philemon and himself, and he said to put that to his account, because he says, "thou owest even thine own self also to me", @Philemon 1:19. I am only thinking that the brethren who are engaged in service should not assume that dealing in money affairs is beneath them but meet a condition like that if I have to do with it and not put it off on anybody else. Whatever little or much one may have, to take on that attitude. It seems to me it is very practical.
A A.T. Do I understand that you are saying that Paul had money to liquidate Onesimus debt?
J.T. That is what he says, "Put it to my account".
{287}
A.N.W. When he said in @Acts 20, "these hands have ministered to my wants, and to those who were with me", it must mean that he worked and received compensation for it.
A.A.T. Is it not so that in the Lord's pathway here, it is not known that He ever had any money on Him?
J.T. Well, it is not known; quite so. It is not known that He actually had a coin or any money, but at the same time, we cannot just say that He did not. You can only make it out that it is not stated that He had it, but then looking back over the history of the Lord, apparently He had a house, and thus He would be practical in His affairs. We are told in @Mark 2 that He was "at home", and we are told that he lived at Capernaum. It was his own city. Nazareth might be more regarded as His city at one time, but Capernaum was said to be His own city and that he was at home; and the paralytic man was taken to that house evidently where the Lord lived. Undoubtedly we may assume that matters were taken care of, financial matters by the Lord. We are told that He worked as a carpenter -- one of the most touching things you could speak about Him. He is called a carpenter. Well, that would have remuneration undoubtedly in it, and we can apply that although the thing is not stated formally; but practicalness in Christianity should pertain, even if we may be out and out in the Lord's service, and if we have money, it ought to be used as we have opportunity. Therefore the Lord gives us this incident of a man who hardly had any principles at all. He knew he was in debt, and his master brought the matter up to him, and he saw the end had come, and now he reasons as to what he will do. One man owed a hundred baths of oil, and he says, Write fifty; and another owed a hundred cors of wheat, and he says, Write eighty. He was a thief, but the Lord
{288}
is not speaking about that, but what should be done with what we have now in view of the future.
R.M. Would this principle you are speaking of help us in regard to ministering to the levites, to those who have money, but we give them more so that they can use it?
J.T. Quite so; it is an obligation if they have it, to use it, too; if anybody is in need, use it, because that is what Paul did.
A.R. What about chapter 11 of Acts where those who were well off gave to those at Jerusalem?
J.T. They did it; they are not *told* to do it. A prophet came down from Jerusalem and made a prophecy. He announced by prophetic ministry that there was going to be a great famine. He does not make an appeal or take up a collection. It says, "And they determined, according as any one of the disciples was well off, each of them to send to the brethren who dwelt in Judea, to minister to them; which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul", @Acts 11:29,30; showing that the Spirit of God contemplates the use of money by persons who had it, made use of it -- not for their own aggrandisement, but for the good of others. They were "well off", that is the term that is used.
A.A.T. Peter says in his epistle, "If any one speak -- as oracles of God; if any one minister -- as of strength which God supplies", @1 Peter 4:11. Is that the subject we are discussing -- ministry?
J.T. Well, we hope to come to that really, but we are discussing now the use of material physical things with a view to the future -- not for the present, but for the future -- not simply to meet the current need among the brethren, but the idea of meeting your own need in the future, your moral need in the future, that you can turn the thing to account, and as it were, bank it now, and it will be turned to use in another form in the time to come when you need
{289}
it. You do not need it now, but you are to use it for the present so you will be ready for the time when you do need it, and that is what is in mind in this passage in Timothy -- "laying by ... a good foundation". Well, we may say, *the foundation of God* -- that is a good word, too. "The foundation of God standeth sure", @2 Timothy 2:19. But the believer has to look out for the question as to how he is going to meet the future. It is not a question of his sins, but more than that: there is something he will need in the future, and he is liable not to have it unless he gives it now.
C.F.E. Would you say that the thought of trading comes into these scriptures?
J.T. Tell us about the trading.
C.F.E. We do not have it mentioned here but in another instance we have the steward who was not trading with his lord's talent. Here, the steward is wasting his goods. How do you look at this in the light of trading?
J.T. The lord furnished his servant with goods to be used in trading. Is that what you meant?
C.F.E. Quite so.
A.N.W. Does what you are at hinge mostly on distinguishing between what stewardship is and what ownership is?
J.T. Well, quite so; what about this matter of the future? You say, My sins are forgiven. Well, that is not all. That is not a good enough foundation. You say, I thought it was. Maybe it is not; maybe we are thinking not quite right, because Paul in his epistle and the Lord in the parable are not speaking of that at all. They are speaking of something else as a good foundation, and whether as having got means, it is going to be any good to me when the time comes for a good foundation for the future, for the future implies, What have I got? You say, It looks as if you are making it a matter of what one does himself. It is a matter of what one *does himself*; because what
{290}
is done by God, and by Christ, and by the Spirit, is one thing; and the other is the exercise the Christian goes through with a view to the future. You say, 'What about current ministry and the meetings?' That is not the point. These passages do not deal with that; they deal with what is coming in the future.
A.R. Like laying up treasure in heaven?
J.T. Yes; that is one of the things, but this is laying up treasure on earth just now, and it can be turned around to the principle of banking, and cashed in, in some other form.
W.W.M. Does that scripture fit in here where it says, "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is right, but it tendeth only to want", @Proverbs 11:24? That is the attitude and manner in which I use what God has given me now in view of whether it is going to tend to poverty or riches.
J.T. Very good, because we are dealing with the present as regards the future, and that if a person has material things how that can be turned around and cashed in the future, as it were, and it is a question of what I am doing with mine now, because the Lord is dealing with that. That comes in, in this particular section in Luke -- money and persons who have it, and what use they are making of it.
A.Pf. The rich ruler missed his opportunity in laying up for the future.
J.T. Just so. The Lord said to him: "Sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens, and come, follow me", @Luke 18:22. Is that what you mean?
A.Pf. Yes; and so he missed the point of the future.
J.T. I thoroughly believe that most of us are saying that, that we are missing the point in the future in regard to material wealth if it is only
{291}
serving us now in a way that makes much of us or we are getting something with it that we need now; but the point we see in this chapter is how this can be turned to account in the future.
W.R. Paul seems to have that in mind when he says, "For I do not seek yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children", @2 Corinthians 12:14. Would that be carrying the thing forward?
J.T. Yes; but the children have to lay up for themselves, too. It is a question with every one of us as to how the present is going, what is the outlook as regards the present, because the future is coming.
E.S. Is this the Christian's way of taking out insurance?
J.T. You might put it that way as taking out insurance, but this is with God. You can only buy an insurance policy from God that is of any value at all. Well, that can only be by putting up collateral; that is, the collateral would be the money you have got. Give it to somebody that needs it, that is, collateral put in a place where it will account in the future. I do not know whether I am making that plain.
E.S. That is what I meant.
A.B.P. What was wanting in the rich ruler? The Lord said, "One thing is lacking to thee yet", @Luke 18:22.
J.T. He lacked love, I would think. In his own mind, he did not lack anything really, but I would say he lacked love. The Lord says, "Sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor". That would be love, I would say. He would turn it into other values by selling it and giving it to the poor. It happens to be his at the present time. If he obeyed the Lord's word, his bank account would be smaller; indeed, he would have none at all, but he has built up something in the future. He has built up something that
{292}
is going to be valuable sometime, and when he needs it, too.
A.B.P. Does this not involve an appreciation of the future, that our path now is one of faith, and that we really look forward to what is really life?
J.T. That is the way I think we ought to work it out, and every one here should ask himself, What have I got? What am I doing with it? How is it going to be any advantage to me? If I increase my bank account, that is not what is meant. I am going to have great need presently, and how can I meet it with what I have now?
T.E.H. I would like to ask a question about Cornelius. His position would imply that his salary evidently was a good one, because he was over one hundred men, and he prayed and gave alms, and then God says it came up as a memorial. Evidently God worked it out that way for his gain. Is that right? Would that have a future bearing as to what he gave in alms?
J.T. I am glad you brought that up. That is very good, I would say, and the idea of a memorial come up before God. I suppose that is there now. It has never lost its power or value there. Well, that is remarkable, and Cornelius would come into the assembly according to that working of the thing out. He would come in a wealthy brother.
D.P. Would the lead Barnabas gave in @Acts 4 be applicable now?
J.T. That is a good suggestion, too, because it is a question of property though he never should have owned it, because he was a levite, and he had land which he was not supposed to have, but yet God honoured him. He evidently took a short cut to get rid of it, but he did not give it away. He did not say to anybody, Take it. He sold it; that is, he used his good judgment. Either the land came down from his father or grandfather, which would look as if he
{293}
counted on grace to recognise that it was his property; and now the next thing to be settled is where should his property be? It should be in a walled city. That is where he should have property. He belonged to cities. That is where his property lay, and he had the land. Apparently, he did not live in a walled city, but now he came into the city and he had a status. He already had a status in the city, and therefore it seems as if grace would allow him to use what did not belong to him primarily, but as long as it is the grace period, he is allowed to sell that land and turn it to account, and he placed the money at the apostles feet. I would say he is doing pretty much what Cornelius did. He is building up a good foundation for the future, that he would become great spiritually and greater in the assembly because of that property -- turn it into account by making it suitable to be put down at the apostles feet.
Rem. You get the opposite in the case of Ananias and Sapphira.
J.T. The very opposite. They were thinking of the land that they had. They sold it and got more for it than would be known and they became liars. That is remarkable. These are remarkable things to come into what we have said, because all these things are going on, whether we are holding money as men hold it, or whether as we have it we are holding it as Barnabas held it; that is, giving it away to others.
J.T.Jr. The man in chapter 12 would be holding it as men in the world hold it. You remember the rich man who laid it up and did not have barns big enough. He had prospered for many years. That would be the selfish idea -- a rich man in selfish consideration.
J.T. Very good, because he was a man that had so much, pulling down his barns to build greater, and to store his goods. He is a man of this world, that is, a man who would be regarded as having a good foundation
{294}
for this world. God says, "Fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee", @Luke 12:20. That is just the thing we are speaking of now, as to those of us who have any little means -- and every one has because earnings are good -- the question is what we are doing with it, whether we are dealing with it as to the present or future.
J.H. When the widow cast in her two mites, she would not be destitute, would she, she would have something to fall back on?
J.T. She would have God; is that what you mean?
J.H. Yes; she would have treasure in heaven.
J.T. God will provide for her, "Give us today our needed bread", @Matthew 6:11. God would say, You can reckon on that. God will look after her, but she is looking to her future.
J.H. You are not excluding any in the room? We are all in this matter.
J.T. That is just the point. Everyone has something. It is a good earning time, and the question is what we are doing with it.
W.R. Mary of Bethany turned her money into good account. She had a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price.
J.T. Just so; it was very valuable. I think it is beautiful what our brother has just remarked about the widow who gave all to the treasury. There is really no treasury in Christianity, as far as I see, such as existed when the Lord was here, but the question is what we are doing with our earnings. That is really my exercise, what we are doing with our earnings, because these earnings are for the present, but they can be changed over to something that will go over to another world, where I will need the property.
F.N.W. Would Abraham be characterised by this spirit? He is depicted as being wealthy in this
{295}
world's goods, and yet he looked for a city whose builder and maker is God, @Hebrews 11:10
J.T. Just so; He was a family man. He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob, @Hebrews 11:9. That would work out, but whatever he did would work out in that way -- the family living with the patriarch, because he presents the great idea of father, and how he would bring the children up.
A.I. In Timothy, we are enjoined to be rich in good works. Would that be laying up, as you were saying, a good foundation?
J.T. Richness in good works can be cashed just now. What is in one's mind is what we can do now to be cashed in view of the future.
C.A.M. Do you think the fact that Luke says so much about money matters stresses the fact that nothing that we have should be inactive? He says, for instance, in one place, "Whatsoever thou shalt expend more", @Luke 10:35, the Lord will repay; and in another place he speaks of a bank, @Luke 19:23. If we had not done thus-and-so, we could at least have put it into a bank that the Lord would have received something later on.
A.N.W. Do you think it possible to revert to such a condition as @Acts 4? "And not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them", @Acts 4:32. Is that possible to be reverted to?
J.T. I would go by the facts, but in the economy of God a greater ability came into the management. That is to say, Paul came into the management. I am speaking now simply, and the order is changed. As soon as you get him you find persons well off. We have already alluded to that, but they turned what they had on the same principle; instead of laying it at the apostle's feet they did it themselves. Paul never seemed to have resorted to that method of having things laid at his feet. He enjoined the brethren to *lay up* on the first day of the week, which
{296}
is better, I would think, than laying it at the apostles feet. He says, "On the first of the week let each of you put by at home laying up in whatever degree he may have prospered, that there may be no collections when I come", @1 Corinthians 16:2. It would look as if Paul is inaugurating a superior financial position and method, because he is suggesting something about the first day of the week. He is turning time into value. Time is going to add to the value of the Christian. What came out is in @2 Corinthians 8 and 9. The matter became adjusted there and Paul became the bearer with others of the results. It seems as if under Paul the economy took on a higher basis of action and plan, so that the current situation was improved, of course, because they were poor. The Lord had said, "For ye have the poor always with you", @John 12:8. But then Peter and others had enjoined prophetically, "that we should remember the poor, which same thing also I was diligent to do", says Paul; @Galatians 2:10. The poor had to be remembered, and under him they were remembered. They had what was needed, no doubt, and I think we have to work all these things out in a spiritual way as to how they bear on the future and how they bear on the present, because Paul provided for the present, too. But it was the future in 1 Timothy -- what was to be for the future -- a good foundation for the time to come.
A.R. Do you think Zacchaeus was working out a good foundation for the future? He says, If I have taken anything by false accusation I restore fourfold, and one-half my goods I give to the poor, @Luke 19:8. And the Lord calls him a son of Abraham.
J.T. He returned fourfold. That is another thing; that a man is rectifying his whole position in the presence of the Lord. The money matter is all adjusted. It is remarkable how much it comes into Christianity, and how much money affects us, and
{297}
how much it is going to be used for the future. That is one of the most important things we have before us now, how it can be used for the future.
A.I. This steward used the word that he was unable to dig. What was the suggestion in that?
J.T. He was too proud to work; that is all. That will not do. He is not fit for fellowship. "I am not able to dig; I am ashamed to beg". Well, I would say, the two things go together. There was pride in the man. Why could he not dig? If a man is not working and is spending his time, not working at all -- Go and find work. It is the best thing he can do.
J.T.Jr. Is that the practical side that Paul speaks of to the Thessalonians? He spoke about "their labour and toil -- working night and day", @1 Thessalonians 2:9, not to be chargeable to others, and then about the man who would not work. It is not right. He was very practical in that way.
J.T. He says, If any man does not like to work, neither let him eat. If a man comes to your house and he is not working, do not let him eat. You may say you are penalising the brother, but you are adjusting him.
J.H. Abraham had a godly exercise about the king of Sodom; He said "that thou mayest not say, I have made Abram rich", @Genesis 14:23.
J.T. Quite so. Here was a man who could make him rich, but he calculated it would not do for him to be made rich by the king of Sodom; God made him rich.
R.W.S. The matter of insurance which was mentioned, often becomes a very pressing matter with some. Just how should the believer regard that?
J.T. Well, I would not insure my life. That belongs to God. If anybody is to keep it I should keep it myself. "Take heed to thyself and to the teaching", @1 Timothy 4:16, Paul says to Timothy, and he tells him to
{298}
take a little wine for his stomach's sake. That is your own body. You do not ask the insurance people to look after your body; I would not. If there is a person that has something he is indebted in regard of to somebody else, I would protect him. Business is so peculiarly managed now that you can hardly carry on business without the principle of banking. If, as a Christian, you are apt to be brought into discredit, you had better protect yourself for the sake of the Lord and His people, not for your own sake. The credit of the testimony might be involved, and it is better to say, You had better take charge of that; I cannot take charge of that. I have no means of protecting the man I am doing business with, and I want to protect him.
R.W.S. It is important to be clear as to the life insurance principle. If I can trust the Lord as to my life, does it cease there? My faith need not go so far as to trust Him for something else that is outside of me? If it is a matter of car insurance, you might damage some other person's property. You would have insurance to take care of that person.
J.T. That is the only way I would reckon: if I should do harm to someone else -- if there is a means of protecting him without my having to do anything with it. It is this world's way. But I certainly would not insure my life nor insure anything I was dependent on except it involves somebody else.
A.N.W. I wondered about the woman at the end of Proverbs. "She considereth a field, and acquireth it; of the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms. She perceiveth that her earning is good; her lamp goeth not out by night", @Proverbs 31:16 - 18. Is she using her wealth or what she has at her hand with a view to the future? It speaks of the family and then finally her works praise her in the gates.
{299}
J.T. That would be worked out on spiritual lines. It is doubtful that it is intended to be worked out on mere natural or physical lines. I would say it is worked out on spiritual lines, because the proposition is, Who can find a woman of worth? Her price is above rubies. You begin to value her. Her price is above rubies, because she is figuratively the assembly. She has cost an enormous amount; the Lord has given Himself for her; "which he has purchased with the blood of his own", @Acts 20:28; the blood of Christ. Therefore, I would put that on a higher level than what we are speaking of.
J.A.P. Do you think in Jacob's history we can learn how we grow? At Bethel he says, I will give a tenth, but as he went on he got more. When he went to meet Esau, he sent herds. Is it not as we pray to God about being liberal-minded that we get that way?
J.T. That is good. When you bring up anybody like that, whether it is the virtuous woman -- well, what is meant by that? It is plain enough from what has been said. But now you come to Abraham himself and his relations with the king of Sodom. You can see the high level he is on in dealing with these material matters. He would not be made rich by a man like that. Well now, we come to Jacob. What can we make out of him in money matters? He was a salaried man, and his salary was changed ten times. His father-in-law was his employer and he was somewhat selfish. In the results, God helped him but it looks to me as if we are dealing with man on a lower level. That is important too; what level the man is on.
J.A.P. He got on a higher level when he went to meet Esau.
J.T. He did. It is well he had those droves. He made much of them at first to Esau. He said virtually to Esau, You must not think I am a poor man. I
{300}
have droves and herds. He sent them on with certain ones to appease his brother. That was on a low level. Jehovah was on the watch about that. What was He going to make out of Jacob? He is left alone, not even wife or children with him. It is a question of Jacob finding his own measure and his own value before God. It is not a question of herds or even children; it is a question of Jacob himself. That is another thing that is important. What does God do with him? He makes a prince out of him, not because he had money but because he had power. He was weakened in his thigh, but he limped. He was weakened outwardly but he was made a prince. Therefore, in bringing up these cases God would help us to see what we are dealing with now, and I think Jacob is a man that represents a Christian whom God would take out of all these things that he followed that were really of no value. He was making too much of them. He just takes him by himself and makes a prince out of him. That is no question of money at all.
W.W.M. This matter is a matter of the heart, too. In regard to God David says, "And I know, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart have I willingly offered all these things; and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, offer willingly to thee", @1 Chronicles 29:17. The idea is the offering spirit.
J.T. Quite so. That was a fine time, showing how these things can be made use of at the time and the brethren seem to be enhanced by it.
D.P. Would you say a word as to why the lord of the steward did not condemn his shrewd practices?
J.T. Because he just left him as it is. He does not exonerate the man or ennoble him at all. It is said, "the lord praised the unrighteous steward". That would be his own lord, the man who hired him. He
{301}
spoke well of him. He was his servant, but he spoke well of him. "And the lord praised the unrighteous steward because he had done prudently". But then the Lord brings in this word 'for'. The Lord begins to speak Himself. He says, "For the sons of this world are, for their own generation, more prudent than the sons of light", @Luke 16:8. He is not saying he was right at all; he is a thief really. He belonged to the sons of this world. He was a thief in it really. He was unrighteous. The Lord leaves him there. He does not enlarge on that at all. He goes on to say, "Make to yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails ye may be received into the eternal tabernacles". It will not simply fail you, it will fail itself. The mammon of unrighteousness is sure to fail. It will never hold when the test comes. "That when it fails ye may be received into the eternal tabernacles". The unjust steward is not going to be in eternal tabernacles. The Lord is turning that around, and He gives a course of instruction, because He says, "He that is faithful in the least is faithful also in much". He is telling us if we have a little means, to use it for the Lord, and the Lord is saying, I will make you spiritual if you do it. "He that is faithful in the least is faithful also in much; and he that is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much". If he is unrighteous in the way he uses his money he will never be honoured in the assembly. That is what the Lord means. "If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who shall entrust to you the true? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's" -- meaning your money does not belong to you, really. As Paul says, "We have brought nothing into the world: it is manifest that neither can we carry anything out", @1 Timothy 6:7. Therefore, the Lord says, "Who shall give to you your own?" Our own is what is spiritual. God would honour us in that way.
{302}
He would say, as belonging to the assembly the wealth of the assembly is ours. All things are yours, even the world is ours.
A.B.P. According to what you said this afternoon as to the teaching of these passages, what you have here can be something you can take with you, the result of prudence.
J.T. You can take it with you, and in taking it with you it stands by you, because you have to go through the Jordan. That is one of the things we have to think of. What wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? Money will not help you there but spirituality will. That is one of the greatest concerns we have when we get older and should be always but especially when we get older. What wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?
A.B.P. Did not the apostle Paul not only have in mind what he had done with material means, but that also that had been once given to him? He entrusted it to the Lord that He is able to keep it. Is that not something he had bought with these things -- his pedigree and all that he relates? He does not simply throw it away. In one sense he does, but in another he buys something with it.
J.T. In giving it up, you mean? Although, sometimes we say, Look at what he gave up. He was a rich man; he was a titled man. Well, the Lord does not always value them as we do, because after all, Paul says they are dross. "But what things were gain to me these I counted, on account of Christ, loss. But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord", @Philippians 3:7,8.
A.R. While we are going through the Jordan it is a question of what we are going to get on the other side.
J.T. That is where the first need comes. If you have to go through Jordan the first need is how are
{303}
you going to meet that? What wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?
A.B.P. Paul further says, "that I may gain Christ", @Philippians 3:8.
J.T. I see what you mean; that we may have Christ for gain.
J.A.P. Barzillai was attached to his wealth. He could not go over.
J.T. His mother and father and what he had on the other side. He was going back over Jordan.
F.N.W. There is a certain variance among the saints apparently as to the life insurance applied to the brothers in the armed services. Do you see any difference there? Is the principle not the same?
J.T. I understand they do not take it.
F.N.W. Many have not.
J.T. I understand many have trouble because they do not take it.
F.N.W. Do you think they should take it?
J.T. Why didn't you?
F.N.W. I felt the Lord's help in it.
J.T. I do not think we ought to commit ourselves where all have one pot and join in together. I believe the Lord would honour us in standing out to an individual position.
F.N.W. It gives an opportunity for testimony that would not otherwise have occurred.
J.H. I was wondering about this state that any of us might get into where Jacob found himself, complaining about his wages being changed ten times. We are liable to be ensnared in trade unionism. We might bolster our wages that way but God would not honour it.
J.T. It is one of the snares of the time and, of course, insurance, I believe enters into it, and those who are in it have to just work it out before God as to how much it may or may not involve. It all works into the modern way of business, and I know
{304}
well enough what it is, what has to be gone through with it, but surely the Lord would help us that way in seeing that we are not going to succumb; at all costs it will be according to the will of God.
A.B.P. When Elijah was at the brook Cherith the ravens brought him a portion of meat in the morning and in the evening. Would that be a great principle on which to live, what God provides and our acceptance of it? "Godliness with contentment is great gain".
J.T. That is beautiful. That is how it was with him, and then he has to go across the country to be supported by a widow.
F.H.L. Perhaps that would connect up with chapters 9 and 10 of Luke, where the Lord sent out the twelve, and then the seventy, without money and without purse. Was that just educational?
J.T. That has to be weighed out, too, as to the time, whether the actual facts of that case would fit in with Paul's exercise; whether the economy had not taken on a different standard which, I would think, because he worked with his hands, whereas the Lord would say, It is an absolute thing in my case, and if you are to be my apostles, you are to represent me, and you are not to take anything, purse or clothing -- nothing except just what you want for the moment. It seems that we have to weigh these things up according to the time, that is, whether the dispensation is involved, and then, as we have already remarked, according to the history of the persons -- how it might fit in their case.
J.A.P. The Samaritan had money with him -- two denarii.
J.T. He did. That is another thing. It is important to have it, because these men at Antioch had money, and they used it because of the prophetic ministry. It was prophetic ministry that met that
{305}
situation, and these men were ready. They did not make a collection; they just gave according to what they had, each being well off. And Paul and Barnabas were ready to do the carrying.
R.W.S. In the scripture in Timothy in verse 18, it says, "To do good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal in distributing, disposed to communicate of their substance, laying by for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of what is really life". I wanted to ask about the laying by for themselves a good foundation for the future. That is after this life, is it not? That belongs to the world to come. Does it apply to the future in our own lives, or in the future in the world to come?
J.T. That is a question I think we have barely time for, the difference between this life -- what he calls here, laying hold of what is really life -- whether that is not the present, what we enjoy now. That comes to one's mind as we have talked about the matter here, whether that is not what we have as here together this afternoon, the life that we enjoy, what is really life. I would say the force of it is what is really life now, what we have in the fellowship -- whereas eternal life is spoken of earlier in verse 12, "Strive earnestly in the good conflict of faith. Lay hold of eternal life", @1 Timothy 6:12. That is to be taken according to the full value of the term "eternal life" and it bears on the future, in the world to come, everlasting life; whereas what is really life, would look as if the apostle changes it to bring it into the present, what we have at any time at these fellowship meetings, instead of staying home or reading or going out for a ride or the like for physical reasons, this is really life.
R.W.S. The note says, 'As "seize" "caught hold" as if it is an act of violence to seize it'.
J.T. The word, you mean, the laying hold, to seize it. Of course you miss that sort of thing if you
{306}
just want to have pleasure and the like, for ease and comfort and that.
C.A.M. I suppose it would be right to say that in either view of life, it would be life beyond the touch of death.
J.T. I think so. What is really life must be beyond the power of death.
{307}
THE OBJECTIVE SIDE OF THE TRUTH
@Hebrews 12:1 - 4; @Proverbs 4:25
I am thinking in reading these scriptures of the objective side of the truth. We often speak somewhat disparagingly of it, but chiefly because we have been neglecting what is called the subjective side of the truth. By observation I have come to see that objectivity is a word that expresses what covers much of the holy page, the holy teaching. It is said of the saints that they shall be all taught of God. That, of course, alludes to men, for it is hardly within our reach to speak of angels being the objects of teaching, although doubtless they are, but men are in mind. In all the realm of creation men are supreme in importance outside of divine Persons, of course. Angels, too, have a great place, but men are supreme. So that the Lord became Man, for He could hardly honour us more than becoming one of us; and when I say 'us' I do not forget the distinction that belongs to Him; but, nevertheless, He has become one of us. Hence, the human race has a dignity that no others have. When I say the human race I am not forgetting that many in it are reprobate and never will be saved, alas; but it is to stand. It is to remain. The Son having become one of us gives it a status and a standing and longevity that exceeds all others. We are eternal. In saying that I remind the brethren of the fact that life is in Him; it is said of Jesus, the Son, that in Him was life. Of course, in God is life, too; in the Spirit is life; the same could be said of each and all divine Persons; but of the Son it is said that in Him was life; that is, viewed as Man; and the life was the light of men. That is to say, the idea of it is made exclusive, that is, in a relative sense. Others, of course, have life; the angels live;
{308}
but it is not said that the life that was in Jesus was the light of angels. It was the light of men. I wish to connect this with what I have just remarked: the idea of objectivity. That is to say, that men being so honoured and so blessed should be given to see afar off.
Now we may say, Why see afar off? People are constantly looking up at the heavens, but the wonder is whether they really see; whether it is not more or less accidental that they do; whether they look at the heavens as if they were an object, an object to be studied and learned from is the question. So that men are so honoured and so blessed and so constituted, for it is said of us that we have the mind of Christ. I do not suppose that could be said of even the archangels, any of them or all of them if there are more than one. Men are the objects. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men", @John 1:4.
I want to show now, as I said, how this matter of objectiveness enters into this great matter, and that we should become, if we have not now become, able to see things afar off. If we do not, there is a moral reason; is it that we are blind in any sense, or short-sighted. The point is we have forgotten that we are purged from our former sins. It is a moral matter. Whilst we remember much financially and the like, politically, historically, the moral side is largely overlooked; and, hence, the forgetting of our former sins; perhaps not the immediate ones, but the former ones. We forget this. There are many abroad in the profession of Christianity in which people used to be forgiven, used to be and knew they were but now they have forgotten. They have forgotten that they were purged from their former sins, and, hence, they cannot see afar off; because the matter of our former sins extends away back as to space and time. Centuries have elapsed since our sins, our former sins were dealt with, dealt with by God. But people
{309}
forget and do not think anything of it. You talk to people and they say, Well, I used to attend the gatherings of saints and enjoyed them, but I do not any more. Alas, alas! that you should say that, or have to say that; and even further, to have to say or admit that your former sins have been forgotten by you, but not by God. It is well, indeed, if they are forgotten by God, because the sins of real believers are forgotten by God. "Their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more", @Hebrews 8:12. He has deliberately forgotten them, but He does not expect that we should forget them; not in the sense of which I am speaking, at any rate. It is a moral defect if we have forgotten our former sins, and, hence, as I said, the importance of looking at a distance, dealing with things at a distance as God does. And looking, of course, making examination inwardly; but I am not speaking of that now. I am somewhat afraid to enlarge on it, because I know in the most cases the inward look causes distress and it should not. We are to call upon all that is within us to praise God. Well, if I am not able to look in I cannot say, "Not a cloud above, not a spot within", as one singer says; not a cloud above. I have in mind to speak now about the above, the distance. As I said, I should not at all suggest that we should forget the looking within, but not to cause us distress.
It may be that it is not simply that we have forgotten that we are purged from our former sins, but that we do remember them and they cause us distress. They have never been settled with God. I did not intend to drift on to that line, but I am reminded of the widow of Sarepta; how she was reminded, she thought, by what happened in her house. Her son became sick and died and she blamed Elijah for calling her sins to remembrance. It was well that they were called to remembrance. Apparently she had forgotten them. They had not been settled, I
{310}
would say; and I hope nobody here listening to me now will in any way construe what I am saying to mean that they should not remember former sins as not yet settled. It is much holier and happier and more wholesome to remember them even if they are not settled. One has hope for anyone who has committed sins and has not settled them with God if he recalls them. We should recall them. We should keep them in mind, because heaven is looking after that matter and expects that you should reflect what it is looking after; that if there are sins unsettled, they should be settled in the divine way, for God has set up a system in heaven, and it extends down to earth to deal with all kinds of sins, and particularly sins that have been committed and not settled; committed a long time ago, it may be, and the soul is hampered by them. It is sure to be. You look down instead of looking up, and when you lift up your countenance it does not shine. You would rather talk about current events here below than talk about God and Christ and about the saints.
Well now, as I said, I am speaking of objectivity, and the importance of it with God, and in a practical sense, and with the thought that no one should forget his former sins. And so here, what I am really thinking of in reading these few verses is, "looking stedfastly on Jesus". I always feel that I have to turn to the New Translation on certain points so as to clarify what may be there. Now, the word 'stedfastly' is rendered, 'It means, looking away from other things and fixing the eye exclusively on one'. Now, the authorised version, as you can see, hardly treats these words fairly. It says, "looking unto Jesus". It is not looking unto Him; it is looking on Him. It is not a question here of looking to Him for guidance, but looking on Him. God looks on Him. "*This* is my beloved Son", He said, when He was here on earth. He looked down on
{311}
Him, and He looked up to God, too. But He looked down on His beloved Son as He was here on earth, and said, "*This* is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", @Matthew 17:5. He was looking on Him, and that is the sense in which I would hope that the dear brethren will follow what I am seeking to say: "looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider well ..." I want to read the translation of that word 'well' there, too. It says, '"weigh so as to judge its value", and sometimes in comparison with other things'. So that you see what our minds are to take in now is looking well: "For consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself". And what for? "That ye be not weary, fainting in your minds".
Now, I hope the dear brethren, not that I wish to say much as to what I am able to say, but I hope the dear brethren will just be aroused as to these words, because we have come to a time of great anxiety. Of course, we have been in this time for five and one-half years, but it is peculiar now, because there are other ways to look. We do not have to look to the immediate east any more, to Europe. We look in the other direction, of course, but our minds are divided; men's minds are divided and rightly. But when you come to Christians, how is the division going to take place? We are creatures, of course, and not capable of very much, but what is bound to influence the world and nations and men in it is bound to influence us, too. But how? They have not any such words as these mentioned in these settings. They have not got them. We have them. We have these words, and we have them in a perfect setting. The Spirit of God has set them here in this book of Hebrews. The writer, I believe verily, as
{312}
most of us do, was the apostle Paul. One can see his characteristics in the book and especially in the ardour in which he writes. It is a time for that; a time for ardour; a time for energy, and to see to it that we are able to look away; suppose we are looking towards the east. All is well there, because presently the Lord Jesus will come out of that point. He will come straight out of it. "For as the lightning goes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man", @Matthew 24:27. So it was that the temple was set that way. Jehovah came in that way according to Ezekiel, and the Jehovah of Ezekiel is Jesus and He is going to come in that way again. We are told His feet shall stand on the mount of Olives. We are told that, but I am speaking now of this matter of the compass; the points of the compass, and how that the east is the line of hope. Evil has been coming in from the east, flooding into the west, but the Spirit of God has to say in all this. He has wrought wonderfully in our times, and has brought in objective truth. He has brought in prophetic truth which is all objective truth, because it is yet to come. It has to be viewed in that way. And then the truth of the assembly was brought in objectively. The Spirit of God wrought and brought things to us and wrote them all on that principle. The whole of Christendom was affected by the movement, the objective movement of God so as to enlighten the minds of Christians. God was aiming at the Christian, and hence in the early days we had ministry, prophetic ministry. We had that then. The Spirit of God began in those days with that. The meetings of the brethren -- and this brings me down to practical things -- they used to meet at first in a furniture shop in Dublin. St. Patrick's was there and, of course, many other churches, but they did not select any of those churches. They were diverted. The Spirit of God diverted them. The voice of the
{313}
Spirit was heard in that hall and in many other like it through the western world; not much in the east. And the word was, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", @Matthew 18:20. The Lord said that thousands of times in those days in little gatherings, in little rooms, furniture shops and grocery stores and the like; empty ones, but filled with brethren. The Lord told them -- we love to think of it: "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". And again the Lord would say, "And behold, *I* am with you all the days, until the completion of the age", @Matthew 28:20. The brethren never tired of those wonderful phrases or verses.
Well, then, I must not descend. I want to keep to my point. The Spirit of God kept the brethren looking up and looking out. I have already spoken of the objective in the sense of prophetic ministry, prophetic ministry in the sense of dealing with future events. They had great meetings, large meetings in Dublin as to prophecy: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel and all the minors were constantly under review. And, therefore, the whole matter was opened up to them; other minds, other spiritual minds; the whole matter was opened up; the whole matter of prophetic testimony was opened up and the brethren began to see where they were. You say, Why do you use that phrase? It is for each of us to understand where he is; where he is spiritually and morally, because each of us will have to give an account of himself to God as to everything, and particularly as to these matters I am speaking of: what God is ministering to His people. It is for each of us to challenge himself as to where he is in regard of God and in regard to the assembly, in regard to the place of meeting. That is how the matter took form, and it is going on today right here, and elsewhere, I know.
{314}
So, as I said, the heavenly side of the truth was another great feature -- that the brethren began to look up to heaven. In the early patriarchal days God took Abraham out and said, Look up to the heavens, @Genesis 15:5. He pointed him up to the heavens for a purpose. He pointed him to the heavens, and so God has done it in our day, and now the question is for you young people here as to where you are looking; as to whether you have learned to look up. The Psalmist says, as we have often remarked, "I lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: whence shall my help come? My help cometh from Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth", @Psalm 121:1,2. That is where he looked for the help, you see, and that is where we can, too. But then we must not forget, as I said before, that the Spirit of God is here. He is here. We do not have to look up for Him. Before Pentecost He was in heaven, of course. He was here in a sense, too. He was here in Jesus but not in others. It is when Jesus went up to heaven that the Spirit of God came down and indwelt others, and He is indwelling others now; and that is another thing I have to challenge myself about, as to whether I know I have the Holy Spirit. Let everyone challenge himself as to that. It becomes an objective thing in the sense of which I am speaking of it, that the Spirit is objective. If I have not got Him I cannot regard Him as in any sense objective in me. He is there in others. I can look out on others and in on myself, but I want to look into myself and prove. They did it at Ephesus. Paul says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" @Acts 19:2. They had to inquire if they did and they soon got Him. You do not have to wait for it -- the blessed Spirit, if you find out you have not got Him and you turn to God about it. "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" @Luke 11:13. Think of that.
{315}
Well now, to return to this matter of objective truth, as I said, "Looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself, that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds". I am shut out from others, you see. Think of what is happening on earth. At times I cannot even look at the papers in which they are spoken of -- the things that have happened, but turn away with sorrow and with grief that it is possible for human beings to treat one another in such a way. But I have to learn to look away even from that, and look stedfastly on Jesus. I shall never get any good from looking at these sorrows; not that I do not feel with men, but I am now speaking of the subjective matter and how I can steer my eyes that way, to look that way, so to speak, and no other way; no other way at all. That is the meaning of this passage. And then to see what is happening or what has happened in that precious Person; what has happened in Him. There is so much there as to exclude from my mind altogether everything: sorrows, whatever they may be; misery, without the words to speak of them. The point here is; see what happened in Him. We are to look stedfastly on Him, "Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God". I have to look at all that. Think of it, dear brethren. It is my privilege to look on all that in the objective sense; what has happened in that Person, and what has happened remains there in its effect for me to feed on for ever and for ever, what has happened there.
I just take the liberty of running down the page a
{316}
little. The first thing to be noted particularly is that He is the Completer, the Leader. The word 'leader' means 'author'. The word 'leader' here is said to mean one who sets a thing on; one who is the originator of it. The Lord Jesus is the Originator in Himself of faith. You may look back and say Habakkuk spoke of it. You may say, Abel had it, and Abraham had it, but none of these was the author of it. Think of the importance, the magnitude of the importance of a person being the author of faith. Well, look into it then. Examine it. He is the Person; He is the Author of it. It is from Himself; it has come out of Himself, and He is the Completer of it. He has run the whole course of it, and I can look on Him. I hope you will not think, dear brethren, that I am stressing one thing too much. I hope not. There is a Person. He is in heaven now, said to be there. He has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. He is to be looked at. Now you can understand it is not as the disciples saw Him when He went up. It is while they looked on Him that He went up, but the cloud received Him out of their sight. But then that is not what I am talking about; I am talking about this matter of looking on Jesus in a spiritual way. As it says in the earlier part of this book, we are to look on Him. We are told in the early part of the book to look on Jesus in the sense of having accomplished redemption, but here we are to look on Him in view of examining, as I might say, analytically, if you will allow me to use that word, that there should be an analysis of this matter of faith, because it is a Person concretely; there is a Person whom you can see and see it there. It is there. He is the Author of the thing, but He has run the whole course of it, and the end of that course is that He has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. The word 'sitting' does not mean He is going to sit there for ever. He is not. He
{317}
is active. He is there in the sense of being quiet, staid, for the moment here that we might look at Him. I am sure that what I am saying is capable of being understood, although I may be stressing some words too much, but I am stressing this: that the Person is to be looked at and the Holy Spirit in us as believers will impress you and stress that you should look at Him; that you should learn to do it and that you can look at Him analytically, so to speak, and see how this thing called faith is actually there; that it has begun there and that He has demonstrated it. He has walked in it to the end of it, until He has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
Then, the next thing that I venture to call attention to is, "who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God". Now, look at what you can see spiritually; the enduring of the cross. Let my soul come up in activity at the thought of it, that He endured the cross. And what a cross! The forsaking of God. The cross was there. It was a gibbet. There were two others there. Physically it is a terrible thought, raised up on that gibbet; I suppose so as to be there with the other two. Think of it! You can look at Him. We are not called to look upon the other two, although they are there and we are glad to think of one of them who went up to heaven just immediately after Jesus. But think of Jesus, that we can look on Him. I cannot look on that man; he is a thief; but Jesus is the particular theme. Only Jesus can be spoken of in this way now, because He is the only One raised from the dead, and it is in Him all this can be seen. What I am stressing now is the terribleness of enduring the cross. But it was not simply that He was able to bear it, but there was joy in His heart. I cannot just put it too strong about what I am saying, but think of the sorrow that was there;
{318}
the forsaking of God, but the joy. I suppose we might say the Lord looked at all that objectively. You say, He felt it in Him. I think it is more accurate to say He looked at it objectively, the joy that was set before Him.
We have to learn to look at things objectively. The Lord Jesus had joy, but I should not be speaking of it exactly as experienced in His soul then because He was forsaken of God. It was terrible. But I can think of Him and see Him in the spiritual sense now as having endured all that. Think of what there is for the analysis, the spiritual analysis of the assembly, to go through all that. It is all there for us to look at, beloved; that the Lord Jesus was there enduring the cross. He was made sin. Who can understand that? Depict what that means? He was made sin. He who knew no sin was made sin. It was all so real and yet there it is. He is in heaven now and we can look at Him. "Looking stedfastly on Jesus". We may say that. But here it is "Looking stedfastly". Not on anything else, but just that one Person; looking stedfastly on Jesus who endured the cross, for the joy that was set before Him. He knew that. He knew it was set before Him. It was an incentive from the outset, but as I was saying I would prefer to think of it as objective in His own soul. He was thinking of what He was coming into at the moment He was enduring that awful cross; and then it is said further, "For consider well him". That is, to value Him "who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself". You can look at Him from that point of view, the contradiction of sinners, especially Jews. How contrary they have become; contrary to all men, we are told, as if sin in that character was allowed to work itself out in them; the contrariness that the Lord Jesus endured: the contradiction from sinners against Himself, as if it were not against any other but Himself. As you
{319}
look at that blessed Man, He has been through all that, and it is for our food. I am to partake of all that, as it were. The Lord Jesus speaks of our eating Himself, eating His flesh. I am only speaking of it in that sense; eating is appropriation, and if I look at it as to taking the thing in fully, it is appropriating that Man in the sense that He endured the contradiction of sinners against Himself.
And then, to just make a few more remarks because of the effect of it upon ourselves, "that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds", because things are coming and coming against us in our circumstances. We are apt to faint, but this passage is to tell us, to show us we are not to faint because of Jesus. He is so brought before us. It is so vivid, the Spirit making it vivid, so that you can fix your eyes stedfastly on that blessed Man.
Then, just to enlarge on @Proverbs 4:25, "Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee". It is not looking up now. It is the path here. You learn to focus your eyes that way, as I was already saying; not looking up; I have already dwelt on that; but look straight on. Do not turn aside to the right or to the left. Hence, "Let thine eyelids look straight before thee". I speak now to you young people, because you are so easily misdirected, turned aside by a little influence or something that happens, and you miss the great moment. The Lord is saying to us now, He is calling attention to the need of intentness and energy and purpose. All these organs of ours, whether it be the eyes or the feet -- whatever it be, for they are mentioned, too -- we are to see to it that we have proper balance and learn how to control ourselves. Flee youthful lusts. That is one of the things that helps the saints. Flee youthful lusts. "But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure
{320}
heart", @2 Timothy 2:22. Do not forget them; do not be an isolated person; do not be a single unit unattached. God hates unattached people. Good enough if you are detaching yourself from something evil, but not to remain unattached, because you are exposed to the devil if you are unattached. You want to get attached to the Lord's people. "Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart". That is all I had to say. You can see how this verse helps to recommend what I have been saying. "Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be well-ordered. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from evil". If it is touching it in the least measure, remove the foot. It is your member. You say, I am not doing very much harm. You know how to use the language to minimise wickedness, but it is wickedness. Remove your foot from it. Your foot belongs to you, and the Lord is saying, It belongs to Me, too, if you are Mine as you are. "Remove thy foot from evil". That is the word, dear brethren. May the Lord bless it to us!
{321}
THE SELECTION OF VESSELS
@Romans 9:23,24; @Acts 9:15,16; @2 Timothy 2:20,21
J.T. The subject proposed occasions opportunity to speak of divine choice in the selection of vessels; hence, extending back to the divine counsels and coming down to ourselves, as the word read in verse 23 indicates: "that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory, us, whom he has also called". So that the 'us' may apply at any time to those to whom it applies. 'Us' -- lifting us out of the mere circumstances of time and of human distinction into the divine way from the beginning and the divine choice, and that it reaches, as Peter says, even to us, for we are among those who are chosen, as we read, "that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory, us, whom he has also called, not only from amongst the Jews, but also from amongst the nations?" So that God brings the great subject down to ourselves; and, of course, it is with the thought that we might understand that the choice is not to go back, that it is made and applies to us who have our part publicly in history, but have seen that the choice is for us to value and understand and enjoy, qualifying us even for a variety of things, but it being basic directs us to divine choice and what it is intended for.
A.N.W. The excellence of the idea shows up, does it not, by the dark background and the contrary vessels which are said in the earlier verse to be fitted? I thought of the excellency of the word 'prepared' as distinct from 'fitted'. Vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, but these vessels of mercy prepared.
{322}
J.T. Very good.
A.N.W. It does not allow for the preparation for those vessels. That is not in the idea, is it?
J.T. Thus we can understand such men as Judas and the beast. It is said of Judas that he went to his own place, as if he were fitted for it in the sense of destruction, the word 'destruction' not meaning obliteration but in a moral sense. The lake of fire will afford thought for this matter when the time comes for the persons fitted for destruction; it will be found that their places were there. Terrible. You might say no one else can fill them. Each has his own place. Poor Judas went to his own place.
W.F.K. Are these vessels for service?
J.T. Those that we read about are, yes.
W.F.K. They obtain mercy first before they can serve.
J.T. Quite so. They are prepared, "which he had before prepared for glory", over against the dark, dark realm of the lost. Their identity remains; the identity of each remains. This present time, too, has afforded for us to solemnly picture to our minds what sin is. The man of sin is presently to come. These men who have already come and have gone sought, under Satan's influence, to take things into their own hands and shut God out. They have gone to their own place, and we cannot but be affected by the manner of their going. What sin is, and what a warning it is to any of us, to young people to abhor sin for it is lawlessness in whomsoever it may be; whether he be a great man as the world speaks, or an ordinary person very little known if at all, yet sin is lawlessness and the person who sins has his own place assigned to him according to the books. It is all written down. The books were opened, we are told, so that there is no doubt about it. Each is assigned his place, and the beast and the false prophet are, you might say, the first of living men, or men
{323}
who have part in history here to go into it. They are cast alive into the lake of fire.
A.N.W. Although that place was prepared for the devil and his angels, two men were the first to go into it.
J.T. There is a word which confirms what you say fully. I believe it is in @Isaiah 30:33, "For Topheth is prepared of old; for the king also it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large; its pile is fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it". I thought of that as you mentioned it; "for the king also it is prepared". Whether it be Satan or some great ones like him, it is prepared; God Himself ignites it.
C.E. As looking at these vessels of mercy, do you not think we ought to greatly value our position before God?
J.T. That is what I was thinking, that this afternoon it might come home to us what we are prepared for: "before prepared for glory". And now that the history has told out what has happened in the great scheme of redemption and the Spirit having come, it is for us to lay hold of the great fact and enjoy it and find ourselves fully prepared for glory.
F.H.L. In the beginning of @John 17 the Lord says, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me", @John 17:6. Would not the eleven appear as vessels of mercy prepared for glory as over against Judas?
J.T. Just so. None of them was lost but the son of perdition. There is the one singled out; the others were the prepared ones, prepared for glory.
A.R. When does this preparing take place?
J.T. It is a question, I would say, of history; a spiritual history, of course, but it is history, anyway, whatever it be. The preparation takes place in history, and when the time comes for the fulfilment of the prophetic word, that is, a prophetic word
{324}
indicating the divine mind, we shall see or we do see, indeed, how it is that the brethren are just of that kind characteristically. So that in @John 17, as it has just been remarked, the Lord speaks of those whom the Father gave Him. "Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee; as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal. And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". The eleven, as has just been remarked -- the twelve is the number designated or singled out in John's gospel peculiarly, but the others are also singled out as prepared for glory in the history of this book or this gospel and the other gospels, but particularly John shows how the preparation took place and how each fell into his niche in the scheme. So the test came in @John 6; it is a very long chapter in the book. The test came by certain going away. They went away back, we are told, and walked no more with Him. The Lord did not send any after them as if they could be saved; not but what that principle may arise too, because it does: persons who go away are saved, restored, but these apparently are not: those alluded to in chapter 6. The Lord says, "Will ye also go away?" The 'ye' refers to the eleven, although publicly it referred to Judas as well; he was there. The Lord made it plain that he spoke of Judas, that he was a devil. There is no hope of a devil being saved, none at all. He will never be saved; he is fitted for destruction. And now in history when the test comes out Peter answers the Lord saying, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal", @John 6:68, just as we had it in chapter 17. The Lord was in the place of giving there and they were the ones who were examples of those who should receive it; as many as the Father gave Him that they should have
{325}
eternal life. Peter says, however, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and *we* have believed and known", meaning that this brings out who they are, and how we can discern that they are the ones, or examples of the ones who are prepared; they are prepared before. Hence, Peter announces the fact that they had believed and known that Christ was the holy One of God. And then the Lord says, "Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil", @John 6:70, so as to remove any possible doubt as to Judas, that he was a devil, not a demon but a devil; that is different from demons; he was a devil.
R.W.S. Is there a link between these vessels of mercy before prepared for glory and the good works which God has before prepared in Ephesians? I thought of what you said in regard to history, what enters into history. It seems that God has prepared the vessels and God has prepared the good works for the vessels. He has prepared the persons and then He has prepared the good works that we should walk in them.
J.T. That is good, showing that the purpose of God is exemplified in the persons who are chosen; it is exemplified in their good works. The good works themselves are ordained or prepared for them, all showing that God is the Source of everything for Himself.
J.S. Is Judas one who resisted His purpose? "Who resists his purpose?" @Romans 9:19.
J.T. It is said in the verse you allude to, "Thou wilt say to me then, Why does he yet find fault? for who resists his purpose?" This is a challenging voice, challenging God; the natural mind lifting itself up to challenge God.
J.S. It enters into history, does it not?
J.T. Just so. The apostle says, "Aye, but thou, O man, who art *thou* that answerest again to God?
{326}
Shall the thing formed say to him that has formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour? And if God, minded to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction". So that the answer is overwhelming; a worm of the dust, as we might say, undertaking to challenge God in what He is doing.
J.S. Hence Judas went to his own place.
J.T. Quite so.
A.R. Does the preparing take place before we are born, as with Jacob and Esau?
J.T. Well, that is another thing that comes up, but the thought of God was there before as in the case of Esau, before they were born, before they knew anything to do good or evil, we are told in the early part of the chapter. That raises a great deal of question. It says in @Genesis 2, "These are the histories of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth and heavens, and every shrub of the field before it was in the earth", @Genesis 2:4,5. There are concurrent facts alluded to, but it is before the thing happened, before the purpose grew. The purpose of God is there and He knows it, but the question is, Who else knows it until history brings it out? So again, another illustration that some of us have had before us lately is in @Psalm 139: "I will praise thee, for I am fearfully, wonderfully made. Marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. My bones were not hidden from thee when I was made in secret, curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my unformed substance, and in thy book all my members were written; during many days were they fashioned, when as yet there was none of them", @Psalm 139:14 - 16. So that we are
{327}
challenged as to how much we know as to these abstract or inactual things that would become actual presently. We are challenged as to whether we can know these things or whether they are not just within the divine realm of knowledge alone, whether we can say when they happen and whether we can distinguish between the abstract happening and the concrete happening.
A.N.W. In that connection, would you emphasise the words 'in him' in @Ephesians 1, where we are told He has chosen us before the world's foundation? That would be the abstract thought and what is not actual. Would you underline the words 'in him'?
J.T. Just so. The 'in him' would have some actual being or existence but whether the creature mind can take that in is a question, or whether it does not belong to the divine mind alone. How can we say that we are chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world? That is intelligible, but it is a question whether we can take that further; whether there is in some sense a concrete evidence which only the divine mind could speak of. Therefore, is it not so that we can begin with the choice in Christ before the foundation of the world as having in the divine mind at any rate an actual person although from the other point of view only abstract, awaiting the concrete, until we are actually in existence by the work of God?
W.R. The scripture really makes it very searching for us: vessels of mercy.
J.T. It does, indeed, make it very testing for us as to what we are actually engaged in at this moment, and what it is possible for us to be engaged in. We have to regard God from the time of the beginning of His purpose, that everything was there before Him. I would think, for instance, take any one of us -- God could look on to him walking here on the earth. The works that God had prepared for him to walk in
{328}
were before the mind of God. Why can God not thus speak of things? Why can He not? And why cannot we, by the Spirit, lay hold of these great things and see how great the things are that we are engaged in, and how we should lay aside all else in view of them?
A.P.T. The last verse of @Psalm 22:31 reads, "They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it". That is a prophetic touch, is it not, in relation to what God has in His mind? Would that fit in with what God has in His mind in relation to persons coming into blessing?
J.T. I think the Psalm contemplates the concrete in some sense. It is a prophetic word. @Psalm 22 is well known to us -- the great sorrow psalm of the Lord Jesus, the great suffering psalm in which He was forsaken of God and the consequences of it. So the psalmist does not stop until he tells us about the concrete results, and the first great one is in @Psalm 22:22: "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and revere him, all ye the seed of Israel". That is history, but it is prophecy before it is history. The Lord in speaking of the results of His redemptive work says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren". That is a prophetic announcement that the Lord would have brethren but the Lord had to wait for that. It requires the full redemptive work of Christ for the concrete thing to come into existence. Well now, that is verse 22. @Psalm 22:30 says, "A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation". That is prophetic. "They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born", that still is future and prophetic but it is presently going to be and has now become a fact: namely, a people
{329}
shall be born. "They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it". When the concrete comes into full evidence, the testimony will be that the Lord Jesus has done it but counsel was there before. And God can begin with counsel; as it says He can call the things that be not as though they were, and hence, God can look down the ages and see us as we are here today. In eternal ages He can look down and see us as we are here today and as we shall be in eternity, so that the history really begins with God; whether we treat it as prophetic history or actual history it begins with God.
C.F.N. So in connection with what you read from @John 17:6 the word is, "They were thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word". Those three sentences enter into what you have in mind -- purpose. "They were thine, and thou gavest them me", would be history, and "they have kept thy word", would be a concrete idea.
J.T. Quite so; the fulfilment of the works that God had prepared, that they should walk in them.
R.W.S. That really affected Paul, I suppose, so that he says, "O depth of riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counsellor? or who has first given to him, and it shall be rendered to him? For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen", @Romans 11:33 - 36.
J.T. Very wonderful, because it brings the whole matter together, as it were, of the divine counsels and the concrete result of them. All come together in the mind and in the fact, too, so that we are obligated now according to what we have been saying to look into these matters and see whether we are able to go on with them in any practical way. It
{330}
says, "that he might make known the riches of his glory", not simply that that might be in counsel but "that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory, us, whom he has also called, not only from amongst the Jews, but also from amongst the nations?" @Romans 9:23. So that we have actual evidences now.
A.I. Would you link in any way with these exalted thoughts which you are expressing to us, the man in @1 Corinthians 5? How would you link him on with this idea of vessels of mercy?
J.T. Do you mean the man that was put away? Do you want to bring out that that man is prepared for glory? Fully. He vindicated himself in that according to the second epistle. They had brought the tidings to the apostle of what had come about and he rejoiced. It is the bringing out of the very thing we are speaking of. It is not only that he should be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus but he was already saved in the present day. The day of the Lord Jesus would allude to the future, but it also includes the assembly's day; the day in which great things are happening in the members of the assembly.
A.R. God has put us in relation to each other in His sovereignty. That is a great point, is it?
J.T. That is the practical point as to what we are going on with and what it means to us. Does it mean anything at all to us that we can talk of these things and picture ourselves as in them, as prepared for glory? The time of glory in one sense according to Romans is come, because it says, "but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified", @Romans 8:30. The thing has taken place already in the presence of the Spirit in us.
J.A.P. The Holy Spirit in that way helps us to be concrete. It says, "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that
{331}
love him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit", @1 Corinthians 2:9.
J.T. So that the thing, according to Paul's method in Corinth, has already taken form; and the brethren, I am sure, will remember in referring back to the two letters to Corinth how much Paul says about himself in both epistles, and what can it be but to bring before them that he was realising the thing that he was speaking of? God has revealed them to us by His Spirit; so that he would say that to them to the end that if young persons there perhaps were not going in much for things -- Paul is an example, and so is Timothy. So he says, "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ", @1 Corinthians 4:17. The thing was taking form, and why not? It is the assembly's day. It is the Spirit's day, and it is Christ's day, too, in a sense, but especially the Spirit's day. This dispensation may be regarded as the Spirit's day and what He is doing.
A.P.T. Peter puts the Spirit of glory first. He says, "For the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you", @1 Peter 4:14. That is rather interesting, that he puts it in that way. It rests on the saints now. Is there something in that?
J.T. Quite so.
A.P.T. It rests on you: would that be the way we move in and out amongst the brethren?
J.T. Quite so -- what you say. Take Stephen as an example. All that were in the council looked on him and saw his face as it had been the face of an angel, @Acts 6:15; a heavenly being, you might say, already.
W.R. Would you have this same thought worked out in @Hebrews 2. I was wondering as to the divine choice in the selection of the vessel. "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to
{332}
make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings", @Hebrews 2:10. So that you have the vessels there and the Lord Jesus the perfect Vessel, as it were.
J.T. Yes, the perfect Vessel, and He is perfected; not in the sense that He was not perfect at any time in the ordinary sense, but He is perfected through sufferings. He had not gone through death yet, and He needed to come through death in the sense of suffering so that the perfection might take form in Him; and, therefore, we are associated with Him. The author of our salvation is made perfect through sufferings. We are perfected, too, in that we are of Him. As it says, "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren", @Hebrews 2:11. Therefore, the thing has already taken place and it must be so if the assembly has concrete evidence, and it has concrete evidence.
J.A.P. Peter and John say, "Look on us", @Acts 3:4. Would that man be a vessel of mercy prepared for glory?
J.T. Quite so. "Look on us". So that Paul was concerned that that which was behind of the sufferings of Christ should be filled out. There was something behind. The saints were lagging behind, I would think, especially at Corinth, but he had in mind that the whole matter should be filled out and that involves suffering. Therefore, the assembly comes out both in time and eternity as the wife of the Lamb; that is, the Sufferer. She belongs to Him; she is the filling out of Himself as the Sufferer.
W.F.K. Would you regard @Acts 9 as an example of the elect vessel?
J.T. I thought we might see that as to the saints -- for use. An elect vessel to Me, the Lord says; the Lord, as it were, making him elect in a special way, for use in the assembly. He is showing how things are to be done.
{333}
W.F.K. He has to go to the assembly first and be told there.
J.T. Quite so. That, of course, would come into it, but the great thought the Lord had in a very concrete way was, He is an elect vessel unto me, @Acts 9:15, and He said that because Ananias was questioning him. He was not sure. He did not think the Lord could be right about that, but how serious that is. Ananias was not like Judas; Judas complained about Mary of Bethany, but Ananias complained about Paul, telling the Lord how he had heard certain things about him, but the Lord says, He is an elect vessel unto Me. The Lord silenced all that in Ananias and saved Ananias for service to this great servant.
R.W.S. Is there a difference between Peter being made something and Paul being an elect vessel?
J.T. I would think that as to the word 'elect'. What a vessel he was! What pleasure the Lord must have had in him! "An elect vessel unto me"; not simply an elect vessel, but unto the Lord. I suppose the Lord would say there is none like him. There is only one Paul. He had to do a great work, and that work would culminate in the assembly; hence, the allusion in Ephesians particularly and many other places to that: "With a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ", @Ephesians 4:12,13. Paul was in all that. It was in the Lord's mind equal in value to the thing itself that there should be such a vessel, such workmanship.
D.P. What is the thought in @Jeremiah 18 about the vessels there? One of the vessels was marred in the potter's hand. "And the vessel that he made was marred, as clay, in the hand of the potter; and he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to
{334}
the potter to make", @Jeremiah 18:4. What is the thought in that?
J.T. I would think that would be the trial with the first man as compared with the complete success of the second. He establishes the second. That is the principle that comes out there, and enters into what we are saying. He takes away the first that He might establish the second. The second was what was in the Lord's mind. Adam was not in His counsels at all in the sense of which we are talking of them. He is taken away in the sense of being the first. Adam must come into the second on another principle; that is, the principle of the counsels of God and the work of God as a believer. Adam must come in as a believer, but the point is that Jeremiah sees the worker on the wheels. "The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words". As if God would let the historical speak and simplify His words. God could have done this without the prophet going down to the potter's house, but He is going to show His words by the actual facts. Hence, it says, "And I went down to the potter's house; and behold, he wrought a work on the wheels". This is the trial; we must connect this with Adam's formation. "And the vessel that he made was marred, as clay, in the hand of the potter; and he made it again another vessel". This brings us down to the second, that is, Christ: "another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make". "Seemed good" -- notice that; the word 'seemed' would allude to eternal purpose. "And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, House of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith Jehovah. Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, house of Israel. At the moment that I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to break down, and to
{335}
destroy, if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, then I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at the moment that I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant, if it do evil in my sight, that it hearken not unto my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them. And now, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I prepare evil against you, and devise a device against you: turn ye then every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings". That is, receive the gospel, you might say; how God tested out the first subject, and, of course, He had a right to make a test, to make a trial, to bring out what Adam was, what that type of man was; but then He had in His mind all the time the second Man out of heaven, and that is what this alludes to, as it says here, "And the vessel that he made was marred, as clay, in the hand of the potter; and he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make". That brings out what God has effected in Christ.
A.N.W. It says "as clay" in @Jeremiah 18:4; it is like @Romans 9:21; the clay is referred to. In Jeremiah there is a broken vessel that is never mended.
J.T. That is all very solemn and no doubt some of us have gone over it in gospel services and the like, but it all is seen worked out in the redemptive work of Christ -- how the fact is established.
F.H.L. Would you not say that the Lord was preparing Saul during the three days? He takes the clay and makes the vessel to honour, it says, @2 Timothy 2:20?
J.T. Would you read on, please.
F.H.L. You were referring to the scripture as to his being an elect vessel. I was wondering if spiritual formation to make the vessel was not in view in the three days of blindness.
{336}
J.T. Quite so. It was all what the Lord Jesus had in His mind, and He would work out a man like Himself in the divine service, and hence the wonderful results in Paul's ministry. Take, for instance, @Ephesians 3. He says to the Ephesians, "ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery of the Christ", @Ephesians 3:4. What a workman he was! What intelligence he had!
A.I. Does the apostle have in mind what we are speaking of when he says in @Romans 12:1, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service"? Would presenting our bodies enter into what you are saying in relation to the vessel?
J.T. That is just it. When you come to the hortatory part of the epistle you see the doctrine of the epistle worked out practically in chapter 12. Then you have the work of God coming into mind in the chapter we read in Acts. What a thought God had as to the kind of man; he is an elect vessel unto me, the Lord says. As the Father thought of the Son, the second Man out of heaven -- so Paul would be the continuation of that; not, of course, a divine Person, just a creature, but still wonderfully wrought out for the perfection of God's work in the assembly.
A.P.T. We should try to help everyone that is on this line. Our position in the testimony should be to help every brother whom God is taking up, not having any jealousy or anything like that; but help the brother. He is an elect vessel; help him along in the work.
J.T. Do you mean a weak brother?
A.P.T. I was thinking of Ananias. He was more or less trying to dictate to the Lord about this servant. I only suggested that we should try to help any brother whom the Lord has elected to serve Him and His people.
{337}
J.T. Make the most of him. It is a question of what the Lord has taken up, however weak. The work is going on and we all have our part in it. That is very practical for all of us.
Rem. I noticed you brought forward the vessel prepared for glory before the vessel for service. Had you anything in your mind?
J.T. The selection of the scriptures was very deliberate and we are dealing now with the question of service, what comes out in the servant, an elect vessel in the service; not a saint but a servant; not a son but a servant. It has a great place in Scripture as anybody will see who looks into it -- the idea of a vessel for God's pleasure.
Rem. There are gradations, so to speak, in the vessel.
J.T. Just so.
A.N.W. You can carry election back prior to his birth and then the setting apart at his birth, and then the calling, I suppose, on the way to Damascus.
J.T. Quite so.
C.F.N. So that his service would be coloured by the service of Christ. As he serves he would reflect glory.
J.T. What a servant may be in the Lord's mind in the classified sense, because He has a classified system of servants. He has His Paul, "an elect vessel unto me", and He has His John, whom Jesus loved, and He has His Peter, and so we cannot number them; but there are classifications.
G.F.N. So that here, as you say, it is very dignified. It says, "to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel".
J.T. The Lord had all that in mind to work out this wonderful vessel that was there before Ananias. The Lord had all that in His mind about him, and
{338}
Ananias takes it upon him to question the Lord Jesus Himself about him.
J.S. You would regard Paul as in training from his birth up?
J.T. He was taken up in that sense and even things he did before he was converted could be turned into account. The Lord could turn them into account.
A.R. The eleven were selected on the basis of sovereignty. Paul's selection is really greater in that sense than the eleven.
J.T. Just so; "last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to *me* also".
A.P.T. In @1 Corinthians 12 which you quoted in prayer at the outset, you referred to "And God has set certain in the assembly", @1 Corinthians 12:28, and then prior to that it says, "God has set the members, each one of them in the body", @1 Corinthians 12:18. How do you view those two thoughts in relation to service and anyone that God may take up like Paul?
J.T. I think it comes under the head of what we are saying; the head of classification. We are not all of the same value. It says in @1 Corinthians 12, "And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues", etc. The same would apply in principle to the body. "Now *ye* are Christ's body, and members in particular", @1 Corinthians 12:27. We are not all of the same value, but each has his own value, and that is what gives variety and such pleasure in the Lord's mind, and what pleasure He had in Paul; "an elect vessel unto me".
And then as regards the passage in Timothy so as to keep to the subject, you see how fitting it is that it should be brought up in Timothy -- this question of the great house, as if God would have that brought
{339}
into this subject. What is pictured in the great house is the great profession today of servants. It says, "But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour, and some to dishonour". That would indicate there are many who are not really converted at all. But then what one had in mind was this matter applied to the profession of Christianity, persons who are viewed as vessels -- whether they are unto honour or dishonour. And verse 21 says, "If therefore one shall have purified himself from these" (that is, vessels unto dishonour), then we have the interpolation of the words there, "in separating himself from them" -- these words are necessary to the understanding of the passage, that it implies separation. A person might say, It is not in the original, but it is a question of spiritual intelligence as putting in words that are needed to give the sense, the full sense of the Spirit of God in this passage. So that separation is needed to bring out in the persons who are ministering professedly, whether they are real or not. If they are not real they have to be separated from; a very solemn matter, whether we are allied with persons who are not really Christians, because the apostle says elsewhere, "lest after having preached to others I should be myself rejected", @1 Corinthians 9:27. That is a very strong word, meaning he would not be saved at all. And so here persons who are to dishonour, who are questionable, you cannot say they are Christians, or that God so classifies them, and He says we must separate from them to be serviceable to the Master. We are constituted vessels to honour and sanctified and serviceable to the Master and prepared unto every good work if we are separate from vessels to dishonour. I thought it would be necessary to add this thought for us practically as to service in the midst of a mixed profession.
{340}
W.R. So that Paul can really hold himself up not only to Timothy but to the saints at large as a model believer. He speaks of his ways and manner of life.
J.T. Quite so. He sends Timothy to the Corinthians to illustrate that.
Rem. I suppose we see the thought of separation in the latter clause of verse 19 as taking on the Name?
J.T. "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". It is that truth turned around into the great house principle.
J.A.P. Is Daniel representative of this? Nebuchadnezzar took the vessels from Jerusalem but Daniel always maintained the principle of separation.
J.T. Quite so.
A.N.W. While vessels to honour are mentioned in verse 20, they do not seem to appear really until this separation has taken place as in verse 21. There are vessels to honour and some to dishonour in verse 20, but the vessels to honour really come to light in separating themselves from the others.
J.T. Otherwise you would hardly discern them. If you meet with persons who are serving the Lord and they are mixing with worldly people who are serving, too, you can hardly discern the difference. There must be separation. That is why the translator put in these words that are in brackets, "in separating himself from them". He marks himself off in that sense as acceptable.
R.W.S. It is the Lord in @Acts 9 but it is the Despot here in 2 Timothy. In verse 21 it is 'Master', and the note says, 'despot'. He will brook no interference. He will not use one who is mixed with unclean vessels.
J.T. Just so. It makes it very solemn as to the persons who are turned out as ministers in the colleges and what the Master is going to say about them, whether they will pass muster or not.
{341}
W.F.K. According to this scripture you are not serviceable unless you are separated, and yet persons are converted through them.
J.T. You have to leave that. You must also remember that you cannot always be sure of the converts that are spoken of.
{342}
PROMISE
@Hebrews 6:13 - 20
I have in mind to speak about promise, dear brethren, and I have selected this passage as a very appropriate one as I hope to show, and one calculated to establish us in the subject; for the very thought of the subject by itself is establishing; and we need establishing, every one of us. The introduction of Abraham in this section is intended particularly to establish us in the matter in hand, because the matter in hand and the subject proposed were worked out peculiarly in Abraham. It is said here that after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise. That is, he had that experience. God is pleased to signalise His children and His servants, and it is because they have signalised themselves, in answering to the divine proposal that may be intended in them. The idea of promise is peculiarly linked up with Abraham and he signalised himself in the thought of promise. As we have read, he obtained it. This epistle is intended to set us up in the obtaining of things set out in our souls, that they are not mere academical things, but things of real value in the soul and to be sought after, stretched out for. This marked the history of Abraham; he obtained the promise. He obtained other things, too, but this is what is stressed here, and I bring it forward so that we may have in mind, if we have set out in any spiritual way, not to lag behind or give up in weariness but to stretch forward to secure the prize, so that we may not seem to come short. Many do appear in this way, and it is not, of course, in any sense in one's mind to criticise but rather to point out that we need to have ideals, and God has ideals and pursues them and follows them
{343}
up and secures them, establishes them, makes them verities in the souls of His people.
Abraham is selected purposely as a particular saint that is to be spoken of at this time and it is in relation to promise. Now the idea of promise is very wide and extends back to the very roots of time; and, therefore, God has made a wise selection in bringing forward Abraham so as to exemplify this point in him. As I was saying, the subject is very wide. If we only had time we could enlarge on it very much, enlarge on it for three days, anyway, as we sometimes do in subjects with the brethren. I think it is a good limit of time, because we have opportunity to expand our affections and minds into a subject, to grapple with a subject and see what is worked out in it so that we may partake of the thing that is worked out.
Now, as I said, the subject is wide and it is seen particularly in the initial books of scripture. It is seen in the higher scriptural records but very little, very little enlarged on in the epistle to the Ephesians, for instance, and in the epistle to the Colossians and the epistle to the Philippians, and these are very significant facts as to our subject. You will find it largely spoken of in the great epistle to the Romans, the great gospel epistle; and also in the epistle to the Galatians. And now this epistle that I have read from, Hebrews, is full of it, and it is clearly, dear brethren, because these epistles -- Romans, Galatians and Hebrews -- are dealing with young Christians; not simply young in years but persons who have not been Christians very long and whose experience in Christianity is not very deep, as if God is grappling with that state in His saints; that we should not remain in shallowness, content to know just enough to get through. God is not satisfied with that at all. He has gone to great pains to set the truth out for us and He expects us to correspond in some way to what He has done. The blessed God is labouring all
{344}
the time, and the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit, and the spiritual among the saints are labouring all the time. Maybe some of you do not know that, that some saints are labouring all the time, but they are. Paul laboured all the time, day and night, and many like him. It all is to set out what God's thought is, that the saints may not be shallow or mere excuses for Christianity, but grounded in it, growing in it, too, enlarged in it, enjoying it. It is worth enjoying. It is something worth going in for. There is nothing else worth going in for. We shall find as we grow older, as we no doubt will in the mercy of God, and as going on in the truth, we shall find what has just been said.
And so it is that these epistles that I have mentioned are full of this truth, and the book of Revelation too. "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place", @Revelation 1:1. These things involve promise, because the saints need to be sustained by promises. So the Lord says, "Behold, I come quickly, and my reward with me", @Revelation 22:12, and again in @Revelation 22:16, "*I*, Jesus, have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies". Not elsewhere, not to men who have made prophecy a study; not that God is at all against the study of the prophetic books, but He is concerned about people who are affected by the prophetic word, moved by it. And therefore the Lord says, "I, Jesus, have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies. *I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". And, "Yea, I come quickly". These are promises, and so also is the word to Philadelphia. "I come quickly", He says, @Revelation 3:11. That epistle, called the epistle to Philadelphia, is full of promise. "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage
{345}
before thy feet", @Revelation 3:9. Think of that. Would you not like to be among them? You say, Worshipped by those that say they are Jews and are not? Yes. The Lord says, I am going to make them to do it, make them worship before thy feet. And why? Because, He says, I want them to know that I love you. That is His word to the Philadelphian saints: "they ... shall know that *I* have loved thee", @Revelation 3:9? I wonder how many of us love Jesus. And then, How many of us know that Jesus loves us and that Jesus loves the assembly? "They ... shall know that I have loved thee". Jesus died for the assembly. These are the great subjects of knowledge to the persons who are spiritual, those who love Christ; and these meetings are to make us spiritual.
Well now, as I have said, these books are particularly marked by promise: the epistle to the Romans because it is a basic gospel epistle; the epistle to the Galatians because it is a recovering epistle; it is the Lord going after the saints that are going wrong as to doctrine; not exactly in worldliness although worldliness usually goes with bad doctrine, but the Galatians were getting bad doctrine. And then, the Hebrews were about to give up Christianity altogether, some of them, not all of them, but there was a general trend among the Hebrew Christians at that time to give up Christianity, and hence the thought of promise is so prevalent in the epistle to the Hebrews. These are three outstanding epistles that we should all read and study and concern ourselves with, so that we may be established in the truth of God and not fall away. Hence, in Hebrews the writer says, "if he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him", @Hebrews 10:38? You say. What does it matter? Who is speaking? Only Paul, maybe. But it is the voice of God; it is the voice of Jesus. He is representative of Jesus. As Paul says (I believe it is Paul who wrote the epistle) that we may be sure it is the mind of Christ.
{346}
If any one draws back from pursuing Christianity you may be sure the Lord has no pleasure in you. That is most serious. "If he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him".
Well now, coming back to my text about Abraham as the one that is especially signalised to treat of this subject, he connects it with Abraham as introduced here, and God is spoken of in the word here as intervening by an oath; a most remarkable thing. And what for? It is as @Hebrews 6:17 says, "Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath". God has intervened in what He is saying and doing by an oath so as to show the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose. In other words, what He has said He means, and if you do not believe it you are disbelieving God. You do not want to be left like that, as a disbeliever of God. No one here, I am sure, would like to be left on the earth as a disbeliever of God. If you are, you shall certainly be left here for a while but not very long. We have been speaking of most solemn things this afternoon: what unbelieving persons are fitted for, destruction. What an awful thing to be fitted for destruction! You know, the word 'destruction' there does not really mean what is ordinarily meant in the sense of destruction, as if they are obliterated and entirely wiped out of existence. It does not mean that at all. The persons remain. The beast and the false prophet were taken alive and cast into the lake of fire. That is what happened. There is no idea of their being destroyed. They are fitted for destruction, but it is destruction in the sense in which the unbeliever, the ungodly is consigned to eternal perdition. It is suffering; "where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched", @Mark 9:48. It is not destruction in any other sense than that; and so, if you are an unbeliever in God, a disbeliever
{347}
in God, these things will follow in time. And you do not want to continue, if there is one here who is a disbeliever in God, you do not want to continue in that state. It is an awful thing. Think of it for a moment! You are showing yourself to be fitted for destruction, and such destruction as I have described. Therefore, God has intervened or interposed by an oath in this treatise, this wonderful treatise of the epistle to the Hebrews. When he comes to this matter of the promise he stops, as it were, and says, Now I will swear on this matter. You say. Well, what does the word 'swearing' mean when God is in question? Well, it is Scripture. The reference is to @Genesis 22 in which there were two interventions of God. The first one was when Abraham had raised his hand or his arm to slay his son Isaac, and the angel intervened from heaven to say to Abraham, Now I know what you are. I want to read it. That is the first intervention in that chapter. It is the chapter that is alluded to in my passage; @Genesis 22. You all remember the journey by Abraham and his son Isaac to Mount Moriah. What a journey it was of father and son. It is God's way of telling us of His own affections for His beloved Son in view of the death of that beloved Son, and so that you young people would begin to think of these things. It is a beautiful, a most wonderful passage in @Genesis 22. In @Genesis 22:6 it says, "And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and the knife, and they went both of them together. And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said. My father!" Would that the dear young men and young women, boys especially, and girls would let their hearts out a bit and think of the feelings of God; the Father and the Son in this passage. "And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the sheep for a burnt-offering? And
{348}
Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself with the sheep". It is not 'a' sheep; it is "the" sheep, a full-grown creature, "for a burnt-offering. And they went both of them together. And they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built the altar there, and piled the wood; and he bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to slaughter his son". Notice that. He "took the knife to slaughter his son. And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens, and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I. And he said, Stretch not out thy hand against the lad, neither do anything to him; for now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me", @Genesis 22:16.
Now, this is the first intervention. God has interposed here. He interposed when Abraham lifted up his hand with the knife in it, as if God waited to see the effect of His work coming out there. And that is what it was. "Stretch not out thy hand against the lad". That voice came out of heaven. It was God intervening to stop the action. It was a question of God's work in His servant, in His child, as you might say. Dear brethren, that is what is in mind in what we are saying now. It is the work of God in our souls. Is it there or is it not? If it is not there we are simply valueless. Not that I am seeking to discourage anybody, but that is the truth. Without the work of God there is nothing, and God is saying here of Abraham, I know there is a work in that man; I know my work has taken effect in that man, and hence He establishes the procedure. He says the thing is out; the truth is out, that is what is out, that Abraham is genuinely a subject of the work of God.
Well, it says, "And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens, and said, Abraham, Abraham!
{349}
and he said, here am I. And he said, Stretch not out thy hand against the lad, neither do anything to him; for now I know" -- as if He did not know before, but He did know before. He is now bringing out what He knew was there, and that is His work in His child, as we might say, in Abraham -- "for now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me". We had already today what Paul was to God, to Christ: an elect vessel to Him. "And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind was a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh; as it is said at the present day, On the mount of Jehovah will be provided", @Genesis 22:14.
Now, as I have already intimated, Abraham is here clearly brought into evidence as a subject of the work of God and God says, That is all I want now, and I challenge my own heart as to what God finds in me now. He says, I have more to say; I have more to work out in you, but I want to say something now, and that is the first intervention of God in the passage. There is no oath there. It is not the time for the oath yet. Abraham did not really need it yet. Abraham would be assured from the voice of the Angel that he was a subject of God's work and that God was pleased with him. God has just said to him, "now I know". That is, He knew as the word says, "now I know that thou fearest God". Let every one of us challenge his heart. Do we fear God? God says to Abraham, I know it now. Well, you say, He knew it before. Surely He did. He knows everything but He would bring this out and have Abraham to understand that He fully understood what the action of Abraham really meant, that he was an obedient man, that he did what he was told to do. As I said, we are challenged, every one of us, by this word.
{350}
God is saying, when you are obedient I will tell you, and when you are not obedient I will tell you. God is not going to keep us in a state of disobedience without telling us, nor is He going to leave us in a state of obedience without telling us. He would say to us, I have pleasure in you in that you are obedient. So it is with children, young people. There is the first commandment with promise, and that is to be obedient. God tells you He has pleasure in you as obedient to your parents. He has pleasure in you. You may say, well, there is obedience to God; yes, but obedience to parents, too; they are representative of God and obedience to parents is really in a sense more valuable in the eyes of God than professed obedience to God. He has set up parents for a purpose. The relation of parents is divinely set in order to bring out what the work of God is in the child. It is a remarkable time. The things that have happened just now are most remarkable and I am certain the children are in mind, the generation coming. What are they learning? What are they learning from their parents? Their parents are greatly distressed in the things that have happened abroad among the nations. Every right-minded parent is distressed about these things and he is thinking of his children; how the conditions are affecting his children; and so God speaks of obedience as a commandment with promise. God makes a promise in regard to obedience to parents. "Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be prolonged in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee", @Exodus 20:12. Not to join the war, nor the army or the navy or the air force. No. I am not saying a word as to what the governments are doing; far otherwise; but I am saying something to children who have parents who are Christians, that the promise that God makes to you is in regard to the land which the Lord God has given you to enjoy. But how to
{351}
enjoy? To enjoy in faithfulness to Him, in obedience to Christ and obedience to parents and to the brethren. It is a question of faith and obedience. The "obedience of faith to all the nations", @Romans 16:26. That is what God is aiming at. It is a great moment especially for parents; to join in in this matter with God. God would say to us that He knows; He knows what the parents are going through. "Now I know", He says to Abraham. Not that He did not know before, but He wants Abraham to know that He has just come to see that Abraham is a godly man; that he fears God. It is one of the greatest things to get into your soul that God knows. Just now He has come to see and He knows you are godly and fear Him; He comes out of heaven to tell you. There is no oath attached to that. The second time refers to something else. It is an oath, as if God were to say, Abraham has much more. Not indeed that God did not know, but God speaks as man sometimes. "I speak as a man", Paul says, and so does God sometimes speak as a man. So the second time it is an oath, and it is as if God were to say to parents here and children, too, that He has come to see something in you, in all of us, more than He thought was there. You say, Well, I should be thankful that I came here today if I just thought that was so, that God has found out something in me that He never saw in me before; not that God would speak just that way, but I am paraphrasing what is said in this chapter. Surely we all want to have the sense that at an occasion like this God is among us and that God is saying something; that God is assuring us that He has some little encouragement, using that word with some reserve, in the fact that we are here and enjoying the truth and in some little way laying ourselves out to go in for it. For the Spirit is here to show us all the truth. He shall guide you into all the truth, the Lord Jesus says, @John 16:13.
{352}
And now, if it is evident today that there is progress, heaven is moving. Heaven indeed moved here. God moved first to tell Abraham that He knew now that Abraham feared Him; but the second movement is to tell him more than that. It is to swear to him. Understand what I am saying. I am speaking from Scripture. The word 'swear' is used. What is it used for? He intervened by an oath. That is the word, that the immutability of His counsel should be understood by His people. That is what it says here as I have just read to you. "Wherein God, willing", notice that, showing the disposition of His mind, "willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath". He has come in, as it were, a second time in the scene. The first time He is so pleased with Abraham that He tells him, I have just found out that you are a godly man; that you fear Me; not that He did not know before. That is the first visit in the chapter. It is to assure Abraham's heart. The second visit is what I have already alluded to. It is to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose. Hence, it is not simply that He says something, but He swears it. Let us understand the idea of an oath.
Well now, this second intervention refers to more than the first, as I have already said. I will read it in @Genesis 22:15, "And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from the heavens a second time, and said. By myself I swear, saith Jehovah". Now that word 'saith' is peculiar; it has a peculiar force. It is said to be a Hebrew word introducing an oracular discourse. It is not used in the first visit; it is the second visit. God is, as it were, clothing this second visit with great things so as to assure us of what is before us and what He is saying. And so the note reads, as I said, 'The Hebrew word introduces an oracular discourse and is an affirmation'. That is to
{353}
say, this matter of the oath is a permanent thing and God would show this to the heirs of the promise, notice, the heirs of the promise, not simply the believers; not simply everybody in this hall, but the heirs of the promise. We are all before God in this; it is an affirmation and He is swearing about it. What He is saying is for you and it is for you to go in for it, to lay hold of it, to enjoy it.
Well now, I want to bring out another thing further in this passage from verse 15 down. It reads thus, "By myself I swear, saith Jehovah, that, because thou hast done this, and hast not withheld thy son". It is not now that he has slain his son, but he has not withheld him. He is ready to give him up. God is saying this as if He a second time stopped him in the procedure, and He would say, I want to say something more to Abraham. I have not said enough to Abraham; I want to confirm all I have said to him and to enlarge it that it may be in his soul for ever; that he may be to Me what he has never been to Me before. That is the principle, and hence the oath.
Well now, another thing that comes to my mind is this second intervention of God and what attached to it is accompanied by an incident that gives character to the whole passage. I am not referring now to the fact that Rebecca is mentioned in the chapter which is of great importance, too. Rebecca is mentioned, meaning the assembly is in the mind of God. The whole scene is being clarified; and, of course, as I said before, Abraham is to be made acquainted with all this, to be assured of it; to know that he is the subject of it; that he is to be a great saint. And so as I said, Rebecca is mentioned as begotten, because it is a question of the assembly, and Isaac -- Christ and the assembly. As Paul says with great emphasis, "*I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly", @Ephesians 5:32. This is the great eternal
{354}
thought, and Paul was full of it, as we had it today. "I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly". Well, that is what happens. The assembly in type comes into view in this wonderful chapter, but what is more important is that the incident I allude to refers to Isaac as not coming down from the mount, as if Jehovah were to say, Isaac and Abraham went up to the mount, but Isaac is not said to have come back from the mount. Surely that is a further bit of information in this setting. Someone has gone up; as Moses went up on the mount in the wilderness. Jehovah said, You come up and be with me on the mount. The others, Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and the seventy elders of Israel were to go up, but not to the mount. They are not said to have come to the mount. Perhaps you do not understand what I am speaking of, but I will speak of it for a moment further. Moses went up. Aaron and Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel went up and stayed at a certain point, but Moses went up alone. Of course, they must have gone up to the mount, but the words of Scripture are to be noted at all times, and it is not said that Aaron, Nadab and Abihu went up to the mount. They went up; that is all; but Moses went up to the mount and remained there forty days and forty nights; a most extraordinary thing. And so here, Abraham returned to his young men from the place where the altar was built, but not a word about Isaac. He does not come down. You say, Well, he must have come down because he is seen down later. Very good. But it does not say here that he went down. Abraham went down and his young men. What about Isaac? He is raised up in a figure, Scripture says; he is received back from the dead in a figure. These are the things that confirm our souls.
Well now, the time is pretty near gone. If you will pardon me for referring to it in this way, but I
{355}
want to get this great thought that is set out in this passage: the second coming of Jehovah out of heaven and announcing things with an oath and accompanying that, that Isaac did not go down from the mount. Abraham went down with his young men but not Isaac. Rebecca is seen as coming in later in the chapter, and I want you all to come into this great scene, dear brethren, in your souls. And that is what is meant in Abraham being introduced in this chapter, @Hebrews 6. As I said, Isaac did not come down. The whole scene is set for the soul. Abraham is illuminated and Isaac has gone through the experience of death to some extent at least, in a figure, but he has gone up to heaven. I mean, that is the understanding of the mind, the spiritual mind. Why has Isaac not come down? He has not come down. The Lord Jesus is seen going up into heaven in the first chapter of Acts. He is seen going up into heaven. They saw him go up, but they did not see him come down. He is coming down. "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven", @Acts 1:11. He is coming back. "Behold, I come quickly", @Revelation 22:7. That is the promise. That is one of the leading promises in the book of Revelation. And so it is, dear brethren, that the word here in @Hebrews 6 has its counterpart in the fact that Isaac did not come down; figuratively he has gone up. Our Isaac has gone up to stay until the time of the restitution of all things. The 'all things' have been spoken of by the prophets; saints have studied prophecies ever since, more or less, especially lately. They have all been spoken of, but the Lord Jesus is going to fulfil all these prophecies by coming back. He has gone up and we are left here. Rebecca is here. We are here to hold the ground as believers; not only so many individuals, but collectively. It is a collective thought. Rebecca is the assembly. We
{356}
are here, however few we may be, we are here to hold the ground, to hold the ground in faith. The second visit out of heaven is to assure us, and so here, as I said before, in verse 17 it says, "Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath, that by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us, which we have as anchor of the soul". Now, dear brethren, that is the point; an anchor of the soul. Jesus has gone in; Melchisedec has gone in; our Forerunner has entered, has gone in, and we have the hope instead. It is a real matter, and I would challenge our hearts as to hope. Hope makes not ashamed, we are told, for the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, @Romans 5:5. Hope is the principle mark of Christianity. There is faith, of course; there is love, of course; but hope. We have often noticed that in the epistle to the Thessalonians, in the second letter the apostle does not say anything about hope. He does in the first, showing there is a measure of decline. May it not be so. These meetings are to strengthen our hearts in the hope of the coming of the Lord; Jesus Christ our Hope. "Behold, I come quickly". The midnight cry has gone out. "Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him", @Matthew 25:6. That is the idea. Hope is in our hearts. The Old Testament passage that I have enlarged on implies that Isaac has gone up. He has gone up. The assembly in the end of the chapter is here. She is seen to be begotten in relation to Abraham. She is one of his relatives and the ground now is to be held by the saints, and it is to be held in hope. There is already hope in our hearts and these meetings inspire our hearts in the reality of the truth that is administered us; real facts we are dealing with. The
{357}
Lord Jesus is really to come; His coming is imminent. The Lord may come at any moment. There is nothing at all to stay it as far as I can see. "Behold, I come quickly".
Well, there is much more that could be said, but I just close with that, so that the dear brethren may have hope in their hearts, and that the matter of promise so full and so blessed and so varied may stay our hearts whatever else may happen; whatever losses may be sustained, whatever discouragements, whatever disappointments. And there are many. Our hearts are sustained by the fact that our Jesus, our Isaac has gone up and the Holy Spirit is here. This leads me to other things. The idea of promise in Ephesians is the promise of the Spirit. There was a promise at the beginning of Christianity but it is not simply that now. It is a reality now: the Holy Spirit of promise. It is a reality that is here and our hearts are sustained in hope. Hope makes not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us, so that we are sustained in hope, dear brethren, and in that, to enter within the veil. If we do not enter within the veil we are really challenged; we are exposing ourselves to be challenged as to the reality of our Christianity, because the point in this passage is that the hope at the end of the chapter is an anchor to the soul. It is not a matter of doctrine. It is a real matter. The Holy Spirit is inspiring it in our hearts, so that we should enter within the veil. It enters within the veil. In @Acts 1 they saw Him go up. A cloud received Him out of their sight, but what was the position down here? Melchisedec has gone up; He has gone up, and having gone up there is hope. Is it not a real thing that we have a Man up there, a High Priest up there entering into that within the veil, so that we should enter in? He has gone in and it is our privilege to enter in. It is our
{358}
part to learn it in our assembly services to enter in within the veil where Christ our Forerunner has entered, High Priest after the order of Melchisedec.
These are the facts of our position and they should inspire hope in our hearts, the expectation of the coming out of that glorious Person and the true Rebecca joining Him, caught up with Him in the air, so as to be forever with the Lord.
{359}
OUTWARD AND INWARD GUIDANCE
@Numbers 9:15 - 23;@Numbers 10:29 - 36; @Psalm 73:11 - 20
It came to me that a word on guidance would help us; first, outward guidance and then inward. Perhaps the word 'guidance' never applied more definitely both within and without than it does now and it behoves us as the children of God to have an eye to what is outward, to what affects men as of the nations, as forming the nations, so that our prayers may be intelligent and feeling; that the enemy may not succeed in bringing about a renewal of the disturbance that there has been of recent years. It is within our range to do this, for we are enjoined to pray for all men; for kings and such as are in authority; and it is to the end that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty; not simply that the nations should be in peace and prosper in the sense in which they regard prosperity, but that the saints should prosper and thus be saved from the enemy's machinations to hamper the work of God. Indeed, we know that there is that which hinders the elements of disturbance, so that we may be encouraged to pray to that end. God will put it upon us and give us to understand that He is paying attention to our intelligence. He will honour it. As was said in the prophets, "And we shall know, -- we shall follow on to know Jehovah", @Hosea 6:3. The same prophet said that his people were destroyed for lack of knowledge; hence God prizes the knowledge that His people acquire and especially now in what I am remarking on, that we should know the conditions abroad and pray against what is sinister. Pray against what is sinister. God will hear us, because He knows what we mean by it, and He will promote in us, too, entire freedom from mere national sentiment which can only ruin us if we imbibe it.
{360}
Well now, I have spoken of guidance; first, what is outward and then what is inward, but I have more in my mind as to what is outward than I have as to what is inward, although they act and react on one another. The outward stands, as I understand it, in relation to the tabernacle. The inward stands in relation to what is inward. That is what is suggested in the Psalm I read, @Psalm 73. Asaph had a great disturbance but he turned inward. He said, "Until I went into the sanctuaries of God; then understood I their end". Only that should not be limited to the Psalms, but it is a remarkable passage as bearing on what has been said. The epistle to the Ephesians really enlarges on it, where we are spoken of as being affected by the Spirit of the Father in the inner man. But I am just touching on that now. I want to go back to the book of Numbers, because it is peculiarly apropos of the moment. The book of Numbers may be well designated the book of trouble; but before we have trouble we are well fortified in peace, and that is why I read the verses in chapter 9. The whole book up to chapter 9 may be regarded as prefatory in the sense in which I am speaking of it: that is, the establishment of an order of things that is according to God in military connections: persons of mature age in the military and men of mature age in the ministry. The military ensures a way for the ministry. And so, a state of things contemplated, which is the wilderness, is met in both branches of what we may call the divine service: that is, the military and the ministry and the ministers. This section that I am alluding to -- the early section enlarges on order based on what I have been saying; maturity in age and experience, and order, too, in the ministry; not only that, but energy in the ministry, remarkable terms being used for the service of the Levites, that service being provided for in the fact that the Levites were of not only mature age
{361}
but as affording physical endurance, physical ability and endurance; because it is quite obvious from the outset that the duties imposed on the military and on the service, on the Levites, would be very onerous. Holiday-making is out of the question. It is a question of work, work, and work again. So that when we come to this section of the passage I read, we have an account of what proceeded, not simply at the outset but right through; as we may say, right through the dispensation; everything foreseen and seen active, too, actually active. So that there are no discrepancies to face, but then, as it were, God allowing the enemy to operate, in a sense letting him loose, we have the trouble. Chapter 11 brings in the trouble; chapter 12 brings it in; chapter 13, and right through. It is right that I should enlarge a little on this, dear brethren, because of the trouble that exists; that we might get back to the beginning. I allude to the verses read in chapter 9 as covering the whole dispensation, for really it is so; what happened. It might be written after, it might be written before, prophetically, but after it was written historically that certain things happened and wonderful things, there is a sense of order, thoughtfulness, so that it is God, I believe, fortifying His saints against what should come or telling them how wonderfully He had provided for them after it happened. What a book is the book of Numbers! Indeed, it may be well said, as it was in earlier days, that the name of the book was "In the wilderness". That is to say, in the scene of trouble. And so, we may well ask one another, Do we come peaceably to one another? If we approach each other at all, do we come peaceably? Or is there war in our hearts? It is an awful suggestion, but we may as well face it. War is abroad in the world and it is in the assembly.
Well now, this section, as I said, and particularly in those verses, contemplates the cloud. I am referring
{362}
now to the means of guidance, and the cloud is the predominant feature in the verses read; a very great suggestion as to what may be relied upon. The cloud may be relied upon. It is said in the book of Acts, and I believe it is a touch of Numbers brought into the book of Acts, that the Lord having said certain things to the disciples was taken up; "they beholding him, and a cloud received him out of their sight", @Acts 1:9. He would be, as it were, in wonderful care, to use that word in regard to divine Persons, for, indeed, the word is used. The Lord was taken up, we are told, carried up into heaven. He was leaving a disturbed world. What a world! As He says to His Father, "Of the world, righteous Father!" (see note to @John 17:24). There is an exclamation when the idea of the world came into His mind. "Righteous Father! -- and the world has not known thee, but *I* have known thee", @John 17:25. And so the cloud received Him out of their sight. We cannot assume that the cloud was inactive after that. Not that the present is a cloud period; it is a cloudless period really, but it was there at the beginning, a sure token of heaven's guardianship, and it is our token today as to ourselves: the divine guardianship involved in the cloud. It runs right through the whole period. You analyse these verses. Whether we view them prophetically as indicating what would happen, or historically, what has happened, we may see it that it is unfailing. It is mentioned more often in these few verses that I have read in chapter 9 than it is mentioned in the whole book of Numbers, so that it certainly deserves our attention and our encouragement, too. It tends to make us restful, for the Spirit of God was already warning of the trouble to come right along; one chapter after another telling of the lawless elements that were springing up to endeavour to overcome or overwhelm, if possible, what was of God and the blessed system
{363}
that God had set up in the tabernacle, what He set up now in the assembly; Christ being in heaven.
So that these verses, as I said, are full of it, and they are full of the guidance that it implies, and that is my point; the guidance. We may say, it has been often said, Keep your eye on the ark of the testimony, but, Keep your eye on the cloud. The cloud is the predominant feature. The cloud was there before the ark of the testimony, and we might say, it is after. The cloud denotes the divine presence; but it enveloped, as I might say, the ark of the testimony. Not exactly the ark, but the tent of the testimony. There are two words or expressions that have to be noted. The tent of the testimony is also called the tent of meeting, meaning what we have here tonight; the brethren are met together for a purpose, of course, but still met. It will be no imaginary thing as soon as we start to speak to one another and greet each other. I do not know if I have ever known of a meeting in which the brethren know each other better than the meetings in this section. It is a great matter, too, a matter of great importance. It is a measure of fortification against the thing I am speaking of: the terribleness of the readiness there is to disturb and complain and attack instead of peace.
Well now, I have spoken of outward guidance and this implies what is seen and what is heard. The second feature that I spoke of is what is inward; but the outward is what I had in mind particularly, dear brethren, and that is what I would urge on the brethren, to pay attention to what is to be observed. It speaks of peace; it speaks of heaven; it speaks of spiritual prosperity; it speaks of love one for another, and many other things I can mention. These are the things to observe for guidance. Where are they? If you know where they are, be guided by the fact. Keep as near as you can to those who have these things, because that is the idea. This
{364}
section -- the verses that I read in this chapter and the few verses in chapter 10 contemplate what is observable. What is observable answers to the idea here of the tent of meeting or the tent of testimony. They are two features of the same thing. The tent of meeting is where we meet, where we find love, where we find enjoyment. We are glad to be there. The tent of testimony is where the testimony is. They are very near in thought, but the testimony is more elevated; it is what is witnessed to, formally witnessed to; but then, love should be formally witnessed to. If it cannot be formal, let it be informal. The informality of love is a most beautiful phrase. We may have it at a dinner table, at a lunch table; we may have it in each other's houses, and in many ways we may have it. It is observable. These things are observable. They are not earth-born; they are not world-born; they are heaven-born. Love is heaven-born. It is out of heaven. Christianity, beloved, is out of heaven; not exactly in it, but out of it. In fact, the same expression is found as to the Lord: out of heaven. The second Man is out of heaven, @1 Corinthians 15:47. The Father is of heaven. It is the same idea. All the qualities, the attributes that flow out from the divine presence may be so designated. They are of heaven; they are out of heaven; they are here to influence what is here. The terribleness, the wickedness that has been displayed in the last few years still simmers and grows and yells. That is not out of heaven. These things are from the pit, whereas Christianity is out of heaven. So there is that which affords guidance in these verses. The term 'cloud', as I said, is more often found in those few verses than in the whole book of Numbers, or at least as often, and what is it for? It is a concentrated description of what the dispensation affords for us. Let us explore it, extending over many years; we might say, thousands of years; but certainly many years.
{365}
And so we have, for instance, if the cloud stays a day or a month or a year or many days, stay there, too. Stay where the cloud is; be it however long, stay where it is. It is God's provision. Look out for it, as I said, among the brethren, at the lunch table, at the houses, but above all at these meetings. Thank God for the number of them: the description and repeatedness of them -- what we call special meetings. It is a very good thought that special meetings increase. It means increase in wealth, increase of means; and it is also a better thought that the brethren attend them. Why? Because of what they find; just as I was saying in these verses from 15 to the end -- what they find. We go, we will say, on a Saturday afternoon -- almost everyone of them there is something of the kind -- what do we find? Well, we find love. I should not go if I did not find love. That is my own estimate of the thing. I regard that as greater than the ministry. "The greater of these is love". Prophecies fail; they come to an end, but love never. Therefore, seek out the love. Where it is, be there. The cloud -- there it is; it is there. It is simply there. The idea is dwelling really, as if God is saying it is a lovely place to be in. God is Himself the Author of love, but He loves those who have it; and God has His part in all these places, and the best evidence of that is that the cloud is always there. But any little movement -- we get in the next chapter a movement -- perhaps resented on the part of God. It happens; certain things happen among us and God resents them. He is not there. But generally He is with us. As far as I am concerned, I can say freely that for half a century I cannot recall where brethren did not find enjoyment in those special meetings. It is constant. It is just what I am saying. God is saying, I am there. The cloud is there. But then there is the tabernacle. Do not forget the tabernacle. It cost a great deal to
{366}
build, to prepare, and it is a part of the guidance. That is to say, what the brethren are as built, as united together. The word 'build' is the best; builded together for a habitation of God, @Ephesians 2:22.
Well, these are great facts, these are grand facts that I am speaking of now; not simply things we might refer to academically as in this chapter. I am not speaking of that at all. I am speaking of what I know to be great facts, and I am urging on the brethren to go in for them more and more. Think of the cloud; think of God every time He used the word 'cloud'. He is there, every time, all the time, as I may say. But then that beautiful tabernacle, too. That is not to be ignored. And when I say 'beautiful', I am referring to the brethren. If there are no beautiful men and women among the brethren, there are none at all. I mean brethren; I mean Christians, when I say 'brethren'. There are none at all if they are not among them; but they are there. The brethren are beautiful; the saints of God are. "Let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us", @Psalm 90:17. And it is. The Spirit of God is putting it on all the time. And so, the verses I read fit -- the beauty of the brethren, and that beautiful structure called here the tent of meeting where the brethren meet together, or the tent of testimony where the testimony is worked out and spoken of. It is either one or the other, or both. Therefore, there is guidance; guidance is there in these things. So, as I said, the beautiful wording as to the time; the description of the whole period. "And on the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle of the tent of testimony; and at even it was upon the tabernacle as the appearance of fire, until the morning. So it was continually". Notice that. "So it was continually; the cloud covered it, and at night it was as the appearance of fire. And when the cloud rose from the tent, then the children
{367}
of Israel journeyed; and at the place where the cloud stood still, there the children of Israel encamped". The note says the cloud 'dwelt' or 'abode', and then the children of Israel pitched their tents. They did it. There is no flaw at all in these verses. They are simply a description either prophetically or what they were historically. And so, "And when the cloud was long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journeyed not". That is what they did. They did not journey. They were obedient. You can see how heaven would keep the record, as I might say abstractly, up there. There are no defections up there; the thing is perfect. Christianity is a perfect idea. We can only reach that by the idea of abstraction, that there is a perfect state of things. Why not? It is a question of the Spirit of God, the work of God.
And so, as I was reading, it goes on in verse 20, "And if it were so that the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle, according to the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed. And if it were so that the cloud was there from the evening until the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed". They went by the divine rule, "or a day and a night, and the cloud was taken up, they journeyed; or two days, or a month, or many days, when the cloud was long upon the tabernacle, dwelling upon it, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed. At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept the charge of Jehovah according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses". Just think of all that, dear brethren, taking place in this terrible world, this wicked world. All this so beautifully described here actually happened and is happening
{368}
today, too; and surely the wisdom of each of us will be in seeking out where it is happening and staying by it. That is where the safety lies. That is where the guidance lies; abandoning all that goes with the natural man, the stirring up of discord; but maintaining love -- the heavenly elements come down, for that is the idea: Christianity come down. Christianity is what has come down out of heaven, and what is going back up into heaven. There is not much more to say; there is not much more time, but just to point out in chapter 10 where we have the concrete thing. The thing has happened. We have a defect in Moses; a very slight one in a way, but still he was influenced by his father-in-law. I am just pointing out the danger of natural relationships and how they mar all this. I think more of my people, than of how the brethren link on together, and how much of the natural there is, continually spreading abroad, and the danger of preference, of preferential relationships and dealings lurking in it all the time. And so it is that Moses thought he had a great helper in Hobab. I should have to stop, perhaps, to go into the matter as to who this man is; and, of course, when we come into the realm of natural relationships you have to think. Who is he, anyway? Is he the father of his wife, or the son? It is not easy to keep track, to follow up the lines. But still, we are obliged to do it to be safe, and safety lies in not allowing the natural to dominate the matter of the tabernacle. Moses permitted, he allowed the idea of his father-in-law to come into his mind. It is left open. It does not say that Hobab refused Moses, but the inference is he did. He is going to stay with his own people. He is very definite; and God is saying the ark is going to leave. Let the father or grandfather or great grandfather or whatever it be -- leave all that out. If it is a question of guidance, leave all that out. That is
{369}
the lesson. And so the result is very beautiful. We are not told just what Hobab did, but the inference is he did not go. He was decided about it, that he was not going to go with them. And then, as if God were to say, Well, Moses must be mourning, regretting that his father-in-law is not going with him -- in fact, he says to him, "We are journeying to the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it unto you: come with us, and we will do thee good; for Jehovah has spoken good concerning Israel. And he said to him, I will not go". I breathe freely when I read those verses. Thank God he did not go. Let us just face this matter of naturalness governing us, even to the extent of putting a man into a position of being a guide or eyes to the tabernacle of God. It will not do. Disaster awaits it if it is attempted. It does not say here that Hobab went the whole way. Moses said, "Leave me not, I pray thee, because thou knowest where we are to encamp in the wilderness". One could say more about this, but I just read it. "Thou knowest where we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou wilt be to us for eyes". It would look to me as if Moses meant this man to be above them all; that he could do more for them than any man in the camp or all together. That shows, dear brethren, what this natural element, if we allow it a place in the service of God, will do for us. But, thank God, as I said before, nothing came out of it; nothing ill came out of it. Moses goes on to say, "And it shall be, if thou come with us, that whatever good Jehovah doeth unto us, so will we do to thee". He is bargaining with him.
Well now, the dear brethren here will know perhaps as well as I do, that the next verse is God coming in, showing what He can be to us in these circumstances. It is said, "And they set forward from the mountain of Jehovah and went three days journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in
{370}
the three days journey, to search out a resting-place for them". You can see that that is where our safety lies, but that is where our comfort lies, and our blessing lies in adhering to the right thought, the right principle, and disregarding the wrong principle although it be a Moses that suggested it. And so the right thought is God coming out of His place; God Himself coming out of His place; undertaking the burden of leading His people. The ark, it is said, went before. "And the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days journey, to search out a resting-place for them. And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day". The cloud is maintaining them; it is not to leave; it is there -- "when they set forward out of the camp. And it came to pass when the ark set forward, that Moses said",Now let us look at the note of triumph: may it be with us. "Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thy face. And when it rested, he said, Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel".
I am about to finish, but I just want to say a word as to @Psalm 73, because it is the inward side of the subject. One might link it on with Ephesians, as I was saying, and Hebrews, because both these books treat of the inward. Ephesians is the book of the opened heavens. It is not simply what comes out of heaven, but what is seen up there, as Stephen saw it. He saw the heavens opened through, he said. That may be included in the passage I read from @Psalm 73. And then in Hebrews we have the sanctuary. I was saying that Ephesians is the book of the opened heavens, and so it is, because it is what we see up there, what is up there. It is the heavenly. God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies, @Ephesians 1:3. That is where we are, raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ
{371}
Jesus. That is Ephesians. You can see as you sit down and go up with the brethren. That is the principle of Ephesians. We are all made to sit down together and go up with the brethren -- what we shall see and hear -- and how despicable all that is here below!
And so if I just read again the verses in @Psalm 73 we shall see the suggestion of despisement of what is of man. It is said in verse 17, "Until I went into the sanctuaries of God; then understood I their end". That is the wicked ones. "Truly thou settest them in slippery places, thou easiest them down in ruins. How are they suddenly made desolate! they pass away, consumed with terrors. As a dream, when one awaketh, wilt thou, Lord, on arising despise their image". Think of what has happened within our own memories; the terribleness of what has happened to the leaders of wickedness in this world. That is in this very verse. "Truly thou settest them in slippery places, thou easiest them down in ruins". This is what the man that has been in the sanctuaries can say. It is not now the tabernacle. It is what is inside the tabernacle. It is not the external; it is the inside. And so it says, "Thou castest them down in ruins. How are they suddenly made desolate!" Think of what has happened. I am not speaking of past history but more of current history: what happens and how it calls for faith -- what has happened and what may happen.
So it is here; the man that has been into the sanctuaries says, "How are they suddenly made desolate! they pass away, consumed with terrors. As a dream, when one awaketh, wilt thou, Lord, on arising despise their image". That is what the man in the sanctuaries can say. What monuments there are representing men, men of this world. But what do they mean? They represent images. "As a dream, when one awaketh", that is, when the Lord
{372}
Jesus Christ awakes up and this world has to go and all its leaders; I mean, the builders of the world. Seven thousand names of men, we are told, were destroyed at once. Names. These are leaders -- men who made a monument for themselves and who got monuments. And so it is, as I was remarking, that the man who was going into the sanctuaries can speak in this way. He says, "As a dream, when one awaketh, wilt thou, Lord, on arising despise their image". What are they to God -- the myriads of images? That is the idea. They represent something. The world is full of them, of man's doings. The works therein shall be burned up and the workers; the builders of the world shall have to go; but the sanctuaries of God disclose what God thinks of it all.
And so we have guidance. We know ultimately that nothing stands but what is set up in Christ; nothing at all. All has got to go, and the man who enters into the sanctuaries understands. "Then understood I their end". Then he discloses what God thinks of those who have been troublers, Oh, let us beware of troubling the saints in any sense at all. It is a time of peace. God is saying, The sons of peace. He says to His missionaries, Seek out sons of peace and stay there; stay in their houses. You say, They may not ask me; but they will. They are characteristically persons who will take you into their houses. They are characteristically that. And so, dear brethren, one would urge all this because of the saints abroad on the earth, the world, and in the assembly. One has great hope that God is going to do something for the assembly.
{373}
HOW CRISES ARE MET IN THE ASSEMBLY
@Acts 6:1 - 8; @Numbers 11:16; @Numbers 17:24 - 30
J.T. The suggestion is how crises are met in the assembly through those who are reliable. Thus reliability is stressed. There is another scripture in mind, but one hesitated to read it, not wishing to take up too much time in reading. It is that in which Jethro made proposals to Moses so that he should not be exhausted in exercising his ministry among the people; @Exodus 18. That may be in mind, too. These scriptures bear on the present situation among the brethren and show incidentally the need of augmentation of the administrative feature of the ministry, lest there should be exhaustion, in view of physical occupation tending to exhaustion and impairment of the vessels. In @Exodus 18 God would remind us we have limitations physically, as well as mentally, and these might jeopardise the truth under certain conditions. In this event persons who are reliable may be reckoned upon to come forward according to the divine mind to lend a hand and relieve, so that the work may go forward unhindered. One would call attention to the fact that in @Acts 6 we get the first attempt of the enemy to interfere with the work of God in Christianity, and how apostolic wisdom met it. The twelve needed relief apparently and we have in the passage read facts bearing on this, and the result, especially in Stephen, bringing out the idea of promotion, persons purchasing to themselves a good degree in the service, and great boldness in the faith, so that advance is made instead of retrogression. The enemy loses, the truth gains.
In regard of Moses in Numbers a sad breakdown had taken place, even Moses himself was affected by it, but speedily recovered, the incident bringing out
{374}
what the Spirit can be in such circumstances, reminding us of His availability in the various distributions of the Spirit. That is what is in mind; no doubt the brethren will see the usefulness of the suggestion.
Ques. There does not seem to be any suggestion of lack of material, "Look ye out among you seven men", not, If ye can find them. Are they potentially there always?
J.T. The apostles did not require to go afield for them, or have recourse to other ways, but took on what was there, and what was there is God-provided, because they were to be men of faith. "The twelve, having called the multitude of the disciples to them, said, It is not right that we, leaving the word of God, should serve tables", that is to say, should do the kind of work that was needed; others can do it as well or better. Then the word is, "Look out therefore, brethren, from among yourselves seven men, well reported of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we will establish over this business". And then it says, "the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch, whom they set before the apostles; and, having prayed, they laid their hands on them. And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was very greatly multiplied, and a great crowd of the priests obeyed the faith. And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought wonders and great signs among the people".
One might mention the thought was not so much to dwell on this well-known passage, nor on @Exodus 18, but more to direct our minds to the distributions of the Spirit under pressure, need being met by qualified persons, reliable and available, the Spirit of God being the medium and directing power. Christianity is marked by the distributions of the Holy Spirit, it is
{375}
the Spirit's time and all operations are in His power. Really He is, as it were, in charge of the whole dispensation, and there is nothing lower than that in which He operates. There could be nothing higher, there is nothing lower. The dispensation is maintained at all times on that principle, the character of it being thus apparent. The Holy Spirit is the operational power, whether it be in new birth, or otherwise, the Spirit is the immediate power in the dispensation.
Ques. Does that involve suitable vessels in which that power is to be exhibited?
J.T. That is the point, we are morally equal in each case, because the requirement was, "Look out therefore, brethren, from among yourselves seven men, well reported of" -- moral qualities -- "full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we will establish over this business". In @Numbers 11:16, the qualifications are also mentioned, "Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and their officers; and take them to the tent of meeting, and they shall stand there with thee". And in @Exodus 18:21 Jethro says: "Do thou provide among all the people able men, such as fear God". They will be there. God is ready to meet all these contingencies, but to meet them on His own ground, and these men could be relied on.
G.W.B. Did you say it was not a matter of gift?
J.T. It became a matter of gift in prophesying in @Numbers 11. What is stressed is the moral quality, but it became a matter of gift because the Holy Spirit and prophecy were involved.
A.M. What is the thought in the repeated word 'full'? Full of the Holy Spirit, full of grace, full of power. Does it imply there was no obstruction in them to the Holy Spirit?
J.T. It is the idea of a vessel or vessels, a word God employs, for instance of Paul, "this man is an elect vessel to me", @Acts 9:15. I believe that is the thought.
{376}
That vessel is wholly fit in the sense of fulness. It is not half full, but filled for the work specified.
Ques. Does the limited number suggest sovereignty in this matter?
J.T. There are seven chosen here, in @Numbers 11, seventy. It is the same principle, whereas in @Exodus 18 the principle is ten -- a military matter. I suppose seven is a complete thought, meaning the whole idea is there.
Ques. Would it show a small number relatively; that a crisis is met not by mere generalities, but by something specific coming forward in suitable vessels?
J.T. I think that is right, the idea of vessel is to be kept in mind. We are dealing with operational things, hence in the case of Elijah's ministry the ravens served him, and the brook served him, @1 Kings 17:4. Ravens were living creatures, but the brook was not, but served on the principle of the universe, on the principle on which water is operated on, moving of itself. God affords ways and means in that sense, but when we come to the woman of Sarepta God said He had commanded her to maintain Elijah, @1 Kings 17:9. It was a full or complete thought and she was a woman under command, and is marked by the possession of vessels; she has means of serving the prophet, the oil and the meal being in vessels, where they should be, and she has skill for using the material, and the power, skill to make a little cake. It was a matter not simply of the material, but the ability to do things, and that enters into this matter of availability and usefulness to meet a crisis. The idea of skill must be there. God has been pleased to give men and women skill as well as material.
A.M. How would you distinguish between skill and gift?
J.T. There is a good deal of likeness between the two ideas, but skill in itself, I think, is more what God gives us constitutionally. The woman had skill
{377}
to make a little cake, but it was skill that was native to a woman, because God has fitted her for that sort of work, of kneading dough. When Israel was to go into Canaan God demanded the firstfruit of their dough, meaning that the thing was already at hand for making bread, but skill was operating in it. God values such a gift as that, the gift which is the fruit of skill. The thing is in process, not yet finished. That is an important thing, the skill in operation in the process, the mind controlling discerns or reckons that there is an end to be reached, which in the dough would be bread. Elijah calls it a little cake, "Make me thereof a little cake first", he says, @1 Kings 17:13.
F.E.S. Does that thought come into this matter of wisdom? "Full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom", @Acts 6:3.
J.T. It would. Wisdom is used by God, one of the things God specially stresses in the creation. It speaks of itself as a person. So much is it in evidence in the divine operations that it is viewed in that light.
P.H.H. Are we to understand that as these matters are attended to the more spiritual matter of the word of God is set free, so to speak?
J.T. That is what is actually said here. There may be other things to say to modify that, Paul never having resorted to this method in his service. He is ready to do anything, to put wood on a fire, ready to do anything that had to be done, but this is a matter of apostolic dignity and office, and that was greatly needed. It was the main thought before the apostles as it is said in @Acts 2:42, "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles", that is to say, they are stressed as characterising the dispensation, and primarily therefore their service needed to be conserved as much as possible, their power should not be expended on the work of deacons. What was needed on their part was the ministering
{378}
of the word of God, and that should not be impaired.
P.H.H. I would like to ask whether what is in your mind is that the administrative side is to subserve the spiritual side; what is spiritual is always to be in mind, is that it?
J.T. That is to be promoted, and apostolic power is intended to promote it, and should be conserved for that purpose.
Ques. Do you think there may have been a tendency to put everything on them?
J.T. Yes, let them do it. Others might reckon thus, and ease off. The brethren ought to join in and do what they can and ease those who can carry on service of greater importance. How much do the brethren think, as a general matter, of the need of the service? How much does that enter into our minds, and what they can effect and what I can effect?
W.C. Is there any reason why they are referred to as the twelve?
J.T. I think it is to stress administration. The numeral denotes administration, and runs right through.
W.C. This crisis would serve to promote mutuality.
J.T. That is in the apostles mind in their remarks. They use the word 'yourselves', that is mutual.
W.C. They seem to initiate that and leave the choice to the people.
J.T. They bring the people into it as the choice involves many more than the seven, "the twelve having called the multitude of the disciples to them, said, It is not right that we, leaving the word of God, should serve tables. Look out ... from among yourselves", that was the multitude.
W.C. The multitude being pleased shows the mutual spirit.
J.T. The saying pleased the whole multitude, and they did what it was suggested they should do.
{379}
J.J.T. They seem to have brought the seven before the apostles after choosing them: in Numbers the seventy were brought before the Lord.
J.T. It is all a question of divine authority. The twelve men represent the Lord.
Rem. So that the mutual side is not to interfere with the authoritative side. We are to work harmoniously. There is no reason why the two sides should not go on collaterally.
W.C. In Exodus Moses is advised to choose them, and in Deuteronomy he puts it upon the people.
J.T. Our service should not damage us physically, otherwise it may damage us morally. Jethro rightly says, 'You will become exhausted'.
P.H.H. Do you mean that there is a danger amongst the generality of us as brethren together of leaving too much to one or two persons, and thus fail in our common responsibility? Evidently the looking for these men would involve that the brethren knew each other, and knew the capabilities and capacities of each. Is that what we should know and discover in our local settings?
J.T. Just so. All these remarks are very important. I was thinking of knowing persons or things so as to use them. In @Genesis 15, for instance, Abram was told to select certain creatures as meeting an emergency on the same principle as we are speaking now, Jehovah met an emergency that arose in the circumstances of His great servant Abram, so we are told, @Genesis 15:1, "After these things the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision", and so on, and it may be remarked here it is the first time we have the idea in the Scriptures of the word of God, and then in @Genesis 15:9, God says: "Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove and a young pigeon". I just refer to that because Abram knew the cattle, he knew where to find these among his large flocks,
{380}
and knew their ages. That is very important to keep in mind, because we are supposed to know the brethren, perhaps visit them, or have them in our houses, so that we know each other, and the mutual side amongst us becomes practical and usable, so it says, "And the saying pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen ..." They knew Stephen, and the others were known, it was no haphazard matter.
R.S.W. Would it help in connection with easing off if we distinguished a little more than we do between different gifts, that of a teacher, and an evangelist?
J.T. I think we should. Scripture supposes we should distinguish. The Spirit of God gives us a list. "First, apostles", for instance, in @1 Corinthians 12. In @Ephesians 4:11 the word 'apostles' comes first, too. There are four different gifts -- pastors and teachers referring to one person, the saints are to know that. We should know that a man like that can do certain work another cannot do.
W.H. These men would have applied themselves on this line before the selection took place, so that when the crisis arrived they were ready.
J.T. If a man like Stephen heard of the murmuring he, like Moses, would be distressed and do his best to meet it.
W.H. I was thinking of the word to Moses -- "whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people", @Numbers 11:16.
W.C. When a skilful player on the harp was required a young man knew where to find David.
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Not only what he could do, but what he was as a man.
J.T. Quite so.
W.C. "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skilled in playing, and he is a valiant man and a man of war, and skilled in speech,
{381}
and of good presence, and Jehovah is with him", @1 Samuel 16:18.
J.T. What a fine tribute. Jehovah would never forget that Saul had that tribute to David presented to him.
W.C. It was effective. The choice was suitable.
J.O.S. Is this knowledge to which you are referring found with the apostle Paul in a fine way in the end of Romans and 1 Corinthians where a crisis had arisen?
J.T. That is a good point, because he salutes them. You can hardly serve the saints better, if you wish to call attention to them, than to salute them. So in the Roman epistle Paul salutes many persons. I suppose Phoebe brought the letter, maybe she read it on the way. If she did, she would know something of the saints in Rome, and could tell them something about themselves. Paul found out there were thirty at least he would wish to salute in his letter, and Phoebe would also salute them as soon as she saw them. She would say, You are Mrs. So-and-So. It is not easy to remember names, but it is important to have their names, to be able to say, You are Mr. -- .
Ques. Does it not often help in a reading meeting to have persons you can name? Does it not bring out the mutual side in a striking way at times?
J.T. It greatly helps to liberate us in our spirits when we know each other. John says, "Greet the friends by name", @3 John 1:14.
Ques. Would it not involve following up the commendation of the persons named? Phoebe would have something to attach to persons in addition to their name.
J.T. Phoebe was well spoken of herself in the letter. You can picture her saying, Well, I brought Paul's letter with me. I know him well, he used to live near me. Corinth was a short distance from
{382}
Cenchrea. He would know her well, and I can imagine she would tell the sisters, I know Paul well; he is a brother that can be relied on.
Ques. In regard of Barnabas seeking out Saul, @Acts 11:25, he saw the need there and sought out Saul to do the work, and the Spirit of God confirmed his choice.
J.T. How much it would mean for Paul himself! Paul said, "I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, and remained with him fifteen days", @Galatians 1:18; he thus stayed two Lord's Days with him; he could tell anyone he knew Peter.
Ques. The link they formed at that time stood the strain later on, the personal side being so important between those who serve and those who are served, so that in times of difficulty there is something to stand the strain.
F.K. As regards knowing the brethren, is there a link with this and Adam naming the animals, the wisdom there?
J.T. That is the truth. God brought it in at the beginning to set out the principle of personal knowledge, the knowledge of things and persons, because Abram had to know the things God spoke of. He was obliged to find the creatures Jehovah spoke of, and I believe God intended that principle to be amongst men, hence in moving about amongst the brethren one acquires the knowledge of traits marking certain people. The brethren are worth knowing and saluting and that is the principle that comes out in the letter to the Roman saints -- all these things enter into that.
W.C. Would the thought of surname confirm that?
J.T. It was to bring out where authority lay, the power of promotion, like the king knighting a man. He has authority to do that. Barnabas was surnamed Son of consolation, which meant he was that.
Ques. I was thinking how the knowledge of persons
{383}
and the naming of them comes out with David in @1 Chronicles:24 in connection with the service of God.
J.T. David always says something about a man when his name is mentioned.
F.W. The young man in @Numbers 11:27 is able to name the two men prophesying.
J.T. These principles we are speaking of came in early in the Acts. They are to run through Christianity, because the things in the book of Acts are intended to govern saints of all times in the Christian era. Hence you get Peter and John. John does not say anything, but it is to call attention to the kind of man he was, he was a good second, not aspiring to be first. Let Peter lead. That was the principle, "first Simon, who was called Peter", @Matthew 10:2. Peter says, Look on us, @Acts 3:4, he would have in mind what a brother was. So Jehovah impresses on Moses what a brother he had in Aaron, he is a Levite; that is the first mention of Aaron, and God said, he is coming to meet you and when he sees you he will be glad. All these things are mentioned to show what is suitable to Christians in their relations with one another. We are to be ready in an emergency to come in and lend a hand and see that the thing is done according to the dispensation.
P.H.H. The spirit of reliability had already been discovered in Moses: "Have I conceived all this people, have I brought them forth, that thou sayest to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as the nursing-father beareth the suckling?" Would that indicate God's estimate of reliability in Moses, so that when his spirit is put upon the elders, there is the reliability extended? Would that be right?
J.T. That is borne out in the general facts in @Numbers 11, the divine thought of preserving the dignity of Moses, because the situation might lower his dignity and his influence upon the people, which God will not have. It is important that a brother
{384}
should have influence, and you do not want to damage it, hence Jehovah says: "Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and their officers: and take them to the tent of meeting, and they shall stand there with thee". That is, Moses is honoured in the transaction, because God is going to make the most of Moses, he is not to be let down, he is a leading man.
Ques. "And I will come down and talk with thee there; and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, and thou shalt not bear it alone".
J.T. God is showing us how He cares for a leading brother whom He has fitted to serve His people; He will protect him, though He will not ignore his failures. The man is the man, anyway, and the next chapter tells us all about this man, there is nobody like him, God says, We are told by the Spirit that Moses was the meekest man in all the earth. God is saying that to show how wrong it was for his brother and sister to make little of him. God will not have that, and that is a word we do well to observe. God will not suffer His servants to be maligned. He resents it. So the whole chapter is taken up with that incident between Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam.
Ques. It says, "And he shall be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand", @Romans 14:4. Is it not important for us to bear that in mind?
Ques. "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only to Moses? Has he not spoken also to us?" Was that the spirit of rivalry coming out because it was not judged? Did they want a place of equality God was not prepared to give them?
J.T. The feminine element enters into the matter. Really it was Miriam's naughtiness; Aaron was brought into it. He should have stood by his brother. Miriam was the one the enemy used. That is a word
{385}
for the sisters not to be jealous of the brethren because of their husbands. Miriam brought up the matter of the Cushite Moses had married, and the enemy used that incident to bring all this about, yet God defends His servant. It was especially trying because it was his own sister and brother. Our brethren according to flesh are apt to be our worst enemies. It was a question of natural feelings.
H.H. Are you going to speak of Eldad and Medad prophesying in the camp?
J.T. I thought it was just as well to stress this passage, because it brings in the idea of the various distributions of the Spirit, which is a feature of Christianity. It comes up at this particular time to meet an emergency, and has in mind the whole dispensation. The Spirit was available, and hence Jehovah says to Moses, @Numbers 11:17, "I will come down and talk with thee there; and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, and thou shalt not bear it alone". No one is to be in this, save those who have the Spirit. We are reminded it is the dispensation of the Spirit; He is the power. If there is to be any help it is to be the Spirit in which Moses had been operating, and there is to be no increase of, or addition to, what was there. The same Spirit was on those seventy men, hence the dispensation is maintained, and even the two in the camp prophesied. It is the sovereignty of God making way for His Spirit, even if the position is not right; the camp is regarded as another thing.
J.J.T. Would that raise the question as to how we view those who have the Holy Spirit and are usable by God, but have not the light?
J.T. I think it opens up the whole question of the operations of the Spirit in Christendom. Even if persons are not walking in fellowship, God can use them. He reserves His own rights as to the Spirit.
{386}
The Spirit of God requires that the flesh should be judged in us, yet you may get the Spirit operating in a man not wholly in the truth. In the revival of over one hundred years ago persons from the denominations were moved and began to come to the meetings, and were allowed to break bread immediately, because it was a question of the work of the Spirit. But we had to modify that afterwards. God would honour the great fact of the Spirit being here, and He may use anyone under certain conditions.
Ques. I think that is helpful, because one has wondered sometimes about this. Where there is movement with a good conscience in relation to the light received, you may find a man quite free to do a lot of things we could not touch at all, and obviously helped of God in the service.
J.T. There are many like that. At the same time you have an eye on what is suitable to the dispensation.
W.C. The fulness of the dispensation was with Moses. Is there anything in that? These two were of those written, @Numbers 11:26.
J.T. It brings out what was in Joshua. Joshua said, "My lord Moses, forbid them! But Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake?" bringing out the character of the great mediator. How do we meet these matters; the operations of the Spirit with brethren not actually in the truth? Moses said, "would that all Jehovah's people were prophets, and that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them!" The Spirit is available. Moses did not say, Would that they were right in regard to the tabernacle, but that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them. It is the time of the Spirit. God acts sovereignly in putting His Spirit on whom He will. We are to respect such persons, but have to bring the truth to bear upon them, too.
Ques. Do you think there is some anticipative reference to what has come in in Christendom?
{387}
There is the integrity of God's heart and the skilfulness of His hand, towards those who have not come into the truth as others. I was wondering whether sometimes in the sovereignty of God He leaves men to serve those who would be on starvation diet otherwise. We should do well not to discredit anyone who is being supported by God in his measure.
J.T. We must never forget we are on the side of the truth. How ready people are to say I have seven reasons for not coming into fellowship, meaning a wife and six children. They think more of these than of the truth.
Rem. There is nothing in the scripture to support our not heeding the call. I was wondering whether from the sovereign side God has left some to prophesy in the camp.
J.T. That is a very important lesson here. It is the sovereign side; the conduct has to be left. Moses is not speaking of what was suitable. He is rather meeting what Joshua said in a party spirit, which was worse. The Spirit of God works in view of "the dispensation of God which is in faith". If a man says, I have seven reasons for not coming into fellowship, he is not in faith.
H.H. Moses had two million reasons for going on -- his children!
P.H.H. Is it significant that the Spirit is referred to in John's gospel, which is for the last days, as the Spirit of truth?
J.T. That is good. John says, "I have no greater joy than these things that I hear of my children walking in the truth", @3 John 1:4. "My children"; what is the use of talking about children if we think there can be a lower level for them? How could John admit of a possibly lower level for his children than the truth, and yet we sometimes hear of a lower family coming into evidence now, which is not true. God is not admitting of a lower one.
{388}
THE WORK OF GOD
@Luke 7:1 - 10; @Matthew 15:21 - 28; @Genesis 24:18 - 21
It is in mind to say something about the work of God, and I have selected three scriptures in order to speak of this, and to see the character of the persons in whom it is seen, and I begin with Luke having in mind that the work of God is seen in the military element, and I may say here that the thought of wonder appears. We have no reference to wonder at the end of the physical creation, although, of course, it was indeed wonderful, but as to what God had in His mind, the idea of man that He should work in him, we have, in the Lord, remarkable evidence of wonder. You can understand that in referring to the Lord in this way, it is only to bring out how the realm of God admits of the thought of wonder, and in Luke God is seen working -- it is grace. The word would not appear in relation to the physical creation. It appears in relation to man, and in this particular case in relation to the military, because it is a great military time, we might say, The world is filled with military renown, defeat, too, and it is not without significance that the Lord selected at this particular time of His service a military man, as I might say God ordered it in His operations, for it is a question of God, and in view of the great place the military has at the present time it certainly is worthy of our consideration that God is not making little of that of which man is making so much. But God is working among the military, and we are not unacquainted with the military, our sons and our daughters, our brothers and our sisters are having and have had to do with it, and to do with it not in a victorious way militarily, but morally, and that is a greater thing. Moral victories are the greatest.
{389}
So we have this centurion: "a certain centurion's bondman who was dear to him was ill", a certain centurion. I just comment on this to come to the point that is in mind, that he was in good favour with the religious class, and they represent him commendably, saying that he is worthy for whom He should do this "for he loves our nation, and himself has built the synagogue for us". The passage suggests to us gospel circumstances, circumstances available for gospel testimony. The religious element is there, but not adverse; the military element is there regarded with favour; the servant, or working class is there in the servant; and the Lord Jesus is there, and so it is that one believes that the present juncture affords great opportunities to the brethren. It is a time for evangelical feeling, and evangelical testimony and work; the opportunities are great, and the fact that a military man is in evidence is surely something to note.
We are not unacquainted with the military, they are near to us; we love them and think of them all, how God has prospered them, and how the work of God has proceeded in them, and how they have been under reproach, and how they stood in the reproach, and now it is a time they should be honoured, but honoured in a moral sense, and so the circumstances afford these elements. There is the military among ourselves, not militant, although the word 'military' applies to them, for they are not militant, they are followers of the Lord Jesus who said that His kingdom was not of this world; they have learned how to put the sword into its place and leave it. It will be needed again from their point of view, but for the moment they are not militant, they are conscientious, an element that belongs to the moment is conscience, not simply the abstract idea of conscience, but conscience in regard of God and of the brethren, conscience in regard of the government, and so they
{390}
afford an element of great advantage in the way of testimony at the present time.
So I proceed to call attention now to the centurion, what a man he was, and that he should come in contact with the Lord Jesus in these circumstances is the more to be remarked on, and that he was commendable and commended by the Jews. But he comes in contact directly with the Lord Jesus, and becomes a great moral trophy in these circumstances -- notice that they represent him commendably. Then "Jesus went with them", ready to join in even with them, and "when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent to him friends, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof. Wherefore neither did I count myself worthy to come to thee. But say by a word and my servant shall be healed. For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bondman, Do this, and he does it". These are the words that fell on the ears of the Lord Jesus, the words of a military man, an officer, no ordinary soldier, a man having men under him, men who would obey him, and having depicted these circumstances to the Lord he uses the word 'also', as much as to say, Lord, that is your picture. He was respectful, he recognised that the Lord Jesus was here in authority, but in authority in the sense of being under it. It was graded authority beginning with God and coming right down to the Lord Jesus. I say, coming right down, for the Lord took a lowly place, and the centurion recognised that He was a Man under authority, and that all He had to do was to say the word, "Say by a word and my servant shall be healed".
I am enlarging somewhat on this point to bring out that it was the work of God, and the work of God
{391}
which causes the Lord to wonder, causes the Lord to be affected, and so the word is, "And Jesus hearing this wondered at him, and turning to the crowd following him said, I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found so great faith. And they who had been sent returning to the house found the bondman, who was ill, in good health". Now I have arrived at the point that is being stressed, that is what the work of God is, not as in the physical creation, however much there may be to wonder at there. The Lord Himself called attention to the lilies, how they grow; that is the work of God in creation, but here it is a centurion, a Roman officer, and he has got a servant and he loves him. Think of what all that meant to the Lord Jesus. He had come into the scene in lowly grace as a lowly Man, so as to regard the circumstances, and as it were with wonder -- one would speak reverently and with caution, but the word is noticeable, and is to be understood, and it applies to the work of God in how many there may be in this hall. One looks at the faces of the brethren (not because they are listening to one, I hope they are listening to the word of God), what a picture for heaven to see so many of us, speaker and hearers together influenced by the word of God, influenced by the work of God. I cannot speak of anything morally more important than what I am saying now. Here is a man, the subject of the work of God, and the Lord marvels at him, and is it not that there should be a radiation of this at this juncture of gospel testimony and gospel results, for surely it is an opportunity for God to carry on according to His own heart, not only His own mind, but His own heart -- "God so loved the world", @John 3:16. It is a time just now for gospel testimony and results from it to follow, and they will be for His own pleasure, for the scene affords pleasure for the heart and mind of God, and the heart and mind of Christ, the Spirit Himself
{392}
operating, the great potential Operator subjectively here since Pentecost, unfailingly operating to bring about conditions affording pleasure for the heart of God. It is a question of what is for the heart of God, and hence we have this centurion causing the Lord to wonder, and surely to think of what he and many like him would be eternally.
And this brings me to speak for a moment of faith. Without faith there is simply nothing. What I am saying and what is here is a case of faith. Faith exists. There is hardly anything one can speak of so important as faith at the present time, because the enemy's aim is to use military achievements, and presently industrial and social effort and achievements to accomplish things. The enemy has marshalled his forces for it and will be successful because of what man is, but God is ready to operate, so this centurion becomes suggestive of what is the great point at the present moment, namely, the possession of faith. Let me be allowed to be simple with a word of exhortation. We need faith, and faith is available. The Lord says: "When the Son of man comes shall he indeed find faith on the earth?" That was His question; it was not answered, but I do know there is faith on the earth now, that the results of what has happened, and present sorrows, denote the existence of faith in the brethren, I know that. But the Lord speaks of great faith, and He speaks here in a relative sense, there was not the like of it in Israel. It has a present application, so we are reminded we are not to be content with the thing as it is -- more and more is the idea. If there be faith, let it be increased, let me not forget what the Lord said in answer to the disciples, "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Be transported hence there, and it shall transport itself", @Matthew 17:20. I am not ignoring that He said to Peter, "O, thou of little faith", @Matthew 14:31. I am afraid that applies to most of us: I
{393}
am thankful it applies to us at all, but the Lord is talking here of great faith.
Now I leave this case and go on to the woman of Sidon in @Matthew 15. In verses 27 and 28 she says, "Yea, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters. Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, thy faith is great. Be it to thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed from that hour". The scene in @Luke 7 involves a military officer, religious leaders, and a servant who represents the working class. These are grouped now, too, only the working class, you might say, are on the top. The relations between the centurion in Capernaum and his servant are most touching, He loved his servant. If all employers loved all those employed, I should say there would be an end to unionism. Love is the great thing, and God is going to bring about love, the great moral triumph where love will prevail. But here we have a class that is under reproach, not because of its religion, or love for Christ or the people of God, but the woman is a Canaanite, a heathen, an alien from the commonwealth of Israel, and a stranger to the covenants of promise, @Ephesians 2:12. But the Lord sees fit to select her to bring out this matter of faith. The gospel aims at that, and so the Lord says, "O woman, great is thy faith". The daughter was made well.
I will dwell for a moment on the effect of Satanic wickedness on young women. She was ailing from an unclean demon, that was her malady, but she was made whole. As the centurion yielded to Christianity, to the results of the gospel in a most marked way, so she, a woman under reproach nationally and her daughter possessed by a demon, becomes a trophy of the gospel. Is it not within our reach? We should not be neglectful of the moment. One of the greatest things is to maintain the character of the dispensation,
{394}
and that character requires gospel testimony and gospel results.
Now to go on to the third passage, @Genesis 24:21. "And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not". What made him hold his peace? I am going to speak a word about the assembly. The assembly is before us in this remarkable chapter, one of the longest and most remarkable in the Bible; the theme is Christ and the assembly. Paul says, "I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly", @Ephesians 5:32. It is a great matter. I believe the Lord is stressing the assembly, the assembly as a whole, not so much the local as the universal feature, and it is the greatest thing, as I understand, in the universe. It is referred to in that sense in the Scriptures; it is referred to femininely and in many other ways, and it comes into line in the testimony of God as the most exalted and the greatest thing in the whole universe, and my hope is that what I have entered on now will lead the brethren to think a little more of it, and its dignity, and what it is in the mind of God in the sense of exaltation, what it is in the sense of lovableness, what it is in the sense of administrative ability. It is going to appear in all these senses, to come down from God out of heaven, having the glory of God. Let us think of these ascriptions and fit ourselves into the thing that is spoken of and see if we cannot learn to walk a little more in its blessed light, the light most precious, that is what it is, the light of the assembly which radiates throughout the whole universe. Anything that is to be made a matter of instruction will come out through it, it grows into a holy temple in the Lord; it grows, and we want to be in the growth. It is a question of growth, not that we shall grow eternally as has sometimes been said, and I would here warn against novelties. I am ashamed and alarmed at the novelties that are put out in readings
{395}
and private conversations without any effort to support them by Scripture. God has His ideal, and He finishes His work; the unfinished parts go on here until they are finished, to "present every man perfect in Christ", @Colossians 1:28. Beware of novelties. Let Scripture have its force amongst us in our Bible readings, in our addresses (I am not, of course, eliminating myself) and in our conversation at our tables let it ever come into mind what the Scripture says, "What saith the scripture?" @Romans 4:3, @Galatians 4:30. The Bereans searched the Scriptures to see whether "these things were so", @Acts 17:11.
So the assembly, as I was saying, is so great and so glorious, and this type is most descriptive in the sense in which I am speaking. The idea originated with Abraham, that is to say, by extension the thought of the assembly originated with the Father; it originated with Christ, but it is more with the Father, the great thought running through this long chapter originated with Abraham. We are now in the presence of God and in the presence of the Father's affections for the Son and whom the Son is to have for His bride, and so the eldest servant of his house must be in charge. It is a great matter to have in our minds that the Spirit of God is here and is in charge -- what was said of the Angel in Exodus.
We should be afraid of saying anything contrary to Scripture, do not let it pass. The father is in mind; we are in the presence of the father and the eldest servant in his house, typically the Holy Spirit. It is wonderful that the Spirit should take such a place and be so lowly. Even the servant's name is not given here, it is the eldest servant of the father's house, the one most reliable who has everything in his hand, and who sets out on his mission, that mission being to secure this person who is described here, and who causes him wonderment. I am speaking to those who form the assembly, and it is a question of bringing it right down to ourselves as to whether
{396}
we have these traits coming under the hand of the Spirit of God in His holy operations here below in our assemblies, in our services, whatever it be, in our ordinary occupations, let us be in the presence of the Spirit of God. He is here present; even for ordinary matters we can reckon on the Holy Spirit to be with us.
Verse 16 says, "And the maiden was very fair in countenance", notice that, "a virgin, and no man had known her. And she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. And the servant ran to meet her" -- we should seek to visualise this in a spiritual way -- "and said, Let me, I pray thee, sip a little water out of thy pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord!"
I speak to the young brothers and sisters here. One has to come back to them; they are the ones heaven is looking on, expecting from; one generation goes and another comes, and the present one is the one to be relied upon; it is a question of quality in men coming out of the Army. How is the assembly to be displayed in them, and the young sisters, too, what is the Spirit of God looking on, what is He expecting to see? Rebecca said, "Drink, my lord! and she hasted, and let down her pitcher on her hand" (notice the 'hand'), "and gave him to drink. And when she had given him enough to drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also". There were ten of them, and I need not comment on how much water it would require to satisfy all those camels, and Rebecca undertook to supply them with water. Let us not say anything at all about how much we have to do. It is a time of doing. God is doing, the Spirit is doing, the ministers are doing, the angels are doing. It is a time of activity, of skill, a time also of ability, and so Rebecca is emblematic of all this in the way she undertook to supply the need of these camels.
However, the word that I am coming to now is she "drew for all his camels ... And the man
{397}
was astonished at her, remaining silent, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not". The answer is in the affirmative, it was prosperous in the extreme, and the very centre of it, the evidence of the prosperity is the quality of this young person and how the servant admired her, for that is the idea. I have already alluded to the quality of wonder in the divine realm, and these qualities are in ourselves; they are intended to be there, and, thank God, they are there. I speak in a certain way victoriously, that God has brought about such a number of persons who are of the assembly, and who have it within their reach to dignify it, to make the assembly the greatest thing. It is that now in administrative power, and it will be that eternally, and so, as I said, it is within our reach to beautify the thought, to begin with the abstract thought of the assembly. It runs right through this chapter, and remember the apostle's words, "I speak as to Christ and as to the assembly". Let us not only speak, but think and pray about it, so that it may come out more and more according to what it is in the divine thought, and according to what it is by the working of the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God is the great medium of all operations beginning with new birth. He was not the medium of the physical creation, although He had a part in it: it was by the Lord Jesus, not as the Son, but as God, He created the heavens and the earth. He Himself is the Creator of all things, let us never forget that. Scripture is full of it, but the Holy Spirit is also here on the subjective side operating, and all the operations are in His hands and they are successful.
One looks at the number present here, not in any natural sort of way to glorify ourselves, but to glorify God. We are the fruit of God's work, the fruit of the Spirit's work, and we may say the fruit of the work of each other. We are to be workers with each
{398}
other, to help each other. Let us glory in our great calling, let us honour it, let us not degrade it, let us maintain the greatness, the glory, the dignity of the assembly, both in its beauty and its workmanship, and in all else that I can speak of and enlarge on, but let it be in our hearts, and let us rise up from this place and go forth in the sight of God and of heaven. It is an opportune time to go in for all these things. There is only a little while, and we are all caught up to heaven, as it is said in @Acts 10, in regard of the sheet -- it was taken up into heaven. It was let down, but it all went up into heaven. It is a question of testimony, and then going up to heaven and coming out in a great administrative way, first in the millennium, and then the state eternal.
May God bless His word to us.

THE LORD MAINTAINING CONTACT WITH HIS OWN
@John 14:15 - 25; @1 Corinthians 15:3 - 9
J.T. It came to me this morning that Paul's remarks in this fifteenth chapter of his first letter to the Corinthians are particularly significant just now, as showing how the Lord though in heaven maintains contact with His people, the contact being continuous according to this passage, continuous from the time of His resurrection. We cannot say it ever terminated, but evidently it alludes to the assembly and runs on down to Paul as he reports, and this fact shows that it is maintained after He went up to heaven. Events began with the appearance to Cephas, according to verse 5, then to the twelve, then to above five hundred brethren at once, then to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all as an abortion, the apostle says, He appeared to me also. We know that He appeared at other times to Paul, and obviously it was Himself, not merely in a spiritual sense, but actually Himself. Then @John 14 describes in a general way what enters into this dispensation, evidently dependent on the Spirit, as it is worked out from @John 14:15, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you", and then, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", @John 14:18. That is the point where we link on with 1 Corinthians, or 1 Corinthians links on with John. I was impressed at the breaking of bread this morning that the Lord maintains contact with us, actual contact with us in the assembly.
{400}
Ques. Would you say a word as to the difference between the way the Lord maintains contact with us characteristically, with those that love Him, and yet the fact that we break bread in His absence and He comes to us specifically?
J.T. I think these facts we have already spoken of would imply that the Lord intended in the earlier comings and goings to accustom His saints, as forming the assembly, to the thought of His visitations. We are told in @Acts 1:21 that a witness was to be chosen "of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us". He, therefore, accustomed them to that principle of coming in and going out amongst His own, apparently intending to carry it on after He died and rose and went to heaven. He could have effected the same thing in a certain sense in a mediatorial way coming through others, taking up servants and using them in a representative way, but He evidently desired to do the thing Himself. Of course, the Spirit would be here, and I think this thought is worked out from that fact -- that He would be here. At the same time the Lord is clearly saying He would act Himself, and Paul also said that He did come Himself, and he is a testimony to it.
A.J.G. Is that intended to impress us with the special intimacy that is to exist between Christ and the assembly?
J.T. I think on those lines. Verses 15, 16 and 17 of @John 14 contemplate very great intimacy between Himself and the disciples, and He calls attention to the fact "that he may be with you". "I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter", @John 14:16, the word is 'Paraclete', one with us all the time, alongside of us, corresponding with the Lord's presence above. There is a point of contact between
{401}
the Spirit and the Lord. He would accustom them to the Spirit as He came down, as if the Lord would make it a matter of custom, so that they should understand the Spirit's presence here, and here permanently, so He says, "another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him: but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you", that is the Spirit was there, I apprehend, in the Lord Himself, which would enable them to become acquainted with Him in the manner of His dwelling in the Lord Jesus. "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", as though the Lord intended to make them accustomed to the great facts of the movements of divine Persons, particularly His own.
Rem. So that the contact between the Lord and the assembly is really maintained by reason of the fact of the Spirit being here, and yet it is the Lord Himself.
J.T. While the Lord was here the Spirit was here in Him, and they thus became accustomed to the manner of the Spirit's presence here, but it would be more so when He was not only with them, but in them.
A.J.G. Does that imply we should be more sensitive to the Spirit's presence and movements, as well as sensitive to the Lord's own drawing near?
J.T. That is an important matter. I wonder whether we can discern holy, divine Persons severally. It seems to me as if the Lord would tell us that it can be so.
J.R.S. Have you in your mind the Holy Spirit being here permanently would prepare the disciples for these visitations?
J.T. I think that is right. His own promise would prepare them for that, and His own habit, too,
{402}
before He died. He came in and went out amongst them. All that was educational.
Ques. Do you think if we were more in the characteristic recognition of the presence of the Spirit the ability to discern the Lord's movements would be developed with us?
J.T. I think that is the way it works out. We are really entering on a matter which is inscrutable. In a general sense who could undertake to say it is the Lord, and not the Father, the Spirit and not the Lord, yet the Lord intimates that they may be discerned.
Ques. Have you specially in mind the Supper, and the peculiar way that affords opportunity for the Lord to come to us?
J.T. I think that is right. The Lord is teaching us in a very tender way. He intended the Supper to be the beginning of things as regards the service of God, because clearly it goes deeper and deeper. We have the idea of the depths of God, and we go deeper and deeper as we proceed in the Lord's supper. We go deeper and deeper, and it makes way for other things, and these other things make way for the Father. The Lord has His intercourse with the assembly initially, then His intercourse with us maritally, as we might say, when there is clearly in His mind a time that should be devoted to that. We were speaking this morning about Isaac's dallying with Rebecca, and his relation to her was not disclosed publicly until it happened, that is to say, after a long sojourn in Gerar, among the Philistines. The king of the Philistines looked out through a window and saw this, and called attention to it, and it was evidenced that she was his wife, not only his sister. I think that enters into the ever-deepening of the relations both with His saints viewed as the assembly specifically, and then His relations with the Father; the Spirit, too, coming in in the whole
{403}
course of the meeting. The Spirit has His place with ourselves, even in our houses, and on the way to the meeting, and in the meeting, and then the Lord taking account of the saints viewed as the assembly in a feminine sense, then there is the thought of what the Spirit is. The Father is pleased to speak of Him as the Spirit of adoption -- the Spirit of sonship, so that it seems to me clear that divine Persons are intended to be known severally.
Rem. And each making room for each other, the Father being content that the Son should have something for Himself, but the Son Himself anxious that the Father should have His portion. Do you think we get, as it were, the unselfishness of divine love?
J.T. Just so. The Scriptures abound with illustrations of the matter, because it is the greatest possible matter, it must be; especially in the Song of Songs there are illustrations, and in certain remarks of Paul's in his letters to Corinth and Ephesus.
Ques. Do you think Paul's prayer in @Ephesians 1:17 would help in this matter of discernment, "that ... the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, being enlightened in the eyes of your heart?"
J.T. I think that is very appropriate to bring in here. You can understand how the Father would open up things for us in that sense, and especially in view of His own inheritance. What a domain it is, how wide, and how the spirit of liberty governs and enters into it throughout.
Ques. May we refer back for a moment to the thought of dallying in @Genesis 26? You were speaking this morning of time being given for it. Would the bride in the Song of Songs be in keeping with that in her charge to the daughters of Jerusalem to "stir not up nor awake my love till he please?" @Song of Songs 2:7. Is it in your mind that the saints should have a particular portion for Christ in their minds as understanding
{404}
He would fill it out before taking us on to the service of God?
J.T. What touches there are as to feelings between the feminine and masculine speakers. There is no reference really, you may say, to God, as though we are intended to think that the Lord Jesus takes up the time with the assembly, the Father, as it were leaves Him with that.
J.J.T. Why does the apostle link this great matter with the glad tidings?
J.T. I think to bring out the truth of the dispensation in Corinth. It was what they had received, "For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures; and that he was seen of Cephas", and then the list, as though he intended that these great facts should run down into the dispensation. I believe that is the intent. The dispensation is unique; there has never been one like it, and never will be. The Lord intended that He should have His way in it, and Paul, of course, writes by the Spirit, and gives us these facts, ending the list with himself.
G.W.B. I should like to ask, to grasp what is in your mind, you do not say, do you, there is any manifestation by the Lord apart from the Spirit?
J.T. I should not like to say that. What have you in your mind?
G.W.B. I thought that you were distinguishing between the Lord coming and the Spirit being with us.
J.T. You speak of manifestations.
G.W.B. I mean what you referred to at the beginning, the Lord coming to us.
J.T. What is your question?
G.W.B. Whether the Lord would come to us in any way apart from the Spirit?
{405}
J.T. I do not see why you should say that, because Paul's record applies, that the Lord literally came out of heaven to see him. I should say at this point the Spirit was not in Paul, is that not so?
A.J.G. You are referring to the Lord appearing to him on the road to Damascus?
J.T. That is what Paul is alluding to here.
F.W. What is the difference between manifestation and appearing?
J.T. The word here is 'appearing'.
F.W. One seems to be conditional, that is in John which is a love matter; in 1 Corinthians it is the Lord's operations in view of what He has in mind.
J.T. Manifestation in John is a characteristic word. As regards appearing, what we are dealing with now is whether the Lord could appear otherwise than by the Spirit, or in relation to the Spirit, and I think what has been said shows that He could or did. What do you think about that, Mr. G.?
A.J.G. I was looking up the passage in the Acts where it says, "the following night the Lord stood by him", @Acts 23:11. Would that link on with what you are saying?
J.T. Chapter 9 is the first instance.
W.C. In the second passage Paul had received the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so. In chapter 9 certainly not so, and that is important, although I must confess the question has never been raised before.
A.J.G. I think we have always rather assumed that the Lord manifesting Himself to us in assembly was conditional, and dependent on the presence of the Spirit.
J.T. No doubt. Our brother has raised the question now, and this passage in @Acts 9:4 has been cited: "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutes!" -- that is the Lord personally --
{406}
"But rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do ... And Saul rose up from the earth, and his eyes being opened he saw no one. But leading him by the hand they brought him into Damascus. And he was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor drank". Now elsewhere we are told that he received the Spirit. "Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away", Ananias told him, @Acts 22:16, and he became indwelt by the Spirit.
W.C. Would you make a difference between appearing in grace, and appearing in love? Would the first be in relation to the gospel and the second the assembly?
J.T. Quite so. We cannot belittle the fact that the Spirit is here, and that is what we begin with. At the same time we may as well face the fact if it involves the truth.
G.H.M. Does it bear upon the point that as Isaac walked in the fields it was Rebecca who detected him?
J.T. He did not notice Rebecca first. Isaac noted the camels, but she saw him: he was coming from the well Lahai-roi, coming and going as you might say, that was in his mind, and you cannot assume Rebecca had the Spirit typically even yet.
Rem. In @John 20:22 it speaks of their receiving the Spirit after Christ had appeared to them.
J.T. Yes, they had not got the Spirit. He breathed into them after He came in. Another instance.
Ques. When the disciple whom Jesus loved said, It is the Lord, does this bear on it? I thought it was the Lord Himself -- what you had in mind.
J.T. That is what we should see; the Lord Himself came and spoke to Paul, and He appeared to these several ones after He arose, before they had the Spirit.
{407}
C.H. Is your point that divine Persons each have a right to act by Themselves as well as in collaboration with one another?
J.T. I am not sure collaboration is on the same ground. The Lord says He does nothing of Himself save what He sees the Father doing. We have to analyse our words. It is all a mystery. As a matter of fact we are dealing with the most sacred, and greatest things, and in touching them need to be in the attitude of Isaac, a type of the Lord Himself; he was coming and going to the well, as if that were in his mind, and that was in the Lord's mind as He rose from the dead until He went up to heaven. Rebecca, until she saw Isaac, is not a type of a person who has the Spirit.
Ques. What would the camels suggest?
J.T. It is a question of the Spirit as the power for carrying.
Ques. Is there any light for us in the fact that the Spirit of God is scarcely mentioned in Colossians? As though the epistle being indited by the Spirit He seems to keep Himself out of the matter, so that a clear view may be seen of Christ, that we may not have two persons in our minds -- it is the greatness of Christ.
J.T. And the greatness of the saints as subjects of the work of the Spirit, what He has effected.
Ques. What bearing has the passage in @2 Corinthians 3:17, "the Spirit of the Lord", and, "the Lord the Spirit"?
J.T. Another passage which bears on it. The Lord is the quickening Spirit, but that does not mean that He is the Holy Spirit, nor the Holy Spirit in the sense of the passage which you quote. You must keep divine Persons clear in your mind.
Rem. The Lord is the Spirit of the covenant.
J.T. I think so: it is carried down into what was said earlier.
{408}
Rem. Yet it is the Lord -- that Person.
C.H. I think our brother had the scripture in his mind, "even as by (the) Lord (the) Spirit", @2 Corinthians 3:18. The two are linked together. I think we should like some help on this, because we have thought that the Lord's coming to His own, especially in assembly, was by the medium of the Spirit of God.
J.T. I think the Lord is jealous about all these matters we are speaking of, and He would be jealous about His personal relations with the assembly.
J.S.E. Is it right to say that in the measure in which we make room for the Holy Spirit and His teaching in relation to the truth of the assembly we become capacitated to discern the Lord Himself when He comes?
J.T. Quite so, but remember that the saints are personal entities, and are personal formations, collective formations, too, but personal entities, and have to be regarded according to what has been said in Colossians. The Spirit of God is putting forward in Colossians His own work, and that work makes much of Christ. The first chapter shows how the Colossian saints are regarded as capable of that, and Paul speaks about his face, so that whilst the Spirit is here, the power of everything, so to speak, yet His formation, His own work is in persons, and these persons are entities, and they can do things. I am only saying that to make everything clear. Whilst you say they are dependent on the Spirit, and they are, the Spirit would have us think of His own work. "What has God wrought!" (`62:1), that will come out presently, and be taken account of by itself, and the assembly by itself. That will be the great word -- what has God wrought! But what He is working now is the point for us, how the brethren have come through, and the Lord is ready to make much of that.
A.J.G. Would you say what is in your mind regarding this thought of the Lord manifesting Himself
{409}
to His own? @John 14 seems to flow out of the reference to the Comforter being sent.
J.T. That is just what I was thinking. We should begin with, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever". Another Comforter is another Person: the Lord was one Comforter when He was here. He was the Paraclete in the midst, by them, and the Spirit is to be the same. First He is with them, and then in them, so that it seems to me we ought to make allowance when we speak of the Spirit doing things for what He has done, what the persons are that are affected, as after all, we shall be there as persons.
W.C. Would "if ye love me" imply spiritual persons?
J.T. I should think so: it was His own work.
E.H. It has been said that in assembly the Spirit impersonates the Lord. What would you say about that?
J.T. Maybe I have said it myself.
E.H. I think you did.
J.T. We had better go by what we are saying today.
Rem. I think you said the Lord impersonates Himself by the Spirit.
J.T. That would be nearer. There is such a thing as impersonation. In regard of Elias, it is "If ye will receive it, this is Elias, who is to come", @Matthew 11:14. In some sense he impersonated Elias. The Spirit may be viewed in that way as impersonating Christ. We cannot go all the way, but what we are saying here today is the truth, let everybody say whether it is or whether it is not. Paul was appeared to by the Lord, the Spirit was not the agent, and yet the Lord appeared to him; he says so in @1 Corinthians 15:8.
Ques. Whilst you would allow that the Lord from
{410}
His side may not choose to use that way of drawing near, from our side would it not be that the power to recognise the Lord and response largely lies in the work of the Spirit in our hearts?
J.T. Quite so. If you think of the brethren who form the assembly, when the Lord comes in they would recognise Him, and He them. I believe that is what is meant. He intended to make them familiar with Himself before He died. If He is thinking of making Himself personally acquainted with them He stays with them forty days, but if He is thinking of being in heaven, and the service on earth, He does not stay a day according to Luke. Why should there be such a difference? He is thinking of one thing in Acts and another in Luke. In the latter He is thinking of the great matter of administration He was going to take up. Whereas in Acts it is another view, and so the writer sees the Lord forty days on earth before He goes up, and tells us what happens in that period. But all that happened as described in @1 Corinthians 15 is not told, because Paul's case was later, and perhaps some of the other events were later.
A.M. Is there a reason why Paul refers to spiritual manifestations in @1 Corinthians 12 and @1 Corinthians 14, before chapter 15? Is there any link between the latter and spiritual manifestations? The first verse of @1 Corinthians 12:1 is "concerning spiritual manifestations", and the first verse of @1 Corinthians 14:1 is "Follow after love, and be emulous of spiritual manifestations, but rather that ye may prophesy". In chapter 12 he brings in the thought of distinguishing between the operations of divine Persons. I wondered what relation that would have to chapter 15.
J.T. I do not think there is much connection; the word 'spiritual' is by itself. It is the idea of spirituals, what would come out doubtless in the Spirit in the assembly, and we have much of that in
{411}
our ministry meetings. Our ministry meetings really work out from that. There is not much if there is not something of that kind, but when you come to chapter 15 the apostle is dealing with the whole matter of Christianity beginning with the gospel. Then he goes on to the appearings. He begins with Cephas. Luke says He appeared to Simon, but this in Corinthians is another view, it has reference to the assembly, the apostle is speaking of assembly material in this passage. The name Cephas was given by the Lord to Peter, and clearly is material. The same with @Matthew 16 -- assembly material, and I think we should bear that in mind, in chapter 15, because it is the gospel right down to the coming of the Lord and the eternal conditions -- a very wide scope.
That that we began with in @John 14 ought to be dealt with now, bearing in mind @1 Corinthians 15. What is said in @John 14 in the passage read is collateral, as showing how the Lord familiarised the disciples with Himself, and with the Spirit, so that when the Spirit comes He was to be apprehended as a Comforter, a Person, and that He dwelt with them which would mean He was with them while the Lord was here, now dwelling in them, the same Person.
Rem. He was with them while the Lord was here, in the Lord.
J.T. Quite so. The Spirit operated while the Lord was here, too, and yet we cannot say He operated through the Lord.
G.H.M. Does not a good deal hinge on another side, in the sense of being additional and not substitutional?
J.T. The idea of the additional thought was there before the Spirit came from heaven, sent by the Father. "If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons", @Matthew 12:28. He did things by the Spirit. The Spirit did things, too, by Himself, as people were born again, Nicodemus
{412}
was, I would say, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul", @Acts 13:2, was the Spirit's action.
C.G. The Lord distinguished between the Spirit coming to them and His own movements toward them. They are distinct movements from distinct Persons.
J.T. Quite so. It is important that the Spirit was not here officially till the Lord went up. The Lord was full of the matter that the Spirit would come. This is how it reads: "And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him". He had not come yet, they were not indwelt, but He says, Ye know Him, He abides with you. I understand that as being in the Lord, though He was here in a sense in the Old Testament times. This passage, however, is very definite and specific. It is emphatic. "Ye know him, for he abides with you and shall be in you". Coming to you is another matter, the two things have to be held as they are. The Spirit would come, and the Lord would come.
C.G. In what sense do we know the Spirit?
J.T. I wish I knew, I really do, because I am sure it is a matter to be considered. I would say surely these meetings are for that purpose, suggestions come to us that have not come to us before, and we are to follow them up.
Rem. In @Acts 8:29 it is first the angel of the Lord. Later on the Spirit said, "Go near, and join thyself to this chariot".
J.T. It is good to bring that out. It shows we are in the realm of divine operations. The angel first, and then the Spirit, we are advancing in quality, and so the Spirit says, "Go ... join thyself to this chariot". The Spirit was thinking of the Ethiopian eunuch and thinking of Philip. He had done well in
{413}
doing what the angel told him to do, and now he is told to join himself to the chariot, and does it, and then we are told, pursuing that subject, that the Spirit raptured Philip. That is another matter, it is His own action, too, He took Philip away.
J.R.S. Do you think light can be gained individually apart from coming out in the meetings?
J.T. I would be governed by the things that happen. If, for instance, I am on the street and a car is liable to run over and kill me, and it does not, I would say that was angelic, I would know who the agent was, because the angels are deputed for that thing.
A.J.G. As Peter preached in @Acts 10 the Spirit fell on his hearers. That would seem to suggest there should be ability to recognise the Spirit's own movements and speaking.
J.T. I am sure that is right, and you are speaking as I am. We should be finding out about these things.
Rem. Verse 17, "The Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you". The last clause is prospective. Was the first one present then, "He abides with you?" Do you read that to mean the Spirit was there abiding with them, as in the Lord? The latter what He would be as coming down?
J.T. I do.
A.M. Yet it says, "that he may be with you for ever", that would not be in the Lord.
J.T. I suppose the thought is both now. The constitution in the assembly is the Spirit with us and in us. No one of us has the Spirit by himself, or could contain Him by himself. The Spirit is here collectively. He has come down to the assembly. No one of us could receive the Spirit by himself, and contain Him, but the assembly can. So we have the
{414}
word in @John 3:34, "God gives not the Spirit by measure".
J.R.S. Would it greatly help us in our meetings for prayer if we recognised that the Spirit was not individual, but in the company?
J.T. You do not want Him that way, any more than you want to go up to heaven by yourself. We shall go up together with the brethren, and so it is that the blessed Spirit in His operations works collectively, but also individually, too, but individually as in the company.
Rem. So in the beginning of Acts the Spirit "filled all the house where they were sitting", and, "sat upon each one of them", @Acts 2:3. The collective position was there, but every individual formed an integral part of it.
J.T.Jr. Would it be right to refer to @Ezekiel 43 in relation to our assembly service? "The Spirit lifted me up", "and the man stood by me", @Ezekiel 43:6. Is the Lord apprehended in manhood?
J.T. That is good. The man stood by me, you could hardly say that is the Spirit. The same thing could be said when the Lord was here -- a Man stood by the brethren. The Spirit operating, but not as indwelling.
C.H. I was wondering whether that passage, "abides with you and shall be in you", rather confirms what you said earlier as to our depending on the Spirit in a general way, and what He has effected in the souls of the saints.
J.T. It would work out for us that way as to happenings. I was speaking about angelic service. I think I could discover who had acted by what was done. This meeting is not a question of angelic help, but the Lord's voice may be heard. I would go by what was said, and how it was said. The Spirit's voice may be heard, and would mean He is speaking in relation to the company.
A.J.G. In addition to the great fact that the
{415}
Spirit abides with us for ever, there is this matter of the Lord's personal visitations.
J.T. I should not like to give it up; it is spiritual and mysterious and both are true. There is such a thing as the Lord coming, and these instances we have show that He can come personally.
Rem. Would you not say He does come?
J.T. I would. When I say 'come', the Lord Jesus can come out of heaven any time He pleases in a corporeal sense. I do not say He does, but He could.
Rem. If you say the Lord can only come by the Spirit you are limiting a divine Person, and we can all see that to do so is not correct, yet when it comes to our apprehension and enjoyment and response to the Lord's movements, is this not contingent on the fact that the Spirit of God has worked in our hearts?
J.T. I think that helps us as to the part the Lord takes Himself. If He is speaking in relation to the company, or to the whole assembly, I would gather He was speaking by the Spirit. Hence when the word came to Antioch Paul and Barnabas had been there for a year. They were in the assembly and taught a great crowd for a year, which would mean that the Spirit was there operating, in a few at first, but evidently the crowd would diminish and the assembly would increase by the action of the Spirit, and then in @Acts 13:2 the Spirit says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". Then we are told what they did, but being sent forth by the Holy Spirit was a collective matter; and we are told before the ministry that went on by these gifted men, and now the Spirit had liberty to operate, and did operate in an outstanding period when the missionary work of Paul and Barnabas began.
Ques. Why is the Spirit of God mentioned in each
{416}
chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, and so little in Colossians?
J.T. It is significant He is mentioned in Ephesians and so little in Colossians. We ought to go back to the beginning of the Ephesian assembly. What was it? There were twelve men there, disciples of John, and Paul says to them, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed? And they said to him, We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come", @Acts 19:2. When they heard that they were baptised and received the Spirit. Paul laid his hands on them, the Spirit came on them really through Paul, which is another thing, so that I suppose that is in mind in view of the place the Ephesian assembly would have in the economy. What a place it has -- all the unfolding of the truth of the counsels of God.
P.H. When you speak of manifestations, are these manifestations made in a collective sense? Are you emphasising that side?
J.T. Not at all. There was one to Cephas, then to the twelve, by themselves first, as the twelve is administrative, and then the apostles as authoritative, then one to James. In regard to Cephas he is going to be a great workman by himself, and the Lord appeared to him accordingly.
C.D. "I will not leave you orphans". Does He come in response to desire?
J.T. Possibly, or need, anyway. The Lord would not say that when they had the Spirit. As it was they were left to themselves. I am coming to you, but the Spirit came first in that sense.
Rem. Much is made of the individual side -- orphans, coming to you, and, Ye see me, the collective side, but @John 14:21, "I will love him and will manifest myself to him", much is left open to the individual potentially.
J.T. That comes down to our own time. "I will not leave you orphans", the state they were in.
{417}
"Yet a little and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live. In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him". We have to face all these things. Can the Lord not manifest Himself to any of us? It is a question of His ability, what He can do, and what He is at liberty to do if He wishes.
G.H.M. Does not the Lord reserve to Himself His prerogative to present Himself living?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. It is striking before the Spirit had come He charged them by the Holy Spirit.
J.T. It is remarkable.
Ques. What is involved in that?
J.T. He is dealing with the dispensation that is going to be characterised in that way. He is saying, That is what I am doing, and you are to be marked in the same way. The Spirit is the power for it.
