SPIRITUAL FORMATION FOR ASSEMBLY SERVICE (1)
@Colossians 1: 1 - 29
J.T. The features of the truth presented in the epistle to the Colossians are well known to the brethren, at least it is assumed that they are well known, but it is hoped that certain features that have not been stressed may come before us at this time, and particularly the idea of hope; then the personal side is pronounced in the epistle. Paul's own feeling and thoughts, personal thoughts, are brought forward, he not having seen the saints at Colosse; a peculiar matter, which, of course, would apply at the present time to us. We cannot speak of any links with apostolic ministry, or even with such ministry as has an apostolic character; none of us can speak much of this. The occasion therefore has to be one amongst us who know each other, and specially the younger men, many of whom have been travelling under the government of God, and have come in touch with the brethren elsewhere. The knowledge we thus have of each other is, in this sense, considerably enlarged, as compared with earlier days. It is well to keep this in mind that we are not so far away from each other in the physical sense as we used to be.
Then the names mentioned by the apostle, such as Epaphras and others, are to be noted, especially some of them who are outstanding, one of them known to the Colossians as one of themselves. The personal side therefore is important, especially if it is spiritual. Spirituality enters into our personal acquaintance with each other, and the knowledge that many of us have acquired through the recent governmental circumstances of the wars. All this would be in mind, and especially with such a man as Epaphras who was one of them, and was marked by combat for the truth and for them.

The apostle's opening word is characteristic, "Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus, by God's will, and Timotheus the brother, to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ which are in Colosse", and then he says, "We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ continually when praying for you, having heard" (that is, what he has to say was based on testimony rendered to him by others) "having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which ye have towards all the saints, on account of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens; of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the glad tidings, which are come to you, as they are in all the world, and are bearing fruit and growing, even as also among you, from the day ye heard them and knew indeed the grace of God, in truth: even as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-bondman, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you, who has also manifested to us your love in the Spirit". I have just read this section to bring out the personal side, and how it was seen in Epaphras. He is mentioned later, showing how important a personality he was in the apostle's mind, and that there are such persons who are reliable and have influence and have care for the local position. It is a matter of the first importance that the local position should be properly cared for, and that brethren who have ability and gift should not forget that the local position in each place has to be maintained.
W.H. Would this reference to Timotheus "the brother" bear on the character of the epistle definitely as opening up the features of the Christian circle?
J.T. Quite so; he is called *the* brother, as if the term brother applied peculiarly to him.
A.Al. Was not Timotheus himself personally introduced in that way as one who was "well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium"? @Acts 16: 2.
J. T. He is brought forward at first on those lines and is particularly noted as one of whom there was a
{3}
good report locally. The idea of universal service, or servants, is in the Scriptures, but generally, even in Paul and Barnabas, the local position is maintained. After their first journey of service they returned to Antioch and remained a considerable time with the brethren, as if to establish the importance of the local principle and that it was not to be overshadowed even by gift. Each is to have his part in it, because Corinthians, which is the scripture that bears on that point, stresses the importance of the local position, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth". We do not get it here or in Ephesus, so much; it is Corinth that is in mind. Just now it is a question of Colosse and the personnel mentioned, showing that one of themselves is marked by spiritual feelings and concern about the local position.
Ques. Would you look for a sober recognition of the government of God as entering into our localities; placing us there with a view to filling out our part in it, and strengthening what is of God in the place?
J.T. Just so. The military circumstances that have preceded us are not to be overlooked, because the two wars were not simply accidental. They have to do with the government of God, and the bearing of the government of God on the saints, especially the young men, is to be noted.
H.Bd. Would what is said as to Samuel help? It says, "his return was to Ramah; for there was his house, and there he judged Israel".
J.T. It would indeed. "There was his house". As we have it even again in Corinthians, "have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?". The bearing of the house on the assembly position is in mind and it is striking that it should appear as early as Samuel. He had a regular circuit and although some of his family did not turn out too well, yet he did not forget his house.
M.A.W. Is the importance of "one of you" in the last chapter striking as linking on with the local thought?
{4}
"Onesimus ... who is one of you" and "Epaphras, who is one of you".
J.T. Just so; he was one of them. So that he represents what we are speaking of, the importance of the local position. The epistle to Philemon bears on all this.
Ques. Would the mention of the elderhood in relation to Timothy's gift also bear this out and stress the importance of the local position?
J.T. His gift, of course, was connected with Paul too, but the elderhood is important and it bears on what we are saying, because the elders are never regarded as universal; they are properly local. They are first mentioned peculiarly in @Acts 14, where the apostles Paul and Barnabas chose elders in each assembly, showing that in their minds the local position was to be properly cared for.
W.S.S. Epaphras would seem to be one who had cared for the local position, and in consequence found himself linked with the apostle in his universal service.
J.T. That is just what we were saying, that he was one of them that clearly cared for the local position, he combated for them. Evidently he or someone must have told Paul about the general position at Colosse, and it was to strengthen it that the epistle was written. The epistles to Corinth begin with the local position and continue on to the universal position. The apostle saying, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies", refers to the universal position, which is to be marked by general unity and not independency. Therefore the customs are to be the same in every assembly, which is one of the most important things that can be mentioned; the idea of general unity in what we are saying and what we teach, and what we do, in our localities.
P.L. Would the princes of the tribes in Numbers illustrate that unity, as each attached to a locality contributed to what is universal?
{5}
J. T. They represent that very idea, for the princes would be influential and would influence all below them for good and for unity.
Ques. Would Philemon show the link between the two sides when it says, "the assembly which is in thine house"?
J.T. Well, that is good. It says, "Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-workman, and to the sister Apphia and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the assembly which is in thine house", that is to say, Philemon's house, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ". So that the position is maintained there, and the nearness of Philemon's position to Colosse is in mind.
P.H.H. Is the question of testimony important, Paul having had the report of what was going on in Colosse by way of accredited testimony? As we hear reports from one locality and another, are we to receive them as accredited testimony?
J.T. It is important to be sure that whatever becomes current in the way of information should be accredited; hence Corinthians stresses "in the mouth of two or three witnesses", and so does Matthew. Therefore whatever is circulated in the sense of information, either as to the work of God, or as to the personnel of the service, should be accredited before circulation.
A.R. The apostle Paul says to the Corinthians, "It hath been declared unto me ... by them which are of the house of Chloe". She evidently reported to the apostle and he speaks of that when writing to them.
J.T. He uses the expression "reported commonly" later, but that common report would be accredited in his mind, I am certain, and so would that be from the house of Chloe. Chloe was evidently a woman and she was reliable, such as Phoebe. Sisters are specially in mind for reliability, that they should be reliable in what they may say.
{6}
E.B. How do you account for the inaccuracy of the report that went out at the end of John's gospel?
J.T. Well, that is to be noted too, but the Spirit of God records what Jesus did not say. If @John 21 be an appendix, then it makes it all the more important that the truth should be fully accredited, and now that we have come to the end of the dispensation it is most important that nothing is given out that is not accurate. We often refer to the Bereans, and that one of them was in Paul's company, according to @Acts 20, as if the apostle would have such a one as that to correct anything that is not according to Scripture. Sometimes notions or thoughts that are given out, it may be at local readings, are circulated and found to be inaccurate and, in fact, untrue, hence the importance of having a Berean or the spirit of the Bereans in our local meetings.
Rem. It is said in Deuteronomy, that if certain things are reported, we are to make diligent search before we accept them.
A. M. Does the quality of faithfulness, so stressed by Paul, therefore apply not only to persons, but to words?
J.T. So that if a report is circulated, the words ought to be carefully analysed. We have already alluded to the expression in @John 21, "Jesus did not say". The Lord is dealing with a special minister that He had in mind, a nameless one so far, at least according to what He said. It was John, of course, "the disciple whom Jesus loved". The Lord had in mind to keep him in reserve, to be used at any time, whether it be he actually or the spirit of what he represents. He was one to be used at any time to bring out some particular feature of the truth. The Lord would stress the need for accuracy in such matters.
Rem. Reverting to the support of the testimony in the locality, there is a rather remarkable verse in 1 Samuel, which perhaps would bear upon it. It says,
{7}
"Behold now, a man of God is in this city, and the man is held in honour; all that he says comes surely to pass. Let us now go thither: perhaps he will show us the way that we should go", @1 Samuel 9: 6. I was thinking that was a striking testimony to what was in the city.
J.T. Quite so. And then the young women, how they were able to tell Saul and his servant where the man of God was. They know, showing the importance of sisters knowing in these matters. As to Colossians, the matter of the brother which was brought forward, "Timotheus the brother", then "the holy and faithful brethren in Christ which are in Colosse", the idea of holiness attaching to the brethren, as well as faithfulness. I am only alluding to the actual wording of the introductory address of Paul, and then what he gives thanks for. His word runs on to the hope, in verse 5, "on account of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens". The word "heavens" is here viewed in the sense of what heaven really is, not the expanse, which would include other things. The word "heavens" here, as coming up in the New Testament, would allude to heaven itself, and what heaven is in regard to matters we are speaking of, but as to the expanse, we have to bear in mind that we have other things besides what is good in the expanse. It says in @Genesis 1, "God called the expanse Heavens", but we have to bear in mind that it is more general. Here the hope is not in the expanse, it is in the heavens, laid up in the heavens for the Colossians.
Ques. Had you in mind that the hope in this connection is limited definitely to the place the assembly has and not any other heavenly family?
J.T. I would think so. It says, "for you"; that is to say, we have to keep in mind who is spoken of and whether the Colossians are viewed simply as a local company or whether they really represent the gentiles, which they do. So what is said to be reserved in the heavens is for the gentiles, I would think. The Jews
{8}
are contemplated as well as the gentiles in Ephesians, but Colossians shows that the gentiles are not at any disadvantage, because the hope is for them, and it is laid up in the heavens, meaning that it is where it is reserved and preserved for them, only they have to come to it. It is a question now of where they are and what God has wrought in them because the epistle depends on what is wrought in us, not only the objective side of things, but what is wrought in us, so that we have means in ourselves of affecting ourselves.
H.F.N. Would you give us a little help in regard to the three fold way the hope is brought in: the reference here to "the hope ... laid up ... in the heavens", then "the hope of the glad tidings", and finally "Christ in you the hope of glory".
J.T. I am glad you bring that forward. The three-fold thought as brought in here in this epistle of *hope*, may be compared with the Thessalonians. It does not say that the Colossians had given it up. In the second epistle to the Thessalonians the idea of hope is dropped, whereas in the first epistle it is found, and here it is found three times. I think that it should be specially stressed that hope should mark us, because things are gradually getting worse in the world and the brethren need to be buoyed up by hope. There are going to be better things for us, but we have to wait for them. "What a man sees", that is the present situation, political, industrial, social or whatever it be, but it is not affording anything, especially for young men and young women. All this is intended, because really God would give the youth to understand that He is thinking of them, and they may count on God anyway to come in for them circumstantially in view of certain things, such as marriage and the like, but on the whole what is so specially needed for all of us, I believe, is the idea of hope. There is little or nothing to be expected here, and so the question is as to whether we are resting in hope.
{9}
H.F.N. Would it be right to link the first reference to hope with the thought of sonship, and the second with the thought of the inheritance? Then would "Christ in you the hope of glory" be the distinctive feature of the Colossian side of the mystery?
J.T. Quite so. God is not spreading things out for unconverted people or even merely religious people. It is a mystery. The hope that we are trusting to involves mystery. And so we are to be instructed in mystery, and hence the need specially of reading Matthew.
E.J.M. Is it a matter for our encouragement that God is pleased to associate Himself with us as the God of hope? "The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing", @Romans 15: 13.
J.T. I was thinking of that as what you would expect in Romans; that is to say, the fundamental truth, especially for the young. So "hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit", a very great and comforting thought, a fundamental thought. So young people are to be established in the truth as to hope. I thought I should add that.
Ques. Would hope make us heavenly?
J.T. Well, it does, it is connected with heaven here.
W.C. Would that link on with chapter 3, "seek the things which are above"? If we hope for them we would seek them.
J.T. Quite so, "where the Christ is". Hope, as in Romans, is a fundamental thought, and it does not make ashamed, because God recompenses us as to what we may speak of as our hope, by the fact that His love is in our hearts. It is not viewed as in heaven, it is in our hearts, "shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".
P.H.H. Would it correspond at all to the book of Deuteronomy? I was thinking that the position of the children of Israel as they stood in the plains of Moab
{10}
looking across the Jordan, corresponded a little with our present position. Moses takes advantage of that, somewhat like Paul here, to speak of the attractive features of the land so as to get the people's hearts engaged with it.
J. T. It is not the easterly outlook that is stressed, but what is over Jordan, that is to say what any one of us may come to, certainly if we are advanced in years. We have to prepare ourselves for, perhaps, departing to be with Christ, and it is said to be "far better". So that we are not disconsolate nor discouraged by anything, even if it be serious illness, but we are occupied with what is over Jordan. In principle it is the land. The Lord, when He said to the thief, "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise", implied that the thing would be very blessed, it would be a blessed condition. That is very wonderful, I think. And so it is that any one of us may be called to depart to be with Christ, but let us have the hope too, that is to say the hope of a better condition.
A.Al. The apostle brings in hope in @1 Corinthians 13 as one of the things that abide. "Now abide faith, hope, love; these three things".
Ques. Was the hope linked with their love to all the saints? It says, "and the love which ye have towards all the saints". We are going to dwell with all the saints eternally, would not that help us to love them now?
J.T. Yes, but we are going to dwell with Christ immediately. It is just as well for us to be practical, for if we are going to be "with Christ", it is immediate, even if we are old or young. It is not a question of joining the throng, it is a question of being *with Christ*; so that it is a better thing, and that would make us more cheerful and stress the thought of hope; already hope is in the matter.
L.E.S. It is said of Abraham, "who against hope believed in hope to his becoming father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be".
{11}
Would that link on with the Colossian epistle in regard to the nations?
J. T. Quite so, and it is not what we see, as it says, "For what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?". Hope refers to what is not seen, and so we should be encouraged as to this point. Whilst there is the great and glorious thought that we are to join the heavenly, the ransomed throng, as we say, and to enter into the actual fact of sonship, because sonship is implied in the full thought of salvation in @Romans 8, yet there is that which precedes that, namely what we may hope for in joining the Lord. He says to the thief, "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise". That is something to think of. Paul said in @2 Corinthians 12 that he did not know whether he was in the body or out of it. But he was in paradise, and that was a truth that he would bring into his ministry. So that those who arc ministering, even if old, have hope in what is immediate, in view of the Lord's coming or of His taking them to be *with* Him at any time.
W.H. So the apostle says, "we are ... pleased rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord", @2 Corinthians 5: 8.
J.T. Quite so. The *immediate* thought of what the Lord will do for us pending the full end of the dispensation is to be before us; that He is thinking of us in view, of what is *better*, is something that very many need to be encouraged with. That brings an element of joy too, but many of us, perhaps, are not very much accustomed to joy in our experience. This may be especially so if we are ministers or gifted men, for we are apt to rest in our gift and what we are doing, whereas the joy lies in what we are coming into, the better things.
Ques. Is this in any way set forth in Caleb when he says, "I brought him word again as it was in my heart"? Was hope there livingly?
J.T. Then he realised it at the end. When he was eighty-five he was equal to what he had been at forty-five
{12}
or forty. Therefore what we are saying as to our having joy in our hearts is very important, especially for those of us who are older. The Lord would say, There is plenty of joy, why not have it? It is all bound up with the Lord's doings. Whatever He may do for us, He has us in His mind, so that we may have joy now, as well as the joy that comes in with our departure to be with Him.
Ques. Reference was made a moment or two ago to faith, hope and love. Would it be out of place to ask what is the difference between faith and hope?
J.T. Well, it is a very good question. We speak more of faith, perhaps, than we speak of hope. While faith is fundamental as to the truth and as to the ministry, hope is intended to stimulate us before things become visible, as it says, "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory". That is to be in our hearts in view of possible dissolution.
Ques. Have you in mind that faith is on the principle of light, while hope is really something arrived at in the way of enjoyment?
J.T. Well, I think hope really involves promise. The promises are very tangible. The Lord says to Philadelphia, "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth". That we are to be taken out of the great tribulation is a promise which I believe the brethren are coming to see. The fact that the Lord has made that promise, as well as other promises, is an element that affords satisfaction and joy. Then, what you say enters into Romans, as has already been remarked; that is to say, "Hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us". The thing is in our hearts, but it is based on promise, and, of course, on light too, as it says, "The things which are seen are temporal; but the things that
{13}
are not seen are eternal", and these all occasion hope and encouragement and joy.
A.Al. Do not the two terms "faith" and "hope" seem to blend into one in @1 Corinthians 13, where it says, "the greater of these is love", as if love is over against the other two joined together?
J.T. Love is the greater. It is not superlative, it is comparative. The comparison is between faith and hope, but love abides, for love is eternal. It is not based on anything in a sense; it is what God is, and what the Holy Spirit sheds abroad in our hearts.
A.N.W. Is faith particularly connected with Abraham, whereas hope more with Sarah? It says she "hoped in God".
J.T. Abraham "looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God". He looked for that and that was a hope. But now we have to come back to the question raised as to the difference between faith and hope. Faith is by report; that is the way it is put in Romans, "Faith then is by a report, but the report by God's word". Then we have what is said about hope also in Romans. Faith is a report which our souls rest in, but hope is clearly additional as something to affect us in a moral way. There is such a thing as what is unseen affording joy, and hope covers all that, for what is not seen is eternal. The soul thus learns to live in hope in that sense.
E.J.M. Is hope linked with the progressive reception of the truth as in @Romans 15? It says, "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye should abound in hope".
J.T. Just so, it is a question of the power of the Holy Spirit, for things are all in the Spirit.
Rem. The sojourners of the dispersion had lost everything so far as what was material and earthly was concerned, but the apostle writes to them and says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his great mercy, has begotten us again
{14}
to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead", @1 Peter 1: 3.
J.T. "A living hope", not simply hope, but a living one, which is just a strengthening thought.
Ques. Would it be right to bring forward the first verse of @Hebrews 11, "faith is the substantiating of things hoped for"?
J.T. That shows that faith and hope are intimately linked together. Faith, of course, is the great fundamental thought and gathers up everything, you might say, in itself, but then when we specialise, we have to come to love, and see that it is greater than the other two. That is to say, it is the great essential thing that emanates from God.
E.G. Peter in his first epistle says, "whom, having not seen, ye love; on whom though not now looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with the glory".
J.T. That is intelligible, in view of Peter's writing to the saints of the dispersion. He was the apostle of the circumcision, but they were dispersed, which would mean that they were suffering, and he encourages them in that way. "Filled with the glory", as it goes on to say, would imply the Spirit, of course. So that the Jewish Christians in that day would be filled with the glory, but the glory as faith would lay hold of it through the gospel.
S.B. Would it be right to bring the blessed Lord into this question of hope? It is said of Him in @Psalm 22, "thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts", and then it says in Hebrews, "who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame". The word *hope* is not used there, but is it not very much implied?
J.T. The joy coming in there, and the Lord Himself saying that He had been made to hope, is very remarkable; the joy that was set before Him, showing that the Lord Jesus Himself as Man entered into all these matters; He leads in them.
{15}
A.Al. Is that seen too in @Psalm 16, "my flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore"?
J.T. These are Psalms, of course, that the saint feeds on, as furnishing food from the experience of Christ, but they arc not on the level of Colossians and Ephesians.
E.C.M. Does the word, "the word of the truth of the glad tidings", involve the hope that you have dwelt on?
J. T. It does. It shows how the gospel is blended into all these matters. The Colossians were gentiles, they were not such as Peter wrote to, the saints of the dispersion, the gentiles are not viewed as dispersed. We are just set here and God has converted us here where we are and we have to battle with the world as it is. We are not in the Jews¬ position, we are gentiles, and we get here the elements of the gospel involving what we need, that is, joy in our hearts through faith.
A.W.G.T. Is not that confirmed in relation to the gentiles in @Ephesians 2 where we are said to have "no hope"?
J.T. That is, of course, over against what the believer has. Ephesians contemplates the Jew and the gentile. We shall come to that later, no doubt; but now we are dealing, for the moment, with the gentiles represented in the Colossian assembly, and what the gentiles had through the gospel. So we have in verse 6, "bearing fruit and growing, even as also among you, from the day ye heard them and knew indeed the grace of God, in truth: even as ye learned from Epaphras".
P.H.H. Does it raise at all the question of the type of gospel nowadays, whether there is a peculiarly heavenly touch in the preaching such as is known amongst us?
{16}
J.T. I believe the custom that the Lord has brought about of the brethren having prayer in their houses in view of their gospel testimony on the Lord's day evenings, would tend to bring about a higher level of the gospel testimony. Usually, we have to say that most of the hearers are already saints, or the children of saints, and it is all the more necessary that we should preach a full gospel, which would mean that the young people are to be encouraged in the line of hope. The gospel involves hope, the hope that makes not ashamed, because of the tangible thing, that is, the love of God shed abroad in our hearts and by no less a person than the Holy Spirit Himself. So that I think prayer for the gospel before the meeting is leading to a better and more intelligent apprehension as to the truth of the glad tidings.
J.S.E. In pursuance of that, would you remark on the expression, "having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus"?
J.T. "Having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which ye have towards all the saints", and so forth. Then we have the word *heard* in regard to Paul himself, "from the day ye heard them and knew indeed the grace of God, in truth: even as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-bondman, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you, who has also manifested to us your love in the Spirit". That is to say, Epaphras would represent the spirit that we are speaking of, the higher level of things in the gospel, which had laid hold of the Colossians, and Epaphras, who was one of them, informed the apostle. He says, "Who has also manifested to us your love in the Spirit", so that love in the Spirit is evidently the thing that we are led up to in this paragraph. It is something that is to be looked for now, because of the level to which things are being brought in the ministry. Although it may be to fewer numbers, yet the quality is better.
{17}
J.G. Would this be supported by verse 28, "whom we announce, admonishing every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ"?
J.T. Well, that is, of course, Paul himself, Paul's ministry itself. But we were trying to work out a little this matter of the gospel as it is preached now amongst us, in our little gatherings. It is to be of a better quality. When we come to verse 28, of course, we come to Paul's ministry, *his* preaching, what *he* had in mind, but what we have in mind now is to make the most of things as they are. Even although the numbers may not be large, there should be something there that ministers the truth even to young people, so that their hearts are stirred up by the presentation of something that they can count on in this present disturbed world.
H.P.W. In speaking of the improved quality of the gospel, do you think that there is something particularly attractive on the side of joy, which would counteract the elements that are abroad in the world? I am thinking of "joy in the Holy Spirit".
J.T. That is exactly what I was thinking, and that we come now to the Holy Spirit, "who has also manifested to us your love in the Spirit", what the Colossians had in the Spirit. I have no doubt you are accustomed to what I am saying as to preaching, and the question would arise, Who is to preach, and how often is he preaching, and is he looking after the home front, and all that. Now we find that we have prayers, and the young people and even the young boys in the families are drawn into the prayers, and this fact is not to be overlooked. They are learning to have part in the things of God. Even although the result may not be as great as we might wish, yet the quality is better, and I believe that is of very great importance. The apostle's allusion here to "your love in the Spirit" is to show what Christianity really is. It is not simply that they have received the Spirit, but the love that they have is *in* the Spirit. We
{18}
have to learn to love in the Spirit; not simply to love persons that we may have special predilections for, but to love in the Spirit, which rises to the thought of love as in God Himself.
W.C. Would preaching of that character lead to assembly material being secured?
J.T. Precisely. That is just what I was thinking. You have something that the Lord can use at once, that He can lay His hand on at once. If love is in the Spirit in the gathering, as it was at Colosse, there is something that the Lord can lay His hand upon.
W.C. Is not that indicated in @John 4 where the Lord leads on from what you might call the gospel to worship?
J.T. Quite so; and it leads on to a person like the woman who left her waterpot and went her way into the city to testify. This is the sort of things that the Lord can lay His hand on; persons that can testify, and the state of the local assembly as characterised by love in the Spirit.
P.L. So that Onesimus, the convert, is introduced as "a brother beloved". Is that the quality?
J.T. Quite so. "A brother beloved".
Eu.R. Does @Acts 26: 18, give us the high level of the gospel? "Receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified".
J.T. Very good.
A.R. Does it not seem to start with receiving or knowing, "and knew indeed the grace of God, in truth"? Would that be the start, and would it be included in the gospel that he speaks of, "the word of the truth of the glad tidings"?
J.T. Very good. The *word* of it, not simply that you preach the gospel, but the word of it, and therefore we have in Timothy, "Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season".
{19}
W.S.S. We are not to be "moved away from the hope of the glad tidings". It would be in our hearts in the preaching, would it not?
J.T. Therefore the glad tidings conveys the idea of hope, so that we are not droopy or downcast, we are alive. Caleb says, "Jehovah has kept me alive, as he said, these forty-five years ... and now behold, I am this day eighty-five years old", @Joshua 14: 10. Therefore if a brother is old, the question is, Is he living in the truth?
P.H.H. What did you mean just now by emphasising the *word*? "The word of the glad tidings" here, and "Preach the word" in Timothy.
J.T. "The word" conveys the mind of God in the thing. It is not simply the formal thing, the terms of the gospel, but the word of it conveys the mind of God.
Ques. The apostle says, "Even as ye learned from Epaphras". Does the word *learned* suggest the higher quality of the preaching?
J.T. I was thinking that the young people in the houses of the brethren are brought into the thing in these Lord's day evening prayers. Sometimes you hear young brothers joining in the prayers, and they are learning. One of the most important things, as we have been remarking, is the youth, and how the truth is brought to them. Then the question is raised as to how they are taking it on and being influenced by it. A man like Epaphras would be just the man to help them. He is "one of you", and that would mean that he was one of them characteristically, I would think. He would thus take on things and teach them to the young.
{20}
SPIRITUAL FORMATION FOR ASSEMBLY SERVICE (2)
@Colossians 1: 9 - 29
J.T. I think it will be observed that this epistle is marked by immediate application of the truth to the local company. It therefore differs somewhat from Ephesians, which is marked by the truth itself being unfolded, although, in time, applied to the Ephesians. There is that in Ephesians which corresponds, but it is the value of the truth itself which is stressed there. At other times the need of application is stressed as here in Colossians and in connection with the application we have the thought of prayer. Hence, "For this reason we also, from the day we heard of your faith and love, do not cease praying and asking for you, to the end that ye may be filled with the full knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, so as to walk worthily of the Lord unto all well-pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing by the true knowledge of God, strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all endurance and long suffering with joy". That which is due to the Father, to God, is then added, leading up to the beautiful expression "the kingdom of the Son of his love": an expression which, I think, is only found here, the Son of the Father's love. The instruction therefore leads up to that. Other things are in mind, but generally as applying to the local company at Colosse, only that at the end the apostle is free to speak of himself and his ministry, the aim of which was to "present every man perfect in Christ".
J.Mr. What *reason* would you say is referred to in verse 9? "For this reason ...".
J.T. What he had been speaking of, I would say. It is a peculiar way of Paul's, that he gathers up what he had been saying and enlarges on it, at the same time centralising it in a certain way, so that here it led to his prayer.
{21}
P.L. Do you mean that where Pauline ministry takes root locally the saints, in such a locality, are able to move in the universal stream of what is Pauline and support it?
J.T. Quite so. And then to see, as they evidently did, his peculiar place in the scheme of the truth that shines always in his writings. So that you rightly use the word *Pauline*. It has its own place and should have its own place in our minds. On any point that may be critical, if Paul bears on it, then he has to be consulted. What he says has to be considered for he indeed has the last word in things. Hence he lays stress on himself; so that if it be a question of discipline, the governing feature must be what Paul says. We must begin with that, and not go to the Old Testament in those cases. Of course, that could only exist after he was called out, because he was called out as "an elect vessel", as the Lord says, "to me". Thus when he is on the scene as formally and definitely appointed in his services, because he has several administrations, then he must be consulted. At the beginning, before Paul, it was the apostles; it says, "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles". But when Paul is definitely set up in the service, he has the last word, at least that is how the truth stands in regard of him.
L.E.S. Would his priestly concern here be a link with what is said in @2 Corinthians 11: 28? "Besides those things that are without, the crowd of cares pressing on me daily, the burden of all the assemblies".
J.T. In the Corinthian epistles we have an account of his travels and of his work and of his sufferings so as to give weight to what has been remarked and to show that morally he is entitled, under the Lord, to a hearing in all matters.
P.L. Is this seen in the expression, "which is given me towards you to complete the word of God"? Is that the final word?
J.T. Just so.
{22}
Ques. Would the truth of the assembly in the gospels be approached by way of Paul too?
J.T. Well, we may look at the truth in a way for our own profit and learning and so on, but when we come to doctrine or to critical matters, we have to consult him. The Lord says he "is an elect vessel to me", as if he had a special place at the Lord's hand for critical matters. John had his place too, but it was as to love and usefulness, extending on indefinitely throughout the dispensation, whereas Paul had the place in critical matters at the beginning, to complete things.
Ques. Is that what is conveyed when he says, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies"? Is that word authoritative?
J.T. Exactly. You have that throughout the Corinthian epistles. We have to observe whatever he says.
Rem. He says to Timothy, "The things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also", @2 Timothy 2: 2.
J.T. Timotheus knew Paul's way for he had a more personal place with Paul than anyone in the sense of his being Paul's child. No one perhaps could have such a place as he. Although Titus came near it he did not come so near to being a personal aid to Paul as Timotheus did.
A.Al. Does the instruction to Timothy, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things" bear on this?
J.T. Just so. He would instruct him as in that position. Apollos on the other hand had an independent position, which is another matter to be considered. Paul suggested to Apollos to go to Corinth, but he did not take the place of being sent by Paul. "It was not at all his will to go now", Paul says. But Timotheus would go if Paul sent him.
{23}
W.W. Why do you think that Paul links Timothy with him here? It says, "For this reason *we* also". Then in the end of the chapter "whom *we* announce". In the epistle to the Ephesians it was more personal to himself. He says, "Wherefore *I* also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is in you, and the love which ye have towards all the saints".
J.T. I think here it would be more general, whereas in Ephesians it is Paul's own apostolic authority.
Ques. Would the importance of referring to Paul in critical matters be seen in the account of the shipwreck, where his voice is heard, from time to time, in connection with the exigencies of the voyage?
J.T. Quite so. He said, "Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me". He was really in charge of the ship, showing how God can bring His servants forward as needed.
W.S.S. Does the expression "to complete the word of God" imply the giving of a fulness to all that had been written before?
J.T. Well, it is not the completion of Scripture, but the completion of the word of God. I suppose the general principle governing the idea of the word of God is that it is really the mind of God.
W.S.S. Apart from Paul's ministry, should we have the fulness of the other scriptures?
J.T. Well, it required Paul's ministry to give the fulness, showing how the Lord takes up certain ones. We might single out Paul and John and Peter, as entering into the whole dispensation. John, I would say, is the one who comes nearest to us, the Lord having him at His hand in view of the changing circumstances of the testimony, and keeping him, as it were, to Himself for needed service. It is in a mysterious sense that he is kept under the Lord's hand; so that whatever may happen, the Lord is ready. It is not simply that the Scriptures are there and the ministry is there, but
{24}
someone evidently governed by love that He can lay His hand upon. John was the disciple whom Jesus loved.
Ques. In the Galatian epistle, Paul speaks as though it was a well-recognised fact that he had received from the Lord the apostleship of the nations. Does that enter into this epistle in a special way?
J.T. He says there that "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me", which is a striking matter. He does not say, *to* me but *in* me.
Rem. It is striking that Peter recognises this very principle, when he singles out Paul, saying, "as our beloved brother Paul also has written".
J.T. Clearly Peter would recognise him as one that had a great place, even a place superior to him in a way. He speaks of him, not simply as a brother, but "our beloved brother Paul". His place in the service is clearly indicated in that expression of Peter's.
W.H. Would his earlier reference in the second epistle to being "established in the present truth" refer to the light brought in by Paul?
J.T. I would think that. "The present truth" is a very good phrase.
Eu.R What would be involved in the thought of God revealing His Son *in* Paul?
J.T. Well, it is the inwardness of Paul's position, I would think. Peter had a place, of course, in the foundation of the assembly, and also in connection with the material, and the administration of the assembly, but Paul's place is unique. It would seem as if he had the Lord's full confidence. To use the word in an ordinary sense, he had an inlet into the Lord's mind confidentially. There was one that the Lord could trust, and I would say Paul was that one. That comes out in all his personal remarks and they give him so much prominence and so much importance which we must recognise, especially when we come to critical matters.
Rem. "Let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment".
{25}
J.T. Yes, It is in the singular, it *is* the Lord's commandment. The Lord would entrust him with any particular matter. But then what we have already commented upon as to God revealing His Son in Paul, refers to the inwardness of the truth, and its bearing on Paul's position.
Ques. So that his authority is not only based on the exercise of gift, but on what he was substantially in the work of God?
J.T. What the man was personally; and what a man he was! What distinction he acquired and what honour was conferred upon him! He himself tells us that he was "caught up to the third heaven", and then that he was "caught up into paradise". He had a part in paradise.
L.O.L. Does not Paul's knowledge of their faith and love bring out prayer, first on account of the hope, in verse 5, and then that they might be filled with the full knowledge of His will, verse 9?
J.T. Well, just so. It shows the place and importance of prayer in Paul's mind, and I do not know of any time when prayer has been in more prominence than it has been recently. The availability of prayer and the part it has in conditions among the Lord's people are very encouraging. We may rely on it too. Paul is foremost in advocating this thought, and so he says here, "For this reason we also, from the day we heard of your faith and love, do not cease praying and asking for you". It shows the immediate need that was in his mind in connection with the Colossians and that prayer was necessary. It is not simply what he could instruct them in, but his prayer for them.
P.H.H. Would the greatness of his personality in all that he was inwardly make that prayer more powerful? He says similarly in Corinthians, "I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ". Is it the power of his own personality?
{26}
J.T. I would think so. We have the idea of a cabinet in David's history; persons over departments, and I would say this must enter into Paul's position. The Lord is operating a system, and Paul is the chief one in it. Peculiar distinction is thus given to him and specially as knowing the inwardness of things, as having the divine mind peculiarly. Then there is the place that prayer has in all this. He had power in prayer, so that things should be brought about. The Lord would do things for him especially.
H.P.W. Would you say a word in connection with this inwardness of Paul's and the expression, "strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory"?
J.T. Well, I think we can get help on that again in David's history for he built *inwardly*. It says, "David built round about ... and inward", @2 Samuel 5: 9. David had a great place, of course, personally and the idea of inwardness was there, but it is especially seen in Paul's case, for God revealed His Son *in* him. Paul says in @2 Corinthians 12 "that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me". He would gladly suffer and he was suffering very severely too, because evidently he had something wrong with him in his person. One had said that his speech was contemptible. Whether that was true or not we cannot be sure, but there was "a messenger of Satan" for the flesh in him and he asked the Lord three times about it. That would bear out what we are saying and show how accurate he was in his knowledge of Christ. He says, "That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings". He had those thoughts about the Lord and he would gladly accept the sufferings in order that the power of the Christ might rest upon him in his work. He would suffer rather than lose that, showing how personal his feelings were as to the Lord, and how the Lord trusted him.
L.E.S. So he says, "The Lord stood with me, and gave me power, that through me the proclamation might
{27}
be fully made, and all those of the nations should hear", @2 Timothy 4: 17.
P.L. The word "Occupy thyself with these things; be wholly in them" bears on what is distinctly Pauline. And further does the school of Tyrannus, where we have the climax of Paul's ministry at Ephesus, suggest that the saints are to be established under Pauline authority in the full scope of the truth by the diligent pursuit of it day by day?
J.T. He makes prominent the reception of the Spirit by the twelve men that were at Ephesus, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?", he says. He had in his mind what he would do at Ephesus, not at Colosse, or at Corinth, but at Ephesus. It is a question of the need of the Spirit, not simply ordinary teaching or instruction but the Spirit received. The twelve men did not know, but the apostle instructed them as to it and then he laid his hands on them. They received the Spirit through the laying on of his hands, showing the place he had in the work at Ephesus.
Ques. Did you have something particularly in mind in speaking of "the Son of his love" as the climax of this exercise?
J.T. Well, I think the Son of the Father's love is a reference to Solomon and the place he has in the truth. In view of the young people among us, God would say, "Son, give me thine heart". We are now speaking of Paul, and what there would be of Solomon in his ministry, because we must look for the best if we take up Paul. In taking up anything of God we must look for the best and then work out from that, and Ephesus, of course, is the very best that we have. It is not simply the application of the truth to a company of Christians but the unfolding of the thing itself; the unfolding of what is in the mind of God. Hence, in that epistle, Paul brings out his place, and his knowledge of the mystery. So I believe what is in mind here in the Son of the Father's love is what Paul works out; the
{28}
truth in that connection. It says, "who has delivered us from the authority of darkness", a word to be noted, "and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love". The word "translated" is to be noted too, for the "us" is not simply the Colossians. It is a question of the saints generally and our translation into "the kingdom of the Son of his love". He has been praying, and now he is really worshipping, in saying, "giving thanks to the Father". It shows how the truth worked out in his soul, and how he would impart that idea to them.
P.H.H. Do you mean by that, that what is suggested in Solomon goes beyond what is in David? Are we to be retained for the realm of peace and glory, and for what is exclusive?
J.T. Well, David was never spoken of in the same way as Solomon. It is said of Solomon that as a babe "Jehovah loved him". I do not know whether that is said of anyone else, save the Lord Jesus, that Jehovah loved him as a babe; not as a man, or a ruler, or a king, but as a babe. Solomon as a babe was loved of Jehovah, and He sent Nathan to name him Jedidiah. David has personal affections in regard to the whole matter, and he would bring Solomon into that, because Jehovah loved him. That is the reason why I mention the fact that He is called here the Son of the Father's love.
P.H.H. Would we have a peculiar link in that kingdom because Solomon sets out sonship by way of adoption as far as we are concerned? Does not God say to David that Solomon should be His son and God would be his Father?
J.T. It is in that sense that the whole matter of sonship comes out in David's history. David said to Nathan, "I dwell in a house of cedars, and the ark of God dwells under curtains", and Nathan says, "Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee". But then Nathan spoke too quickly, because Jehovah had in His heart, at that time, to bring in Solomon. It was not to be David, it was to be Solomon. It was sonship
{29}
in that sense and it says Jehovah loved Solomon. I believe it is in that sense that he is brought in here. Christ is brought in here as the Son of the Father's love, in view of our translation into that kingdom. It is the place that the Lord Jesus has with the Father as the Son of His love. We read in @Romans 6 of the Father raising Christ by His glory. That is another thing to notice, for it would be in keeping with this passage, "the Son of his love".
J.S.E. Why did you emphasise the word *translate*?
J.T. Well, it is a word to be noted. It says in verse 13, "who has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love". It is a word to show the totality or fulness of the deliverance of those who form the assembly from the darkness of the devil.
Ques. Does it involve an entirely new place; not substantially but spiritually?
J.T. The word *translation* involves our being taken out of one state and condition into another, by an act of power. It is a collective thought, I would say.
C.R.B. It says in @Proverbs 4: 3, "I was a son unto my father". Does that come in here?
J.T. That was in my mind, because I believe "the Son of his love" is a reference to the book of Proverbs. It opens up the book of Proverbs to us, especially to young people. Solomon says, "I was a son unto my father", showing that the youth ought to be attracted by this thought and look into the book of Proverbs and especially in view of the virtuous woman at the end of it. He says in @Ecclesiastes 7: 28, "a woman ... have I not found", but still he could depict her character here and she represents the assembly. The book of Proverbs thus opens up the truth of the assembly, I would say, for young people especially, and the Son of the Father's love is a most attractive thought in that setting.
Eu.R. Does it involve "sharing the portion of the saints in light"?
{30}
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Is it a little remarkable that some expressions only occur once in Scripture? They seem powerful enough to convey all that there is to be conveyed. We never hear of Jedidiah more than once, and here "the kingdom of the Son of his love" is a unique expression.
J.T. Just so, that is good.
A.R. It says "in whom we have redemption". Would that suggest that we are graced in Christ in this character?
J.T. He works it out in that sense. He is speaking of Christ, of course, but He is the Son of the Father's love. Then "in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins" and so on, showing that it is a peculiar place in which we are graced. We have redemption there.
N.K.M. When it says, "who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light"; how is that effected by the Father?
J.T. Well, as it is seen here it is a collective thought. It is not a question of *how* it is effected, but the great thing is that it is effected by the *Father*; the Father has done it.
W.S.S. Would you say that the great thought in the apostle's mind is what is in the Father's mind for us, namely that we should have a real understanding of these things, not merely an objective knowledge?
J.T. The Father's action is in mind. "The Son of his love" is a beautiful expression, and, as I was saying, points to Solomon. In that sense it points to the glory of Christ in His Solomonic character, and not simply in His Davidic character. It suggests the very best and most precious in the sense of persons.
Ques. Would the expression "his only-begotten Son" emphasise the tenderness of the Father's love?
J.T. Quite so. "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all", is another one like that. These expressions bring into view the relations in which divine Persons stand to each other. The
{31}
Spirit of God through Paul thus brings it in here, no doubt to suggest the place Christ has in Paul's heart. He was the Son of the Father's love, but God had revealed his Son in Paul. Paul says, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me", @Galatians 1: 16. He revealed that Son, that blessed Person, in Paul's heart, I would say, and that brings out just what we have been saying as to Paul and the place he has in the divine system of things. He has a unique place in the divine economy. No one has it but he. Hence his being taken up into heaven, and hearing wonderful things; *things*, he says, "which it is not allowed to man to utter". So perhaps we must begin to think about Paul in a different way and revert back to the Lord's remark as to him that he "is an elect vessel to me".
F.C.H. Does not that fit in with @Micah 5: 2 - 4, in regard of Christ Himself? "Out of thee shall he come forth unto me who is to be Ruler in Israel". Then it goes on to say, "And he shall stand and feed his flock in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God". The tenderness and authority that marked Paul's ministry would be conveyed in that, would it not?
J.T. It is a question of what is knowable amongst the brethren. We have hardly touched it really. I do not say, what is known, but what is knowable. Paul says, "my knowledge", and no one had such knowledge as he.
L.O.L. Would you say that the service of God never reached such a height as in Solomon's time as we see in @2 Chronicles 5?
J.T. I would say that is true. The description we have in 1 Kings especially is to bring that out and to show how beautifully things were done. The glory of Christ was foreshadowed in the service of Solomon.
R.B. Would the expression, "the kingdom of the Son of his love" convey the thought of display in contrast to what is inward?
{32}
J.T. Very likely, because the Father would take account of Christ in that way and that He should be displayed as the Son of His love. I believe it may be taken to run with the first day of the week, because on the first day of the week the Father raised Him by His glory. He was raised by the glory of the Father and we are entitled to regard that as giving character to the first day of the week.
A.Al. Would the expression "the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own", bear on this matter?
J.T. It clearly points to the affections that the Father had for the Son. He was *His Own*.
A.D.T. Is there a link with John's ministry? It says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand".
J.T. Very good. That comes out in @John 3, and then chapter 4 is to make known the Lord in His service. The woman of Samaria especially comes into evidence and then the worship of the Father also. We can see how everything has been placed in the hands of "the Son of his love".
Ques. In view of current exercises, should the expression "saints in light" be noted? If we are in the consciousness of that there would be no difficulty as to points of detail and our all doing the same thing.
J.T. The Father has "made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light". It is not simply the portion that we have, but *where* it is. It is *in light*. All this fits in with Colossians and the immediate link with Paul too.
Now we want to come to the second great point here and that is the question of the Lord's own Person. It is worked out, without a paragraph, from verse 14, where it says, "in whom we have redemption", (that is, in the Son of His love) "the forgiveness of sins; who is image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation; because by him were created all things, the things in the heavens
{33}
and the things upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or authorities: all things have been created by him and for him. And *he* is before all, and all things subsist together by him. And *he* is the head of the body, the assembly; who is the beginning, firstborn from among the dead, that *he* might have the first place in all things for in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell". So that we have before us now this great subject of the Person of Christ in regard to the creation, in regard to all things, and, finally, in regard to the assembly, that He is Head of it.
A.St. Why is there such a wonderful description of His Person here?
J.T. I think it is essential that the Lord should be seen personally according to these verses in view of the truth that was intended to be unfolded, and it is a question of His Person. The time has come for the truth of the Lord's Person to be brought in and so the apostle pursues it, saying, "who is image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation; because by him were created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth" and so forth. It is a question of His glory in creation, and then His glory in the assembly, as Head of it.
W.S.S. Would it be a distinctive glory which no creature could share?
J.T. Quite so. He is viewed as the Creator; all things being created by Him.
A.H.G. In the expression "*he* is the head of the body", the *He* is emphasised. Is that a reference back to the glories described in the previous verses?
J.T. It is an additional thought. The apostle moves on from the thought of redemption to the thought that He is the "image of the invisible God", that is to say, it is Deity in Christ. Then He is the "firstborn of all creation", meaning that He has the chief place in creation, which is amplified when he says, "because by
{34}
him were created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or authorities: all things have been created by him and for him". All that is to bring out His Deity, His part in the Deity. Then we have His distinctive place as Man in it, and finally His part as Head of the body, the assembly.
Ques. Is there a link between the expression in @Proverbs 8: 30, "the nursling of his love" and what is said in Colossians in relation to Christ as the Son of His love?
J.T. In Proverbs it might be translated the *architect*. Things were created on the principle of skill or architecture. The 'nursling' is a very tender thought, but it is wisdom appropriating the term to itself, and, of course, we may go too far as to that and make too much of wisdom. It is said in @1 Corinthians 1: 24 that Christ is the wisdom of God, but in @Proverbs 8 wisdom is not a person, but a quality; it is personified, in a certain sense, but it is simply a quality attached to God as apprehended in creation.
Eu.R. Here is it the greatness of this Person; that He is the source, the means and the end in creation?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Does "image" here go further than representation? Does it involve the whole revelation of God?
J.T. *Image* is representation. It is stated that Christ "is the image of the invisible God". John says, "No one has seen God at any time"; but then he qualifies that in saying, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him". It is a question of declaration, not revelation.
J.Mr. When the Lord Jesus was born, He who is "Firstborn of all creation", there was no room for them in the inn.
J.T. Well, it is a question of the smallness of the inn and that a place had to be found for Him elsewhere.
{35}
Of course, we can quite understand that there is no place great enough to house Him, but still He is pleased to dwell in the assembly.
Ques. Would @Hebrews 1 bear on what you are saying, "the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance"? Is that any different or would it amplify what you have in mind?
J.T. These expressions in the first chapter of Hebrews have to be carefully used. We have the fact that "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son". The article is not there properly, so that it really reads: 'God has spoken to us *in Son*'. It is really the Son who is the Creator and He is the Speaker. So it says, "whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance". Now the notes help in that, and I think ought to be taken account of. The note to the word "effulgence" in verse 3, reads 'that which fully presents the glory which is in something else. Thus light makes us know what the sun is; the tabernacle, what the pattern in the mount was'. Then again, another note to the word "substance" in verse 3, reads, 'Clearly'substance','essential being',not'person.'' Therefore what we have to regard in these words is that Christ is the effulgence of the glory of God, and the expression of His substance. It is to be noticed that the word 'substance' (according to the note) is not 'person'. It is therefore outside of us and we have to say we do not understand. We cannot say anything about the essential being of God for He is spoken of as "dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see", @1 Timothy 6: 16.
G.H.M. Does not @Hebrews 1 connect with "all the fulness" which was pleased to dwell in Him? (@Colossians 1: 19). Is the fulness in Him something separate from what He is personally?
{36}
J.T. The word *fulness* is a noun, just like the word *greatness*. You cannot just say what it is; you just have to accept what it may mean. The word *greatness* is used in that way also, and it is better just to let it stand as it is, that in Christ "all the fulness was pleased to dwell". What do we know about that? We have just to bow our heads and say we do not understand, but it is there.
F.C.H. Is the force of it that it is "the Son of his love" who is all this?
J.T. Exactly. That makes it all very simple. He is a lovable Person, yet, at the same time, He is beyond us as to any thought of expression physically, for it is a question of God here, and that in Christ is the fulness of God. The word *fulness* there, as we have remarked, is a noun.
Ques. Is that borne out by His word "no one knows the Son but the Father"?
J.T. Quite so. And "No one has seen God at any time" is another expression of the same character.
P. L. Is not this sense of infinitude to us essential in view of the promotion of the service of God?
J.T. Quite so. We cannot speak of divine Persons as if we knew Them as we know each other. They are beyond us. Even the Lord Jesus, as Man, is beyond us.
P.L. 'There only to adore'.
J.T. Quite so. Hence we worship the Son, we worship the Lord, as well as the Father.
A.N.W. Is there any scripture that speaks more highly of Christ than @Colossians 1?
J. T. I hardly think there is. These verses are specially devoted to the thought of the Person of Christ. It seems as if, in the apostle's mind, it was necessary to bring them in, in view of the present time. We are dealing now with practical things, and in view of the present time the brethren should have clearly before them that the personal Deity of Christ enters into all these things that we have been going through in this chapter. He is God, and our hearts are bowed before
{37}
Him in the midst of all the confusion there is, and He is the One that God has appointed to judge the world in righteousness. God has appointed Him, so that the matter resolves itself into this that we know where we are, that things are vested in Christ, and He is God Himself.
P.L. Is this the ark and the two thousand cubits between it and the people?
J.T. That is just what it is. We are not to be too free in talking about the things of God and the Persons of the Deity, but we must speak of them in a holy and reverential way. I believe @Colossians 1 is intended to teach us that and it is needed, too, in view of the condition of the Colossians, where they were in danger of philosophy and vain deceit.
W.S.S. Would you say a word about the two references to "firstborn"? In verse 15 it says, "firstborn of all creation", and then in verse 18, "firstborn from among the dead".
J.T. They show how the Spirit of God brings in the things that adorn the Scriptures, and give them a fulness. He is firstborn of creation and then firstborn in relation to coming out of death. "*He* is the head of the body, the assembly"; and then it adds, "who is the beginning, firstborn from among the dead, that *he* might have the first place in all things". So that we are to accustom ourselves to giving Him the first place.
W.S.S. I was thinking that "firstborn of all creation" does not bring in the thought of relationship, whereas "firstborn from among the dead" does.
J.T. Quite so; only He has the first place in that. "Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming", @1 Corinthians 15: 23.
In verse 24 the apostle begins another paragraph, saying, "Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly; of which *I* became minister, according to the dispensation
{38}
of God which is given me towards you to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints; to whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory". The apostle now is releasing himself from all others to think of his ministry and the place that he has. It gives a peculiar finish to the chapter and makes way for what is said more specifically in chapters 2 and 3. His service had the finishing thought in it, "that we may present every man perfect in Christ".
W.W. Going back to verses 19 and 20, it says there, "for in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell, and by him to reconcile all things to itself". I would like to know the difference between the thought of *in Him* and *by Him*.
J.T. I think it all has in mind, first to establish the Deity of the Lord, so that He might have His own proper place in our minds and hearts, and then to show, that not only we, but all things will be reconciled by that Person. It is a question of the Deity, and of God doing it, and that He has this Person in His hands, as we have been saying. Paul was in Christ's hands in this same sense, but God has this Person in His hands for these things; first for the thought of the fulness of the Godhead and then to reconcile all things to Himself. God has this Person and is employing Him (we are speaking reverently) to reconcile all things to Himself; "all things" I suppose being the universe. Everything is to be reconciled; that is, brought into complacency with God. Thus he runs on, in verse 24, as we have been saying, to his own special service in the completion of all this, and that would be to "present every man perfect in Christ". It is not every *thing*, but every *man*; because that is the immediate matter in Colossians. It is a question of *man*, and every one is to be presented perfect.
{39}
Ques. Would you say a word as to the scope of that expression, "present every man perfect in Christ"? Does it involve Paul's ministry of the gospel and of the assembly?
J.T. Well, of course, it cannot be the assembly fully because it is every man, but then we must have the thought of perfection in each of us. God selects us, and He thinks of each of us personally, and then our being presented in perfection to Him. It is a question of the completion of the work of God and the detail involved in that regarding each of us. We have been speaking of the Lord taking us through death and the hope that there is even in that, but now we have the thought that we will come out in perfection. The divine thought in every one of us will come out in due course, and Paul was labouring to that end when he says here, "that we may present every man perfect in Christ".
A.N.W. Is his combating primarily his prayers, more than his work and ministry?
J.T. Showing that there was combat in it, for Satan had to do with it. He was working in the midst of conditions such as there are in this world, where Satan has power. Hence the need of combat, which has a great place in this epistle. It is a solemn thing that we have to do with Satan.
A.H.G. Why does he bring it down to the thought of every man here after having spoken of the assembly?
J.T. To show, I suppose, the individual character of the work of God in each person and what God must have. He first had Adam, one man, and then a woman, but now it is every man. Think of the innumerableness of those that are to be presented perfect, and what pleasure God has in that! Paul was labouring to the end that that should come about and it was a question of combat, because the devil would have his part in it too.
E.G. Would you connect "every man perfect in Christ" with Ephesians, "chosen ... in him before the foundation of the world"? If we were chosen in Him,
{40}
God is going to have us brought up to a state of perfection.
J.T. Well; it is a question of the *work* that is involved in the gospel and the ministry that God is carrying on. We should see what pains have to be taken so that we should not work in any loose way in dealing with the things of God. God is not doing things thus. He is working through His own skilled workman, and that skilled workman was Paul. It is a question of learning how to do things so as to *finish* them, and Paul is a model for us all. What is being done is to be finished. I believe that is what this chapter means. He singles himself out here to show how he was engaged in finishing matters. If a man comes before him, and he cites many, then he is going to finish that man.
Ques. Is that why admonishing and teaching are mentioned in this chapter?
J.T. Quite so. It is a question of what is involved in the ministry, whoever may be employed in it.
P.H.H. Would Joseph labouring with his brethren give the idea of the work?
J.T. Yes, see the pains he took with them, putting Simeon into prison, and all that he did with others, so as to come to the time when he could speak directly to his brethren and love them.
P.L. Do you see this in Hiram? It says that he was "a worker in brass; and he was full of wisdom and understanding and knowledge, to do all kinds of works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and made all his work", @1 Kings 7: 14. Would that be "the Son of his love" and would "all his work" be the completion?
J.T. Very good. So that we have eleven hundred brethren here today, and what is the intent of it? Surely it is not to have a holiday or anything like that, but what is in mind is that we should become instructed in the work of God and in the service of God. Paul was labouring on those lines, to "present every man perfect in Christ". He had no lower standard than that.
{41}
W.C. Would @Ezekiel 37 fit into it, bone coming to bone and finally all standing on their feet?
J.T. Quite so. It says, "these bones are the whole house of Israel".
J.P.H. Would you distinguish between the "full-grown man" in @Ephesians 4: 13, and "every man perfect in Christ" here in Colossians?
J.T. Certainly, it is each individual in Colossians, whereas the "full-grown man" in Ephesians is one thought. It is just like "the new man" which is one thought.
Eu.R. Joseph selected five men of his brethren and presented them to Pharaoh. Does that link on?
J.T. Yes, quite so. There were eleven but he selected five to present them to Pharaoh. It was a question of what he would present. So here it is to "present every man perfect in Christ".
Ques. Would the minister have before him not only what God has in the aggregate in the assembly but what He has in the personnel?
J.T. Exactly. What a glorious thought that is! What God has in the work of His hands! We may well say, "What hath God wrought!", for it is not only what He has in the assembly, but what He has in each person who forms the assembly. Each person is an entity, has a being, and has a history, and God has had to do with it. The full result is that that being is presented perfect in Christ.
P.L. "The men whom thou gavest me"?
J.T. It is the word *men*, not the persons, but the *men*. It is the idea of full growth.
Ques. Does what the apostle says as to himself in @Philippians 3: 12 bear on this? "Not that I ... am already perfected; but I pursue".
J.T. Just so. He says that he was not already perfected but that he pursued, and the point was "the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus".
{42}
H.P.W. Does it give great lustre to the Holy Spirit's work, and would not "the might of his glory" come in there?
J.T. Yes. Then the skill, too, of each of us, because God is looking for skilled men, not only apprentices. Apprenticeship in the levitical service is not the same as the full-grown man. A skilled man is thirty years of age. It means that he is skilled in the work of God.
Rem. So that while Paul takes the lead here, Epaphras seems to be in reserve, the matter being so important.
J.T. Just so. He and others are mentioned. We shall come to that later, God willing, but what we are speaking of now, this matter of skill, is of prime importance and yet very practical. We are not just doing things as well as we know how, but we have in mind to present things perfectly. Things are to be done well and rightly, as it is said of the Lord Jesus, "He hath done all things well", @Mark 7: 37.
A.Al. Is this seen in Mark's gospel where the Lord chose twelve that they might be with Him?
J.T. Very good. It is suitable for Mark too, because it is a question of workmen in Mark. So it says, "he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach". He was concerned that they might be His. It is like David in the cave. Although there were a good many there, they were a motley lot, but he made them into a great army, the greatest warriors that ever had appeared up till then.
Rem. "These are the ... mighty men whom David had", @2 Samuel 23: 8.
J.T. Exactly. The mighty men whom *David* had.
P. L. Is this great skill seen also in Aholiab and Bezaleel, as bound up with the complacent divine dwelling in love? Hence Colossians, as leading up to this great climax, insists on skill?
J. T. Quite so. This is a book of first-rate importance, and I believe God has approved of our taking it up.
{43}
Ques. Do Priscilla and Aquila come into this, where Paul says, "my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus", @Romans 16: 3? Would that show that a sister can have part in it?
J.T. Well, exactly. They are always spoken of on equal terms. Aquila and Priscilla are each spoken of the same number of times, showing that a man and his wife may be actively engaged together in the service of God.
{44}
SPIRITUAL FORMATION FOR ASSEMBLY SERVICE (3)
@Colossians 2: 1 - 23
J.T. The idea of combat in this chapter affords opportunity to speak of what occasions it. Satan invaded the garden of Eden and then Israel, for he specially attacked Israel in Jerusalem, and now he attacks the assembly. A wide sphere of enquiry therefore enters into this reading, as to the occasion of conflict, or combat. The word really involves physical war, but the spiritual thought is in mind, although it is not enlarged on as in Ephesians. We are told there that "our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities ... against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies". There is the suggestion of what is called "the expanse" in creation, as it was after the chaotic condition had arisen. To make it practical, we have to consider why Satan should find occasion to invade the assembly, for it is said that the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it (see @Matthew 16: 18), and that is a comforting thought. At the same time the idea of the expanse, which God called Heavens in the first of Genesis, reminds us that Satan personally has made the attack and has found some success. It thus becomes a question of where the attack is made and why. In a general way the Creator resented the interference, and that is shown in the negative wording of the account of the second day. There is nothing said about its being good, although the general fact remains, according to the last verse of @Genesis 1, that what was done was very good. But there is a reserve. The chapter now before us opens up much to instruct us as to the attack which is being made, and which occasions combat. The allusion would be to an arena, and that there is a danger of damage, because this chapter says, "I would have you know what combat I have for you". We may thus locate the position, for it
{45}
was in view of the protection of the gentiles, but particularly, as the apostle goes on to say, "as many as have not seen my face in flesh; to the end that their hearts may be encouraged, being united together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God; in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge". There is a suggestion of the need of hiding in view of a possible attack of an adversary, as the Lord Himself, in the gospel, says, "An enemy hath done this", @Matthew 13: 28. We have thus just to locate who the enemy is and where the attack is or has been made. Then it is a question of who is meeting it, or how it is to be met, because of the treasures in the mystery. It is to be kept in mind that the mystery involves that things are to be hidden and not displayed in any natural sort of way; indeed, the natural mind is not to be brought into it. Wherever the natural mind is active, we may be sure there will be an attack.
H.W.A. Do you think Hezekiah had some sense of that when he saw that the enemy was minded to get to Jerusalem; he saw that Jerusalem was the objective?
J.T. Yes. Later, however, he neglected protection, comforting himself that there would be peace in his day, and he showed the princes of Babylon all his house, and that is just the point in question now.
A.M. Would the references to Laodicea in this epistle indicate the measure of success that the enemy had?
J.T. If we compare our remarks with the Lord's words in dealing with the different assemblies, we might say that Satan had an opportunity in Laodicea; but, of course, the great opportunity was in Thyatira. Therefore, it is a question of whether we should now introduce the Lord's words in His addresses which come down the line historically to the Romish system. Our chapter hardly leads to that, nor do I think that Laodicea in itself would suggest it. The seven assemblies were
{46}
in the Lord's mind and He was in the midst of them according to Revelation. He was there, however, in altered garb and with His affections shut up. That is how He is presented in the assemblies, according to the first chapter of Revelation. So John says, "I turned back to see the voice", which is a striking thing, because it is a question of *hearing* really, although he turned back to see. It was a question of what was to be seen, and so it says, "I saw seven golden lamps, and in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle: his head and hair white like white wool, as snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire; and his feet like fine brass, as burning in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters". That is to say the Lord is dealing in Revelation with a later period historically in the testimony and Laodicea is in mind with the other assemblies. There were seven and Laodicea is the last of them. It is not in mind as attacked, or in itself an object of attack, it has still the status of an assembly. We thus have to question where the attack began and that raises the whole question as to how Satan gets in and how he is to be viewed. The cause of the combat requires searching because it was primarily through Eve, the feminine side, and we might say, therefore, that the assembly herself, typically, occasioned the opportunity.
P.L. Would "persuasive speech", verse 4, link on with Satan's approach to Eve?
J.T. Yes. No doubt the allusion is to the Greek ability to speak, because speech is characteristically a feature of Greek. It suggests that part of humanity which is skilled in the sense of speech or language, and this itself ought to be in our minds. We are apt to make much of anything we have of that kind, whereas it affords an opportunity for the devil. No doubt the Greek ability to speak was in the apostle's mind when he says, "That no one may delude you by persuasive speech". Paul's speech was said to be contemptible. It was something
{47}
that the devil would attack reproachfully or derisively, and that is a thing to be avoided. If brethren are defective in their speech, or in their language, it is not a matter that should concern us very much. It is the *delusive* character, I think, of Greek oratory and its place in the history of humanity, that Paul speaks of as *persuasive*.
H.F.N. Would you help us in regard to the distinctive features of the mystery as presented in Colossians? First that "in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge" and then the thought of the mystery as "Christ in you the hope of glory". Would the truth of the mystery be the great bulwark and preservative against all these satanic attacks?
J.T. Well, that is going too far, I would think, because we are dealing here with the negative side, and that which occasions the attack. It is a question of speech and what the enemy has found in delusive speech. It is not simply what is hidden; indeed, I would think the hiding was necessitated by the attack. The mystery is a matter that God has had in reserve so as to hide things. For instance, parabolical ministry is to hide the truth from certain conditions, that is, from those who would make much of speech and language.
Ques. It is said of the apostles that they were unlettered men. Is that the character of person that the Lord Jesus would use?
J.T. Well, that is the reason why I referred to it. Our brother was bringing in the question of the mystery which, of course, is a prime matter here, but I would say the question of speech is the point of attack. Therefore, as has been alluded to, the apostles were not lettered men. They were not men characterised by learning, whereas the schools and colleges are all based on learning.
P.H.H. Is that why presently, it says, "lead *you* away as a prey through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the teaching of men"? Does the speech tend to become teaching to lead man away?
{48}
J.T. Well, it tends to make teaching attractive. Hence people speak of oratory. They say, What oratory; What ability in speaking! Whereas, in truth, Paul is not characterised by that; he does not speak like that. If we are to take his opponents, they said that his speech was contemptible, but nevertheless, God used it for conversions. He used it to build up His people.
G.C.S. They brought in the orator to attack Paul as to the resurrection.
W.H. Moses, himself, was one who was skilled in words and deeds of the Egyptians, but he had to learn to speak in a different way, had he not?
J.T. Quite so. He said to Jehovah he could not speak. That is something we all have to come to in regard of divine things, for we must not build ourselves up on any ability in regard of speech. Not indeed that speech is not to be employed, because God is the author of speech and the power of speech, as He said to Moses, "Who hath made man's mouth?". God made it. But then the question is whether that is meant in this reference to *delusive* speech. It is not simply a question of the faculty of speech in man, but the use of skilled oratory to build up the world.
W.C. It is said to Thyatira as to Jezebel that, "she who calls herself prophetess, and she teaches and leads astray my servants to commit fornication and eat of idol sacrifices".
J.T. Well, just so. That system makes much of it. They leave nothing undone that is needed to build it up, and if speech is needed, they will make much of speech. Hence, in their system, learning is a great matter with them.
Ques. When Paul speaks of his own entrance to the Corinthians, does he give speech according to God? "And I, when I came to you, brethren, came not in excellency of word, or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God". Is that his own estimate of how he was among them?
{49}
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. He also says in Corinthians, that five words with the understanding is better than many in an unknown tongue.
J.T. Well, of course, an unknown tongue is another thing to be avoided. There are those who pretend to that, whereas simplicity is the thought and the ability that God gives.
Ques. Does the serpent being more crafty than any other animal link on with the delusive speech?
J.T. I would think so. It would be what he employed, and the wording of what he said to the woman is given.
Ques. Does the first attack of the enemy in @Acts 5 bear on this? It says of Ananias and Sapphira that they lied to the Holy Spirit. Would not that be the climax in a way of the "persuasive speech"?
J.T. Well, it is a question of whether lying is specially persuasive. Of course, it might be. Public speakers, however, in supporting some particular cause, use oratory, and skilful expressions; they say one thing, yet hide others by their words. They have to have recourse to this sort of thing, but such a course is to be refused among the Lord's people. Simplicity is the thought; so that, although Paul was a simple person, he knew the truth.
Ques. Is the origin of "persuasive speech" found in Satan in Eden?
J.T. That is just what has been remarked and that the actual wording is given. It should be noticed that he is never called Satan at the outset. Although it is what is attributed to him later, and Satan is known later, he has not such a name at the outset. It is Satan as among the Greeks and I would say, particularly among the Jews. The ability of speaking so as to deceive is in mind and what the Greek language is capable of. It brings in mere learning in religious things. Mary called the Lord "Rabboni", and it is said that it was Hebrew,
{50}
though possibly it is not pure Hebrew but the current dialect. That is to say, she would be simple. The simple vernacular, I think, is the thing. The simple way in which the truth is learned and to be ministered is the point, for we are not assuming to be anything. If we are dependent in our words, God will give us the mouth and wisdom that is needed so that we find means of expressing the thing that we have in our hearts.
E.C.M. Moses says, "I am not eloquent ... for I am slow of speech", but Jehovah says, "I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shalt say".
J.T. Very good. The expression "with thy mouth" is very beautiful. How God can be with us, the most ordinary of people. It is a question of those whom He takes up, and dependence on Himself in them. It is a question of what God can do for us, for He can do wonders through anyone on the ground of their being dependent.
Rem. "It shall be given to you in that hour", @Matthew 10: 19.
J.T. Just so, "in that hour".
Rem. At the third temptation, the Lord calls him Satan. He does not call him Satan before. I was thinking of what you said as to the name that is given to him when he discloses himself.
J.T. Just so. He is called "the tempter", which is a characteristic and right word.
Now there is much more in the chapter than this negative thought, although, of course, the question of speech that may be used in the ministry is important, because that is what concerns us. Then the passage says, "For I would have you know what combat I have for you, and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in flesh"; showing that he was at that disadvantage, as not having seen them in the flesh, "to the end that their hearts may be encouraged, being united together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the
{51}
mystery of God; in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge". We have to consider now these treasures, how they are hidden, and how we are to hold them; because when we speak of the assembly we must be practical and regard ourselves as of it. It is a question of whether we are using any methods or ways in our preaching or teaching that the enemy could use; methods that would not hide the mysteries of God which are spoken of here. It says, "in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge". That is to say, we are to be the custodians of the treasures, I mean the assembly is, because it is the assembly that is alluded to in the word *mystery*.
P.H.H. Would the thought of stewardship come in here? Paul says, "servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God", and then, "it is sought in stewards, that a man be found faithful", @1 Corinthians 4: 1, 2. Would faithfulness there include the thought of knowing how to hide and not bring out a thing in a way to be attacked?
J.T. Yes. It bears, of course, on those who form the assembly, because the assembly has no existence without us. It is a question of persons, and we, that is, Christians, are the persons. It therefore becomes especially a question of ourselves and those who minister, whether they minister in the gospel or minister the truth of the assembly, or the truth generally. It if a question of how we do it and whether we are in any danger of using delusive speech or anything that would make the truth popular. The Lord, in introducing the great thought of the assembly in @Matthew 16, makes a special reference to what was said. "Then he enjoined on his disciples that they should say to no man that he was the Christ". That is, He enjoined a hiding principle and it was for the disciples to pay attention to that.
J.M. Would what Paul says in @2 Corinthians 1: 12 bear on this matter of speaking? "For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity before God, (not in fleshly wisdom but in
{52}
God's grace,) we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly towards you". And then in the end of chapter 2, "For we do not, as the many, make a trade of the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, before God, we speak in Christ".
J.T. Very good. That was in one's mind indeed, because Paul enlarges there on this very point. Of course, it bears on all of us because, after all, he is the model for us under Christ. The Lord has taken him on to use him in that sense, as representative of Himself, as he says, "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ", @1 Corinthians 11: 1.
E.E.P. Would you say that Paul came under the influence of this proper speech when Ananias addressed him as "Saul, brother"?
J.T. The point is that he was a brother.
H.F.N. Would Paul's culminating speech be in @Ephesians 5, "I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly"?
J.T. Well, it was to bring authority in. What was in his mind was Christ and the assembly, because Adam and Eve had been alluded to, and they really spoke of Christ and the assembly. This shows how typical speech may be used, but the point is to make it clear that it is typical for the real thing is in what is spiritual. The antitype must be in spiritual language.
W.C. Would Delilah's persistency with Samson, vexing him so that he should tell her that in which his strength lay, remind us of the peril of the system and the feminine side of deception?
J.T. Just so, Satan using the feminine to deceive.
Eu.R. Would you say a word as to the contrast between "the full knowledge of the mystery" in verse 2 and then "in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge", in verse 3. We get "full knowledge" and "knowledge". What is implied in full knowledge?
J.T. Well, the word involves completeness. So that we have, in @Ephesians 4: 11, an allusion to ministry,
{53}
where it says, "*he* has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man". The word 'full knowledge' here in verse 2 of our chapter would, of course, have that in mind; "unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God". The apostle was about to say that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge were hidden in it and it was important that not only should they have that knowledge but have it in a full way. That, of course, is a great point now with us, for we are to be accurate and have things in their fulness and completeness, as the Scripture teaches them. We are not to be bringing out things that are not in Scripture, for we can only meet any evil or error by the truth.
A.H.G. You have spoken of the *Father's* activities, but here it is "the mystery of God". What would be involved in that expression?
J.T. It is called "the mystery of Christ" elsewhere. It is to bring out the full thought, I would think, particularly in view of what we have been saying as to the object of the attack, the means of it and where the thing happens. God, I believe, is the fullest thought to be applied. If we are dealing with the mystery it is a question of God, for we are led back to the beginning of things. The Colossians were in need of all these things, because they were exposed to vain deceit. That is to say, the allusion would doubtless first be to Greek philosophy, and then as we go on in the chapter, to religious features. These two became the means of the attack, so that it would be Greek philosophy and Judaism that the chapter aims at.
E. J. "Through wisdom is a house built, and by understanding it is established; and by knowledge are
{54}
the chambers filled with all precious and pleasant substance", @Proverbs 24: 4.
J.T. That is a very good reference as to how a house is built.
Ques. Would you think that what Paul says, "that their hearts may be encouraged, being united together in love", is a necessary condition before these things are entered upon?
J.T. Well, I think so. You have in mind that love is the point?
Ques. And "being united together" in it. I wondered whether we needed the brethren to enter upon these things?
J.T. Just so. I think the Lord is helping the brethren in these matters. I have been greatly struck by the way that sympathy for one another among the brethren is called forth in all parts of the earth. It is a notable evidence, I believe, of the work of God and I believe sympathy should, and normally does, precede active love. Sufferings and the like are in mind and they draw out the sympathies of the saints, and then love becomes in evidence, and the building up in love, for love always edifies.
P.H.H. Are there certain limitations mentioned here in the word 'not'? For instance, "according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ", (verse 8). And then later, "not holding fast the head"; (verse 19). Then in the next chapter, "not on the things that are on the earth"; (verse 2). Are our minds helped into positive things by the limitations of the word 'not'?
J.T. Quite so. I have often thought of that as agreeing with the division of the land of Canaan, because Colossians is working up to the idea of the division of the land, though they were coming short of it. The word 'not' would mean the shutting out of the world, so that our boundaries are limited to ourselves. It is a question of the brethren and their being united together in love.
{55}
P.H.H. In relation to that, would you say something about the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in Christ? I do not know if I follow your thought, but I was wondering whether the positiveness and fulness of what is in Christ bodily and our holding the Head are the great preservatives against the attacks.
J.T. Well, going back to the idea of boundaries, and limitations, and companionships and associations, the idea of *not* (*not* on things below) is of great importance. Even in regard to the distance between a man's house or himself and the meeting which he should attend. These boundaries in themselves are not hallowed; it is only a question of what relates to the brethren, to ourselves, that things become hallowed, and so here "you" -- "your hearts"; that is, *yourselves* "being united together in love". Thus the sphere that belongs to us and in which we are to operate and to live is the circle of the brethren. Perhaps you will enlarge on what you had in mind as to headship, linking it on with what I have attempted to say as to ourselves, and our being united together in love.
P.H.H. I was thinking of the word *fulness*; the "fulness of the Godhead" being mentioned as in Him bodily, and then "*ye* are complete [or filled full] in him". Would that mean, that in regard to limitations which the refusing of persuasive speech, delusion and so on would impose we have full supply in Christ of what is needed and we need go outside of Him for nothing?
J.T. Well, I think what should precede that in our minds is this question of *ourselves*. We are together; that is, ourselves and then the Lord Himself having come into bodily form is in relation to us, to ourselves. In chapter 1, you have *the fulness* in verse 19: "in him all the fulness was pleased to dwell" without mentioning bodily. In chapter 2 persons are in mind, and Christ is spoken of in a personal way as in bodily form. It carries with it the idea of substantiality, I would say, what is substantial. We have in each one of us what is substantial
{56}
or else there is nothing. If it is merely a question of what we know, that is not anything; it is a question of what we are personally, what each one is personally. The assembly is made up of persons, Christ being the Head of it. Other things, of course, have to be added to express the full truth, but it is a question of persons, not simply what we know, or even the associations we are in and that, but persons, and persons that are attractive to each other. There is thus a real unity, and I believe the personality of the Lord as in a bodily form enters into it; "in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". The word *bodily* implies substantiality. We cannot apply exactly the idea of substantiality to God, although there is substance, but we cannot go so far as to speak of a body; we can, however, in Christ, for He has become Man. In the first chapter the word *bodily* is not mentioned but that all the fulness was there. That is to say, the Deity or Godhead is there in itself, which we cannot compass. But when we come to chapter 2 the word *bodily* involves what Christ is to the saints. It means Christ, and it is a real Person here, and a Person who is a Centre and an Object. So I think all that must underlie what we have been speaking of and our being "united together". It is a question of persons, how much we are to one another, and the idea excludes all else as to what is in this world, where Satan is operating.
P.L. So that, after the allusions in the beginning of @John 1 to the Deity we have in verse 14 "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth". We have no *us* or *we* introduced until that point. Is that the company?
J.T. Just so. "We have contemplated his glory". It is the glory of the Person in Manhood.
Ques. Does it help to notice the difference between the tenses in chapters 1 and 2 of Colossians? In chapter 1, it is "For in him all the fulness ... was pleased to dwell". I suppose that involved the Lord's humanity here, but
{57}
the verse we are looking at now in chapter 2 says, "For in him *dwells* all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; and ye are complete in him". Is one the reference to the past and the other a reference to the Lord as He is and bringing ourselves in?
J.T. Just so. The saints are brought in, for it is said, "and ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and authority", and so on. We have Christ thus in a substantial way before us and the brethren, not simply according to what we know. While we cannot perhaps name the thing as to which we are complete in Him, yet we can name the persons; we can name Christ. It is a substantial idea in relation to persons. Peter says, "Look on us". That is persons, not simply what we know or what we may be in that sense, but the persons. So in this chapter the thought of circumcision comes in immediately and then the raising of Christ from the dead; that is to say, the *working* of God. He is raised from the dead by the power or working of God. It is a question of what is going on through persons being affected and used, or handled in a sense, in view of something being formed. That is what would shut out all this material for the enemy which occasions the combat, because it is a question of the "increase of God", and that is in the assembly. We make increase in that sense, in the persons, and hence we have to consider who the persons are and what they are and how they behave. Is there anything to admire, because that is what this chapter has in mind? It shuts out all the material the enemy is working on in the whole world, because "the whole world", John says, "lies in the wicked one", @1 John 5: 19. It is what is going on currently in the world, and we are to keep clear of it entirely. This chapter is to that end, so philosophy in the Greek system and Judaism in the Jewish system is kept out.
H.F.N. Have you not said that the bringing in of that thought of *bodily* and the introduction of the Lord's headship was really to bring about in the saints
{58}
a correspondence with Christ; first positionally, and then morally in the quickening?
J.T. Well, it is. The chapter is really to clear the ground for the assembly, where the increase of God is. The apostle had in his mind that they were growing together in unity, and all these things in verses 4 to 19 are subservient, to bring about the unity and to clear the ground for it. Hence you have the idea of nailing things to the cross. The death of Christ is brought in, in circumcision and then in the cross itself, but then we have the *working of God* and that is where faith enters into this chapter.
F.C.H. Is the working of God a present thing and not confined to what is stated afterwards in regard to the resurrection?
J.T. It is a question of *the working*. It is active power so that it is not simply something done, but *being* done. The chapter contemplates what is being done, what God is doing, His working, and so faith comes into it, as it says, "through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead". It is therefore a question of going into Canaan, I would say, and how in assembly formation and service there is something that enables us to keep ourselves so that we should be with God in Canaan, having entered in through circumcision and the power of God through the Jordan. The small portion of the earth called the land of Canaan is thus typical as a principle. It typifies our proximity in dwelling together spiritually, and nearness where love is, with an ascending character to it. That would lead us into Ephesians, of course, but Colossians is the crucial matter, because it is the working of God. It is not what is finished but what is being done, and the power that keeps us. It is the power that enables us to be in assembly so as to be for God in it.
Ques. Does "the increase of God", involving substance, stand in contrast to being "puffed up by his fleshly mind" which involves inflation and recalls what
{59}
the enemy says in @Genesis 3, "ye shall be as gods", and then there is the reference to "a tree to be desired to make one wise"?
J.T. Yes. I believe the Lord is helping us at this very moment as to assembly formation and what interferes with it. How easily we may become the instruments of the interference; hence the strong language used; but that is a current matter. It is a current operation of God, which would apply to the assembly, not what will lead us into heaven literally, but assembly service.
L.H. Is that seen in Joshua when the ark remained in the bed of the Jordan while all the people passed over? Is that connected with "the working of God"?
J.T. Quite so. The ark was there so that they could pass over, and they did pass over; but then they had the circumcision there and the old corn of the land there. It is a question of appropriation, as to what is going on *now*, not when we are in heaven, but what we have now in assembly in view of the power of the Spirit. "The working of God" applies to the power of the Spirit in the saints.
P.H.H. You have referred to what is feminine; would Rahab, *being in the land*, be an example of what God is doing in providing for this in an abstract way in the midst of what is hostile?
J.T. Quite so. She is already there and she has the characteristics; she had the flax, and then the power in the cord. It is all a question of what God can use. It is His power but then it requires faith in us. Unless we bring in the element of faith then the working of God is not effective in us *now*. It is a question of what He *will* do in resurrection literally, but what He is doing *now* has all these features. If we take Rahab, she is in the land and she has flax. That is, there is a means of purity there and she has a means of letting the spies down and instructing them. She is in the thing for she knows what God has done. It was a question of what God *had* done
{60}
and what they *had* done, but now it is a question of what she *is doing* or what anyone like her is doing. God is operating and I believe the point in this chapter is *the working of God* in order to bring in conditions for assembly service at the present time, leading us to heavenly places in a spiritual sense.
Ques. So that "rejoicing and seeing your order" is what is taking place now?
J.T. That is right. That is what he observed in spirit. He was not there, but it shows what is current and that there is such a thing as knowing things without being there physically, for the spiritual thing is here.
L.E.S. Is not the footnote you quoted really the important matter, because it is a link with the last verse of chapter 1? The footnote to the word *working* in verse 12 says *active internal power* and then in the last verse of chapter 1 we have "according to his working, which works in me in power".
J.T. Very good. Chapter 1: 24 - 29, is what Paul was doing, but chapter 2 is what God is doing and that is what we have to keep in our minds if we are to have actual assembly service. That is to say, the spiritual matter; because the only power for it is the working of God and that involves the Spirit of God down here in the saints.
Eu.R. Would the word to Philadelphia: "thou hast a little power" be the working of it now?
J.T. I think so. I think the Lord is accrediting the saints in our times with that very thing. There is a little power and that little power must come into the assembly. It is not simply what is in our houses, it is what is in the assembly when we are sitting down together, how we can move on from the Lord's supper into heavenly places. It is a question of the power of God that is at work, but that must be in the Spirit.
W.C. Would the woman's experience in @Mark 5 bear on it? She touched the hem of the Lord's garment
{61}
and it says she *knew* what had taken place in her. She has the experience of that coming into the soul.
J.T. Just so. Then when the Lord Himself came into the house of Jairus, it was a question of what He would do. They had the flute-players there, but such was the condition that they derided Him, and that may be the condition at any time in our localities. The Lord put them all out, and that makes way for what we are talking about, that is to say, *the working of God*. So He says, "Damsel, I say to thee, Arise". The idea of persons coming into life is what we want and how God does that in view of their having part in the assembly. Therefore it says, "he desired that something should be given her to eat". That was a matter for the parents to do.
Ques. Would you just say a word on the expression, "in whom also ye have been circumcised" (verse 11)? It seems a very strong expression and seems to link up with the presentation of Christ as the One in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily.
J.T. It says, "In whom also ye have been circumcised with circumcision not done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ; buried with him in baptism, in which ye have been also raised". The word *whom* is stronger than the word *which* and is in relation to circumcision, that is the actual death of Christ. It is a question of how far we come into that, but then baptism is linked on with it, and "in which" is used there. Baptism is a figure, but it is a figure not only of death but of resurrection. This chapter brings in the added thought that baptism carries with it the idea of resurrection. It does not carry it in Romans. There it is simply that we are dead with Christ, but here there is a figure of resurrection in baptism. We can therefore apply the idea to our children being baptised. If the power of God is there, they really have a place in resurrection in the sense in which the assembly is available to them. This chapter goes the whole length of the truth, in order to make
{62}
assembly service possible. We can take the ground of being risen with Christ, as it says, "Wherein also ye are risen"; but then in Ephesians it is said that He "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies", and we can go that far too. It is a question of the power we have, if we can speak intelligently as to the power we have, for assembly service; that we go beyond the Lord's supper and as having power, we can go into heavenly places. The power is the Spirit, so it is not a question of God as such, but of what is down here in the Spirit.
Ques. Does the idea of faith here suggest a certain objective line of things? Although the *working of God* is, in itself, subjective, would *through the faith of it* involve our being maintained in the light that has reached us of God's thoughts?
J.T. Well, just to guard the idea of the thing being all literal, it is a question of faith, for it is a faith system we are in. We shall not be in a faith system when we are in heaven, but now it is a question of how much we have. It is "through faith of the working of God"; and therefore it becomes a question of measure.
H.F.N. In regard to this thought of the working of God in relation to the resurrection sphere and in relation to the assembly service, what place does the ascension have?
J.T. That would be Ephesians, of course, and it is a question of how far we can go. In Ephesians there is quickening, which is *making alive*. Then we have to go to Ephesians for the formal thought of resurrection and ascension, and there we are said to have been raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies; that would be an anticipative thought, and in assembly service we can anticipate things.
Ques. In the actual working out of assembly service, do we come together on the resurrection platform and are we led on to the plane of ascension?
{63}
J.T. I do not think there is a resurrection platform for the assembly. If there is a platform it would be an anticipative platform. We are entitled to anticipate things, and the Spirit of God supports us in our minds and affections to that end. Ephesians is an anticipative position; the platform is anticipative, that we are raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ. So that I do not care about the idea of a resurrection platform. I know how much it is used, but I think we do well to keep to the full thought, if we are going to deal with faith and what belongs to faith, which is the present time. We are entitled to go to the full thought but it is a question of the power we have for it. Then that power should not only affect our minds but our affections, so that it extends to one another, it extends to the saints who are present.
P.L. In @John 12, the distinguished persons there are each the fruit of divine and resurrection power and seen in relation to one another.
J.T. Lazarus was in mind. It says they came to see Lazarus also, which is just what I am trying to show. It is a question of real persons and substantiality and what we think of them, what they are to us in assembly.
Ques. Would you say a word as to verse 6, "As therefore ye have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord". What do these titles involve in our affections?
J.T. The thought is, "As therefore ye have received the Christ", and then the other words are additional or just to support this point. They received Christ, and He is "Jesus the Lord". Then they are to "walk in him, rooted and built up in him, and assured in the faith, even as ye have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving". The point is faith here. Of course, faith is light too, and we have instruction, but as I said before, it is a question of substantiality. The brethren will pardon me for repeating that word, but we are dealing with persons. The Lord Jesus is brought in here as a Person in a substantial sense as we have been saying;
{64}
this is involved in the word *bodily*. Christianity is thus a real thing, in which Christ is known to be "everything, and in all". We have real Christianity, but it is in the faith sphere. On the principle of faith everything is ours.
A.Al. Do we get that reference to substantiality in @John 1, "the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ"?
J.T. I would say that.
{65}
SPIRITUAL FORMATION FOR ASSEMBLY SERVICE (4)
@Colossians 2: 9 - 23; @Colossians 3: 1 - 4; @Joshua 5: 2 - 9
J.T. It is thought that the types in Joshua will help us in the understanding of these sections of Colossians and so the verses read have been suggested. There it is a question of Israel, not having exactly entered the land, but in the act of entering it and it thus links with what has been stressed this morning as to what God is doing. It is not what He has done or will do, but what He is doing now and hence the application of this passage to us as we are here on the earth. That is why we dwelt upon it at such length, and yet we hardly finished what should be said about it, especially the position of Christ in chapter 2 as compared with the passage in chapter 1. They correspond in measure as to the word "fulness". We have here in verse 9, "in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". The word *bodily* is added in order to bring out the idea of persons. It is not only what we may know, or be, in God's mind or in the minds of each other, but what we are in person, each one in his person. The assembly is composed of persons, and Christ is said to be Head of it. In chapter 1 of this book, it is formally stated that "*he* is the head of the body, the assembly". The word *body* carries with it the idea of persons, but in a substantial sense and in the aggregate. Among many other distinctions, Christ has the place of headship to the body; the word *assembly* being added. Then this passage alludes formally to the Person of Christ in a bodily sense. The question of our bodies must therefore come up if we are rightly to understand the passage and this must include our connections, relations or associations and what we are in appearance as well as what we are in our minds. Circumcision is introduced in Joshua, after they had crossed the Jordan. The enormous number of those who died in the wilderness,
{66}
possibly six hundred thousand, actual death being administered to them so that their carcases fell in the wilderness, would point to the force of circumcision. As to those who go into Canaan, their bodies are affected by circumcision and not literal death. Circumcision is not in the head, it is a question of their bodies in a general sense and it obviously points to the number that were slain. Thus death, in a moral sense, takes the place of literal death which the great number in Israel endured. Circumcision therefore for us now is not a rite or ceremony or something to be administered, such as baptism; it is the death of Christ that is in mind. It is real death, and that we come into it in a moral sense, and hence have passed out of the world. So the word later is, "for ye have died".
P.H.H. Referring to the word *bodily*, do you mean that the "fulness of the Godhead" dwells in Christ's own personal body as Man?
J.T. Yes.
P.H.H. Would you say just a little more about the term *substantiality* in that connection.
J.T. Well, He is a real Man. Here, I think, it is to stress the reality of His manhood, as over against certain current ideas and that "as he is, so are we", @1 John 4: 17. He is a real Man with the faculties and feelings of a man, but withal in that outwardly small compass; not inwardly small, because there is no measure of the inward side; but, in that *outwardly* small compass, the fulness of the Godhead dwelt.
A.N.W. Is that why John begins his epistle with the word *That* rather than *He* as at the beginning of his gospel?
J.T. Well, I think that is just the point. John brings that out; he begins with the neuter: "*That* ... which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes". It is the reality of His manhood. He was a real Person, a real Man. It would be very much to John himself, because John lay in His bosom.
{67}
P.H.H. Is it clear that in some connections the word *fulness* refers to the complete expression of a thing? Here would you take it to mean more, that it is all that is inward and completely immeasurable?
J.T. Just so. Instead of the word *expression*, it is, as you say, *all* that is there. So the first chapter of Hebrews, as we had it this morning, reads: "by whom also he made the worlds". That is to say, it is from eternity, and then "who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance". The word *substance*, according to the note, is *essential being*, not *person*, and the note adds, *It is of God, not of the Father*. That is to say, it is the expression of the substance of God, what He is substantially. Substantiality is the word we have been using, and Christ, as the passage says, is the expression of His substance. It is not exactly representation, but expression, the expression of His substance, which is beyond the creature's power to compass, or ever to name, what God is essentially, in His own being.
Ques. In "the expression of his substance", does the word expression mean that it is something for us to take in?
J.T. Well, it is a question of who we are and who are the persons in mind, because it would be angels too, the whole realm of intelligence, I would say. Yet it cannot be said that the thing is properly understood, because it is infinite and inscrutable.
W.H. Would the expression, "seen of angels" come in in that connection?
J.T. Quite so. It says, "seen of angels ... believed on in the world, received up into glory", @1 Timothy 3: 16.
A.Al. The word announcing His birth is "that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God", @Luke 1: 35. Would that involve what is substantial?
{68}
J.T. Yes, it would. The word *thing* there is to be noted; "that holy thing which shall be born of thee". The Spirit of God has that way of dealing with matters at times. He does not go so far as we might think. His way is just to avoid certain things as needed. Later the Lord was circumcised and His name is given. He was called Jesus, but "that holy thing" is to bring out what was there in a substantial sense.
Ques. Do you see any connection between verse 9 of our chapter and @John 17: 5, "and now glorify *me, thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was"?
J.T. Yes, there is, only that in the latter case the Lord was in the form of God; what we are dealing with here is in the form of man. @John 17: 5 is what He was in Deity, before incarnation, but here we are dealing purposely with the incarnation, so that it might be understood that there is a real Person and that the fulness of the Godhead is in Him, "for in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". The word *dwells* too is to be noted. It is not simply that it is in Him, but it dwells there, the Godhead dwells there.
L.E.S. What would be the difference between "expression of his substance" in @Hebrews 1 and "God is a Spirit" in @John 4?
J.T. Well, we cannot go beyond that. "God is a Spirit". God is that, and He has to be worshipped in that sense. It is to bring out the need in ourselves of the knowledge of God and of who He is and what He is and that we know therefore how to worship. It is *who* we worship. We worship God, but then we worship the Father, and we worship the Son. The point there is that God is a Spirit, and that thought should enter into our worship so that our worship must be spiritual.
Ques. I would like to ask why the word "bodily" is used in chapter 2 when it has reference to the present place of the Lord Jesus, in contrast with the place that He had here as Man.
{69}
J.T. Well, it could come in there also, for it was true when He was here. It was true from the time of the incarnation as to fact.
Ques. Is it not the fact here, that the truth is brought forward in its bearing on ourselves, for it goes on to say, "ye are complete in him". Does not Mr. Darby's note to verse 10 connect the two?
J.T. Yes. The link is strong as to substantiality and personality of which we have been speaking, and bears on the assembly, because later in the chapter it says, "the body is of Christ" (verse 17), and then "not holding fast the head, from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God". The body is thus in mind in all this and what God effects in it; hence the importance of what has been said about substantiality. The assembly is formed of persons of which Christ could be Head, or is Head. That is, there is in that sense a correspondence between the Head and the body, but all in the sense of substantiality as over against chapter 1 where the word *bodily* is not found.
W.H. Would the thought of bodily stress the substantiality that the saints have now in Christ where He is?
J.T. Well, just so. The very existence of the body depends on Christ where He is, dead and risen and glorified. The assembly is out of Him, @Genesis 2: 23. It says, "the body is of Christ". It is a substantial thought, it is composed of persons such as ourselves. That raises the question as to how we regard each other and what we are as in that position. It is the position or sphere in which the divine operations are being carried on, and hence the thoughts of circumcision and baptism that follow and the faith of the operation of God or the working of God. That is to say, He is operating on the principle of faith. It is not what we shall be by-and-by, but what we are *now*, as we are now in faith. God is operating in us on the principle of faith, because we are
{70}
in a faith period. We are not in a risen condition, in an eternal period or in eternal conditions, we are in the faith condition, and God is pleased to operate in the faith period. It is in view of bringing about a condition in which we can abstract ourselves from what we are morally in this world, to be abstractly what we are in Christ, and that is the basis on which assembly service is to be carried on. Hence the position of the ark in Jordan and all that follows as seen in @Joshua 5 and other parts of Joshua help greatly in the elucidating of the truth in this epistle of Colossians.
A.J.E. Would the idea of substantiality be seen in @Acts 5, the shadow of Peter falling upon the sick?
J.T. Just so. You could hardly have a shadow without a substance. That shows the value of the saints, which we have already touched on. Peter in the beginning of Acts, with John, says to the lame man who was to be healed, "Look on us", that is on John and Peter. There was something there in those two persons, and that is really what is in mind in all that is being said as to substantiality in persons. We are to learn to look on each other and regard each other accordingly, because there is little or no value in dealing with the body, save in the sense that we are the persons themselves, at least we are of them. We are real persons in whom God is working, so that we are objects of affection to one another. That is what is in mind, and that is what this passage has in mind too; it is to bring out the reality of Christianity.
W.S.S. That is the great mystery of it, I presume, "Christ in you the hope of glory". He is here substantially in persons today?
J.T. Quite so. According to the last verse of chapter 1 God was working in Paul but now He is working in us and it is on the principle of faith: "through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead".
{71}
E.C.M. Would you say a word on the expression "united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God", as connected with "being united together in love".
J.T. Well, it all bears on the same thing. The joints and bands are not in the head, they are in a general way in the body. Although it is enlarged on a little more in Ephesians than it is here, it brings out the full idea of a body, of the human body, and that Christ has a body, only that He is divine, He is God in it.
G.H.M. While you are speaking of this matter of *bodily*, would you say a word as to its application to the Spirit in Luke?
J.T. The word bodily there cannot be said to be in the sense in which it is spoken of Christ. The Holy Spirit has not a human body; it is just that the form was there. He took that form, so that it could be attested by John; as it is said in @John 1: 32, that John beheld the Spirit descending. It was a question of testimony and hence what could be seen. So in the beginning of the epistle; "That which ... we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled", and so forth, is to bring out the reality of the humanity of Christ.
We are endeavouring to get at the abstract position, the essential position that the chapter contemplates. There is what is in Christ, in His body, in a bodily sense, and how we correspond with it. Then we have the working of God; first, that we are circumcised in His circumcision, and then that we are baptised, not in *His* baptism, but baptised just in the ordinary sense, and that baptism in this chapter, as we have remarked, carries with it the idea of resurrection. It is not resurrection as a full basis of things but simply that they are viewed as risen. "Wherein also ye are risen", as it says, "through the faith of the operation of God". Then, if we are that, if we are risen by the faith of the operation of God, well then we can proceed to what is found in
{72}
Ephesians, where it is not only that we are risen, but quickened and raised and seated in the heavenlies. Ephesians goes all the way and is anticipative, whereas Colossians is not anticipative. It contemplates us as we are, what is current at the present moment. That is to say, instead of being in the land, we are entering it, and @Joshua 5 shows what happens in the entering. There was need for circumcision, and we are told that they made stone knives or *swords of rocks*. The idea of the sword is used, which means there is a real cutting off, and not only a cutting off but a rolling away of the reproach of Egypt. The word *rolling* is to convey the thought of the *total* rolling away of the reproach of Egypt. Before there could be the eating of the old corn of the land, that has to take place, and it takes place in the entering, at the time of *entering* into Canaan.
S.B. In regard to what happened when Elijah was taken up, Elisha asks for a double portion of his spirit and Elijah's answer is: "If thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so". And Elisha sees Elijah taken up and when he comes back the sons of the prophets say: "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha".
J.T. I am glad you have brought up that, because it is just a question of what we are saying. It is what is current, what God is doing. The great thought is the operation of God and all these things enter into it, having in view that the service of God should exist and go on.
Ques. Would the practical effect of the apprehension of this amongst the saints be that we learn to dispense with all that is not of Christ?
J.T. Well, just so. It is really a question of displacement and hiding and so you have here a striking word in verse 14, "having effaced the handwriting in ordinances which stood out against us, which was contrary to us, He has taken it also out of the way". I am referring to "out of the way" and effacement. God has operated to take
{73}
things that would hinder us out of the way and to take them out of the way judicially. We can thus see that they are dealt with and dealt with for ever so that they should not hinder us. Then there are many things besides that are hindering us that are not mentioned here, that God would have *us* remove and take out of the way. Such things as associations that are not proper to Christians and many other things like that; so that instead of God as it were taking them out of the way judicially, *we* take them out of the way too, in a practical sense, so that they should not hinder us.
L.E.S. So that Paul's word in @Philippians 3, agrees with this, "See to dogs, see to evil workmen, see to the concision. For *we* are the circumcision".
J.T. Quite so. See to it and have it attended to; that is the thing.
H.P.W. Is it displacement by death?
J.T. The circumcision of Christ is the death of Christ. Although we have literal baptism, we have no literal circumcision, but we do have spiritual circumcision, and that is what the apostle means. It is the application of death, hence he says: "for ye have died". The first verse of chapter 3 is really hypothetical; it says, "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God: have your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth; for ye have died". He is dealing with that and he alludes to the circumcision of Christ.
Ques. Would the importance of what you are saying be stressed in @Joshua 5 when Jehovah says "circumcise again ... the second time"?
J.T. Just so. I think it points to what was so very real with the Israelites for six hundred thousand of them died in the wilderness. The word *carcases* is used as to them, and then the word *bones* in the warnings against defilement shows that the reality of death was there.
{74}
Hence the second circumcision is to stress that, for the young people that were born had not been circumcised and they should be. It was to stress in their minds that their forefathers had died because of self-will that is the idea of it. Death is a real matter and it can be brought to bear on young people now and upon all of us that death will come if we persist in ministering to the flesh. Now circumcision forestalls that, and we are able to enter on the service of God because we are raised through the operation of God, on the principle of faith.
W.H. Would circumcision, in that way, have particularly in view what is spiritual as suggested in the inheritance?
J.T. Quite so. They were already entering on it really. They had actually laid their feet on it, but still they are not regarded as having gone up definitely, because Jericho is still in the way. They had to go through the thing in themselves; that is to say, the actual figure of death, accepted in the true sense of it.
P.H.H. What place would the stones have in connection with what you are saying? There were the stones in the Jordan and then stones placed on the other side.
J.T. I think the stones in the Jordan are just a type of where we were; where Israel was and where we were in death. The setting up of these stones was done by Joshua himself, as it says in the ninth verse of the fourth chapter, "And twelve stones did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood firm; and they are there to this day". That is to say, they are there as a testimony. Jordan has returned to overflow its banks, and the whole force of death is there but, nevertheless, *they* are there. Then what precedes that is, "And it came to pass when the whole nation had completely gone over the Jordan, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying, Take you twelve men out of the people, one man out of every tribe, and command them, saying,
{75}
Take up hence out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests¬ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night. And Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had appointed of the children of Israel, a man out of every tribe; and Joshua said to them, Pass before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and lift up each of you a stone and put it upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, that this may be a sign in your midst. When your children ask hereafter, saying, What mean ye by these stones? then ye shall say to them, That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it went through the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever", @Joshua 4: 1 - 7. That means, as applied to ourselves, that we are risen with Christ. We are entitled to regard it so, but that is not the whole position, for according to Ephesians we are raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies, but Colossians does not go that far. What we are saying therefore as to Joshua greatly helps us as to Colossians for the bearing of resurrection in Colossians has the heavenly position in view. We have to realise the power of resurrection, which is "the working of God"; that is, the *energy* of God; His active power. Paul says, "ye have been raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead". That is to stress the power of resurrection entering into the service of God, and that it is realisable by us, when we are actually in the service, because we have the Spirit. Without the Spirit it could not be realisable, it could only be a theory or a doctrine. The Spirit makes it a real fact, so that we are affected thus and really in the enjoyment of association with Christ.
P.L. So that spiritual alacrity marks Abraham after circumcision, for he runs and then he ministers to
{76}
divine tastes at the tent door. Would that suggest the service of God?
J.T. Quite so. It was a real scene of activity and Abraham was a servant in active service. Sarah is brought into it, although she did not just fulfil her part in it, yet she is brought into it and the young men are brought into it as well, and so forth.
G.W.B. Would you say a word as to the distinction between baptism and circumcision.
J.T. Well, circumcision is just a real figure of the death of Christ. It is never applied to the Christian, nor is it brought into Christianity as baptism is. It is just a figure of the death of Christ, and that we are circumcised in it, in Him. Baptism is also a figure of the death of Christ, but it is a figure of the resurrection of Christ as well, as it says here, "Wherein also ye are risen". All that bears on the service of God as showing what we may be as sitting down together in the assembly.
Ques. When he speaks of being quickened in verse 13, he says quickened *together*. Is that the point where we touch true collective ground, in the consciousness of this relation?
J.T. Very good. I think it is, because we are greatly tested as to what we think of each other. One would always challenge oneself in sitting down with the brethren as to what one thinks about them, because it is a question of what we are, and the Lord comes to us according to what we are. We expect Him to come, but He has in mind what we are, we are persons that are attractive to Him.
Ques. Would you judge that there were those conditions in the assembly at Antioch according to @Acts 13?
J.T. Well, I think that is right, because they are called Christians. It is a term that signifies what they are, that is to say, they are "of Christ". It just indicates that the saints at Antioch were fully in these matters; they were fully in the truth of Christianity.
{77}
F.C.H. What would be the relation of the younger generation in regard of circumcision? No uncircumcised person was to eat of the passover and yet it says that "all the people that were born in the wilderness on the way, after they came out of Egypt, them had they not circumcised". Does that bear on what you are saying as to the young people?
J.T. Well, quite so. It is really what we are aiming at in the main, because most of the dear brethren that are in mind here are young and perhaps not fully initiated in the truth of Christianity. One knows no passage more important than the epistle to Colossians as to the reality of Christianity, and how we are to get into it. We are told in these scriptures how we are to get into it, and the types, particularly that in Joshua, help us greatly.
Ques. What is the thought of spoiling principalities and powers?
J.T. It would mean that they would be hostile principalities and powers; that is what Satan has built up. It is more fully entered on in Ephesians, but here they are spoiled.
A.H.G. Why does it say that they are made a show of publicly?
J.T. Well, I suppose to bring out that the power of God is operative against the world. Presently, as the book of Revelation shows us, there will be a great conflict between Michael and the devil. There will be an actual conflict. No such thing as a conflict in heaven has ever been seen before, and the devil will be cast out of heaven for ever. He is not cast out yet, and that is a very solemn thing and that is why we have so much conflict, so much combat. It is spoken of so much here and we have to struggle in this matter because of many things in our circumstances and our houses, and the like, that cause combat, the devil taking advantage of circumstances in which we are.
A.H.G. You spoke earlier of making way for the assembly. Is what is here linked with that thought?
{78}
J.T. Well, it is. "Taken it also out of the way", is the very word that conveys it to us. Something is in the way and it may be in any one of us. In what is alluded to here, it is said that *God* has taken it out of the way, because it is God here: "Having effaced the handwriting in ordinances which stood out against us", that is ordinances stood out against us, they were contrary to us, "He has taken it also out of the way, having nailed it to the cross". That is all judicial; it is the death of Christ, but then there are other things that are not mentioned here that are very practical and it raises the question as to what *we* may do in removing them. One could mention many things but the general thought is that there are things which we can deal with ourselves; things that hinder us and if we do not deal with them they will continue to hinder us.
J.G. Would the graveclothes of Lazarus come in in that connection?
J.T. Just so. The Lord told them to loose him and let him go. The Lord said in effect that he would not be able to go unless they loosed him. They had to do that, for Lazarus himself could not have done it, but there are things that we can do ourselves, and that is just what is in mind, let us do them.
E.E.P. In @Exodus 33: 11 it says "Joshua ... a young man, departed not from within the tent". Would that show definitely how to become a skilled man in order to enter with vigour and strength, on Colossian ground?
J.T. Many, who perhaps do not know it, are held by things that could easily be taken out of the way. It is not that we should wait on God to do it judicially, because things are not dealt with in that sense. Such things as evil associations that we link on with, business associations and companionship and especially mixed marriages; all of these things are to be dealt with *by the persons involved*, or we will be hampered by them.
{79}
Ques. Would the word that the apostle writes to the saints at Corinth enter into what you are bringing before us? "Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own? for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your body", @1 Corinthians 6: 19, 20.
J.T. Quite so. How many things there are that we can deal with ourselves! The Colossian epistle is to help us to deal with ourselves where there are hindrances. God has done certain things for us; He has taken things out of the way, and gone so far as nailing them to the cross. We might therefore do very well, too, to nail them to something, so that they should never be taken up again.
Ques. Does it help in verse 14 to see that the *collective* position is the real point of the attack in the associations to which you have referred? Whilst the individual has to take them up this way, it is against *us* that they stand out and "contrary to *us*".
J.T. Quite so. As regards sins and as regards quickening in verse 13 it is said, "And you, being dead in offences and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has quickened together with him, having forgiven us all the offences; having effaced the handwriting in ordinances which stood out against us, which was contrary to us he has taken it also out of the way, having nailed it to the cross; having spoiled principalities and authorities he made a show of them publicly, leading them in triumph by it". All that would allude to what God has done and what God alone could do. But then we are speaking of what we can do, too. God has taken things out of the way judicially, but there are things that we may allow and not take them out of the way and, of course, we never get on in the truth accordingly.
G.C.S. Does Paul enumerate some of them in @Philippians 3, when he speaks of counting all things but dung that he might win Christ? That follows on what he had said about circumcision.
{80}
J.T. Yes, quite so. He had a purpose in what he was doing and that was that he might have Christ for gain. That scripture is very important in regard of what we are saying, Paul had such a purpose in what he was doing.
W.H. So he says here, "Let no one fraudulently deprive you of your prize". It comes home to us in that way.
A.J.M. Have you any thought about Zipporah in regard of Moses? The Lord sought to slay him and she said, "A bloody husband indeed art thou to me! ... because of the circumcision", @Exodus 4: 25, 26.
J.T. That is a remarkable passage indeed, because he neglected the circumcision for his son, and Jehovah thought to slay him, showing how serious it was. So here, "Let none therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in matter of feast, or new moon, or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. Let no one fraudulently deprive you of your prize", whatever it may be, "doing his own will in humility and worship of angels, entering into things which he has not seen". That shows that we may get into these things religiously, such as Romanism would instruct us in. Even heathen eastern religion might creep in and hinder us, and there are many other such things in the surrounding religions, such as the Established Church, where customs are practised that would hinder us unless we judge them and cease doing them. So it goes on to say, speaking of the false worshipping of angels, that such a person was "entering into things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh", showing what all this means, the mind of man's flesh working in the things of God. Then we have "and not holding fast the head", that is to say, Christ the Head of the assembly, for Christ is Head of the body, "from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God". All these instructions are very clear and are very obvious, and,
{81}
if in any way we are ignoring them, we will be hindered in entering into the truth of the assembly and the service of God.
A.H.G. Would you say a word on the expression: "but the body is of Christ".
J.T. It is just the thought that, as Eve was taken out of Adam, so the assembly is taken out of Christ. That is really what is meant, "the body is of Christ".
A.N.W. Does it emphasise the matter of substance again in contrast to shadow? In verse 17 it says certain things are a shadow but then it says the body is of Christ. I wondered whether that involved the substance again.
J.T. These customs and religions around us are nothing at all; they have no force at all religiously, I mean to say in the spiritual sense. But then when the word comes in "the body is of Christ" we have a substantial thing, for it is referring to the persons who form the body and that they are taken out of Christ. It is not simply so many persons born, but persons in whom God has wrought, persons whom He has quickened and made to live together.
J.M. Would the reference to the handwriting in ordinances being effaced indicate that they are no longer necessary because the body is of Christ?
J.T. Quite so. "The body is of Christ" means it is a substantial thought. It is referring to ourselves, to Christians, the only circle of persons who are really of any account to God, to heaven. All else is simply in the way. Of course, there are natural connections, associations or links which we have to recognise, but they do not continue; the assembly does continue, for it is an abiding thing.
P.L. It is a deathless company, is it not?
J.T. Quite so. Deathless is a good word for it.
W.S.S. It "increases with the increase of God".
P.H.H. Would there be a warning in connection with all this in Achan hiding the wedge of gold and the
{82}
Babylonish garment in his tent? That is, while positionally risen with Christ, yet we may be going on with the elements of the world?
J.T. Yes. He stole them and hid them, and, of course, suffered accordingly.
P.H.H. It is said of him that he dissembled.
J.T. Quite so. They represented the world. On the other hand, there were certain things in Jericho, such as metals, that, in themselves, represented what was of God and that is another matter.
Ques. Does Gideon represent the idea of dealing with things that are not right, in that he deals with them first in his father's house? He destroyed things that were inconsistent with the thoughts of God for His people.
J.T. On the other hand, when he would use the gold of the persons he had overcome to make an idol, there was failure. How easily we can drop into what is wrong after being so characterised by what is right!
Eu.R. Do the twelve stones taken out of the Jordan and reared up on the land side link on at all with the thought of Christ's brethren; a company of His own order, a heavenly company?
J.T. Quite so. They link on with ourselves in that they are types of ourselves. They are types of the assembly, that we are risen with Christ.
Eu.R. Does not that help us to enter into the thought of being His body and responding to Him?
J.T. Quite so. That we are risen with Christ helps us in participating in the service of God. That is in Colossians and resurrection is only on the way, as we have already remarked, for Colossians is *entering*. They have not yet fully entered, and so it is that the full truth of the service of God requires Ephesians as well as Colossians. We are thus able to go the whole way, and it is a question therefore of the power of the Spirit operating in our hearts and minds. We are able to sit down together in assembly and lay hold of the fact that we are risen with Christ and not only so, but that we are raised
{83}
up and seated in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, because we have to go the whole way. God would have us to go the whole way; and unless we reach heaven, sitting in heavenly places, we do not go the whole way. In order to go the whole way we have to go through this chapter and that is why one is stressing it so much. God has done His part in removing things that would stand in our way; but then do we remove the things that we know are standing in our way?
You have in the next paragraph, verse 20 of chapter 2, "If ye have died with Christ from the elements of the world, why as if alive in the world do ye subject yourselves to ordinances". The thought of *subject yourselves* would be that you are holding on to what is in the way, and so then he explains what he means, "Do not handle", that is what people would say in that sense. "Do not taste, do not touch", and then the bracket "(things which are all for destruction in the using of them:)", That is to say, they are really nothing all, they have nothing to do with the service that we are professing to hold. Then he goes on, "according to the injunctions and teachings of men", and then again a parenthesis, "Which have indeed an appearance of wisdom in voluntary worship, and humility, and harsh treatment of the body", (and we know something about that in certain systems) "not in a certain honour". That means they do not respect what is due to the human body; then the bracket ends; then, "to the satisfaction of the flesh". That is to say, the flesh wishes all these things religiously, and every one of them is in the way. They become an occasion of religious pride, because we have them and because we practise them.
A.M. Does the word in @Hebrews 12 link on with it, "laying aside every weight, and sin which so easily entangles us"?
J.T. Just so. That is just the point; "laying aside every weight", whatever the weights may be, as well as "the sin which so easily entangles us".
{84}
SPIRITUAL FORMATION FOR ASSEMBLY SERVICE (5)
@Colossians 3: 1 - 17
J.T. It is clear that the part of the chapter read involves the conclusion, in the apostle's mind, of the doctrinal part of the epistle. It therefore reverts back to chapter 2 especially, again recalling what we have had before us as to the crucial side of the subject and the place death has in these chapters. In chapter 3 (including what is said of it in chapter 2) the allusion is to baptism. It is, as it were, what each one of us has had our hand in, for baptism enters into Christianity as a public sign as over against the Passover or circumcision in Israel. Death is spoken of in the second chapter as the state we were in by nature. We were dead, in that sense; not exactly judicially, but as to our state. Then we have burial added, which baptism conveys, and also the thought of resurrection. Romans does not carry the thought of baptism as far as resurrection, but Colossians does. Paul in Colossians is aiming at the saints moving on to heavenly things in view of the service of God, and so it adds the thought of resurrection to the idea of baptism, evidently in order to complete the thought in view of the service of God. We can take the ground of being risen, although resurrection is not final, nor is it basic exactly, but it is in view of ascension. We cannot have Christianity, either in a public or private way, except on the ground of ascension. This chapter leads on to it and, especially in view of the Lord's supper, we are entitled to take the place of being risen; that is in the sense of being wholly free of the world. The idea of burial is that we are out of sight, but being raised is added, according to the twelfth verse of chapter 2. Then in verse 20 we have a hypothetical thought, which is a previous one to the one we have in chapter 3. It says, "If ye have died with Christ from the elements of the
{85}
world, why as if alive in the world do ye subject yourselves to ordinances?". Ordinances have a great place especially in Episcopalian countries. This country has a National Church, and ordinances are almost legalised; they become part of the religious profession of the people. So that the "therefore", which is sequential in chapter 3, is of prime importance as to the service of God, which must be wholly free from mere ordinances and, however much we might add the thought of ritual to the things that are to be done in the Lord's supper, there is no thought of it properly. The Lord's supper should be done with intelligence, of course, and the apostle addresses himself to our intelligence in speaking of it in Corinthians, but it should be done as simply as possible. It is a simple thought involving "simplicity as to the Christ". So that the less formality there is, save what is warranted in Scripture, the better.
P.H.H. I do not quite follow your reference to "having died" and here "being raised with Christ". Are you connecting that with a certain preparation of mind, having the Lord's supper in view?
J.T. Yes, in view of the latter part of it, I would say. We are not on resurrection ground in partaking of the Lord's supper itself, but we are entitled to take that place after the memorial, leading on to the heavenly side of things. To complete our position we must refer to Ephesians, which tells us that we are raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ. I am speaking of what follows the taking of the emblems, included in the Supper, because the Lord's supper is undoubtedly in the wilderness; it has to be taken in that position.
Ques. Does it help at all to see the objective the Lord has before Him? It says in @John 13, "Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that ... he should depart out of this world to the Father". And then a little later on "knowing that ... he came out from God and was going to God". Then we have His service
{86}
that His saints may have part with Him, but it seems that that great objective is always in His mind.
J.T. Well, what is to be said there is that @John 14 contemplates His coming to us, which is a matter to be considered in view of the idea of the memorial in the Lord's supper. He says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", and we count on that, that the Lord comes to us. It contemplates that He is moving out of heaven. He moves, on the first day of the week, towards the brethren, towards the assembly. I should say properly that He moves toward *the assemblies*, and that raises the whole question as to whether He is remembered in heaven or whether we have in view that He is near. In @Luke 24: 36 we are told that "as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst". It is not said that He *came* as in @John 20, but implies that He was near and ready to manifest Himself as the time for it arrived. He thus moves towards us, as we might properly say now, spiritually. Indeed it is just spiritually now, but still there is an actual movement involving His part on the earth where the sufferings are.
L.E.S. Would what you are saying link on with what we were considering on Lord's day afternoon as to the suffering side connected with the wilderness?
J.T. Yes, just so. The Lord is viewed, you might say, as He was here. As risen from the dead, He moved *here* for forty days. But then @1 Corinthians 15 says that He appeared to certain ones, and one of them was Paul. "Last of all", he says, "he appeared to *me* also". So that it must not only involve what He was in the forty days, but also what He is now as in heaven. He takes on these liberties, either spiritually or corporeally, so that He is free to be with us at any time, as He was with Paul. What we are saying now is of the highest importance, because it means that the Lord is free and it avoids our assuming that His position is static or stationary. He is active and from the Colossian point of view especially, because Colossians does not stress ascension. Paul
{87}
speaks of what might have been known in the early days before He went up, and also what might have been known even after He went up, because we do know from @1 Corinthians 15 that He appeared to certain ones, including Paul.
Ques. Would it be right to say that as we come into the position of being raised with Christ following the Supper, the Lord comes to us in that position?
J.T. I should not like to go so far as to say that it is the resurrection position. It was only a resurrection position as regards Himself in the forty days, and yet He moved about amongst them, not assuming that they were risen, but that they were in ordinary circumstances down here. The chapter we are dealing with contemplates us as risen, but that is an allusion to baptism; that is to say what resurrection means as seen in baptism. That is the ground that we may take in faith, because the faith position is really of the first importance in this epistle. If it be a question of faith, it is the ground we can take, because of the idea of resurrection being involved in baptism.
Rem. I was thinking of the resurrection position in regard to ourselves in the light of your remarks about "through faith of the working of God", having that in our souls. You were suggesting that God is operating in the light of the resurrection of Christ.
J.T. Well, that would come in properly after the emblems are partaken of, because the Supper includes both the emblems and they both refer to the memorial of Christ. That cannot apply to Him as come amongst us. That is what I understand, because the Lord's supper is properly in the wilderness and refers to persons, as we are, in flesh and blood, including brothers and sisters.
Ques. Would the expression, "Have your mind on the things that are above", confirm what you are saying?
J.T. Well, just so. "Not on the things that are on the earth", which shows that we are on the earth in fact.
{88}
Ques. Does the Lord come personally or by the Spirit?
J.T. Well, both these things are true if you take the whole dispensation into account. He came personally to them after He rose. We are told He came personally and we see it in the first chapter of Acts. But then, as we have said, we see it in @1 Corinthians 15. @John 14 would contemplate more the spiritual side. When it says, "I am coming to you", it is left open, and I think it would cover the whole dispensation right down to the present moment. I doubt the wisdom of bringing forward the corporeal side, because there is hardly anything in Scripture to indicate that anyone experienced the Lord's coming in this sense, although Paul said that He appeared to him, and even later in his service, the Lord actually stood by him and said, "Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome", @Acts 23: 11. But then in saying that, why should we not accept the liberty the Lord takes, in that sense, at any time, if He is pleased to do so? To say that we have not experienced it, will not be enough; it is a question of what liberty the Lord may take, for He is a divine Person.
Ques. Are we to take the position of being raised with Christ all the time?
J.T. Not if we are dealing with the order of the service of God. In introducing the Lord's supper in 1 Corinthians, Paul does not contemplate that we are risen with Christ. He contemplates us as in flesh and blood condition, and that Christ is absent. When we are eating and drinking, doing our work and so forth, we are simply in ordinary flesh and blood condition, although, of course, in the light of salvation. Therefore the position we are in is not any different from the millennial position, for the millennial position will imply a flesh and blood state among men. What will happen eventually we have to work out from other scriptures, but that will be the millennial condition and it will show
{89}
what God can do in men as they are, in spite of what Satan has done. Of course, Satan then will be bound. He is not bound now but, at the same time, the Spirit is in us. We have the Spirit now, and the Spirit enables us to move about as men in the flesh. The word "in the flesh" is just a form to show that we are not literally raised, we are in flesh and blood conditions. Then, added to that, we have the thought of the service of God properly. This is not continually going on; it is special, and we are entitled to take the ground of being risen and even ascended according to the state we may be in, not simply theoretically, but actually, for the Spirit of God may support us in such a way that we are conscious that we are with Christ and that we have part with Christ together in a collective sense.
Ques. When you speak of the Lord being absent, does that convey the thought that He is in heaven, or that He is not yet in the assembly?
J.T. Not necessarily in heaven. It may be said in a formal way that He is "gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him", and that He is "at the right hand of God"; but that does not set aside the fact that He is personally free to do what He pleases.
Rem. I was thinking of the end of Matthew, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world".
J.T. Well, that is true. That is Matthew's view and he is the only one that says that. He never says the Lord ascended and that is to bring out the great fact of the assembly in its functions down here, the local assembly, and then the general idea of it, that the Lord is with us all the time. It is a very comforting thought. So we have such expressions in Matthew, as "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" (@Matthew 18: 20) meaning it is a local position.
{90}
E.J.M. Is that what you had in mind when you spoke earlier about the Lord coming to the assembly, and then added that He comes to the assemblies, that is, the plural?
J.T. Well, both are true. @Matthew 18 contemplates that where two or three are gathered together unto His name there He is in the midst *of them*. That does not mean the whole assembly; it is a local company, it is two or three. Then in @John 14 we have, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". It is left in an indefinite sense, but the fact is there that He is at liberty to do so. Why should we not recognise that? A divine Person can never be limited, but must be free to do what He pleases.
G.F.G. In connection with this matter of the service of God and our being enabled to take our place as being raised with Christ, is that something more than we were considering yesterday in regard of being raised through faith of the working of God?
J.T. The allusion is to the same thing, only that the latter thought (that is what we are dealing with now) is more definite. In the second chapter we have: "ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him". That is a statement of a present fact, that we can take that ground. But then, when should we take it? There ought to be intelligence in our movements and in what we do in the service of God. As we come from our houses and sit down together to partake of the Lord's supper, it is not then the time to introduce that passage in @Colossians 2; it belongs to a subsequent part of the service. There are, so to speak, stages, as we often say, *from glory to glory*. The saints come out of their houses as in freedom from the influence of the world and sit down together. There is glory in that, but it is not the same glory as when we can take the ground of being risen with Christ and seated in the heavenlies in Christ. Why should we not do it? We are addressed as intelligent persons and we are dealing with the service, which is as much a service as that which
{91}
Moses inaugurated. Thus, when we take on the service, we should know the parts of it and how Scripture refers to it, and to use the right scriptures at any given time.
J.S.E. Does the reference to being raised remove the mind from the sense of suffering?
J.T. It does. The Lord is viewed as risen and, of course, you might say that the idea of suffering hardly fits; only we are dealing now, as we have said, with those that are addressed as intelligent persons. All these quotations from Scripture, therefore, as used in the service of God, ought to be used intelligently. Usually the service of God is dependent on someone taking part. It is not that we may not all, as it were, be in the Spirit, but there is the idea of someone taking part, because the service of God is largely a matter of speaking. Therefore if a brother is in power in the Spirit, his giving of thanks may lift us all up to a higher level. It is a question of what may be done by our taking part. There is great latitude, in a sense, but there is not to be mere words, but intelligence in what is being done, and why should there not be? The thought of priesthood involves intelligence and we are said to be priests of God and priests of Christ; the scripture says, "the priest's lips should keep knowledge" (@Malachi 2: 7), and a brother ought to bear that in mind, so that what he is saying is according to knowledge.
F.C.H. With regard to intelligence, how would you regard addressing the Lord as being *above* or *on high*, after the spiritual side is reached consequent on His coming in?
J.T. Well, I think if He is apprehended as having come in, it is happier to address Him as in our midst. But still if a brother addresses the Lord as above and as ascended and so on, then it would be a question of known doctrine, which is always right in its place. Mark would say, *He is above, at the right hand of God*, but Matthew does not say that. John would, of course, say both, but he entitled us to say that the Lord has come in,
{92}
and to say, "It is the Lord". John himself would say that and did say that, and if you are intelligent enough or spiritual enough to discern that the Lord is there, why not speak accordingly? "It is the Lord". The saints who are in the Spirit will recognise it too.
Ques. You have alluded to the words, "I am coming to you", as marking the whole of the dispensation; is His coming to us as referred to there, as conditions are pleasing to the Lord, of exactly the same character as what is spoken of in Matthew where it says, "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them"?
J.T. Well, I think we ought to take that by itself. I would not regard that as exactly a scripture to treat of the saints as in assembly. I would take it as it is seen in Matthew; it would be evidently a time of stress and maybe in relation to a disciplinary matter. I would say generally it would be that and there is great need that the Lord should be with us in these matters, so that we should not have to take the ground of doing things twice, which is a very humbling thing.
E.C.B. Where does marital response come in, in relation to what you are speaking of?
J.T. Well, that is a matter of *discernment* too, and that is another word to keep before us. David used it in regard to Abigail, and it is a very good word; he said, "Blessed be thy discernment". In the service of God it is a question of discerning and not simply going on the ground of a theory.
A.G. In connection with the presence of the Lord amongst us, some have a difficulty as to ending our addresses to the Lord with the words, '*In Thy name*', as seeming to imply distance. Would you help us as to that?
J.T. Well, the scripture that is before us tells us, in verse 17, "And everything, whatever ye may do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father by him". What can
{93}
anybody say about that? The name is there. It might be said, Well, that is ordinary; but still, there it is: "everything, whatever ye may do in word or in deed".
E.G. Would you say we are no more entitled to address the Lord Jesus either in prayer or thanksgiving and end up just with "Amen" than we are the Father? We must bring in His name because of what we are.
J.T. Well, quite.
L.E.S. Have you not stressed that the mediatorial position and service of the Lord is to be held by us at all times?
J.T. I would say that generally. There is no doubt that the term *in the name* has a military bearing and I am speaking of that here because of the idea of combat in this epistle. We have to recognise the enemy and what he might do at any time; but then the name has power in it. Thus we have the expression "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", @1 Corinthians 12: 3. That would be a military thought too; there is power in the words. It is a great matter, in assembly position, that there should be power in all that is said and done, so that the enemy has no place.
P.L. Does the Name attach to His fame?
J.T. It does; quite so. The word "Name" in the Old Testament was used by itself. Jehovah, of course, was the One spoken of, but it was "the Name". One was said to have blasphemed "the Name" (see @Leviticus 24: 11). That is the name of God; and, of course, the name of God must enter into the name of Jesus, for it means "Jehovah the Saviour".
W.S.S. Does @Ephesians 5: 20 help in relation to what is before us, "giving thanks at all times for all things to him who is God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ"?
J.T. Just so. Of course, we would have to make allowance in the assembly where the Lord's supper is only in view, because it is the *Lord's* supper; the name would then be used in that sense.
{94}
W.S.S. Do we ever reach a point when we would not say, *In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ*?
J.T. Well, that actual phrase would not be used if it were the Lord's supper, for we are then speaking to the Lord Himself, but the use of *His Name* is then right and in order. The time now will hardly suffice for us to go further with this point, although I am assured that it is most important.
P.H.H. Several have been asking about the matter of sufferings and in the minds of some the occasion of the Lord's supper is one at which there is liberty to mention the sufferings of atonement. I gather that that is not in your mind in relation to the Supper?
J.T. No; it is not in my mind. What is in mind is more centred in what is said by the Lord to Saul of Tarsus, "Why persecutest thou me?". Those are the Lord's own words, and He is not speaking there as in heaven; He has come down to where Saul was, and deals with him. It was a great matter in the Lord's mind, because He is taking on Saul. He is going to make him His chief servant, but He speaks first of what he was doing as persecuting. Of course, He is alluding to the fact that he was persecuting the saints, showing that the saints are bound up with Christ in that sense.
Eu.R. When it says "the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up", would not that involve that He was in the midst of sufferings and treachery?
J.T. Just so. That is one of the first things we have, you might say, in regard of the Lord's supper.
P.H.H. So that it is more sufferings in connection with the testimonial position.
J.T. Quite so. That is a good word for it.
L.E.S. It is very much similar to the position of the three men in Daniel's day, and One like the Son of God being discerned as in their midst.
J.T. Very good. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego are mentioned about thirteen times in the chapter, showing what a place they had with God at that time,
{95}
and how one "like the Son of God" was seen there with them.
Ques. The position of the assembly as viewed in Corinthians does not go beyond the suffering position down here in testimony, does it?
J.T. I would say that.
P.L. So that His presence assures solace in every church grief.
J.T. Quite so. All of what we are saying now is of the utmost importance in the sense of comfort. We do need comfort for the world is just turned upside down. Men are at their wits¬ end to know what to do, but the Lord would have us to be restful, and therefore He says, "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you". What we have been saying involves that the Lord is near. What does that mean? It is not simply that He is at our side; He is just near, and you can, as it were, call on Him. The Lord is near in the sense of help.
Ques. Would the word that Joseph says to his brethren in @Genesis 45 be in your mind, "Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth which speaks to you"? And then afterwards it says that "his brethren talked with him".
J.T. That would fit rightly.
Now, in view of the time at our disposal, we must proceed to what follows. In the first verse of chapter 3, we have the sequential idea: "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things which are above", the word *heaven* is not used there, it is *above*, "where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God: have your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth; for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God". So that it is a question now of moving on; not exactly in the service of God, although that may come into it, but moving on in our souls, hence the thought of the word *seek*: "Seek the things which are above". In Colossians the tendency is to lead upwards. It is not a millennial thought; it is more than
{96}
the millennial thought in Colossians, it is an assembly thought that is in mind. Although we are still viewed as literally on earth the apostle wants to lift us up, and so he uses the word *raised*. The word "If therefore ye have been raised" refers to baptism; he is referring indeed to what the second chapter enlarges upon, and using it to lift us up, to make us heavenly minded, or *as above*.
H.A.H. Is the thought of *above*, in view of power in the service?
J.T. Well, it would be; but more dignity, I would say. It is in view of our being lifted on to heavenly ground. The word 'above', of course, is very striking. It is so forceful as disconnecting our minds from the earth, and that raises the question of the expanse, as we have already had it. The expanse is a very wide thought, reaching down to the earth, with the waters above the expanse and the waters under it. The position is that we are in the expanse, in that sense, and it is a question of how the operations can proceed unhindered.
W.C. Would the daughters of Zelophehad illustrate the idea of being heavenly minded and typify that element in the assembly that appreciates the inheritance?
J.T. The inheritance enters into what we are talking about, the Spirit of God being the earnest of it.
Ques. In rejecting the expression, 'the resurrection platform', have you in mind that true assembly relationships are in ascension, and that we should always have that as our objective?
J.T. Well, that is good. I would say that. The Lord went to the right hand of God, which is a definite matter, and He can be there whenever He wishes to be and operate from there. He does operate from there, in fact He has gone beyond all heavens, we are told, and that should be in our minds too. Therefore the Lord is in liberty, and we cannot limit the Lord; we cannot limit a divine Person. It is a question of what He pleases to do, because it is a question of God at all times.
{97}
J.S.E. Would "the things that are above" which we seek be connected with the treasures of wisdom and knowledge?
J.T. Well, they are *morally* above. That is, they are above what this world is going on with. The assembly's position is heaven, and the thought is to bring the saints, as forming it, into a spiritual state of things. The teaching of Colossians is to enable us to take heavenly ground, that is to take ground above what the world is going on with.
J.H.T. Would the expression, "three men going up to God" (@1 Samuel 10: 3), cover what you are saying? They had one purpose before them. They were heavenly minded.
J.T. Quite so. That links us on with our ministry meetings for it is a question of God.
Ques. Does the expression "your life is hid with the Christ in God" amplify what you have said?
J.T. Well, I think it is in keeping with the idea of Colossians, where it says, "in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge". It is the idea of a covering, I think; we are not letting the natural mind into it. It might be linked on with the headship of Christ in 1 Corinthians where we have the idea of a covering, but the word *hid* would mean that they are not exposed to the devil. That implies that the Spirit is here and that there is power to conceal things and to maintain the idea of mystery, which is a great matter as regards the assembly and this dispensation.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the assembly's place in relation to the expanse? Is the assembly's true place above the expanse?
J.T. He has "raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus". The word *heavenlies* is in Ephesians, of course, and it is a question really of what is meant, and whether that is to be regarded as in the expanse.
{98}
J.S.E. Does the word *above* in our chapter help in that connection?
J.T. Well, I think that is right. The word 'above' is in keeping with what we have often spoken of: "Jerusalem above, ... which is our mother". It is the moral elevation she is in. The word used in ordinary worldly affairs means that some people are high up and the like. In the things of God we have the same idea, only this involves our having the Spirit, and the position that Christ has literally. Christ has literally gone above, He is above all principality and power; He has gone beyond all the heavens. The thought of above is greatly intensified when we think of Christ personally. Well, then, the thing is for us to apply the idea of being above to ourselves, and then to the assembly's position, because her position is to be the nearest to Deity of all the families. Thus we get, for instance, "the Spirit and the bride say, Come", which shows how near the bride or the assembly is to divine Persons, or to the Deity; how near her place is.
J.S.E. You have referred to the invasion by the enemy; are we let into the secret in this chapter that there are things that are *uncapturable* on that line, things that remain intact?
J.T. I would say that. The primal thought of the assembly is that it is uncapturable. That is, "Hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it", @Matthew 16: 18. So it is that John's epistle would show in an abstract sense that as Christ is, so are we in this world, without going up. It shows the application of power in us, in an abstract sense.
Eu.R. Do the upper springs given to Achsah involve power in our souls enabling us to reach these higher levels?
J.T. Quite so. They are the upper and the nether springs. There may be a comparison with what we call the expanse in @Genesis 1: 7, because there the waters also are in two places. The upper springs would be the
{99}
Spirit viewed as in relation to heavenly things in Ephesians, but I suppose the nether would be Romans and perhaps Colossians too. It would be what the Spirit is, in operation down here, in view of our ascension and our part in the assembly.
Now to come on to the idea of the new man and the old man. These two thoughts are in the verses beginning with verse 5 down to the end of verse 11.
"Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, vile passions, evil lust, and unbridled desire, which is idolatry. On account of which things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. In which *ye* also once walked when ye lived in these things. But now, put off, ye also, all these things, wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, vile language out of your mouth. Do not lie to one another, having put off the old man with his deeds, and having put on the new, renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him; wherein there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is everything, and in all". So that it is a question now of the new man. It is not so much the question of *above*, of heavenly places, but the new man; that is, another man replacing what is here. There is only one; one of the new and one of the old; and it is of great importance because we are dealing now with a world that is either Canaanitish or Egyptian. The Canaanitish side is that which might invade the truth of Christianity. The Egyptian refers to the world of the flesh. The idea of what is Egyptian, as entering into the old man, is to be noted. It shows what nature may be, what the earth may be or the world may be, in a general sense, as for instance, in Asia or in Africa, where neither Judaism nor Christianity has had any influence. It is just the naked thought of the world, of the flesh in man, without any amelioration. On the other hand, if we are dealing with what we may speak of now as Canaanitish things, it is important
{100}
to note that the "old man" enters into these also; there would be then an allusion to what Christianity has done, what Judaism has done too in a public sense, but especially Christianity. It is Christendom, the world as it is, but as affected by the truth of Christianity, yet the old man is in it, as much as in the Egyptian, and it is specially the truth of Colossians and Ephesians, indeed the truth generally, that delivers us from these features of the old man.
L.E.S. Would that be in Abraham's mind in @Genesis 24 when he told his servant not to take a wife for his son of the daughters of the Canaanites?
J.T. Quite so. They would, I think, represent the old man, but when we come to the typical teaching, it is not in Genesis, but in Leviticus. The typical idea of the old and new man is in Leviticus, and Leviticus is meant for Christianity. It is meant for us, because "whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning". It is for us to see whether we are dealing with Canaanitish things, that is to say, things now that they are affected by Christianity, or whether we are dealing with Egyptian things, which would just mean nature as it is without any trammels, without anything to control it. We have both things to deal with.
Ques. Would it be right to say that the first group of evil things are those which are indigenous to a fallen nature, and the second group are habits which might be acquired by us?
J.T. The Canaanitish side and the Egyptian side are very near to each other now, if we take the world as it is in Britain or in America. In America, specially, it is as much Egyptian as it is Canaanitish. In Britain it may be more Canaanitish, because of the influence of Christianity, but there is not much to say as to the actual features in either group. The worst things, I would say, are the things that are found in Asia, the terrible wickedness of Asia. There polygamy is unrestrained and all that goes with it, and the ancient things have been carried
{101}
down, you might say, from the time of the flood. Man unrestrained is there. Of course, that enables us to see what we were delivered out of, because Christianity delivers out of both, whether it be Canaanitish or Egyptian. It is a question of the gospel. Thus when we come to the 12th verse it says, "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any should have a complaint against any; even as the Christ has forgiven you, so also do *ye*. And to all these add love, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of Christ preside in your hearts, to which also ye have been called in one body, and be thankful". That is the new man applied fully. The word *new* in the previous passage, according to the footnote, means *young or fresh*. That is to say, what is fresh in the youth, and those who recognise the Spirit and walk in the Spirit, there is peculiar freshness in what God has thus wrought in young people. Of course, an old person is in it too, but the idea of youthfulness is to be noted, and it is very precious that it can be taken account of in Christianity, in the new man.
P.H.H. Do you think Elisha taking up the mantle of Elijah, that is the man who is above, and using the mantle, would illustrate these thoughts?
J.T. Very good. He discarded the other, you mean?
P.H.H. Yes, it says, "he took hold of his own garments and rent them ... And he took up the mantle of Elijah which fell from him", as if to convey that the mantle remained here.
J.T. Quite so. Hence the position in Elisha is carried on thus. It is, you might say, the new man. He has come down, in that sense, from above and all these qualities described in verses 12 to 15 belong to that realm.
P.L. So that the traits of the heavenly man are now to be maintained in unity in a corporate way amongst us?
{102}
J.T. Quite so; that is good, especially if we can get them in young people, young men and young women. How great a thing it is to get them, for they are very, very rare!
Eu.R. Is that what is involved in the expression, "Christ is everything, and in all"?
J.T. Just so. The word there refers to what He is to us, in the new man. If you speak to a young Christian about Christ, well, he might say, Christ is everything to me, and if it is shown that He is everything, and no other thought is in the mind, that is an immense thing. It is a glorious thing to get a young person to whom Christ is everything, and in all. So we have here in verse 10, "having put on the new, renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him"; (That, of course, would be Christ),. "wherein there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is everything, and in all". Well, that must be in persons; that is to say these qualities of Christ, known down here, must be in persons.
W.H. Then the persons themselves are addressed, are they not, in verse 12, in the same language by which Christ was addressed, "the elect of God, holy and beloved"?
J.T. Just so. The sequential thought thus comes in that verse, "Put on therefore as the elect of God". The doctrine of the new man, or what we may call the abstract thought of it, is more in the previous paragraph, but from the twelfth verse down to the fifteenth verse we have the actual concrete thought that the apostle is aiming at. It is that these precious traits should be seen in the young and in all of us.
L.O.L. Does the Lord anticipate this new man in @Luke 10 in relation to the man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho? This man was stripped of his garment and left by the side of the road, but the Lord typically comes in and supplies him with everything he
{103}
needs on the line of compassion, long-suffering, and meekness.
J.T. Well, I would say that. There can be no doubt that the Lord had in mind Mary and Martha, especially that Mary had "chosen the good part", as it says in that chapter. All these features of the new man would indicate one who is chosen, corresponding to Christ, "the elect of God". It is a question of choice and what we are taking on, both as to garb and all else. It says of Mary, "the good part, the which shall not be taken from her".
Ques. Does the fact that *full knowledge* is the first feature of the new man mentioned here, bear on the epistle particularly, and link with *the good part* as seen in Mary? I was thinking of human learning and the necessity of setting aside philosophy and vain deceit and so on.
J.T. Quite so. The doctrine or abstract thought of it, as we were saying, is in that passage you quoted, "having put on the new, renewed into full knowledge", the word "putting on" here would be our profession, I would think; what we accept as truth in Christianity. But then the next paragraph, verses 12 - 15, gives the concrete thought. "Put on therefore", it is a sequence to what he has been saying. We are regarded as the *elect of God*, which is not in the previous passage, as far as I see, "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion", and so on. The putting on is not simply abstract, it is practical, it is concrete, so that one puts on these things, and learns to put them on. It may take years to learn to put them on fully, but you have that in your mind, for that is the divine idea. Then the *elect of God*, being applied to Christ Himself, is abstractly applied to us too, so that we are spoken of thus. The saints are the elect of God, everyone of us is elected and has that character in the mind of God.
P.L. Is it what is distinctive in incorruptibility in the presence of all that is so corrupted?
{104}
J.T. Quite so. What God has for Himself, in His own elect.
A.J.M. Would the boy Samuel illustrate this? It says, "Samuel ministered before Jehovah ... girded with a linen ephod. And his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year", @1 Samuel 2: 18, 19. Has that any bearing on the matter?
J.T. I think it has, because Jehovah made him a confidant as to His concern about the condition of the priesthood. It is a very remarkable thing that Jehovah should take on a young boy like that, for he was still very young, as a confidant to tell him about the old priest and especially his sons who were corrupt. The *old man* was there in those sons.
T. There are some among us who have some reservations regarding young ones being received into fellowship when only round about the age of twelve. Could you tell us anything about that?
J.T. I have no difficulty about young people coming into fellowship at that age. It is a question of where they are in their souls. I am always encouraged in the fact that the Lord was twelve when He said, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?", @Luke 2: 49. That is intended to be a model for us as to youth.
W.C. Do you think that is about the right age?
J.T. I think it is recognised as being used of the Lord Himself.
Ques. Would we have a concrete example of "the new man" in the little maid in the household of Naaman? Even in captivity she refused to be held back.
J.T. Well, Joseph is a very good example of a young man, an incorruptible young man. He would not hearken to the seductive person that was seeking to corrupt him.
L.H. Would verses 12 to 17 of our chapter represent what is substantial in the saints in line with what was suggested at the beginning?
{105}
J.T. That is right. The new man is one idea involving all these qualities.
Ques. Referring to the expression "the image of him that has created him", is it that the Lord puts His own impress on the saints?
J.T. It is a remarkable thing that the creative thought is here. As Adam was created, so here it is a creation, and that brings us into a very important line of thought.
A.G. Would "bowels of compassion" refer to what is inward and represent a normal spiritual function, valuable, in days of increasing difficulty, amongst the saints?
J.T. Quite so. It is needed just now, there is so much illness and suffering of every kind. Hence the need for putting on what we get in verse 14, "to all these add love, which is the bond of perfectness". If we want to get the thing perfectly, love is the bond of it.
C.O.B. Is, "the peace of Christ" the ultimate, as coming after love?
J.T. Quite. It is an additional thought, I would say. "And let the peace of Christ preside in your hearts". It is remarkable that it has its full place in the heart, "the peace of Christ preside in your hearts, to which also ye have been called in one body, and be thankful". The full thought of the assembly is in mind, as to the presiding power of the peace of Christ being there.
Rem. There does not seem to be any limit to the idea of forgiving one another.
J.T. Quite so. Because is according to the measure of Christ.
{106}
SPIRITUAL FORMATION FOR ASSEMBLY SERVICE (6)
@Colossians 3: 18 - 25; @Colossians 4: 1 - 18
J.T. The personal side, a feature of Christianity, is peculiarly in mind in these sections of this epistle. There can be no doubt that these meetings that we have had are intended to strengthen the personal side, especially as to those who, in their formation, are calculated to influence the position of the testimony and the saints in it. The Lord would put forward such as are faithful and, in their faithfulness, are influential for good. This reaches down, not to the full thought of the family, as we get it in Ephesians, but to certain relationships, such as wives and husbands and children. John has liberty to speak of certain persons in a dignified way, on account of their status as amongst the saints. Thus he speaks of "the elect lady and her children" (@2 John 1), and Luke also refers to Theophilus on the same principle. There can be no doubt that these meetings, such as we are having now, and also what are called week-end fellowship meetings, are intended to promote personal acquaintance and characteristics and influence, so as to bind the position. In taking up Paul, it is pretty clear that the Lord intended to make him specially distinguished on the personal line as one to be trusted. Paul therefore takes on that in the way he speaks here of certain ones in this closing chapter, such as Tychicus, of whom he says that he is "the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-bondman in the Lord". He evidently was linked up personally with Paul whom, he says, "I have sent to you for this very purpose, that he might know your state, and that he might encourage your hearts". Then again, Onesimus is linked on similarly and, particularly, Epaphras who is spoken of as combating and as one of the Colossians. All this tends to promote the idea of a community, as it were, in us all and thus promotes confidence.
{107}
P.L. Are these a little like the golden taches of the tabernacle?
J.T. Just so, for the tabernacle is in view here. The whole position is in mind that it might be kept, as it were, in a tidy way, as having a finished character. Like the hem of the garment of the high priest, it is a finished idea.
P.L. "This one and that one was born in her; and the Most High himself shall establish her", @Psalm 87: 5.
E.G. "Rejoicing and seeing your order". Would that be connected with the taches?
J.T. Just so. "And the firmness of your faith in Christ". He puts that in early in the letter, in view of what he was about to open up for them; that is, the idea of the service of God. It is important that the order in which they did things should be kept in the front.
W.H. Is there anything very important in the fact that Paul desired the saints at Colosse and elsewhere to be constantly maintained in touch with what he was doing and ministering?
J.T. I thought of that, in mentioning this side of the subject. So we have the expression, "I Paul", and also the way he would inform them of himself, as he says, "Tychicus ... will make known to you all that concerns me". The leading servants are of prime importance in heaven, and although what is going on there is not visible to us, it is to be understood through our communion. He speaks in Romans of certain things by "the love of the Spirit", which is a real thing and enters into what we are saying. It is not only the love of the Father and the Son, but the love of the Spirit, and that would bear on what we are saying as to Paul. He enlarges on the same thing in Romans, as taking up the basic position, but here in Colossians it is the thought of finishing and binding up things, so that they should not hang loosely or give place to the devil. For instance, if the relations of a wife with her husband were estranged, the devil would easily get a footing, and talk would be spread abroad to disintegrate the whole position. We must therefore not
{108}
give place to the devil, as is done if things are held loosely by us. So it says, "Wives, be subject to your husbands" (the word "own", apparently, is not there as it is elsewhere), "be subject to your husbands (or to husbands), as is fitting in the Lord". The stress would be on wives and husbands; for them it says, "Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them". That an apostle should condescend to such suggestions and admonitions is worthy of note.
F.C.H. Does the expression "one another", just preceding this, lay the basis for these specific things?
J.T. Quite so. When you have references to wives and husbands, then the possibility of bitterness against the wives is remarkable. It would bear on what we have remarked, from time to time, as to the attack and how Satan may attack us through the relations between husbands and wives.
J.S.E. Why is the weaker put first? Does it show us how we can, in our several relationships, be on the line of prevention of further invasion?
J.T. Yes. 'Further invasion' is an expression that may well be used, because the expanse is wide and varied and affords conditions for the devil. The expanse in @Genesis 1 is not said to be good, by the Creator, because it affords so much scope for the enemy for invasions and for attacks. At the same time it is never given up and it is used. The idea of the heavens, I suppose, would come down to the lowest point, extending to the earth itself. The expanse was evidently added after the primal creation, as if God would use it in His ways for His operations, and yet it was not included in what He designed originally. I mean to say, He does not say that it is good, although it affords these things that we are speaking of and we have to keep it in mind.
L.O.L. In @Psalm 36 we have "Jehovah, thy loving-kindness is in the heavens, and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. Thy righteousness is like the high mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: thou,
{109}
Jehovah, preservest man and beast. How precious is thy loving-kindness, O God! So the sons of men take refuge under the shadow bf thy wings". Does that refer to the heavens and what is available in them?
J.T. Yes. It shows the extent of the expanse and how varied are the things that may be found in it. But then God is in it for it is His creation. In fact, it is among the many things that are called good in general, but it is not specifically called good, and therefore it seems that the enemy has a peculiar way of attacking it and that God has allowed that.
P.H.H. Would the reference to the anointing in @Psalm 133 be a kind of counterpart of that; the brethren dwelling together in unity being like the precious ointment, descending finally to the skirts of Aaron's garments? Would that be a preservative against the inroads in the expanse?
J.T. I would think that. There is variety of space, because the word *expanse* means that it is a large matter, and evidently Satan took advantage of it, gradually getting into the position of government.
A.N.W. Can your remarks, in that connection, be extended to the relationship of children to their parents, as well as to wives and husbands?
J.T. Well, we have "Wives be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord". That is to say, it is to be just what is fitting or suitable to a woman in the relation of a wife. It is clear that polygamy is not in mind in these letters; it is the primal thought of God in the relation of man and woman, that is, as husband and wife. So it goes on, "Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them". Why that should be added is a matter for consideration. "Be not bitter against them". Why should there be alienation to that extent? We can see that alienation might happen, and be even permanent, where the bitterness of a husband towards a wife is in any way allowed.
{110}
P.L. If the first tie is weakened between husband and wife, is the next tie, between children and parents, weakened?
J.T. That would be the result, I suppose. If relations become dislocated the condition of the house would be somewhat marred. But then it says, "Husbands, love your wives and be not bitter against them". And then, "Children, obey your parents in all things". Whatever there may be as to the children, the word "obey" is clearly imperative, "for this is well-pleasing in the Lord". Then, "Fathers, do not vex your children", showing that we are on somewhat lower ground than in Ephesians, although on higher ground than in Romans. No reference is made to the family in Romans, properly; whereas it is here, and also in Ephesians. "Do not vex your children, to the end that they be not disheartened". How the apostolic mind, moved by love, extends down even to the feelings of a young child in a family and the possibility of such a one being disheartened by the attitude of his father!
A.H.G. Why is there no reference to the family in Romans, and why is it introduced here and in Ephesians?
J.T. I think it is because Romans was not intended to go the full length of formation according to Christ. It is just to deal with the fundamentals of Christianity, making a basis for the gospel, although, as we know, it leads on to the assembly.
P.L. Is every element here, down to bondmen as well as the children, mobilised, so to speak, to resist the invasion?
J.T. That is the idea, I would say, because we are where an invasion is possible at any time. Now, of course, it is greatly accentuated in the added modern thought of associations and the lawless combinations of men. Many of these are lawless and utterly unfair, because there is a robbing of men's rights, as in this country. The principle of the Magna Carta involving liberty is just thrown to
{111}
the winds by certain combinations of men. All these tend to give the enemy a place, and invade even the Lord's people. Some of the Lord's people have given way to these combinations of men, for supposed personal advantage.
E.A.E. Why are the wives addressed before the husbands, the children before the parents, and the bondmen before the masters?
J.T. I think it is that Satan finds his point of attack in the weaker elements. The strong elements, therefore, ought to see to that, and not afford opportunity for the attack. Thus it is for the husband to love the wife, who is the weaker, and the father not to provoke the children, who are weaker than the father, because if the children are disheartened, they are exposed to the devil.
Ques. Is it interesting that Paul in his first movement into Europe at Philippi secures these right conditions in the jailor's house? It says he "rejoiced with all his house, having believed in God", @Acts 16: 34. It is as though you have the firstfruits of this great thought there.
J.T. It is remarkable that a jail should be the place of the disclosure of divine consideration for men, and that in the position there should be the thought of the house. It is remarkable that the house, where the wife and children reside, should be spoken of in the jail. So the word is, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house". The use of the pronouns *thou* and *thy* would arouse the family idea in the jailor, who is the person in question. The facts show that he was a hard man, unduly hard as a jailor; but then he had a house, and how would the hardness of the jailor comport with the affections that belonged to his house? The great thought was that the gospel could meet that situation, and so what he saw there in the jail would bring out what Colossians promotes. It says, "Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising God with singing". They were creating an attractive condition so that the gospel was commended in the jail, but commended in
{112}
relation to the house, for the jailor's house would be taken care of in the gospel.
W.S.S. Is it your thought that all these relationships are to be so held that the truth opened up to us in Colossians finds expression in persons who are found in these relationships?
J.T. That is just the thought and links with what we had this morning. It is a question of the new man, which bears on woman as well as man, and on children too. It is what is new and fresh, and it is to work out in these relations. Hence the apostle is led to move from the passages we had this morning to verse 18, which deals with wives and husbands, children and fathers, and then servants. It is in view of all these relations being available for the promotion of the new man. The new man in the wife, and the new man in the husband, and the new man in the children and in the fathers, and then the new man in the bondmen. That the idea of the new man should be in the bondmen, of course, should certainly bear on, what we have been remarking as to the lawless combinations of men. Trade unionism is utterly foreign to the idea of the new man.
A.Mh. Would Boaz illustrate this? "And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem; and he said to the reapers, Jehovah be with you! And they said to him, Jehovah bless thee!". Would that be on the level of this exhortation?
J.T. Very good. It shows the happy relations existing between his reapers and himself, and that Ruth should be brought into these circumstances. It is all to promote the idea of the new man, and the new man is a creation. It is, as it were, God doing things over again, but in men; under the heading of the word "man".
Ques. You have spoken of trade unionism. Would verses 23 and 24 be over against the so-called advantages? "Whatsoever ye do, labour at it heartily, as doing it to the Lord, and not to men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance". Is
{113}
that not better than anything that could be gained, or thought to be gained, by the associations of men, and would it not be an incentive to stand aside?
J.T. Quite so. "Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance; ye serve the Lord Christ". The inheritance is on a higher level, of course, for the Spirit is the earnest of it.
Ques. I wondered whether it linked on with what you were saying as to the truth that is opened up in Colossians; whether the inheritance is in view and ability to go into it promoted?
J.T. Just so. It is a question of *who* is to go into it; that is to say, it is the idea of the new man.
Ques. Had not Paul given a right lead in the matter of masters and servants when he sent Onesimus back to his master, Philemon, in righteousness?
J.T. It is remarkable that he comes in here, and he is included in those that are spoken of favourably. It says, "Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you". He was one of the Colossians but he was a convert of Paul's, and Paul's treatment of him is a guide for us as to persons in those circumstances. It shows how Christianity lifts us up from any spirit of slavery which might invade the family and the home. Circumstances of slavery might invade the family, not only in the wife, but in the servants, and slavery is not suitable for Christianity. Therefore the reference to Onesimus would lift Onesimus from the position of a slave into that of a "brother beloved", which is an exalted thought.
E.B. When the Lord Jesus came down from the mount, the enemy brought forward a child completely under his power, as much as to nullify, if he could, what had marked the scene on the mountain. Is it not often the case that domestic circumstances tend to mar or detract from what we may have enjoyed in a spiritual sense?
{114}
J.T. Very good. No doubt the brethren are all conversant with the incident. Matthew records it as a case of lunacy in this child. The Lord, in a remarkable way, avoids hastening the matter of the recovery of the child and He delays to ask the father about him and how the thing happened and so on. It would look, from the facts, as if the father was a real father, and he says to the Lord, "If thou couldst do anything ... help us". But then the Lord does not hasten to meet the situation. He saw the crowd coming, running up, but the crowd will not help the family, nor the condition of lunacy in the family, and so the Lord proceeds to cure the child and He commands the demon to go out of him. Thus the Lord would meet these family conditions. There is nothing said about the mother and what she may have thought of it. It is the father only, but, as we have said, it would seem as if he were a real father, and he besought the Lord for his child. The disciples could not help and that is another matter to be thought of. The father tells the Lord that he brought his son to the disciples and they could not help, and the Lord attributes the want of faith to everybody. It was not only the crowd but the disciples too, but then He meets the situation Himself. We can thus count on the Lord to come in in all these circumstances. It is a question of prayer, so that the man says, "If thou couldst do anything ... help us". The Lord says to him, "The 'if thou couldst' is 'if thou couldst believe'", that is to say, it brings in the thought of faith in such circumstances.
Ques. Would we have a contrast in Deborah? The conditions were rather unsettled, but the household conditions there were right. She is spoken of as "the wife of Lapidoth". The blessing then, so to speak, went right through the tribes.
J.T. Yes. She did not use her office, as we may call it, of a prophetess to exalt herself; she retained her place as a wife. The name Lapidoth, I suppose, would show that light was there. This epistle to Colossians is to give
{115}
light both to husbands and wives. Deborah behaved well, both in regard of her husband and also in regard of Barak, although she is not commended in @Hebrews 11 amongst the persons who had faith, as Barak is.
A.S. Why does the apostle refer to the Lord so much in this part of the epistle: it is more "Christ" in the earlier part?
J.T. Well, no doubt it is a question of the authority of the Lord that enters into this hortatory part. So we have, as you say, the Lord used more frequently than Christ. It is just to bring out, I suppose, the authority that was needed. When it becomes a possibility of bitterness in the husband or insubjection in the wife, then we have to bring the Lord in.
H.F.N. Might we have some help in regard of these distinctive servants such as Tychicus, Onesimus and Epaphras?
J.T. Leading up to those, we already alluded to bondmen or slaves. Then we have masters, in the beginning of chapter 4, "Masters, give to bondmen what is just and fair", which is a very important matter. Although there are fewer masters now and fewer servants than there used to be, yet the idea of fairness comes into these relations. "Give to bondmen what is just and fair, knowing that, ye also have a Master in the heavens". That brings up the position of the Lord as our Master, as it is said. "I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher", @John 13: 14. We have to look to Him for the fairness that is suitable between master and bondmen or servant. The Lord is the model in all these cases; but Paul helps us in what he teaches, and it is very striking how he can descend to the smallest things, family relationships and bondmen and so forth.
Ques. Is it significant that he brings in the thought of government? "For he that does a wrong shall receive the wrong he has done, and there is no respect of persons". Does it not bear particularly on this situation?
{116}
J.T. Just so. "No respect of persons", for God is God and man is man, and we have to do with the Lord Christ. Then the thought of prayer is the next important matter. "Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving; praying at the same time for us also, that God may open to us a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ". So that it is not only what prayers may be, or should be, for the servants, but the truth that they actually minister and whether they go in for the full thought, that is to say, the mystery. He says, "Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving; praying at the same time for us also, that God may open to us a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ, on account of which also I am bound, to the end that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak". We have already noted that his enemy spoke of the contemptibleness of his speech, but then he was concerned that he should speak as he ought to speak. It is not simply his power of speaking as to what men might think of it, but "as I ought to speak", he says; that is to say, what the subject required.
P.H.H. Is the idea that even in the speaking of one like Paul, the enemy might get no advantage, so that the ministry is not to be beclouded or the level of it lowered?
J.T. It is *how* he ought to speak. No doubt he would assume that he would know himself how he ought to speak, but it is thrown out in this general way and it is for each of us. It raises the question as to whether we are given over to the thought of the mystery in our ministry. How many of us are? Mr. Stoney, as far as I have heard of him, gave himself, in a great measure, over to the truth of the mystery; so that it should be known. But the question is whether that subject by itself is much treated of now; "the mystery of Christ".
P.H.H. Do you mean you think it should be?
J.T. I think it should be, because we can never really arrive at the full thought except in the sense of the mystery.
{117}
W.S.S. Should it not be the background of all speaking; whether ministry among the saints or the ministry of the glad tidings?
J.T. Well, it says here that they were to persevere, but he adds as to himself, "praying at the same time for us also". One is thankful that one does not feel the need of asking the brethren to pray, because the volume of prayer that goes up for any one who is in trouble is wonderful. It is due to the brethren that it should be said that the volume of prayer is wonderful and it is answered, too, for the answers have come. But why should Paul have to ask for it? That is something to think of. In certain circumstances a brother may be neglected. Why should it be? Did Paul's prison condition cause indifference or weakness in the saints as to him? It is well worth inquiring why he asked so often for prayer. He does in Ephesians, and here, and elsewhere. He stresses the thought here of persevering in prayer and that it should be with watching and thanksgiving, but he adds, "praying at the same time for us also". But then, why? Because, he says, "that God may open to us a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ". He enjoins on Timotheus to preach the word, in his second letter to him, and he says here "that God may open to us a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ, on account of which also I am bound, to the end that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak".
A.Mh. Do you think that this exhortation to persevere in prayer, following the exhortation in the latter part of chapter 3 and chapter 4, might be carried forward into our homes so that prayers for the divine interests and the Lord's servants would have a great place with us?
J.T. I am glad you mention that because of what we have often referred to lately; that is, the prayers for the gospel in the households of the brethren, and how the custom is teaching the children. They are being brought up with the thought that there should be prayer
{118}
and if they have households, in time they will have prayer in them. Prayer for the gospel on the Lord's day, I think, is of very great importance, because it elevates the character of the preaching and leads to the thought of the truth of the assembly, and the young people coming into the assembly, involving the mystery. So I think it links on with what we are saying. Paul is concerned that they should pray in regard of the mystery that a door should be opened to him. He says, "that God may open to us a door of the word", which is a remarkable form of expression, "a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ, on account of which also I am bound, to the end that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak". It is all in view of the preachers having a higher level of ministry where not many unconverted people are present, but where the children of the saints are sure to be. The children should thus be brought up to understand this, and to acquire the habit of prayer for the gospel, for the testimony; not only for ordinary circumstances, but for the testimony.
G.H.M. You emphasise very much this prayer before the gospel. Would it not be an advantage before a reading meeting or other meetings?
J.T. Well, I am only speaking of what is. As far as I know, the households of the brethren generally are employed in prayer immediately before the gospel on Lord's day evenings, and I believe it is pleasing to the Lord, pleasing to heaven. The question now is whether we rise to the full level of the testimony, because here it is a question, not of the gospel, but of the mystery. The brethren, and even the little ones, may bring the thought in, because if there are young ones who are in the family and they are actually in fellowship (or even if they are not, if they are known to be Christians) they should be made accustomed to prayer for the testimony.
Ques. Is it not striking that in the opening of @Acts 21, where Paul departed, it says, "all of them accompanying us, with wives and children"? Is that
{119}
not a beautiful and touching expression of the thought of the households in relation to Paul? They all went down to the ship.
J.T. That is a very touching passage, showing how the young ones are brought into the thing. In fact we have already had it, how the children would make inquiry why the twelve stones taken out of the Jordan were set up in Canaan. They were supposed to be in Canaan, and the children in principle ought to be in Canaan and have understanding and be able to inquire as to the twelve stones, which would mean the unity of the brethren. Why is it needed that the brethren should be united? Children should be brought up in the thought that the brethren should be united.
Rem. At the entering of the testimony into Europe, it says, "we went outside the gate by the river, where it was the custom for prayer to be", @Acts 16: 13.
J.T. That has often been commented upon, and very profitably too. It was a question of Europe, and God pointing westwards, but pointing to the fact that Europe was in His mind and that it was to be the sphere of the truth as to the assembly. The governmental condition in Asia does not afford conditions really for the truth of the mystery, for the truth of the assembly.
A.H.G. You spoke of the attack by way of speaking. Would the counteracting influence be in this speaking?
J.T. Quite so. I think that is right.
L.E.S. Could we have a word on the end?
J.T. It is only in a cursory way we can refer to it. We have spoken of Onesimus; then we have Aristarchus who is said to be a fellow-captive, and then Mark, Barnabas¬ cousin, is spoken of. It says of him, "concerning whom ye have received orders (if he come to you, receive him)". It would look as if there was a doubt about Mark, and the apostle is taking account of that. Then he says, "These are the only fellow-workers for the kingdom of God who have been a consolation to me". It shows that he was thinking of himself and the need of
{120}
consolation in his fellow-servants, which is perhaps not always thought of. Then Epaphras has a peculiar place. We have already alluded to him in the whole epistle, as a man intended to dominate the position because of what he was, and how he was concerned about the Colossians. Now he is combating for them as it says, "salutes you, always combating earnestly for you in prayers, to the end that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God". That is a very fine phrase, "perfect and complete in all the will of God". It is not simply in the mystery, or in the gospel, but in "all the will of God" and Satan was against that.
C.C. Would that involve the will of God according to @Ephesians 1, "the good pleasure of his will", "the mystery of his will", and "the counsel of his own will"?
J.T. Quite so. It is a strong reference to the thought of "the will of God".
Ques. What would be the difference between Paul's reference to Epaphras in chapter 1 verse 7, "faithful minister of Christ for you", and in this chapter, "the bondman of Christ Jesus"?
J.T. Well, the word "bondman" is striking here, and is just in keeping with what we are saying; he is a fellow-bondman. We hardly know, in our time, what bondmanship is in the sense in which it is spoken of here, for Paul himself was a prisoner, a bondman. The book of Revelation is in that setting, which is also important. The Lord received it from God and it was evidently late in the history of the testimony that He received it. Then He sent and signified it by His bondman John, "who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw". So that the idea of bondmanship came in then, and it is, perhaps, little known now, although there must be something to correspond with it in what some may be suffering in view of the testimony.
Then reference is made to a brother called Nymphas, "and the assembly which is in his house", which is
{121}
another thing not to pass by. Then it goes on, "And when the letter" (I would take that to be this letter), "has been read among you, cause that it be read also in the assembly of Laodiceans". That shows that Laodicea was still intact, but it shows also that letters to assemblies may be interchanged, but at the same time the letter should be intact. The letter should be just what it was as written to Colosse, or as written to Laodicea, because there were two letters. He says, "When the letter has been read among you, cause that it be read also in the assembly of Laodiceans, and that ye also read that from Laodicea", as if there was interchange between the local assemblies, because they were near to each other; they were adjacent to each other, but yet they were not viewed as one assembly. There has been a need in late years to enlarge assemblies, adding gatherings that are adjacent as recognising that they really belong to the local position and should rightly move together in local government and administration. But then we have here an indication, I think, that ought to be in mind, that we must not extend thus too far. The question is whether the position is local. The local position should never be set aside; it begins in Corinth and it runs through. So here, the local position of Colosse is not interfered with by the local position of Laodicea. Colosse was not one of the assemblies that is mentioned in the book of Revelation, yet Laodicea is, and therefore it has a distinct place as a local assembly.
Eu.R. Would the interchange of letters tend to the spiritual compactness of the universal situation so that the enemy is kept out?
J.T. Just so. The word *compactness* is good and it enters into this epistle.
Then there is the word to Archippus; "Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it". That is, a brother may not be fulfilling his ministry (which may have a voice to some of us), for there may be a retirement to an easy
{122}
position, to a watering-place, or the like. We are to be alive as to the service that may be committed to us, and to see that we fulfil it, because Paul uses the word "fulfil". It was given to him "to complete the word of God"; it is the idea of completing a ministry. If the Lord has given us something to do, let us see that the thing is done, and not simply to take it easy because we are old, but to see that the thing is done. Carry on when you can and as long as you can.
A.Mh. Would you say that his ministry would not be only local but would go outside what is local? "Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received".
J.T. Whatever it was, he ought to know what he received from the Lord, and to see that it was fulfilled. I believe that is the point and it is a feature in this epistle. Paul says that he *completed* the word of God. He did not leave it open; the thing was finished. We have already alluded to the hem of the garment in @Psalm 133, which I believe conveys the idea of a finished condition.
{123}
THE SETTING OF THE LORD'S SUPPER
@1 Corinthians 11: 1 - 3; @Psalm 17 - 34
J.T. It is thought well to call attention to the verses relating to headship at the beginning of the chapter, with a view to speaking of the Lord's supper. The local position is specially in mind in the epistle, although the universal thought is in mind too in the verse "If any one think to be contentious, *we* have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God". It implies that contention is likely to occur and to hinder the understanding of the truth. So it opens with "the assembly of God which is in Corinth", and then certain things are spoken of in an abstract way. The abstract thought should be in mind, in view of the concrete truth set out, specially as to the Lord's supper. Clearly the local position is stressed, and then all that goes with the local position from the divine side in an abstract way, as if everything was there from the divine side, and then the hortatory part begins in verse 10. It is as if the apostle were specially concerned to deal with local conditions, with what might appear among them to cause obstruction to the truth. So that the abstract thought is in mind, beginning at verse 4, "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge, (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,) so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall also confirm you to the end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord". We are reminded, at the outset, that everything is there from the divine side in view of what might cause obstruction that might cause darkness. So that everything should be clear in relation to the great subjects to be treated of, specially the Lord's supper.
{124}
Ques. Is there any distinguishing thought between the expressions, the Lord's supper, and the breaking of bread?
J.T. As the words indicate, the Lord's supper is a term that covers the whole institution, the whole matter of the bread and the cup. The Lord evidently intended that there should be a designation covering the whole institution of the Lord's supper. It would be foreseen that it would occasion much controversy, which it has, and the Lord has been pleased to give a term to cover it. It is seen in verse 20 of chapter 11, "the Lord's supper". That is the formal thought of the Spirit of God which evidently should cover the matter from the outset to the end. As in Judaism the Passover had a distinguishing feature, so the Lord's supper has a distinguishing feature in regard to the present dispensation.
Ques. Were you going to say something more as to headship as making way for this section dealing with the Lord's supper?
J.T. It was needful that if any directions were given in regard of this great subject of headship they should be observed and not be treated lightly. Paul makes a point of the fact that they kept his directions, and then he goes on as to headship, "But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God". Clearly, if this important matter is to be understood, we have to discard contention. The Scriptures and the truth generally, are not to be understood through contention, but through subjection.
W.H. So would the feature of headship be the setting aside of all contention?
J.T. That is what I thought. How can God be Head except as we recognise that we are to be subject? How can we expect to reach the truth if we begin with the idea of contention? Some of us are very prone to be contentious and therefore the apostle says, "If any one think to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor
{125}
the assemblies of God". It does not say the *assembly*, but the *assemblies*; meaning that they were all set up on the principle of order. That is from the divine side, and order requires subjection, otherwise we may think as we wish, each having his own thoughts.
P.L. It is the Teacher and His disciples, in Mark's gospel, as we approach the Lord's supper, @Mark 14: 14.
J.T. Quite so. As the subject is approached in the three synoptic gospels the twelve are always in mind, meaning the administrative company. Luke says the Lord "placed himself at table, and the twelve apostles with him"; meaning that He had with Him enough to set out what was in mind in the number, and that there would be enough to deal with any attempt to overthrow it. I believe the twelve were in mind in the sense that there would be enough to deal with any attack on the truth. So that it is said in the second chapter of the Acts, "they continued stedfastly in the apostles¬ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers". There would be enough in those persons to overthrow any attempt at opposition.
J.S.E. Is that why there, is peculiar emphasis in Luke on the apostles?
J.T. I think so. Although Luke is marked by grace, yet he is also marked by authority.
Ques. Is it instructive that headship was first set aside by craftiness?
J.T. You mean the devil was crafty in setting aside Adam's authority over Eve.
G.C.S. Does Rebecca covering herself suggest the recognition of headship?
J.T. I would say that. Isaac is concerned about the camels first, for it says, "he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, camels were coming", @Genesis 24: 63. That would show that there was the means of carrying. Then she inquired about the man that is walking in the fields and the servant said, "That is my master". Abraham
{126}
is not said to be master there, but Isaac, meaning that the authority of Christ is there.
R.B. Do we see that in Abigail in the number of times she called David *Lord*?
J.T. Very good. David said to her, "Blessed be thy discernment", which is a great matter in regard to this point of headship. Then too, when David proposed marriage to her, the feminine thought, involving subjection, is stressed in the persons whom she took. Now the scripture continues, "Every man praying or prophesying, having anything on his head, puts his head to shame. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered puts her own head to shame; for it is one and the same as a shaved woman. For if a woman be not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if it be shameful to a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered". Then it goes on further, in verse 10, "Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head, on account of the angels". That is to say, the token of the authority under which she stands, shows that the unseen world, the angels above, are concerned about this matter, and certainly, if *they* are, all the sisters ought to be concerned about it too. As we read in the Scriptures, the angels have had to say to women as well as to men. Certainly the one that came to Manoah's wife reminds us of subjection in her. He did not come to her husband; he came to her. The husband had to say to him, also, but he hardly shines in what he says to the angel. The angels are thus to be held in regard, for we are told in Hebrews, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?". This matter of salvation includes the idea of headship.
P.H.H. So the thought of subjection is vital and essential to true assembly ground and any service in an assembly setting.
J.T. Hence, in verse 17, Paul immediately refers to the Lord's supper, but says that what was being done
{127}
at Corinth had not the character of the Lord's supper; whereas in verse 23 we are told what the Lord's supper is. "For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, and having given thanks, broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. In like manner also the cup, after having supped". That expression "after having supped" implies a meal, but the Lord's supper is not an ordinary meal; it is a memorial. Paul says he could not praise them in this; "For each one in eating takes his *own* supper before others, and one is hungry and another drinks to excess". Therefore he says, "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them who have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this point I do not praise". He is not ready to commend what they are doing; indeed he condemns it.
A.M. Is there any suggestion in the title being changed? He says, "I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread".
J.T. I think the title 'Lord Jesus' is an affectionate allusion to the Lord. It is found in other settings and usually conveys affection and regard for the Lord.
A.M. Would the title 'the Lord' suggest that what he had received was on the line of authority, whereas whenever one touches the thought of the Supper, affections come into play as suggested in the title, 'Lord Jesus'.
J.T. So we have the word, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", @1 Corinthians 12: 3. It is as if the Holy Spirit was needed to bring in the affection and respect that are due to the Lord in His Supper, for it is a question of His Supper.
Ques. Does this feature of headship become more essential on account of the character of the day in which we are? Is the light and recognition of headship an
{128}
element that we would preserve especially in view of our service together?
J.T. Quite so. What is current generally is just a travesty of the Lord's supper; hence, in view of the near coming of the Lord, as we all believe, it is necessary that the facts of His Supper should be understood, and that it should continue in its celebration to the very moment of His coming. There is hardly any feature of the Scriptures that has been more stressed of recent times than the Lord's supper, and the Lord has helped the brethren in it too.
Rem. Would you say more as to the memorial that you have spoken of.
J.T. It is not an ordinary meal, and that brings up the question of our houses. Paul says, "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking?". There may be a deficiency of houses, but certainly the thought of the house is to be retained. It is not simply the dwelling-place, but the house as a family, as if the household of a believer is a place in which divine order should be set out and family feelings prevail. There should thus be a readiness when we come together, to partake of the Lord's supper, for we are equal to the order that belongs to it as well as to our houses.
W.H. Would the thought of the Supper suggest that the family in that sense would be free and able to take part in it restfully, the responsibilities of the day being over?
J.T. I would say that. How easily disorder is ignored when children are allowed their own way! The word to the jailor in @Acts 16 is "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house". The pronouns used emphasise the personal side.
H.B. When he says, "or do ye despise the assembly of God", is he referring to their using the assembly of God for eating and drinking?
J.T. He is hinting at it. In fact, they did that, for each one ate his own supper in the presence of others.
{129}
The occasion was not intended for an ordinary meal, and they were despising the assembly. The Supper is a memorial and it makes everything of Christ. Where everything is made of Christ, in that sense, then there is room for the whole scheme of divine purpose and the divine service.
A.H. Would you say a word as to *the approved* being made manifest? Would they be persons that had rightly used their own houses?
J.T. I would say that. A well-regulated house is what every head ought to keep in mind, so that the children, who come out of it and come into fellowship, are ready for it, for they are hardly uninitiated. Whereas the truth of the Lord's supper is initial, yet it makes way for the great scheme of divine purpose, which involves a system in which headship shines. God Himself indeed is in mind as Head, as it says, "the head of Christ is God".
Ques. Do you think the Lord is exercising us in relation to detail, in view of His speedy return?
J.T. I think so. I think the Lord in His communications to Paul had in mind that the thing should be fully understood, because of its place in the testimony.
J.S.E. Does it imply that in our houses there is to be the element of instruction as to what is proper behaviour in the assembly of God?
J.T. I think that is the idea. That is the reason for much that the apostle says in chapter 10, which we did not read. There the cup is placed before the bread, which perhaps is something that many do not notice. It is "The cup of blessing which we bless". It is not what the Lord blesses; it is what we do; that is, what intelligent Christians do, persons who know what they are doing. Chapter 10 belongs to the earlier instruction, of course, and hence it is not a question of the *order* in the Lord's supper, but it is the spirit that enters into it, and shows that the cup is well thought of. Whatever is alluded to in it, indicates feeling on the part of the brethren, for it is a feeling matter. "The cup of blessing which we bless".
{130}
That is stressed so that we have the right feelings, such as belong to it. If we have these, they will enter into other things. The whole scheme of the divine mind is intended to be brought into the divine service. The millennium will not afford any such testimony as we are supposed to afford. The angels are in mind here, and they are looking on, as it says, "which angels desire to look into", @1 Peter 1: 12. Hence the importance of everything being accurate, even with details, so that we are not loose in our handling of things. If we are reverential and holy in our thoughts, then we shall know how to bless. The cup is given the first place in chapter 10, in that light, because it is a question of feeling, and shows how much the Lord attaches to His memorial.
Ques. Reference was made to *the approved* being made manifest; does that link up, in any way, with verse 33, "So that, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another"?
J.T. Exactly. I would think that would mean that there is to be right feeling toward each other. It raises the question as to how we regard each other, as sitting down at the Lord's supper.
Ques. Does the eating there convey the full thought of the Supper?
J.T. Yes. I would say it is a question of the whole service of the Lord's supper. We do not want to sit down piecemeal; we want to be all together. So the Lord says, "Drink ye all of it". It is a united thing, and we should wait for one another till all are present. Of course, we must not ignore the time, but then, we must not ignore the brethren. On the other hand, they should not ignore us, so that those that are late should be concerned about it. It is said of the Lord that the twelve were with Him; none of them would be late. All is intended to promote love for one another, so that we can say, We are all here. If there are only a few in the locality, well, let it be said, We are all here, for that is a great matter. The Lord values there being no absentees.
{131}
J.S.E. Is it to clear us in our minds of any thought of what is social in connection with this great occasion? In Corinth social relations were getting the upper hand.
J.T. Well, I would say that. The social idea ought to be entirely left out for it is a question of what is suitable to the Lord.
P.H.H. Is the mention of "the assembly of God" to raise our thoughts to a certain level of dignity?
J.T. That is what I believe. I was alluding to the first nine verses as abstract, and especially from verse 4, because they show that from the divine side everything is there; so that there is really no excuse for any discrepancy. If any one does not know, well, the thing is to inquire and to see to it that he does know, because we are addressed as persons who should know. Paul says, "I speak as to intelligent persons". There is so much instruction as to the Lord's supper. Why should we not know about it?
J.S.E. Would not the expression "This is my body, which is for you" lift us all in our outlook upon one another, to the same level as we are in the Lord's thoughts?
J.T. Just so. *For you* means that it is for us. It is not for the saints of the coming dispensation. It is the saints of the assembly that are in mind.
Ques. In the words *for you*, did the Lord have in view the assembly?
J.T. I think He had the assembly in mind. Paul says to the Corinthians, "I speak as to intelligent persons". Why should we not be intelligent? There is so much said about the Lord's supper and so much instruction given, for the Lord intends that the saints should be instructed as to it. I do not know of any part of Scripture that has been more stressed for the last few years, it may be for a quarter of a century, than the Lord's supper, and still something is coming up about it. If one quotes the apostle in his remark to Timothy, saying, "Let not the assembly be charged", having
{132}
in view that certain financial burdens should *not* fall on it, someone may say, Well, that is nothing; but it is not to be treated as nothing. The assembly is to be regarded in its dignity, and so we should watch things that are charged on the assembly, and see that things that really should not be charged to it are charged under some other account, so as to keep things right. Money, in the sense of its mere financial value, is really nothing in the Lord's mind. It is a question of *His* valuation of it, and His valuation of the assembly, and how it should be treated and regarded, because the assembly has the first place with the Lord.
A.R. Would you say a word as to "This is my body, which is for you". In the New Translation it does not say 'which is *broken* for you', nor 'which is *given* for you', but just "which is for you". Is there anything suggested in that?
J.T. I think it is as though the Lord would say, What a portion there is for you! And we might say it to ourselves, What a portion we have! Do we understand all that relates to it? The idea of appropriation, I think, would enter into the word "for". It is for us to appropriate all that that body means. So the Lord said of the woman in Simon's house, "In pouring out this ointment on my body, she has done it for my burying", @Matthew 26: 12. It was His head she anointed, showing how she observed the dignity of the Lord as to His body, for His head, of course, was His body. His head was anointed, but He said she anointed His body. Her act shows how we should regard the Lord's body, and how much is before us in the Lord's supper. The Lord said, "Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her". She is an example for us all and it is leading up to the Lord's supper in @Matthew 26.
J.W. Does the *for you* exclude every other family and show that the Supper is entirely for the assembly?
{133}
J.T. I would say that fully. Therefore the need of paying attention to what is said about it, and being intelligent about it, because we are addressed as intelligent persons.
Ques. In giving thanks for the bread and the cup you would have what is given by Paul peculiarly in mind rather than what is given in the close of the gospels?
J.T. Yes. It is the last word. The ministries of Matthew and Mark specially contain instruction for the faithful remnant of Israel, and run on to the millennium; whereas Paul's ministry is wholly for the assembly. Paul, who, as we know, had other ministries, had the ministry of the assembly, and he brings the Lord's supper into that because it is a question of the assembly. It is a matter relating to the assembly, and not any other family.
P.H.H. What would be the usefulness for us of the Lord's supper as set in the gospels? Would it put certain moral features in our souls?
J.T. Yes. I think it is to show the full significance of the subject by itself. But in order to get the truth of it as relating to the assembly, and the assembly only, then we must consult Paul. His ministry is the last word on all matters relating to the assembly, and especially as to the Lord's supper.
A.Al. Is that why the "I" is emphatic, "for *I* received ..." emphasising that this is fresh light on the Supper?
J.T. Quite so.
A.H. Referring again to the sufferings of Christ, how far would you think the apostle would have us to carry those in relation to the Supper?
J.T. It is a question of instruction. In thinking of the sufferings of Christ which stand related to the Lord's supper we are to have in our minds what the Lord left behind in the way of sufferings when He went to heaven, for all the sufferings of His saints He feels and regards as His own, as @Colossians 1: 24 and @1 Peter 1: 11 and @1 Peter 4: 13
{134}
show. The former passage specially shows that a measure, determined by the Lord in His love and wisdom, was left to be gone through by the assembly in order to bring her into full accord with Christ in the place of testimony here in the fulfilment of the will of God. They are therefore to be regarded as the sufferings of Christ which He endures in His suffering assembly; the "me" of @Acts 9: 4. In @Colossians 1: 24 Paul says, "Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly". Paul would fill up "in his flesh" those sufferings that were behind of the tribulations of Christ. He would and did have his part with the saints in these, but further, as the special minister of Christ he suffered for the saints because he loved them. He followed the Lord in this, and in himself portrayed to the saints the sufferings of Christ as continued in the testimony here. Although the Lord was and is corporeally in heaven Paul shows in himself that the Lord would still identify Himself with the suffering position in which His saints are. Paul therefore said to Timothy "Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner", @2 Timothy 1: 8.
F.I. Is that not to bring to our minds the thought of His affections as the outcome of His words, "My body ... for you"? It is His love to us, so it is followed on with "in remembrance of me". According to the note here, that is to call Him to mind. Is that not so that our minds may be filled by Christ on such an occasion?
J.T. Quite so. Then another thing comes in. We say it is the Lord in glory and that is quite right, but, at the same time, when the Lord is having to do with us now, in relation to His Supper, it is as in our present circumstances, and He is nearby. If He comes to us it is in our present circumstances. He does not take us up to glory in relation to His Supper; He comes down to our circumstances, and therefore He is to be known as with us in the suffering position. I mean as to the actual
{135}
suffering that the brethren have to endure, the Lord is with them in it. Therefore, the Lord would say, as it were, 'I am in the town too'. If anything is going on in the town that is causing sufferings to the brethren, the Lord is there too. He is not to be thought of as in heaven. He is down here with us in the place of testimony. As in the midst of suffering for the testimony Paul said, "The Lord is near". He is at hand. Matthew never says that He goes to heaven. Matthew views Him down here where the sufferings are, so that He has part in them with us.
Ques. Is that the difference between Stephen and Paul? Stephen says, "I see the heavens opened"; whereas with Paul it is rather the Lord drawing near to Him and his hearing a voice. Would that suggest nearness?
J.T. Quite so.
L.H. Is that why Paul mentions the circumstances here? He says, "The night in which he was delivered up"?
J.T. Quite so. We might say the Lord is out of all these things, and He is in heaven; but He is down here where we are. He is going through the things with us.
P.L. Did not Paul get an understanding of that in the vision at Corinth, the Lord saying to him, "*I* am with thee", @Acts 18: 10?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord said to Paul, "Fear not". He was pressing on Paul that he was not to fear. The fear was there, for the actual circumstances to cause fear were there, but the Lord was with him in them. So that the Lord is in the suffering position, and He is to be called to mind thus, for the suffering position in which we are, He was in personally for the will of God. It is not that He is to be called to mind in His place up there, but in the place of sufferings. The sufferings in mind are those in which we have part as now ourselves here for the will of God.
{136}
A.S. Would the verse in @John 14 "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" confirm what you are saying?
J.T. It does confirm it. He is coming to us. He is not taking us up there but He is coming to us. Matthew never says that He has ascended.
P.H.H. That would make the Lord's supper a very feeling matter to us in our day.
J.T. Well, that is what I think it should be too, and some of us, perhaps, feel it more than others, because in our localities we have to go through certain things, but the Lord is with us in them.
J.S.E. Does it help to bear in mind that, in addition to Matthew, 1 Corinthians rarely touches anything that is off the earth?
J.T. It is the circumstances down here, and the local position is in mind in Corinth. "The assembly of God which is in Corinth". It is not in heaven, but in Corinth.
R.M. Would you say a word as to verse 28, "let a man prove himself, and thus eat". Why does Paul bring us down to the individual?
J.T. The eating is contingent on his proving himself, which is an important matter.
E.M. Does the *unworthily* enter into what you have been pointing out? It has often been connected with persons, but is it not in connection with the manner?
J.T. It is a question of the *way* we do things; the attitude we assume and whether we are there in a holy, reverential way. The Lord has that in mind.
Ques. Returning to the thought of nearness and the assembly as the place where the Lord is known to be near, would it not preclude references to the Lord on the throne and such like references after the Supper?
J.T. I think so. I think it is important to keep that in mind. I do not know that we have had it much in our minds, but the Lord Himself is to be regarded as being yet in the place of sufferings with His own. Though He
{137}
is not here bodily, yet He is in spirit in the place of sufferings, and He knows that we are in them too. (See @Revelation 2: 10, 13).
Ques He is linking Himself on with the saints, with the assembly, which is in the place where He was?
J.T. That is right.
H.B. Would the reference to His blood in the verse, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" suggest His love feelings?
J.T. It does. It is "my blood".
W.H. Would all this lead on in assembly service to His circumstances? You have been speaking about Him coming into *our* circumstances in sympathy and support, but would that be in view of our entering into His, as in @John 20?
J.T. I think so. The Lord is speaking about His own circumstances, and so, in the beginning of Revelation, you see Christ in relation to the assembly. It is a symbolical reference, but it is in relation to the assembly as down here; "the seven assemblies which are in Asia". The Lord is seen there in the midst of them. He is not in heaven but in the midst of them. When we come to the end of the book, the assembly is seen coming down out of heaven, which is another matter altogether, but, in the first section, it is a question of the circumstances the assembly is in, and that the Lord is in those circumstances.
J.M. So He says to Paul, "Why persecutest thou me?".
J.T. Quite so. That is a very good scripture and confirms what we are saying. Paul was persecuting at that time and the Lord felt things. The Lord's supper is only for us; for the assembly only, because it is a question of His body and of the nearness in which she is to the Lord; the nearness in which we are to the Lord.
L.E.S. Would the expression "After having supped" indicate the distinctive place that the cup has in relation to the assembly, in contrast to Judaism?
{138}
J.T. Quite so. "After having supped". It is carefully distinguished from anything else. It is just the thing by itself, and it is mentioned, I believe, lest the full thought should be overlooked in the second feature of the Lord's supper. The full thought should be carried through the whole service.
Ques. Do you mean the full thought of remembrance?
J.T. Yes. Quite so.
Rem. So that fills up the whole time of the Lord's absence until He comes.
A.McG. I want to be clear regarding the remembrance of the Lord Jesus as absent from the earth. Are we thinking of Him as absent and in glory, or here as feeling with us here?
J.T. The word "remembrance", of course, alludes to Himself, but has in mind the conditions in which the assembly is now, with which He is identified. That is what I would understand. There is really no need to introduce the thought of sufferings as regards His present place, but the remembrance carries with it the idea of what is here, where the sufferings are; and the assembly sharing in it, and the Lord sharing with us in it too. As instituting the Supper the Lord was then suffering, for the whole atmosphere around was rife with murderous feelings against Him and His own, as @Matthew 26: 1 - 5 shows, but these were not atoning sufferings. The sufferings indicated in @Matthew 26 and elsewhere are those in which we have part, as the Lord said to His own in @Luke 22: 28, "*ye* are they who have persevered with me in my temptations". These sufferings continue and as the saints are in them the Lord is with us, feelingly with us, because we are in the position in which He Himself suffered. "I will not leave you comfortless", He said, so that He manifests Himself and is known "in the breaking of bread", @Luke 24: 35.
P.L. So that depth of feelings are assured as thus in concert with Christ in rejection, for all that will
{139}
follow, in spiritual feeling, in praise, in relation to the upward trend.
J.T. Quite so. The upward trend will come in the order of the service, for Ephesians contemplates that we are already seated up there, but Corinthians does not imply that nor do the gospels. It is a question of the Lord's own circumstances in the testimony and the remembrance has those circumstances in mind.
P.H.H. Does Joseph's word in the prison about remembrance bear that out?
J.T. Yes. Joseph's circumstances had not changed. He was in the prison, and the butler says, "I remember mine offences this day", @Genesis 41: 9. Well, that is the position; the sufferings are still present. So that as we have already remarked, the Lord says to Paul, "Why persecutest thou me?". The Lord in His body, the assembly, is going through the persecution.
A.M. The "priests of God and of the Christ" in @Revelation 20: 6, are a suffering company, are they not? They precede the coming out of the assembly.
J.T. Well, regarding them as the assembly now, that is important. I do not know that brethren usually attach *priesthood* to the saints as belonging to Christ, yet it says there that "they shall be priests of God and of the Christ". So that, at His Supper, the Lord has the priesthood. It is Christ's matter, and He has His own priesthood.
Ques. You mean in relation to Himself?
J.T. Quite so. He has His priests, and that ought to exercise us all as to whether as breaking bread we are really "priests of God and of the Christ".
W.W. Is the Lord looking for those priestly feelings when He joins us in the Supper?
J.T. I would think so. I think He is having in mind what He has personally. "This is my body, which is for you". He has the *you* for Himself.
P.L. Would His universal heirship as suggested in the reference to Him being the Head of every man, but
{140}
emphasise, in the Lord's supper that follows, what He has been bereft of here, and the resulting expectation of sympathy which He counts upon from the assembly?
J.T. Quite so. I think it is a very lovely thought that the Lord has His own priests. I mean to say He carries on Himself and the Father would make full allowance for that. The Lord would make full provision for the Father, but the Father makes provision for Him.
Ques. Is there power to move on to the other side unless we are well established in that which is for Christ personally?
J.T. Well, I think that is good. I was thinking, at the beginning of our meeting today, that there are a good many young here, as there are usually in these meetings, and one thanks God peculiarly for it, but perhaps they are wanting in what relates to the sense of order and the priestly state. The Lord has His own system of things that He carries on, with a view to proceeding to the Father's things.
J.M. Is it your thought that certain references to the sufferings of Christ are in order in the Lord's supper?
J.T. Yes. I would say that. He said to Paul, "Why persecutest thou me?". Well, He meant something that Paul was doing, and Paul understood that. He told the Lord later, "When the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by", @Acts 22: 20. He spoke about *His* martyr.
P.L. Would the expression, "Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations", have some bearing upon that?
J.T. Quite so. Hence He says, "I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you", @John 16: 22.
H.K.R. Would the believer's household, seeking to be held in the gain of headship, know something of suffering, and, as coming together in assembly, would that suffering find its expression in a proper and intelligent way?
{141}
J.T. Yes. If the household is with Him they go through the sufferings of the testimony. Onesiphorus is commended because he sought out Paul diligently and found him, and Paul desires that he should find mercy for his house in that day, because of the way Paul regarded his service.
Ques. Is it significant, in relation to the feelings, that a brother died before Paul was secured for the assembly? I was thinking of Stephen.
J.T. Well, that would bring into prominence the distinction that Stephen has.
P.H.H. I suppose the very thought of priesthood suggests a setting of suffering. There will be no priesthood, as such, in the setting of glory, will there? Does it not suggest the opposition and unholiness of what is outside and therefore, the sufferings which relate to the testimony?
J.T. Quite so.
{142}
GRACE MAINTAINED
@John 20: 19 - 25; @John 21: 1 - 14
J.T. The thought in mind is that John represents the *grace* side of the believer's position. Paul represents the doctrinal side, while John, coming in at the end, is left mysteriously, to be available for the Lord's will, and represents what is here in that sense in view of the end. Grace prevails from the very outset of John's instruction, life also, and it is intended to affect and characterise us to the very end. It is thus that the verses in chapter 20 afford an example of the Lord's way at the beginning, and those in chapter 21 His way at the end.
In chapter 21 there is no regard for the Lord's rights but independence on the part of leading servants, yet the Lord has no rebuke or penalty for their conduct; all through the chapter it is grace, though much could be said in the way of condemnation, showing how long the Lord can bear with us in maintaining the character of the dispensation. The brethren will see that it opens up much.
Rem. It is said in chapter 1 that "grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ".
J.T. The word *subsists*, which is in the singular, shows it is there in a very pronounced way; so Paul speaks of "faith and love which is in Christ Jesus". Then we have "of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace". It is there in Him; but upon the saints it is the spirit of the anointing.
Ques. Is grace preservative?
J.T. It is viewed as in Christ first, then we are said to have received it, hence in chapter 1 we have "grace upon grace". In chapter 21 the disciples are found in independence, thoughtless of the Lord's rights. Verses 2 and 3 read: "There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael who was of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two
{143}
others of his disciples. Simon Peter says to them, I go to fish. They say to him, We also come with thee. They went forth and went on board, and that night took nothing". Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael, and the sons of Zebedee, were well known persons, and two more are not named. The company was a fair representation of what there was at that time and also bearing a clear allusion to the closing days. In John's gospel the Lord shows how long He can bear with those He has trusted with something.
Ques. Is it a matter of the testimony being presented?
J.T. Yes, I thought that; there are seven of them, a fair representation of what there is at the present time and of how the Lord can bear with us, making way for Himself to come in and help us as needed. He did not simply appear with rations for them, but He prepared for them to *dine*; a dignified thought was in His mind. The Holy Spirit would help us to understand this. Some active men are being deflected and the Lord is showing what He can do, and how He can restore us and go on with us. So that in the end we see they had taken one hundred and fifty-three great fishes, the Lord helping them in this.
W.S.S. In chapter 20 things were right. Does that show the liberty in which the Lord moves when the saints are governed by the truth? In chapter 21 we can see His movements when things are wrong.
J.T. Chapter 20 is normal Christianity, showing us how to forgive sins and how to retain them, forgiveness being put first.
W.S.S. What the Lord does in chapter 21 would show how He restores things to normality when they are abnormal.
J.T. Quite so. It also shows that the leading man has to die, that is Peter. The Lord gives to him the service of feeding the lambs and shepherding the sheep. John also has his work, but the Lord however does not say what John is to do.
{144}
Ques. Would this bear on the *peace* of chapter 14?
J.T. Yes, He left it with them; but here He is present with them, inaugurating the system He has in mind, setting it up in grace and the Holy Spirit's power, not simply the gift of the Holy Spirit, but His breathing it into them. He was affecting them inwardly, which will be seen in its results, involving the retention of sins if necessary.
Ques. Would there be a link with Peter and John in @Acts 3 and Peter's words "Look on us"?
J.T. That is good. There is something to be seen there; it was not a question of what they knew, but of what could be seen in them. In @John 9 the man whose eyes were opened speaks of what *had* happened to him, as he speaks to the neighbours, but to the Pharisees he speaks in the present tense. "I washed and I see", not 'I saw'. The point being what is seen now, which is generally in mind in John's writings.
Ques. Is there therefore something to be seen in this way in the disciples although they were marked by independence?
J.T. I thought so. If anyone had said anything at that point to Peter or John or Nathanael they would have had an answer *then*, not what they may have said previously. At the same time they were disobedient and selfish; though it is Peter that says "I go to fish", all are on the same line, not thinking of the Lord and His interests. How long He waits, for He knows what each one is capable of! Here He is setting them up in a dignified way, not simply that they were fed, but He invites them to dine, showing that there was something to be seen in them as a result of His service.
Rem. This incident would remain in their minds as expressing "grace upon grace".
J.T. It *was* that. It was His own doing. Grace was there in plenty, not scantily and they had received it: "of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace". That was at the beginning, but He would have
{145}
the same in mind at the end, and then, if anything is wrong, it would show itself.
A.M. There is only one reference to the Father in the section we read, chapter 20: 21.
J.T. Yes, it brings out the position of the servants as sent ones. The Lord was sent, so the question now comes up as to our being sent.
Ques. Does this refer to voluntary work or to our being sent?
J.T. Well, there is really no voluntary work. You cannot say you can go when you like or when you can. It is imperative to recognise this; or the testimony would fail unless there are those who hold to this principle as an obligation.
Ques. Is that the sort of spirit that comes out in Isaiah saying "send me"?
J.T. Yes, he says that because he was fit for it. He had gone through the experience involved in the "glowing coal" and he had seen the Lord, and was therefore in a fit condition to be sent.
Ques. How do brethren arrive at the consciousness of being sent today?
J.T. Well, a hundred and twenty years ago certain persons became conscious that there was something to be maintained. They began to get together having the truth of prophecy before them firstly, and we are profiting by this today. Now the question is, as having the Spirit, are we holding the truth? The Spirit is here as He was at the beginning. It is a question of how much we make room for His service when we pray; Jude says "praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God".
Rem. It was the Holy Spirit who said: "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them".
J.T. Just so. The Lord said, "I also send you", in @John 20. The "I" is somewhat emphatic in accord with John's general practice in writing. He would
{146}
emphasise the Persons, and he thus uses the personal pronoun. The Lord has sent us and the sooner we take that on and act on it the better.
W.S.S. Things may be weak but the obligation is to go on.
J.T. Just so.
Rem. You are speaking to us all, not only to the servants.
J.T. Quite, it is not a local matter only but for all. Are we standing in what we have received? Paul speaks of our standing in the things we have received (@1 Corinthians 15: 1). The Lord says here "Receive the Holy Spirit".
Ques. The "doors being shut" is mentioned twice. Does that suggest the vital importance of attending to this matter?
J.T. It is a divine principle to maintain a certain secrecy, for a sense of mystery attaches to our position in the truth; things are not open to everyone to look into. The doors are to be shut in a spiritual sense, to exclude all that hinders.
Ques. Is the testimony dominated by the first day of the week?
J.T. Yes, it is greatly stressed in chapter 20, and that shows that the service should be carried on unhindered. The doors were shut, not simply closed. "The doors shut where the disciples were". These were the circumstances in which the disciples were found, and Jesus came *there*.
Rem. There were conditions therefore to which He could come, and He showed His hands and His side to them there.
J.T. Quite. The Lord did not want to be disturbed in such a holy and precious time, He had the assembly according to what it is in His own mind before Him. Then there was the grace of their being sent, and He breathed into them saying "Receive the Holy Spirit: whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained". This is
{147}
the whole matter; the Lord wants these conditions amongst the saints. It is an intimate matter, involving His own breathing; not as at Pentecost.
W.S.S. Would that involve the Spirit of Christ in the saints today, working out in the remission of sins?
J.T. Yes, sins *are* remitted; hence it is in the present tense, it is not to be delayed 'till next Lord's day', which is often the custom.
L.P. If an issue arises among us and remission is given, is it not then a completed matter?
J.T. Yes, it *is* completed. It is a present thing; they are remitted.
J.C.M.W. The Lord speaks "to them", we are told. Would this imply that they would be conscious inwardly of the remission?
J.T. Quite. The Lord would have much pleasure in that, and how much more we, too, should enjoy forgiving more than retaining. It is a joyous matter, if sins are really judged, that they are to be remitted and forgotten.
W.S.S. We have to ask ourselves whether we are really in line with the spirit of the dispensation.
J.T. Quite so, @Galatians 6 bears on that, referring to one being taken in some fault, not overtaken by it, but taken in it. The word is "restore such a one"; that is in effect, *set him up as he was before*.
W. S. S. This would be a serious fault, not a momentary slip, and yet restoration is in view.
J.T. Quite, "ye who are spiritual restore such a one"; that is, he is set up unimpaired.
Ques. What determines whether sins are remitted or retained?
J.T. The meetings of assembly character. But if there is real self-judgment there must be remission and there will be joy in this. Otherwise Satan may get an advantage.
Ques. Would the trespass offering bear on all this?
{148}
J.T. The types help much. In the inauguration of the assembly we have the gospels which are necessarily short, as if words were spared by the writers, but now we have the Spirit who is patiently opening up the truth to the brethren, using all the Scriptures. At no time has there been so much opening up of the truth and the question is, Are we going in for it, having in mind the great objective, the service of God on the first day of the week?
Rem. As to Peter's recovery; he is said to have wept bitterly.
J.T. The spirit of the whole thought of recovery was there; there can be no recovery apart from self-judgment.
Ques. What is the significance of "Children, have ye anything to eat"?
J.T. It is a term of parental affection; the Lord is appealing to the erring ones. In @Isaiah 9 we have the term "Father of Eternity" or 'Father of the age'; Christ takes the attitude of *Father* toward the disciples in this chapter.
Ques. What is involved in the eating?
J.T. It shows the Lord's gracious sympathy toward them. He raises the question as to whether we have something to eat. This question is raised in @Luke 12 and the Lord says: "Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus", that is, administering food to His household.
A.M. Would the absence of food cause weakness and lead to breakdown? Is the inward side lacking?
J.T. Well, there were seven of them and they should have had something to eat, but they had taken nothing. In @Luke 24 the Lord says, "Have ye anything here to eat?" But it was not that in @John 21, for He had it all ready for them; "they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread".
Rem. If the right kind of food is ministered, the rod would not be needed as Paul suggests.
{149}
J.T. Well, the Lord did not use the rod; it was left for a later period, not now. That is the word for us now; how long He can bear with us. He knew what was there in them, it would come out in time. The unfaithfulness was not really deep.
Ques. In view of the abundance of ministry there is at the present time, is it a question of how we answer to it?
J.T. Yes, on this occasion He gives them a meal, but at another time He asks them to provide food for others. If you get something from the Lord and give it out, it will enlarge as you do so.
Rem. May we have a further word as to the dining?
J.T. It is a question of the truth as opened up for the mind; it involves knowing how to proceed. For instance, we have the Lord's supper which opens up the service of God. We are to know what to do; it is not simply the setting of the table, though that is necessary, but there is the eating of the bread and the drinking of the cup, intelligence teaching us what to do. We are not irregular as they were at Corinth; we are accustomed to eating properly, in a dignified manner.
Ques. Is there significance in the right side of the ship?
J.T. The right side would be the place of power. In Mark the man in white was at the right side of the sepulchre, and in Luke, the angel who appeared to Zacharias was on the right side of the altar.
Rem. "Children" is a term of endearment, but "Come and dine" is on a more dignified level and would link with the first day of the week.
J.T. That is so. Later in the chapter, we again have the thought of feeding, the Lord telling Peter to feed His lambs, then to shepherd His sheep, and then to feed His sheep. These are things to be done. We are now at the end, but the feeding and the shepherding are to continue.
{150}
W.S.S. Peter had been a voluntary worker at the beginning of the chapter, but at the end he comes under the Lord's control.
J.T. Yes, he is to feed the lambs and the sheep; it is a matter of obligation.
Rem. What John said was used to recover the others.
J.T. He was one of them, of course, but "if any one love me" was also true of John. John represents that more than gift; it is the spirit of the man, and what characterised him in this sense.
Rem. Thomas was on the wrong side too, and in the lead next to Peter.
J.T. Well, Thomas is spoken of here as Didymus. How can that be brought in to the things of God? It implies a special link with someone else. He is not mentioned in chapter 20 until after the matter of remission and retention of sins. They say to him "We have seen the Lord". That is a fine bit of news, but he does not seem to value it, though Mary had told them. He says, "Unless I see ... I will not believe". A remarkable thing to say. Why should he say it? Why should he boldly discredit what the other disciples had said? It was a strong negative, his will was in it. Why should any one take up such an attitude implying that the brethren are wrong, as if to say, You go your way and I go mine; that leads to division.
Rem. Grace overcomes all that.
J.T. Well, I think so. If there is anyone here like Thomas let him be overcome by grace and be forgiven.
Rem. "Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good".
J.T. Yes.
A.M. May there be unity in a wrong sense, as here, involving giving a false lead, leading to a wrong combination among the brethren; the Lord broke up this combination: it was His action.
J.T. Yes, but He did it in grace.
{151}
W.S.S. The three names mentioned were all connected with the Jewish line of things as if there were a going back to the old dispensation.
J.T. The Lord met the whole movement in grace and broke it up.
Rem. The impression one gains is, that if a serious position arises involving many persons, the situation can be saved by the introduction of grace.
J.T. I think that, but how few there are who can be relied on today! We may be met with the expression: "I go to fish". Even as in the years preceding us, such things have been said, meaning, I want my own way. A leading man wanting his own way may act so as to divide the brethren, and cause serious scattering. All such things must be met in grace, but in firmness.
Rem. So grace is on the throne. It reigns through righteousness already. Is this implied in the reference to "the third time"? (see verses 14, 17).
J.T. Just so, the reign of grace is going on, hence the reference to "the third time".
Ques. Would there be special significance in the bread? It is easier to understand the thought of the fish and its origin, but it says, "Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them".
J.T. Well, we have the thought of bread explained in @Psalm 104, verses 14, 15. Bread is given for man's support and strengthening, oil to make his face to shine, and wine to gladden his heart. God would thus maintain us in life and loyalty to the truth.
Ques. Do we see here love coming into action, when John says, "It is the Lord"?
J.T. That is wonderful. What a lead John gives, in saying "It is the Lord" -- Himself -- He was amongst them.
Ques. Why is the miracle of great fishes needed? It is not like the showing of His hands and His side in
{152}
chapter 20. Here the case has to be proved to them miraculously.
J.T. Quite so. Things in chapter 20 are normal, but here they are abnormal, so that a sign is needed. John gives signs as divine evidence, and this is one of them. Here the truth had to be proved miraculously.
{153}
THE SUBJECTIVE SIDE OF THE TRUTH (1)
@Matthew 4: 12 - 25; @Matthew 28: 16 - 20
J.T. It is in mind to call attention to two of the Gospels, with a view to our acquiring more knowledge of what we call the subjective side of the truth in the Scriptures. Matthew and John particularly give the subjective side of the truth, and it is thought that we should look at Matthew this morning and John this afternoon. The Gospels, so called, among other things, are intended to balance us in our knowledge of the truth. In Luke and John, for instance, we have no allusion to the forsaking of the Lord Jesus on the cross; whereas in Matthew and Mark the forsaking is specially given. Correspondingly, it is thought that the subjective side of the truth, as we call it, that is what is formed in us in a positive way, appears in Matthew and in John. What is immediately in mind, in the passage read in Matthew, is the fact that light is said to have "sprung up". The same is true as to life in John. It springs up. The water of life springs up into eternal life. In the other gospels, and especially in Acts, light is seen coming *down* from heaven.
In regard to what springs up, we have the idea of *making*, as seen in Matthew. The disciples, specially John and Peter, but the twelve generally, were to make disciples of all nations and it is thought that this should be understood, so that the idea of making disciples should be apprehended by us. It is mentioned in Acts, too, in connection with Paul, for it says "having made many disciples", @Acts 14: 21. Then in the passage read in @Matthew 4, the Lord says to Peter, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men". I think it will be obvious that the thought of believers being *made*, in the sense of disciples and fishers, is practical and concrete.
W.C. Does it enter into God's original thought in connection with man, "Let us make man in our image?" @Genesis 1: 26.
{154}
J.T. I would say that. "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground", @Genesis 2: 7. It would appear that the whole man was made in a material sense, and then the breath of God was given to him, for it goes on to say, He "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life".
P.L. You referred in prayer to what was historical. Is there an allusion to a subjective state in Zebulon and Naphtali in a crisis, when it says they "jeoparded their lives unto death", @Judges 5: 18? The end of the Song of Deborah, "let them that love him be as the rising of the sun in its might", would be in accord with what is in view in Matthew.
J.T. I think that is good; specially if we consider Deborah and who she was. She was the wife of a man whose name signifies light. The wifely condition would be the practical side of our position. She did not represent the full thought of leadership, nevertheless she did act in leadership. Although a great sister, a great woman and a poetess, she is not mentioned among the persons of faith in @Hebrews 11; Barak is the one who is mentioned, because God would have the official side, which belongs to man, in the record.
Ques. Would Deborah represent the state of soul that lay behind Barak's activities? He says, "If thou goest with me, then I will go, but if thou goest not with me, I will not go". That was a right sentiment, from that point of view, was it not?
J.T. Yes. He had confidence in her. He was conscious of the need of her. The practical side was in her and the light was in him. He was to be the leader and she herself had that in mind.
F.C.H. Have you in mind that light is in view of formation?
J.T. It is. That, I believe, is seen in the first and second chapters of Genesis. God said "Let there be light". Paul enlarges on that in saying that the light now is in the face of Jesus, which is a very practical thought. The light was necessary in the first day, before there
{155}
were any operations. It was necessary that there should be light, but we are not told what the light was on the first day, whereas we are told on the fourth day. It says then that there is a greater light and a lesser light, and these would be substantial. It was a question firstly of what light is in itself, but the New Testament says "God is light". Whether we can say it is 'substantial' is a question; but the result of it, what is brought about as the effect of it, is substantial.
Ques. Were you going to say any more about it having sprung up here in contrast to the Acts where light came down from heaven?
J.T. Well, it was just to call attention to that fact. Christianity, as seen in the Acts, connects with what comes out of heaven, what comes down, but Matthew speaks of what was here. Hence he does not record the ascension of Christ, but has in mind that He is still here with us during the whole period until the end of the age.
P.L. Does this fit in with "the word of God grew and spread itself"? In the quotation from Isaiah in the chapter we have read, we have this thought of increase, to which you alluded in prayer, "Thou hast multiplied the nation, hast increased its joy: they joy before thee like to the joy in harvest; as men rejoice when they divide the spoil", @Isaiah 9: 3. Is that the great Matthew issue?
J.T. Quite so. Hence the references in Matthew to the great followings which the Lord had. You cannot have too many for God if they are the kind He wants, and the Lord was seeking the kind that was needed. So Matthew mentions two or three times the large following He had. Then in @Acts 2 there is a large result from the gospel, and there is an allusion to a large result later, in chapter 4, but large numbers are never referred to in connection with Paul. With him it is a question of quality and formation. The Matthew side would be the idea of numbers and then the formation. The last
{156}
passage we read alludes to the baptismal words or pronouncement; it is in "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit". Although the divine Persons are one, and "God" would apply to each at any time, yet you could not reverse the order in which They are said to be, because the wisdom of God requires it for the economy that He has in mind. So Matthew does not tell us that the Lord ascended, which is remarkable, and we have to understand that it is needed that He should remain with us and He does remain with us. He says, "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". It is not simply "in the midst", but "in the midst of them". That is to say He recognises or signalises the disciples because He is in the midst of them.
Ques. Is what you have in mind, that the work of God in a subjective way, links with the thought of *making*? *Making* fishers and *making* disciples, is to be carried on by those who accept responsibility in localities.
J.T. It is, and that is what I would understand to be the meaning of our care meetings and the service of our elders. The form care meetings have taken is almost, you might say, modern, but, anyway, the intent is the formation, the regularisation, of the persons that are there; that they are to be enlightened. One of the greatest needs existing now is that of being regulated by the principles of the truth, so that the saints are kept from the world and from sin. Care meetings have become increasingly important, because we are able to investigate. It is not simply that the ciders should do it, but the brethren are all brought into it; even if the sisters are not present they should certainly ask their husbands at home, so that the facts should be known and that there should be formation.
W.C. Would David in the cave of Adullam illustrate the way it works out? It says, "he became a captain over them; and there were with him about four hundred men", @1 Samuel 22: 2.
{157}
J.T. Exactly. There were none such elsewhere. Then David came under prophetic ministry, which is just what we have and what the Lord has opened up for us, so that there might be formation. The prophet Gad came into evidence and told David what to do. He was always subject to the prophet, whether it was Gad or Nathan, for he always recognises the importance of the prophetic ministry.
P.L. So that David became greater and greater, and then it says "it was a great camp, like the camp of God", @1 Chronicles 12: 22. Would that be the regulation as seen in Matthew and Corinthians?
J.T. Just so, and that means the assembly. It is not simply as it was in Acts, "the crowd of names", but an ordered assembly. The word *assembly* is not found immediately; it is doubtful that it is found in the second chapter, and it is doubtful if the plural is found in the ninth chapter; but anyway the idea of the assembly appears in due course, and that implies order. It implies those that are *called out*; those that come under subjection and walk in subjection, so that they are formed.
P.L. Does the Galilean environment, in both scriptures read in Matthew, bear on the truth of the cross in 1 Corinthians in relation to our regulation? I was thinking of the reproach of Paul in the light of the cross in 1 Corinthians and whether the 'making' process was in view as suggested in Matthew in the Galilean environment. Is that the place of reproach where all this is worked out?
J.T. Yes. The Gospels insist on the truth of the cross and so does Paul in 1st and 2nd Corinthians. The truth of the cross is marked by severity in the application of it, and in Colossians you have the extraordinary word nailing of things to the cross, so that they are fixed there.
P.H.H. The disciples at the beginning of chapter 5, are being separated from the crowd. Is that the beginning of this regularising?
{158}
J.T. I think it is. It is a striking chapter. It says, "But seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain". It is *the* mountain, you will notice, as over against the plain, "and having sat down", meaning deliberation. The Lord would be deliberate in what He was about to do in view of their being formed by the truth He was about to bring out. "His disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for *theirs* is the kingdom of the heavens. Blessed they that mourn, for *they* shall be comforted. Blessed the meek, for *they* shall inherit the earth". There are nine 'Blesseds' down to the twelfth verse, where we have "Blessed are ye when they may reproach and persecute you, and say every wicked thing against you, lying, for my sake. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for thus have they persecuted the prophets who were before you". The Lord's instruction, in Matthew, begins there properly. He is on the mount, which would be in agreement with the idea of the word *assembly*; that is, those who are *called out*. They went up themselves, as it says, "he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him". He did not even call them; it is what they did themselves, showing that they themselves were affected immediately by the light that was coming out.
Rem. They seem to have got benefit from Christ and He would doubtless become attractive to them and they now come under this teaching to regularise them.
J.T. Matthew stresses teaching right through so that His followers might be affected. The fifth chapter is one of three, for the sixth and the seventh are on the same line. It is the line of teaching, but also of legislation. There are seven mountains in Matthew and what is in mind at this first mountain is legislation. The Lord refers to what others had said, but He stresses what *He* says.
{159}
P.H.H. Would that correspond with the word of Paul, "the things that I write ... it is the Lord's commandment"? @1 Corinthians 14: 37.
J.T. It would. That word commandment is in the singular. It expresses the one idea that pervades the whole epistle, as if Paul was impressed with the need of obedience. It agrees with Romans, where the gospel is said to be "for obedience of faith among all the nations". Paul readily discerned the need of the insistence on obedience in order to form the assembly.
E.S.H. The Lord says to Peter in @Matthew 16, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona". That is the responsible side, before He says, "*thou* art Peter" in regard to the revelation.
J.T. He is taken up by the responsible name, but the Lord has in mind to change it, and to constitute Peter material for the assembly. That is in keeping with Matthew, for it is not simply a question of light but of material. The revelation involved light, of course, that Christ is the Son of the living God, but then there was need for material; there was need for an assembly, and the Lord had in mind to build one, and Peter was to be the material. I suppose that is what is meant, and, of course, it comes into what we are saying in Matthew, for it is not simply a question of light or doctrine, but the material for the assembly, and the idea of *making* in order to add to it.
Ques. Does that bear on the difference you are making between teaching and legislation? Will you open that out a little more?
J.T. It would be the difference between the universities or the schools and the House of Commons. The House of Commons is the place of legislation, of making laws, and then there is the administration of the laws. Administration calls for principles and hence the need of certain laws being laid down, but teaching is for children to start with. They are to be brought up in the truth of things, so that they can handle things when the
{160}
time comes. Therefore the idea of formation or making, which we are dealing with now, is of first-rate importance.
P.L. With regard to this *making*, it says of David's mighty men, that he "made them chiefs", @1 Chronicles 12: 18.
Ques. In verse 24 of chapter 4 we see a large range of enemy power, but there is power down here to meet it. The Lord had to say to every form of it and He healed those who needed healing. Is that all in view of teaching?
J.T. That is why, I think, Matthew omits the ascension. It is to stress the idea of the presence of the Lord here. We have to understand the presence of the Lord here continuously as applied to assembly service as well as to service generally.
W.C. As to light springing up, would the thought apply now in local assemblies?
J.T. I think it would. So the local assembly is immediately mentioned by Paul in the first epistle to the Corinthians. It is to support Matthew. The apostle would imply that the truth of Matthew has to be maintained, and that it had to be maintained at Corinth. The Lord said to Paul, "I have much people in this city", @Acts 18: 10. That is important to keep in mind because of the need of formation and teaching and of administration too. So that in the beginning of Corinthians we have *the assembly*. The first mention of the assembly in Corinthians is in chapter 1, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth". That is a great expression which is in keeping with @Matthew 16.
P.H.H. Is the local position hinted at in the reference to the Lord Jesus leaving Nazareth and going and dwelling at Capernaum? Is that to lay some stress on the locality where the Lord is?
J.T. I think that is right. It is to a locality that would not be any advantage to Him or to anybody, physically. Capernaum would be considerably lower even than the surface of the Mediterranean. Therefore there was a disadvantage in dwelling at Capernaum in
{161}
preference to Nazareth, which was a considerable number of feet higher.
Ques. Does the appellation. "Men of Galilee" in @Acts 1: 11 suggest that the truth had taken shape in a substantial sense, that they had been made?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord took great pains in dealing with certain facts needed to adjust the saints. Among them were such things as divorce and the like; matters that were of great importance in the households. Undoubtedly @Matthew 5 was intended to lay the basis for the assembly in the sense of teaching. In this part of Matthew He is directing the disciples to their Father, to God, for they were to be imitators of their Father in the heavens.
Ques. As to the process of *making*; is the putting of the material together in mind in @Matthew 16 in the Lord's word, "I will build my assembly"?
J.T. Just so. The first thought as to building we get is in @Genesis 2 in reference to the woman.
A.H.G. Has the sovereignty of God to be recognised in connection with the thought of making, as we see in @Romans 9: 20, "Shall the thing formed say to him that has formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?"
J.T. We are to be submissive and not to admit of our own will in what God does. I think the great letters to Corinth, especially the first, are in keeping with that. They are to maintain the truth of Matthew in the local position.
F.C.H. As to things being effaced and nailed to the cross, would the record of the forsaking of Christ so definitely mentioned in Matthew have this in view?
J.T. It is remarkable that the forsaking is found there and in Mark. The cross is stressed in the epistle to the Colossians, to which you have alluded. The thought of nailing things to the cross, would refer, I think, to Jewish things, and they are the most difficult to handle.
{162}
G.W.B. Would the Lord's word in chapter 18, "two of you", imply formation in those who agree and ask?
J.T. Quite so. The idea of agreement must be there, and it is to ask the "Father who is in the heavens", showing that the heavenly side is also found in Matthew. The *you* in the expression "two of you" is, I think, an allusion to the assembly, for the assembly is formed of persons. It was a great thing to belong to that company and their number is given at the beginning. It says, "the crowd of names who were together was about a hundred and twenty", @Acts 1: 15. That is ten times twelve. I suppose there is something in that, but it was a great matter to belong to that company. There is no such august group of people on the earth as the assembly, but then it is not simply a group of people, it is a building, as the Lord said, "on this rock I will build my assembly", @Matthew 16: 18.
Ques. Are there special occasions when the name *disciples* might have application to us now?
J.T. The word is not much used in the epistles; it is more used in the gospels. It is more initial, and I believe that the Spirit of God would in this link on with Enoch; that is to say, with the idea of learning. He is the seventh from Adam, the principle of learning being cumulative.
W.H. In verse 19, the Lord says to Peter and Andrew, "I will make you fishers of men"; but in the case of the other two brothers, He does not use any such expression.
J.T. In @Matthew 4: 21, in connection with James and John, I think, the idea of the father is in mind, for they were with their father; that is not mentioned as to Peter and Andrew. What characterises them is that they are brothers; brothers in the flesh, and the Lord sees that they were casting a net into the sea. It says, "for they were fishers"; that is, their occupation is in mind and they are working on their own; they are not working
{163}
with their father. It is not a family affair. Then the Lord brings in this thought, "I will make you fishers of men", and it says, "they, having left their trawl-nets, immediately followed him". That means that the principle of leaving something enters into this whole matter. It is not simply that I have a side line to my own affairs, and that side line is Christianity, or the gospel, or the like, but that my main thought is in my business. That will not do for the Lord or the Spirit of God. It says "they ... left their trawl-nets, immediately". Luke adds to that somewhat and says, "leaving all they followed him". Then it goes on here to say, "And going on thence he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending their trawl-nets, and he called them; and they, having left the ship and their father, immediately followed him". They do something further, for they left the ship *and their father*. The others left their trawl-nets but John and James, I would think, are to be noted as having left more.
P.L. Would the brotherly reference of Luke to Matthew, the writer of this gospel, emphasise that? He says, speaking of Matthew, "having left all, rising up, he followed him", @Luke 5: 28. It is such a one who writes this gospel.
Ques. Have you in mind that these two sets of brothers are, in a way, an advance on the idea of disciples, having the assembly in view?
J.T. I think so, especially with the thought of *making* added to it, for there would be skill acquired thus. We need skill in handling the things of God. John puts Peter and Andrew together, and tells us that Andrew had sought out Peter.
Ques. Would "fishing" be on the line of the gospel, but "the mending of the nets" be the maintenance of right principles to preserve what is caught? Both are required in the working out of the truth formatively.
{164}
J.T. Quite so. In @John 21 the Lord takes in hand the restoration of the disciples who had turned away from the service, but John does not say that the Lord reproved them. That is to say, John would ease things a bit, and make restoration as easy as possible for us. It is not that principles or the truth are forsaken, of course, but the Lord does not reprove them, and that, I think, is a very important thing to keep in mind. They went fishing, it says, but they did not catch anything. In the earlier instruction in @Luke 5 the catch was very large and the partners are brought into it, but in @John 21 they did not catch anything; nevertheless, the Lord does not reprove them, and it is to be added with comfort, that they found on the beach "a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread". Whoever caught the fish, or made the bread, is not stated, but the Lord invited them to dine, without a word of reproof. Then He says, "Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken". There were one hundred and fifty-three great fishes which shows the result of the Lord coming in without reproof. Someone has spoken about the Lord's 'unrebuking gaze'. Even in such circumstances He can, if necessary, reserve His rebuke and He reserved it here in instructing the seven who went out fishing. The fish were brought, and then the probing ensues, but the probing of Peter is to bring out that this man, of whom the Lord said He would make him a fisher of men, had to do something *himself*. He had to probe himself as to whether he loved the Lord more than the others did.
Ques. Is there instruction in the use of the word for *mending* in @Matthew 4: 21, and in its being the same as *united* in @1 Corinthians 1: 10 and *restore* in @Galatians 6: 1?
J.T. That helps as to the restoration, or recovery of the brethren. We need not always contemplate disciplinary action in our first approach to a matter causing sorrow. It may have to come, but it ought to be the last thought, for we want to gain the brethren; that
{165}
is what the word in @Galatians 6 means, "Ye who are spiritual restore such a one". It is not 'if you can', but it is assumed that they *can* do it.
Ques. Do you mean that, although it may become impossible, restoration would be the primary object in view in any visitation?
J.T. This is discipline, of course; yet, at the same time, although the apostle is severe in his word to the Galatians, he is not severe in chapter 6 as to someone taken in a fault.
P.H.H. Would the section of @John 21 to which you have referred be a sample of "whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them"?
J.T. Just so. That is what the Lord says. Remission is a very important matter.
It is thought that @Matthew 28 augments what we began with, namely what happened at Capernaum. There we have the thought of light springing up instead of coming down, and what we have already remarked as to formation. Chapter 28 brings in the work they are given to do; to "make disciples of all the nations". These would be a most difficult kind of people, because they are nations, they are not trained from the divine standpoint; they are just raw material, but the Lord proposes that they should make disciples of them. Governed by this thought in the little work that we have to do; that is, the brethren with whom we are all walking, we are endeavouring to get souls. The Lord's word is, "Yet will I gather others to him, besides those that are gathered". @Isaiah 56: 8. We are entitled to expect gathering, but it is with persons who are already, more or less, affected by the truth of Christianity generally, that we have to deal.
Eu.R. There were disciples whom Paul could embrace in @Acts 20. They had been made, and then it says there were many lights. Is that like light springing up?
J.T. I think they would be suggestive of the seven whom Paul had with him. They were the evidences of
{166}
his work in different localities, so that the places whence they came are mentioned. I believe that God's intent was that Paul should have evidences of his work, which could be examined at any time. According to @Galatians 2: 1, Titus was there at Jerusalem, at the meeting recorded in @Acts 15, and Paul says they did not compel him to be circumcised. The fact is that they could not produce anyone better than Titus at Jerusalem. I think the workman should have some example or model to show what can be done or what he has done.
Ques. Some effect of his ministry in a person?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. Whether it be his wife or his child, or anybody near by, or whoever it may be, bring them forward to show what can be done. It is not simply what God can do, but what the disciples can do. We have already alluded to David and what happened in the cave of Adullam. It is a question not only of what these men had been, but what they became through David's training and example, and the prophetic word of Gad too (@1 Samuel 22: 5). The position in Judah is to be added too, for Judah's was a place of special favour in the counsels of God. The prophet's word on that occasion was, "get thee into the land of Judah".
P.H.H. Is the reference to *power* in @Matthew 28 all the more remarkable seeing that the company was incomplete? There are only eleven disciples, and it says of them that "some doubted". Would that be an encouragement to us in our day to understand that the power is not diminished?
J.T. Quite so. As we approach chapter 28, many questions are raised in our minds. There is what the soldiers did, and what the Jews did. What stumbling-blocks there were to obstruct the work of God! The Lord, however, does not instruct His own near Jerusalem, but He says, "go into Galilee". They are only eleven, and they have to go a long way to meet Him. Later that company would be restored to its number twelve.
{167}
Allusion has been made to the idea of mending in @Matthew 4: 21, and @1 Corinthians 1, and then Paul's word in @Galatians 6: 1 to the restoration of a soul.
The word *restore* has reference to a person who has been taken in some sin. @John 8 tells us about one who was taken in sin, and it tells us, too, how the Lord met that case. But the apostle says, "ye who are spiritual restore such a one"; so that when we come to discipline, we must think of those who are spiritual. It is not simply those that are at the care meeting, but those who are spiritual; that is the point that Paul makes. "Ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest *thou* also be tempted". The apostle Paul carries the thing through as expressing what Christianity implies in relation to recovery. We are living in a time of recovery, and the way of Paul is the thing to be kept in mind. The Lord selected him for a purpose, and he was to be an example to everybody. So he stresses the idea of persons who are spiritual, and that they are to restore the man. It is not *if* they can do it, but they are to *do* it.
P.L. The scrutiny in the healing of the leper to be restored is exclusively in the hands of the priests?
J.T. That is what it is exactly, so the Lord sends the leper to the priest.
A.McG. Would Elihu's service to Job help? He says, "If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto man his duty", @Job 33: 23. The footnote to the word *duty* gives the meaning as *in judging himself*.
J.T. That helps.
E.B. I would like to ask whether "taken in some fault" in @Galatians 6 is merely a sudden lapse, or whether it may even include a grave case of evil?
J.T. We are not told what the case is; he is taken in it, however. It is not in the sense that he is caught in it, or overtaken in it. The fault is there and the thing is unquestionable. What the apostle intimates is that the
{168}
spiritual are capable of restoring *such a one*, and that is, I believe, to bring out the superiority of Christianity in the epistle to the Galatians.
E.B. So that the scripture in Galatians applies to cases of evil.
J.T. That is, to certain cases.
A.M. It is remarkable that the ministry of James closes with that service. "He that brings back a sinner from the error of his way".
J.T. Yes, quite so. "Shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins". That is to bring out the greatness of the action.
Rem. In view of what you are saying, and the balancing of the scriptures, it is noticeable that there is no suggestion of this kind when Paul writes in @1 Corinthians 5.
J.T. There is not. There is, however, something to be said there, that the Corinthians did not think that the man would be restored so soon.
Rem. I was thinking rather of the call to action, so to speak, and the characteristics mentioned in the list that Paul gives in @1 Corinthians 5. It is a course indulged in so that the person has, for the time at least, been characterised by something. Wisdom is needed to determine into what category a matter falls.
J.T. Quite so. Only that Paul says of the person, "being such". The thing must be clear, that he is what is stated. Then the word is, "that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus". That is the point; but then the Corinthians were not ready for the early recovery of the man, and that is a thing to be noticed. They were not restoring him when they might have done so. He was already recovered in his soul and they did not apparently know it.
Rem. In @1 Corinthians 5 it says they were not mourning about the sin. They were allowing the sin and even glorying in it, so that it was necessary that the
{169}
truth should be brought home in such a powerful way by Paul.
J.T. Quite so. In the whole company.
Ques. Is it not a fact that those who may be lax in regard of what may be required for assembly action may also be lax in discerning the work of God in a person who is repentant?
J.T. Therefore the need of having an eye for anything of God in the person. Sometimes it is said, Well, just leave him or her, as the case may be. "Ephraim is joined to idols: leave him alone", @Hosea 4: 17. That may be true sometimes, but then is that so in every case?
E.C.M. In the second epistle the apostle says, "ye should rather show grace and encourage, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief", @2 Corinthians 2: 7. Would that link up with the thought of the priest?
J.T. Quite. That is the priest's work. All these things suppose the existence of the priest, and the Lord would not expect us to effect the things unless the priest was there. So Leviticus always assumes the presence of the priest. It is not *if* he is there; it always assumes that he is there.
Ques. Then supposing the priest visits and cannot bear testimony to any alleviating circumstance, he does not proceed with restoration at the time, does he? With the leper, for instance, there were certain matters that would preclude him coming back to the camp. So is it not a question of determining, at the time, the category into which the person comes?
J.T. Just so.
P.H.H. It says in @Leviticus 14: 3, "when the priest looketh, and behold, the sore of leprosy is healed in the leper". Would that be like the work of God which must precede the process of cleansing and restoring, as we might say, to fellowship?
J.T. There is hardly time to go into that chapter now but it is very important to examine the process
{170}
Of restoring the leper and its bearing on the restoration of a man or woman to fellowship, after they have forfeited it by their conduct. Chapter 14 gives us an account of that, and it is remarkable to note these things that are mentioned; especially the priest and how the anointing oil is poured into his hand and then put on the he ad of the cleansed leper, so that he is anointed. He is set up; as Galatians would say, he is restored. The word *restore*, according to the note, means *mending* him; setting him up again to function among the saints; that is what is meant.
P.L. Would the going down of pain and the embrace of Eutychus be a little like the priest going outside the camp and restoring Eutychus to his privileges and place? You referred once, happily, I thought, to the Lord on the cross in relation to His service to the dying thief, going out as the priest in relation to the leper. Do you too not think there should be more preparedness with us Identity oneself with the condition?
J.T. I think Galatians is remarkable, because the word *restore*, in view of what it means, shows that the thing is completely done. The person has forfeited his position and he is useless in the service, but he is to be set up again. That I understand, is the meaning of the word, so that the brother or sister is set up again as he used to be.
P.L. "Mark ... profitable to me for the ministry"?
J.T. Exactly. So that we have not lost him.
J.C.W. Would you say what you had in mind when you distinguished between being overtaken and taken?
J.T. The word *overtaken* is not there. The person, whoever he or she may be, is taken in the fault, like the woman in John g. The fault is unquestionable; you have no need to prove it; but the point is to restore him; set him up again to be of use in the economy of God.
Ques. Does all this involve that we are in the good of "all things whatsoever I have enjoined you"; that we ourselves are held in relation to divine legislation? If
{171}
there is looseness with us in matters we shall be loose in our dealings with others.
J.T. I am sure that is right.
P.L. Would you say the great outstanding features of the dispensation shine severally in the bringing in of I, teach of the divine Persons, who give character to it; the Father, in grace; the Son, in liberty and dignity; and the Holy Spirit, in power?
J.T. Exactly, and the Holy Spirit is here with you *all* the time in a peculiarly personal way. Matthew also tells us that the Lord said, "behold, I am with you all the days". That has to be understood according to what was in the Lord's mind, but the Spirit is here in a permanent way as the Lord said, "I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever". What is meant, I am sure, is the first-hand knowledge that the Spirit has of all that relates to the testimony and its requirements. He knows what has happened from the beginning.
P.L. So the "communion of the Holy Spirit" (@2 Corinthians 13: 14), refers to His place here as the Companion of the saints in the wilderness and in the assembly as in Corinthians?
J.T. Quite. Paul's word in @1 Corinthians 12: 3, is very striking; "no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit". The Spirit must be here if the service of God is to go on, and to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus must not simply be in words, but in feeling. That is what is implied, I am certain, in the idea of the power of the Holy Spirit.
{172}
THE SUBJECTIVE SIDE OF THE TRUTH (2)
@John 3: 1 - 8; @John 4: 7 - 14
J.T. It is thought that John's ministry was reserved by the Lord to cover the whole dispensation, with special reference to the closing days, in view of the subjective side of the truth. Christendom has lost that side of the truth in having recourse to creeds and mere doctrines, whereas the Lord had in mind that the Spirit should be here, and that, as having come, the Spirit would remain here until the coming of the Lord and it is believed that the recent revival, in which we have part, is the outcome of this. The Spirit had been here even in the darkest ages, but under great disadvantages, because of the systematic religion which held the saints in its power. Where that is admitted it will ever obstruct the working out of the truth. These scriptures are read having all this in mind. Nicodemus provides us an example of one to whom the Lord could speak. He was a gifted man, or a minister, but an inquiring man. That is essential, for inquiries are used, under the Lord, to bring out the truth; they may expose themselves, and their ignorance, but they serve the purpose. Nicodemus, as we have often noted, is distinguished in the "But" of the first verse of chapter 3. It says of the Lord in the previous paragraph, "when he was in Jerusalem, at the Passover, at the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he wrought. But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them". That is to be noted; it is not simply that He did not trust *them*, but He "did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man". The whole race of man was thus under the Lord's eye and known to Him, and, although many made inquiry as to the truth, not being able to resist the testimony of the signs, the Lord did not trust Himself to them. I suppose He would not trust Himself
{173}
to any save those in whom the Holy Spirit had liberty, and fully to the assembly.
Ques. Do you mean the "But ... Nicodemus" lifts him out of the class the Lord could not trust? He is thus representative of those in whom God was operating.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. It indicates that eventually there would be someone to whom the Lord could commit Himself. Systematic religion is not trustworthy as to the Lord, whatever terms it may use; even though they may be right up to a point, He cannot be trusted to them.
A.H.G. Does the *Himself* involve the truth of His Person?
J.T. I would say that. In chapter 2 it is said that they inquire of the Lord for a sign, and He says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple building, and thou wilt raise it up in three days? But he spoke of the temple of his body. When therefore he was raised from among the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken". I should hardly think, by his bringing the spices for the Lord's burial, that Nicodemus had ever come to that sign and what the Lord implied in raising up His body. John in his record makes the most of Nicodemus, but that most was not very much. He was, in a certain sense, a genuine kind of man, but he remained in the council of the Jews. There are many like that today, persons who remain in the world's councils, yet professing some regard for the Lord.
Ques. Is the value of the incident really in the truth that the Lord brings out of it, rather than in Nicodemus himself?
J.T. The thing that the Lord brought out of it was from Himself, not from what Nicodemus said, for Nicodemus said some poor things. At the same time, as we have said, there was something there, but we do
{174}
not want to identify ourselves, in this hour of the dispensation, with Nicodemuses, because they are not fully reliable. If we would have the truth we have to trust in the Lord Himself, and what He brings out.
P.H.H. The whole race of man being in view here, is it also in view now, that there should be a new race on the principle of new birth, a race which the Lord can own, and in whom God can operate?
J.T. That is just what I was thinking. It is said, "Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men". That is, whether they were Jews or gentiles. We have arrived now at much that men are saying, about God and Christ, but they are very untrustworthy things, even although those who say them have reputation and their systems may have reputation. So it goes on to say, "he had not need that any should testify of man", not of any particular man, but man as a race, as an order of being, "for himself knew what was in man".
Ques. Is that what Paul had in his mind when he said to the partisans, at Corinth, "are ye not carnal, and walk as men?", @1 Corinthians 3: 3. They had not been delivered from that order, had they?
J.T. Take anything there is today, whether it be legislative councils, or governments or religious councils; whether it be American, Asiatic, or European, there really is nothing to be trusted, when it comes to the Lord Himself. There is not a thing that can be relied upon to look after the Lord and His interests any more than there was when He was a Babe.
F.C.H. What is involved in verse 22, where it says that the "disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken"?
J.T. It shows that the Lord's resurrection was awaited for the confirmation of everything. Thus the endings of the gospels are intended to provide that confirmation, for they are a witness to the Lord's resurrection.
{175}
But then there is more than that, for the Lord is not only risen but He is ascended, and the Holy Spirit has been sent down.
A.H.G. Where it speaks in the end of the gospel of Jesus Himself standing in the midst, would that indicate that a certain trustworthiness had been brought to light?
J.T. Quite so. There it was, in @John 20: 16. Mary Magdalene herself had proved what was needed, for she says, "Rabboni", meaning 'My Teacher'. She becomes representative of the results of real Christian teaching, reliable teaching, as distinct from the creeds; and not teaching from merely educated persons, or the universities. Then another thing comes up, the shutting of the doors, and that brings up the question of the mystery. It has to be understood that things are in mystery, for our position as of the assembly is a mysterious one. The parabolic teaching, recorded by Matthew, implies mystery. Things have to be in mystery for they cannot be trusted to men unless they are men that are truly born again. The foundational thought is the new birth, and that is what we are dealing with now in @John 3.
P.H.H. Does that ensure that trustworthiness shall be there from the very start, because it is God's action?
J.T. Just so. The Lord says, in answer to Nicodemus, "Verily, verily". Notice the words "Verily, verily" here, which occur twenty-five times in this gospel, and not at all elsewhere in this double form. We must have what is really true in Christianity. "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God". He might be the most brilliant man, so to say, in any province of science, but, whatever else he may see, he cannot see the kingdom.
Ques. Do you think we arrive practically, in the history of our souls, at the necessity of new birth, as over against the acceptance of it as doctrine?
J.T. Just so. There are those who make much of it; not that we want to speak of others, but it is the beginning and end of Christianity with some. We have
{176}
to go deeper than mere stereotyped ideas and confession for the truth, in order to discover where people are in their souls.
Ques. Is what we are dealing with here really the start in the sovereign operations of God which are at last recognised in the expression of the man in @Romans 7 when he says "*I myself*"?
J.T. I would say that. "*I myself*" is the real man. You notice similar reference here, as to the Lord Himself -- "Jesus himself", @John 2: 24.
W.C. What is the distinction between what we had this morning as to God with us, and then this thought of the Lord trusting Himself to persons? You were saying that the fact that Jesus Himself did not trust Himself to man implied that conditions were in view to which He could trust Himself. Would that be to reinforce the position, as seen in Matthew, in a subjective way?
J.T. I think so. We are speaking of @Matthew 4 and the light *springing up*; then the number of persons who followed the Lord was stressed; and then the regulation of the persons on the mount of legislation; chapters 5 to 7. It is important to have before us that it was not simply the mount of administration, but the mount of legislation, where right laws were enacted, or unfolded; the word *unfold* was used as to Moses in @Deuteronomy 1: 5. He unfolded the law, and Matthew unfolds the thing that was needed for the assembly in its government. I think the idea of the light springing up would show that the Lord had come in in relation to a certain class or race of people. The generation of Jesus Christ, in Matthew, is traced through forty-two generations, three sets of fourteen. It is as if God would test out what there was in Israel in view of His Son coming in and being received here. The many generations with which the testimony has been identified up to our own time must be tested out so as to discover what is reliable. God had been working from the very beginning and
{177}
continued through these forty-two generations. They are not taken from Adam; they are taken from Abraham; that is to say, it began with a man sovereignly selected by God. We have to bear all that in mind in order to get at Matthew's point of view.
W.C. Do you mean that John goes back further still to man as such?
J.T. Yes. He goes on to the *Word*. He says, "In the beginning was the Word". That is to say, One capable of unfolding the mind of God. John has in mind not simply the setting forth of signs, but the unfolding of the mind of God.
A.H.G. Would what is here in @John 3 show the basis of trustworthiness?
J.T. It is a question of what the Spirit of God does; that is the point that we are at, and that we can have nothing without Him. That is implied in the start with Abraham, for he is a man that God Himself took up and said to him, "Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward", @Genesis 15: 1. God had a man that He could rely upon, for Abraham was a reliable and trustworthy man; and so are those who are truly his children.
Ques. Do I understand that, whilst in Christ as the Word there was the perfect expression of what God was, it needed God's operation in men for that light to be received?
J.T. Quite so. There was this great thought which had not been understood, although the Old Testament had contained it in principle. The idea of the new birth was there in Ezekiel, but not understood; and the question is whether it is understood now. The first thing is how persons are to see the kingdom. We can easily see man's kingdom, whether it be a republic or whatever else it may be, but we cannot see God's kingdom without this great transaction which is said to be effected by the Spirit. It is to bring out the reality of the Spirit's operations.
{178}
Rem. Ezekiel makes the subjective thought clear in his reference to this, "I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances", @Ezekiel 36: 27.
J.T. Ezekiel has a striking place in the prophets, and amongst the things he deals with is this matter of new birth, and God putting His Spirit within people, which goes beyond new birth. The mere fact of new birth does not mean that a person has the Spirit. It means that he is affected by the Spirit; the operation has taken place.
Ques. Does the Lord, in this gospel, rejoice to call attention to Abraham as one who could see?
J.T. Just so. The Lord says, "Abraham rejoiced to see my day", @John 8: 56. How far-seeing he was! The writer of the epistle to the Hebrews, too, says of those who died in faith that they "not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar off and embraced them", @Hebrews 11: 13.
J.P.H. Would you make a little clearer how you link on what is subjective with this operation in the soul. Is it a necessary foundation for it, or is there a subjective character in it?
J.T. This is a subjective element. The Lord says, "Verily, verily", and again I would remark as to these two words which have a peculiar place in John, the expression occurring twenty-five times. Surely there must be something in it; for it is not recorded elsewhere. John was a truthful, reliable man, and this would accentuate the idea of reliability in ministry. "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew". That, as I understand it, means from top to bottom. (The note, which is important, says, Not only 'again', but 'entirely afresh', as *from* a new source of life and point of departure; translated in @Luke 1: 3, 'from the origin'; that is Luke says he knew "from the origin": that is this same word.) That means, born from a new source entirely.
{179}
Eu.R. Would you explain a little your expression that it affects a person from top to bottom?
J.T. It affects him in all his faculties. It is not physical, but he is affected in a moral sense, although, of course, it will affect his physical members as to how he uses them. It affects all the faculties whatever they may be. I believe that is what is meant.
P.H.H. Would it give the capacity to respond to the light?
J.T. The members we have are also to be controlled; they are to be controlled by the life which we have by the Spirit, resulting from the Spirit *in* us, which is distinct from this operation of new birth. The Spirit dwelling in us *controls* our faculties.
Ques. Is that what Paul means when he says, "the Spirit life on account of righteousness"?
J.T. Just so.
J.P.H. Would it be right to connect @Colossians 3 with this matter? We have such expressions as "Put to death therefore" and then "put off the old man" and "put on the new" mentioned in that chapter.
J.T. I think it can be connected. The new man has to be considered to see how it works out in the history of the race. Has the race been affected by what is presented in the testimony of God, as in Judaism or Christianity? If it has been affected, the evil implied in the old man is apt to develop in that very setting. The old man is perhaps more accentuated in persons who are affected by what is religious. I would like to dwell on this point, for it seems to me that it has not been understood. We have to consider the ways of Egypt and the ways of Canaan. The ways of Egypt represent just the natural state of man as he is without being affected by anything religious, or anything, in any sense, of God. Whereas if man is merely externally affected by what is of God, his character becomes more like the ways of Canaan, and these have especially affected a part of the human race. If you have to deal with that,
{180}
you have the worst kind of evil, the worst features of the old man. Whereas in Colossians the idea of the new man is what is fresh. It is fresh as just affected by God immediately and therefore the more reliable.
Ques. Is that why Moses is so drastic in his instructions to the people in view of their going into Canaan? He says, "Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall dispossess have served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree; and ye shall break down their altars, and shatter their statues, and burn their Asherahs with fire", @Deuteronomy 12: 2, 3.
J.T. The state to be dealt with in Canaan as Israel went into it was solely from the devil, but, if the old man is affected by anything that is professedly of God, the evil state is apt to be more deep and deceptive and subtle.
P.L. Is that why the Egyptian is allowed finally into Israel and the Canaanite excluded?
J.T. Quite so, and the Canaanite is cursed. Noah said: "Cursed be Canaan". Sometimes it is assumed that Ham was cursed, but he is not; it is Canaan that was cursed. It is a man that behaves as Ham's son did.
Eu.R. Would the Lord deliver Nicodemus from all that he was as the teacher of Israel?
J.T. Well, yes, although the Lord rather noticed it. There is something which ought to be noted in any persons we may have to do with like this. This man, who is a teacher, and who is seeking Jesus by night, discerns that He is of God. The Lord says to him, "Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things!" That is to say, the teacher of Israel, in such a man as Nicodemus, might read the Scriptures, and that is not to be despised. If the Scriptures are resorted to, as by Herod in @Matthew 2, to murder Jesus, then it is another matter, but Nicodemus had no such thought. Nicodemus was a man that discerned that Jesus was of God.
{181}
P.H.H. You would say that the giving and receiving of the Spirit are evidently subsequent to this great matter of new birth.
J.T. They are; because the giving and receiving of the Spirit lead us to a higher level of the truth than Nicodemus had reached or was capable of understanding so far. We find it in Paul's ministry. In @Acts 19 reference is made to the giving and receiving of the Spirit. There were twelve men there having John's baptism, the number being in view of administration. They had some light about God and about Christ, but they did not have light about the Spirit. They had not even heard that He was come. But still Paul clearly attaches importance to the administrative number at Ephesus, because of the structure that was intended to be reared up there.
P.H.H. What has the Lord exactly in mind in saying, in verse 5, "Except any one be born of water and of Spirit"? Previously He says "born anew".
J.T. Well, I think "born of water" implies that the doctrine, or teaching, is accompanied by a purifying effect. Now we have the word *regeneration*, which is only found in Matthew and in Titus, and that means something more than an ordinary external change. It would imply the idea of born of water and the Spirit. The regeneration refers to the millennial condition of things, and that implies the presence of the Spirit in some sense here on earth, and the effect of it, and it is called the regeneration.
P.H.H. A wholly new state of things?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. The note to the verse in Titus reads, '*Regeneration* is not the same word as *being born again*, nor is it used so in Scripture. The force of the word is a change of position; a new state of things. The word is only used here, and in @Matthew 19: 28 for the Saviour's coming kingdom'. That is followed in Titus by the
{182}
expression "and renewal of the Holy Spirit". Would not that show that that was subsequent?
J. T. Well, quite so. These references I think help us as to the new birth, and the second reference, which includes the thought of water, implies that a purifying effect is attached to or included in the thought of the new birth.
A.H.G. Would the receiving of the Spirit be involved in being born of water and the Spirit?
J.T. No. The reception of the Spirit is not in either illustration of new birth. Redemption was required which shows that although the Old Testament saints had certain things it was in a very shallow and limited way. Nevertheless they were there and that is what brings out the value of Abraham and the forty-two generations through which the Messiah should come.
Ques. Would you use the word *potential* in relation to this matter, as over against what is substantial? It is not exactly that new birth is the end of a story, but is it not the initial thing in view of a great many other things? Does not the gift of the Spirit and the reception of the Spirit come in subsequently to fill out what is in mind in the potential operation of God?
J.T. Then the Lord says later in the passage, "We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen, and ye receive not our witness. If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe? And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal" (verses 11 - 15). Redemption is implied before one could receive the Spirit and therefore the Old Testament saints did not have the Spirit in the sense in which it is predicated of us. The true sense of the reception of the Spirit was not there, for David had to ask Jehovah
{183}
not to take it from him. There is no such thought as the Spirit being taken from a person now. He remains with us for ever. The great operations of God in believers are contingent upon the Spirit, and not only on the Spirit here, but on the Spirit in the persons.
E.C.M. Does the verse in chapter 7 have any bearing, "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified"?
J.T. It has. He had to be glorified in order that the Spirit should come down. So the word is, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear", @Acts 2: 33. The thing was there substantially.
J.S.E. Would it help to draw a contrast between this statement as to the water and the Spirit, and the statement in the epistle to the Corinthians, "flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom"? Is this presented in Nicodemus, as representing the best in nature up to date, and yet asserting that, on that line, nothing is possible, relative to the kingdom of God?
J.T. That brings up a matter that deserves inquiry. The passage in Corinthians implies the transition from the millennial condition into the eternal state of things and it is a question whether anybody knows what that will be, because flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is a moral thing, and it would seem, in that particular case, to imply the transition from the millennial condition, called the "regeneration", as we have said, into the eternal state of things, for which we are all intended. It is doubtful whether we all understand or whether anyone understands it. What transaction will happen is left somewhat vague in the Scriptures. The millennial condition is a condition set up in order that God should show what He can do with man in the flesh as he is. There is the possibility of sin, yet it is greatly restricted because Satan is bound. But then the transfer will be made from that
{184}
state of things into an eternal state of things where there will be no possibility of sin.
F.C.H. What is the force of the expression, "the promise of the Holy Spirit"?
J.T. I think it is just that the Father had promised Him. It is referred to in the endings of the gospels. The apostles or the saints at that time were told to wait for the Spirit. It was as though the Lord would say, Do not do anything without the Spirit; the Spirit is the great thought of the dispensation, and do not begin to do things without Him. It was not indeed that they did not have to do certain things; for they had to select the twelfth apostle; but there was not much to be done until the Spirit should come. Then, of course, there was much done, and the Spirit of God stresses the much that was done, namely, that three thousand people were converted.
Eu.R. Would you say something as to verse 6, "that which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit".
J.T. The word *is* there is important and shows what is really brought about by this transaction of the Spirit in the believer. There is something that can be designated as *spirit*. It is important to keep the naming of things in mind. In the beginning of Genesis God named things. It says, He called the light, Day; and He called the expanse, Heavens. Then Adam named things and what we are dealing with now has to be named. We have already alluded to certain Christians and how they deal with the question of new birth. I do not believe they have the right thought, because they think new birth is everything. If a person is converted and has the Spirit, according to them, he is born again; whereas he may be born again and not have the Spirit. They do not know how to distinguish between these two things.
Ques. Is "born of the Spirit" an advance on "born anew"?
{185}
J.T. The new birth is set out in the first remarks of the Lord to Nicodemus, but it is not easy to say just what is alluded to in the actual transaction. When we come to the second remark of the Lord, you would expect that He would increase, because it was somewhat a vague matter. Although the Old Testament had spoken of it, it was not known much, so when the Lord refers to it the second time He adds the thought, "born of water and of the Spirit". That helps us to understand that the idea of purification is added to the transaction called new birth.
Rem. Then subsequent to that, this remark, "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit". It is something at least sufficient to be named.
J.T. That is what I was thinking.
P.H.H. Does the Lord carry that forward in the next chapter when He speaks to the woman as to the worship of God. He says, "they who worship him must worship him in spirit". Is it something more substantial now which can distinguish the worship of God in persons?
J.T. Very good. So when Paul comes to the time when he feels it necessary to say what the worship of Christians is, he says, "*we* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh", @Philippians 3: 3. That is to say, the worship of God implies the entire rejection of the flesh; there is to be no confidence placed in it at all.
A.D.T. Would "born of God", in chapter 1, be a further thought?
J.T. I think it is. Although the Spirit is God, it does not say born of God here. It says "born of water and of the Spirit". But "born of God", I would say, is the full thought of Christianity. Thus, according to chapter 1, everyone born of God has the liberty to take the place of the children of God, and the word "children" there implies the basic relationship which underlies our
{186}
sonship from the standpoint of the heavenly calling. This relationship is connected with us down here where we need the care of God, and corresponds with our place of dignity as His sons. Sonship for us gives the full dignity of our position in heaven, for God is said to be bringing many *sons* to glory. The word *children* is not used in that connection.
Ques. Had that not already been evidenced by the reception of Christ?
J.T. Yes. "As many as received him". Being born of God is a complete transaction, involving Christianity, and would be inclusive of being born anew.
W.C. Would the woman in chapter 4 be born of God?
J.T. I do not know about that, because she had not received the Spirit. No one received the Spirit until Christ was glorified, as it says, "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified". That brings the thing into definiteness, for the gift of the Spirit is from a glorified Christ.
J.P.H. When she says, in verse 17, "I have not a husband", is that the water operating, "born of water"?
J.T. Very good.
Eu.R. Is the full thought of persons born of God reached experimentally by way of the verse in @Romans 7, "I *myself* ... serve God's law", so that we have sons and children in @Romans 8?
J.T. The way is made for @Romans 8 by @Romans 7. In chapter 8 there are many references to the Spirit of God in the believer, and that brings out the greatness of the Holy Spirit, and of His being in the believer.
P.H.H. Would you say a word on Peter's expression "being born again, ... by the living and abiding word of God", @1 Peter 1: 23.
J.T. Peter confirms what John says. He confirms what Paul says too, but especially what John says. Peter says that it is by the incorruptible seed, by the living and abiding word of God. It is the action of the word
{187}
of God, implying the revelation of God, and it is apprehended through the mind. The allusion there is to the power that effected the birth of the persons through the presentation to the mind of the incorruptible word of God. I hope the brethren will just think of that and give it its true place. The mind has to be taken into account if we are dealing with the word, and it is a question of God being apprehended through the mind, the result of the word of God acting on the mind of men. If it is a question of the birth of the man, the whole man is involved in the sense of his mind or his intelligence.
Ques. Is that confirmed by what the Lord says in @Matthew 13: 51 as to the sowing of the word? "Have ye understood all these things?" and, in @Mark 4: 13 He says, "Do ye not know this parable? and how will ye be acquainted with all the parables?"
J.T. Quite so. But @Matthew 13 says that they did understand, for the disciples say, "Yea, Lord", and the Lord did not deny it. Then He proceeds to speak of what a disciple is, "every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old". He is intelligent as to what he is dealing with. It is not simply what he has objectively, but he has things new and old in his treasure.
A.B. Peter refers to the pure mental milk of the word. Is that the mind of the believer being fed?
J.T. Well, that is good. That is just what was in mind; it is a question of that faculty, the mental part of man. Paul says, "*we* have the mind of Christ"; that is the idea; it is the thinking faculty of Christ.
Rem. Mr. Darby's note to that verse in Peter says, that 'the word here translated *mental* has the sense of *suited to the rational faculties -- the mind in contrast with the body*'.
J.T. We are slack on the point of the mind and especially so at the Lord's supper. The Lord says, that we are to do what He did at the Lord's supper,
{188}
*for the calling of Me to mind*. See note to @1 Corinthians 11: 24. That is to show, that the *mind* has a great place as we sit down to partake of the Lord's supper.
P.H.H. How does the woman in @John 4 fit into this picture?
J.T. She fits into it well. The Lord has taken her on and, although weary with His journey, He was pleased to converse with her and to listen to her natural thoughts. We all have these natural thoughts and they unquestionably interfere with spiritual thoughts, but I think she comes into it in that way. The Lord allowed her to give out her experience and thoughts and then He proceeds until He calls her *Woman*. She is learning and the Lord proceeds to make something of her by His teaching. She had said, "I see that thou art a prophet". As soon as she begins to see things, and discerns that He is a prophet, then the Lord calls her *Woman*.
F.C.H. It says in verse 5, that the setting of the incident was "near to the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph". Does not that bring out the thought of the spiritual addition there is in the chapter? Joseph's name means *He will add*.
J.T. I believe the idea of addition was in this woman, because she left her water-pot. That would not add to her any more, for, when you come to this matter of birth and the living water, our belongings do not add to any of us. The vessel, whatever it may be, even a business, does not add to us, so this woman left it, and went away into the city and said, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?" That was the whole point.
P.L. The Lord using the word *woman* shows that in His mind she is stripped of her circumstantial environment and stands out according to the work of God that needs no appurtenances.
J.T. Quite so. She left her water-pot; this is recorded for a purpose. Paul, in visiting Troas, had the effects of his work accompanying him, but here the
{189}
Lord has not the disciples with Him. They should have been there to give fulness to what He was saying, but they were not there. That brings out the necessity of the brethren being present when the testimony of God is being unfolded. The Lord will use us to add to what He is saying, to bring it out, because, as we have said, it is a question of persons.
E.C.M. Did the Lord take the woman on with a view to securing her as a vessel for the reception of the Spirit?
J.T. Quite so. He took her on at the very outset in view of what He had in mind. He knew all about her, but there had to be this exposure of the number of husbands she had and so forth. We have come to a time in the history of society in which the marriage tie has become weakened and the family damaged. So here the question of husbands comes up, and when she says, "I have no husband", the Lord accredits her with telling the truth. When we come to Christianity, the whole matter as to society and as to men and as to families has to be settled. Thus this woman has to be exposed, and the Lord does not stop in His instruction, until we come to the very topmost thought, and that is that man is to worship God.
P.H.H. Is there a suggestion in the mention of the prophet that God would answer all these questions nowadays by a word in ministry? The woman says, "Sir, I see that thou art a prophet", and she says it as the result of the Lord exposing her. Would you say that all the practical exercises amongst us might find their settlement according to the mind of God, in the meeting for ministry, as it is called?
J.T. Quite so. Then the question is whether we have prophets. The woman definitely distinguishes the Lord as a prophet; she says, "I see that thou art a prophet". If we have them then we will get the solutions of our difficulties.
{190}
P.L. Is that the perception that attaches to "let the others judge" in @1 Corinthians 14: 29?
J.T. In all these matters dealing with the assembly and its order, and the persons who form it, we are bound to come back to Corinth. God has revived the prophetic meetings. It is supported by the first book of Samuel, and the mention of "the hill of God", @1 Samuel 10: 5. That is where the power of God is. In Samuel the hill was in the hands of the Philistines, but it should not have been. The service of the prophet would soon make way for the hill of God. So @1 Corinthians 14 contemplates the whole assembly coming together in one place. No matter how many sub-divisions there may be, when they come together in one place the hill of God is there. It is all that God has in the town or the city, and the prophets will bring out, therefore, what there may be. If there is anything to be solved, there will be light through the prophets.
Ques. Would the fact that Samuel was a judge and established to be a prophet show the intimate link between what is prophetic and what belongs to the legislation that we were speaking about this morning?
J.T. Yes. It says of him that none of his words fell to the ground. You just wonder how much there is in ministry that does not fall to the ground. I believe the idea is that the prophetic word reaches the saints. The point is, that if the saints are listening, and if their consciences are in exercise they will be listening, then, instead of the prophet's words disappearing into thin air or falling to the ground, they will fall into honest and good hearts.
P.L. Would the record of Samuel's death also indicate the choice fruit of the seed he sowed, in Abigail for David?
J.T. Just so. She had an understanding of David and could speak about him as bound up in the bundle of life with Jehovah his God.
{191}
E.C.M. Do you connect the idea of preservation with the prophetic ministry? Hosea says, "By a prophet Jehovah brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved", @Hosea 12: 13.
J.T. Quite so.
Eu.R. The Lord designating her *woman* involves the reaching of a subjective result?
J.T. I think so. Jesus says to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father". He addresses her as "woman" as if she was now qualified to be so regarded by herself.
P.H.H. Does the Lord raise the question of His Person in His earlier remark, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink"? Is there a suggestion there that we are to be prepared for the greatness of the Lord in His Person to dominate this position, both as the Giver of the water, and then the Prophet, and then the One who speaks about the service of God?
J.T. That brings up what we have already alluded to in chapter 2. It says there, "Jesus himself did not trust himself to them", but this woman would be trusted. I think she represents the trustworthy quality, because the Lord goes on to speak to her about the greatest things. He speaks about the worship of the Father. He could commit to her even such elevated thoughts as that. I do not believe that the leaders of the national and publicly accredited churches could give you the true thought of worship, yet the Lord speaks about it to this woman and she would understand.
C.O.B. Linking chapters 3 and 4 together, would you say that the operations of the Spirit have in view the worship of God?
J.T. I was thinking that we might come to that in chapter 4. This woman is singled out in the Lord's mind, and in the facts that are mentioned by the Spirit, because it says of her in verse 27, "And upon this came
{192}
his disciples"; they now come in. Then it says they "wondered that he spoke with a woman; yet no one said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? The woman then left her waterpot and went away into the city, and says to the men, Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?" She now comes to the Person. It is what we get in @Matthew 1, "the generation of Jesus Christ", for we come there to the idea of the Christ. There are forty-two generations leading us up to that. "The generation of Jesus Christ"; what a process preceded the Christ! Now we come to the idea of the worship of God, and, as we learn from Hebrews, Christ is the Minister of the sanctuary; the worship of God is in His hands. The woman understood and called Him the Christ. She put it that way, as if to say, Is it not really so that He is the Christ?
Ques. Do you think she was using her mind? Was it not a calculation that she had arrived at?
J.T. I think so. She was developing in intelligence.
A.H.G. Would the need for intelligence be pointed out in the Lord's words, "we worship what we know"?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. So that the culmination of new birth is a worshipper?
J.T. I think that is what the passages we have read mean. We have come to the worship of God, and surely that is the main thought now in our times. The evangelisation of men, too, is a very important thing, but I think the service of God is what God is stressing amongst us.
Ques. Have you in mind also the power to take it on, so that the matter is filled out with spiritual substance as the result of this subjective, formative work?
J.T. Quite so. There she is. The Spirit of God singles her out. She left her water-pot and she goes to the men. She does not go to the women to talk about things, but to the men, and the inquiry she makes is:
{193}
"Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done is not *he* the Christ?"
P.L. So that the great thought of the worship by the Spirit of God in Philippians, is linked on with the greatness of the surrender. Everything that is of man is parted with, the race of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin (see @Philippians 3: 3 - 7). Is not worship bound up with sacrifice? David said, "Neither will I offer ... unto the Lord ... that which doth cost me nothing", @2 Samuel 24: 24.
J.T. Quite so.
P.H.H. Would Obed, the worshipper, coming from Ruth, suggest the true substance arrived at in a subjective way?
J.T. Very good. He is the progenitor of David, who is the sweet psalmist of Israel. The whole matter thus hangs together in the Scriptures.
P.L. Does our power to rise and soar in the spiritual realm lie in our power to part with the natural?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Have you not had in mind all through that the worship of God really requires persons who are formed spiritually and who conduct themselves suitably in it? It is not merely taking the matter on by way of creed or doctrine, but being formed inwardly in relation to the God whom we are worshipping.
J.T., Thus Paul says, "*we* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God", @Philippians 3: 3. He emphasises the *we*, so that we can say we belong to the worshippers.
Ques. Is that not precisely the difference between verse 29 and verse 25? In verse 29 the thing has become substantial, whereas in verse 25 it was, more or less, tradition.
J.T. She says, in verse 25, "I know that Messias is coming". That is what she might have known from
{194}
reading the Scriptures; but in verse 29 she says, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?" What is really in mind is the Christ, the Person. He is the great divine Operator and His operations include the service of God, for He is the Minister of the sanctuary.
{195}
THE ASSEMBLY AND CHRIST'S RELATION TO IT
@Revelation 22: 17; @Acts 9: 1 - 16
J.T. It is of importance to call attention to the fact that the assembly is the nearest of the families of God, to divine Persons. The verse in Revelation points to this, because she is seen joined with the Holy Spirit in saying, "Come". It is a peculiar and important matter that she is so near to divine Persons as to join with One of Them in saying "Come" to Another of the three Persons in the Deity, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. The passage read from @Acts 9 points to the Lord having to say to the assembly and to the persons forming it. The general fact of His position now is that He has gone into heaven and that, as Mark tells us, He has sat at the right hand of God, which is a position of dignity the Father has conferred on Him. This links with the word in @Acts 2: 33, "being by the right hand of God exalted ... he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear". At the same time, however, He is seen in the Acts and in @1 Corinthians 15 as appearing to Paul. Paul refers to himself in the words "last of all ... he appeared to *me* also"; the appearing alluding to what we read in @Acts 9. Then there are other appearings to him, such as at Corinth and also at Jerusalem. It is therefore thought that we shall get help in looking into these scriptures and seeking to understand how great the assembly's place is. Then how the Lord was active with it, or the members of it, in different ways, but particularly in the corporeal sense, for He actually came to earth in person in relation to Paul and in relation to others too, as we have remarked, but particularly in relation to Paul.
P.H.H. Would the servant with Rebecca at the end of @Genesis 24 give a type of the Spirit and the bride together?
{196}
J.T. He is seen there typically, and yet it is clear, that it is intended to be as real in its meaning as what we have in the antitype. Rebecca is seen as riding on camels, which points to the power by which the assembly is carried to Christ. Then further we see how the Lord, as typified by Isaac, was occupied, for Isaac was coming from the well called Lahai-roi. Coming from it points to his being active in that sense. Typically he is a man of leisure and free to be occupied with his bride when she comes into view. The first allusion, however, is to the power by which she is carried. Then later he is seen as at liberty and in restfulness and dallying with her. All this has a meaning at the present time as showing how the Lord would take advantage of the first day of the week. He has peculiar liberty among the saints on that day. It is named in Scripture as "the Lord's day". It is the Lord's day, and John says, "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day". The allusions by the Spirit, in that setting, to the assembly particularly, in @Revelation 22: 16 point to the Lord's activities, as in referring to Himself He says, "I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". He says that, and says it in order to affect the assembly, so that immediately we have the answer; "the Spirit and the bride say, Come". It is quite intelligent and intelligible that we should so regard the first day of the week as affording such an opportunity, the bride being mentioned. Earlier in the book of Revelation she is mentioned as the *wife*, which would refer to her in her occupation with His interests down here. In this particular verse in @Revelation 22, she is occupied along with the Spirit, one of the divine Persons, with another divine Person. They are occupied with the coming of the Lord; that surely is something which should command our affections at this present time.
Ques. So that when this moment actually arrives, will it not signalise the close of this dispensation? Have you in mind that what will be fully consummated then may be in our hearts now?
{197}
J.T. I am sure that is right. The word in @1 Corinthians 11: 26 is, "As often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come". That is the proper occupation entering into the Lord's supper.
Ques. Has the invitation "Come", the rapture or the appearing in view?
J.T. I would say the appearing. It is a question of what He is coming into. She is occupied, as a wife ought to be, with what He is coming into and not only what He is to her. So we have Paul speaking of those who "love his appearing".
N.K.M. "Until he come". Is that the rapture or the appearing?
J.T. I think the appearing is meant, because it is a question of what the Lord is coming into. The assembly in her wifely character is not only thinking of what she comes into herself, but of what He comes into; the full consummation of the divine thoughts.
Ques. Does the fact that she understands and appreciates the expression, "the root and offspring of David", suggest the greatest measure of intelligence as to His Person?
J.T. They are, of course, the Lord's own words. His being the *root* of David refers to Deity, and the *offspring*, to His humanity. She understands that, and He knows that she is capable of understanding it.
Ques. Is it specially through the understanding of Paul's ministry that we come to this thought of our nearness and intimacy with divine Persons?
J.T. I think the Lord is working at that constantly. The real feminine representative of the assembly in John would be Mary Magdalene, and she calls the Lord "Rabboni", meaning that He was her teacher. I believe the importance of teaching runs through John's gospel. The instruction that he affords to us is stressed, in view of the importance of the brethren being taught.
{198}
J.P.H. The appearing being in mind in @1 Corinthians 11, what will occur between the rapture and the appearing? It says, "Until he come" in connection with the Supper.
J.T. The interval would have to be worked out in prophecy. We would have to work out the three years and a half which we find in the book of Revelation and in Daniel, and we have to be like Daniel, and understand by books. Perhaps we do not set ourselves to understand enough by books. The words "Come" and "until he come" refer to the general position of the testimony until He comes into His rights. His creative rights are alluded to in @Revelation 10: 2 - 3 in which we are told that "he set his right foot on the sea, and the left upon the earth, and cried with a loud voice as a lion roars". He will thus assert His authority creatively and, I believe, that is included in the coming of the Lord.
F.C.H. Would not the reference to the "morning star" confirm the thought that it refers to His appearing? It is in view of another day.
J.T. I think that is good. It is "the bright and morning star". Peter says "until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts", @2 Peter 1: 19.
W.C. Is there any idea of something in the nature of the Supper being continued by the remnant on the line of Matthew and Mark?
J.T. I do not understand that, although I have heard of it before. Of course, you might say, the expression "until he come" would imply it, but I do not think the Lord's supper belongs to any other family. The Lord says, "This is my body, which is for you".
Ques. The expression "until he come" is hardly a reference to time chronologically, but rather in view of His rights being owned. In the assembly, during the whole time of His absence they should be owned, until He comes personally to take them up?
{199}
J.T. That is right, and that is how I understand the place of the woman of worth in the book of Proverbs. "Her husband" it says, "is known in the gates". That is to say He is known through what she is doing and now the Lord is known through what we are doing. It is a poor thing if He is not.
P.H.H. Is it your thought that the close connection between the Spirit and the bride would help to put everything that the assembly has to do with on a very high level?
J.T. That is just the point that is in mind.
P.H.H. Does that mean that the Lord's supper, in itself in its inwardness, is also being elevated in our minds?
J.T. I think it is. The Lord has been stressing the truth of His Supper for well nigh thirty years, and the true thought of it has been coming to light constantly. You might say, almost every Lord's day we get something. Then the truth of the assembly is bound up with it, because the apostle says in @1 Corinthians 11, "When ye come together in assembly". The Lord's supper is thus bound up with the assembly, and to make the Supper the portion of any other family is, I think, confusing.
W.C. I think what you say is clear from the setting of it, that it is the assembly's privilege.
Ques. Do the Lord's words in @John 14: 3 "I go to prepare you a place ... that where I am ye also may be" show the peculiar place of intimacy that the assembly will have to the divine Persons as over against other families named in heaven and earth?
J.T. I think so. Beginning with verse 15 of @John 14 and running right to the end, the Lord has in mind those who form the assembly. So that He says in that passage, "I am coming to you", which enters into the chapter we read.
Ques. Do you regard the Supper as special? You have spoken of Christ being in heaven as the general
{200}
position in Christianity, but at the Supper have we liberty to think of Him as near?
J.T. I think it is intended to be that. So the apostle says, "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God?" These are words that point to the greatness and glory of the Lord's supper, involving the assembly and no other family.
P.L. You distinguish between His coming, as, in the end of Luke, in relation to localities, when He stood in *their* midst, and asks them whether they have anything *here* to eat, from the occasion in @John 20 when it says, that He *came* and stood in *the* midst? Would the latter view His coming in as from heaven as the ascending Man and bear on the general position, and the upward trend of the service of God. The first in Luke rather bears upon His identification with us in the sojourning character of the assembly in its sorrows and exercises?
J.T. Very good. I would say that, because Luke writes to an individual, Theophilus; he does not write to a company, but in coming to his last chapter he gives an account of the Lord's visit to Emmaus, showing that He was concerned about two of them, which would suggest the assembly and its members. Mark says that they were going to the country, and that is not a suggestion for the assembly, for the country does not promote much as to the assembly. Cities, as such, do not either, but still cities are more concentrated positions in which God is pleased to set His assembly locally. So the first mention of it in Corinthians is, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth". It is thus a local matter, and, I believe, Luke bears out the local matter, for we have the reference by him to the breaking of bread, being in the house, a local position. It was not in the assembly then, although Corinthians would show that it should be in the assembly today, but it was never in the temple. Other things are recognised in what Luke records as in the temple. It is linked up with the work of God at the
{201}
outset and continues on long after the Holy Spirit had come down, yet it is never said, or implied that the Lord's supper was in the temple. They broke bread in the house, meaning that it might be in a brother's house. It is never alluded to as in the temple at Jerusalem. I believe @Luke 24 is to show that it is the local position that he is dealing with, and so the Lord was constrained by the two, whoever they were, to go in with them into their house. They had a meal there and evidently the Lord waited. It is wonderful to think of Him waiting there, whatever the preparation may have been, until it was completed, and then He gave thanks. Then it says, "he disappeared from them". That is to show that the mysterious idea enters into the assembly, even into its local position. This would teach us that the service of God should not be brought down to the level of the ordinary mind. So it says that the two, into whose house He went, returned to Jerusalem. It must have taken them a good while to get back, probably two hours, but they went and they found the eleven gathered together. It was a broken state of things, as Matthew records, but they found them. It shows that they were characteristically real assembly people and they found those that belonged to the assembly. Those that belonged to it, as gathered together, were saying, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon". That means that the Lord took account of what Simon had done, but He would set him at ease as to that, so that whatever there was in the way of assembly service might proceed. Then the two from Emmaus added to what had been said, by referring to what the Lord had done there, and then, while all that was proceeding, "he himself stood in their midst". That bears out what has just been said as to the local position, whereas in @John 20: 19 it is the general position. It is not "their midst" in @John 20, but "the midst", which would be the general idea. If the Lord comes to us from heaven, it may be in relation to ministry or other occasions which call for
{202}
His presence, the bearing of this as also the ministry, is universal. This is going on constantly.
G.W.B. Do you think that the Lord's words, "I am coming to you" are fulfilled at the Supper or on other occasions also?
J.T. I think it might be on an occasion like this. Why should it not be? It is a question of His love. The idea is that He came to where the disciples were, not exactly into the hall, but where they were. Then the reference to the doors being shut means that there was a danger of intrusion, and the saints ought to take care of that.
W.S.S. Paul writes to Timothy about "all them also that love his appearing". Would that have a present bearing?
J.T. I think so. I think it ought to have with us now (as seen in the following verse of a hymn);
<blockquote>'*We look for Thine appearing, <br>Thy presence here to bless; <br>We greet the day that's nearing, <br>When all this woe shall cease*'. (`200:4)</blockquote>
How comforting that is!
W.S.S. I was thinking how the ministry in relation to Christ and the assembly quickens our affections, so that we would love His appearing, and not merely hold things doctrinally.
P.H.H. Would the experience of these two coming back from Emmaus result in something wealthy added to the company? Would it correspond a little to adjustment and enrichment which we might get by way of teaching relative to the Supper?
J.T. They were not just right, and we have to own, humbly, that perhaps we are not always right, yet, even if we are not, the Lord may come to us. The Lord came to those who had gone fishing in @John 21. They had caught nothing all night and He said to them, "Children, have ye anything to eat?" In @Luke 24 it is, "Have ye anything here to eat?" Did they have anything? Well,
{203}
they did; they had a broiled fish and a honeycomb, but they did not have any in @John 21. Nevertheless, the Lord did not upbraid them for not having something, nor did He upbraid them for going fishing, and that is to bring out how gracious He can be with us when the assembly is in our hearts, and when He knows it is there. Although it may be damaged by something, if He knows it is there, He may reserve His reproof about it. He will bring it out some time or another, because it is a question of ministry, but, in the meantime, we find "a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread", and the Lord saying to them, "Come and dine". That is the sort of thing we might expect.
Ques. Do you think @Luke 24 would show that, as the Lord is present, He pledges Himself to serve according to the conditions that may require His service?
J.T. That is good.
Ques. He says, "behold my hands and my feet", and then, "having said this, he showed them his hands and his feet". Do you think we are learning to count on the present service of the love of Christ in our localities that we may be set free for what is universal?
J.T. Just so. Hence the week, I believe, comes under proper consideration in relation to the Lord. The first day of it usually takes care of itself, but all the other days have to be provided for, and the brethren have been providing for them and especially in the prophetic ministry.
J.McK. Would the reference in @Acts 1: 3 to the Lord "being seen by them during forty days" confirm this? It is not a fixed matter, for the first day of the week only, but varying according to their state or need. "Being seen by them during forty days".
J.T. Quite so. He was not always with them. As we were remarking, the two undertook the journey from Emmaus and came to Jerusalem and found the eleven. They *found* them. The Lord was not there but they
{204}
were speaking about Him, showing that He was in their hearts. They needed adjustment, but still the general thought was that He was in their hearts, and that they knew what had happened so far. It was a known and an accepted fact that He was risen and that He had appeared to Simon. The two then added what they could, referring to what had happened in Emmaus, and then it is said, "as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst". They were not just ready for the appearing, but He did not leave. He remained, and the journey He was on led to Bethany, for it says, "he led them out as far as Bethany". The season of His being with them went on, and we are told a good deal of what entered into it. The local position went on in the sense of instruction, and then He leads them out as far as to Bethany and goes up from Bethany. What is in mind is to call attention to the fact of a local position, and that the Lord is ever ready to make it right if it is not right. It is for the persons who are local, those who are resident in the town or place, to see that things are right.
P.L. Would "his hands and his feet" in Luke speak of the adaptability of Christ's love to current conditions; whereas, "his hands and his side" in John speak of His complacent love for His own in relation to another scene?
J.T. I think the allusion to the side in John would be to @Genesis 2, to Eve as coming from the side of Adam. The Lord is to be apprehended, and the fact that the wife, the assembly, has come out of Him. I do not suppose that in the eternal condition of things there will be anything indicating a wound in His side. I do not think there is.
Ques. We are not told much in Scripture about the transition between the millennium and the eternal state. Is there not a tendency with us to carry a good many things over into eternity that will really cease with the millennium?
{205}
J.T. I think so. Much will happen that is not recorded, in fulfilment of what is required by the word in @1 Corinthians 15: 50, "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God". We have to accept that.
Ques. Is it noteworthy, that following Bethany in @John 12, we have all the heavenly instruction that is so useful to us in relation to the service of God in the assembly and the knowledge of the Father? Is it your thought that, as being adjusted locally and filling our part there, we are then free to move on to the great universal spiritual sphere?
J.T. I would say that fully, especially when we come to chapter 17, where the Lord lifts up His eyes to heaven and prays. There is some conclusion reached there. Matthew has many conclusions but the Lord's prayer in @John 17 is a peculiar kind of finish to something.
F.C.H. Is it not of great importance to learn to listen to the Lord in assembly? In @Luke 24: 35 it says, "how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread". Would not that include the way in which He blessed and gave thanks? It does not just say that He was known to them in the breaking of bread, but *how* He was known.
J.T. It is like the allusion in @John 6: 23 to "the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks". That is a beautiful touch for us and implies how He gave thanks.
P.H.H. You would not think that the expression in @Zechariah 13: 6, "What are those wounds in thy hands?" would warrant our supposing that any thought of suffering is carried into the eternal conditions, or into the assembly service which relates to what is eternal?
J.T. No. I do not think so. There is much that must be considered, in a prior sense, to instruct us, but the idea of teaching continuing eternally, I am sure, is not right. Things are to be settled here and we shall reach
{206}
a finish. It says, "Then cometh the end", which indicates that things are finished.
Ques. Is it like the difference between the destination and the journey to arrive there? Much may occur on the way, but when the end is reached, the journey may not be referred to or reported, but the persons are there in all the value of what has happened.
J.T. Quite so. You would not expect a finish in a letter like the first letter to Corinth. It is a teaching and a corrective letter, but all in view of a finish. We have to wait for Ephesians to get the finish of things.
Ques. In connection with the thought of sufferings, what would you say regarding the reference to the "Lamb ... as slain" in @Revelation 5: 6?
J.T. That is in view of certain things being accomplished in the earth, among men; it is the opening of the book and the breaking of its seals. John wept about that, and whatever John does, as a rule, is to be noted. In @Revelation 1 it says he fell down at the Lord's feet as dead and the Lord did not reprove him for it, but He laid His right hand on him. Then, in the chapter quoted he wept much "because no one had been found worthy to open the book nor to regard it". But one of the elders says to him, "Do not weep. Behold, the lion which is of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, has overcome so as to open the book, and its seven seals", @Revelation 5: 4, 5. Following that the seals were loosed and the book opened. There were seven seals, and each one carries some instruction for us. When we are dealing with that which gives instruction, we are to note the form and appearance in which the truth is presented to us.
Eu.R. In @Revelation 21: 2 we have not the Lamb mentioned but the assembly "coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband". Is that the eternal thought?
J.T. I would think so. Things are new; and although the name "Jerusalem" is retained, it would be,
{207}
I suppose, to identify, who is the bride adorned; meaning the assembly.
Ques. Is it instructive that when Paul writes to the Philippians, where we have the practical working out of the truth, he gets as far as speaking of the Lord's body of glory? It is as though there is nothing more to come after that.
J.T. We will be like that. John confirms that in saying "when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is". It is not as He *was*, but we shall see Him as He is in glory, in His body of glory.
J.S.E. Is not the understanding of the truth of the bride, perhaps our biggest test? It says in @Revelation 21, "I will show thee the bride", and then at the close the Spirit and the bride say, "Come". I wondered if it suggested the need amongst us of greater consciousness of our true place in relationship to Christ.
J.T. We are to learn too where the bride comes into the service of God. It must be worked out through the Lord's supper, and there can be no doubt that the instruction needed for that is very great. We were remarking that the Lord had selected Mary Magdalene for a purpose, for she represents the exercises needed to arrive at the truth in the assembly viewed femininely. So she says to the Lord, "Rabboni". We have often had that before us, for the word is a strong one, meaning *my teacher*, and it is also used in @Mark 10: 51. John is particularly full of the idea of teaching. In the first chapter the Lord is called "Teacher". The two disciples of John, who followed Jesus, said to Him, "Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?" They do not say "Rabboni". That is a thought that runs through John's gospel, and it culminates, I believe, in Mary's remark and in the place she gets in the Lord's mind. It is unique, and she is used as a messenger to the Lord's brethren, for they are viewed as His brethren.
{208}
E.B. Do you see order in the instruction that has come to us of recent years, first of all in regard to the Lord's Person, and now in regard to the assembly, and the great service of teaching which has been extended to us?
J.T. I think there is. There is the sonship of Christ and all that hinges on that, and then there is the truth of the assembly.
Ques. Would that be conveyed in an initial way to Paul when the Lord said, "Why persecutest thou me?"
J.T. That passage was read in order to show that the Lord's manifesting Himself to us, in view of having part in our circumstances, sufferings and feelings, is not in any corporeal sense, as it will be when He comes for us. When the Lord refers to Himself as *Me* He is speaking really of the saints. The sufferings, or whatever they may be, are literally experienced by the brethren, and the Lord is having part in them in spirit.
P.L. "In all their affliction he was afflicted", @Isaiah 63: 9.
J.T. I think that helps. I would stress that, because it avoids our assuming that the Lord now comes in in a corporeal sense into our circumstances. I do not think He does. I have never heard anybody, or seen anybody, that has seen Him thus. I think it is a question of what He participates in spiritually.
J.C.T. Would chapter 2 of the Song of Songs help at all? It says, "The voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh". Then the Lord typically immediately says, "Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away".
J.T. Well, the Song of Songs is a peculiar book in the Old Testament in that sense. The book does not contain the name of God, except in the expression "Flames of Jah", and that is only once. It confirms what has been said about the Lord's supper being entirely for the Lord, it is not the Father's supper; it is the Lord's supper.
{209}
P.H.H. I think we are getting clear as to this matter of sufferings and about the Lord having regard for our circumstances of suffering; that the atoning sufferings are not in view in this connection, but would you say a word as to any thought of suffering involved in His love entering into death. I am thinking, for instance, of the frequent mention of the "myrrh" in the Canticles. Then the Lord says through Paul in relation to the Supper, "this do in remembrance of me"; that is, *for the calling me to mind*. Would you in the service of that be free to make any mention of sufferings as connected with the Lord's love in going into death?
J.T. Well, the symbols before us, the bread and the cup, imply His death; that is to say, they imply that He was in a different state from that in which He is now, for He is now risen and ascended. What we have said about the Lord coming to us implies that He manifests Himself in a spiritual way, so that He takes part with us in spirit in what we are passing through, as in @Luke 24. We cannot say that He took part *with us*, in any sense, in His atoning sufferings; we were not there, those sufferings were entirely His own. It is noticeable that only Matthew and Mark mention the fact of the atoning sufferings of Christ, but they do not mention the memorial of Christ continuing through the Lord's supper. That does not minimise the importance of Luke or John, but shows that certain things are left out by the Spirit in ministry as required for a certain purpose. It is not that they should be left out entirely from every side of the truth, for we have Matthew and Mark speaking of the atoning sufferings of Christ, in the forsaking by God. That is clearly not to be left out in the teaching and our learning; it is only a question of where it fits, and this too has to be learned. In the Lord's supper the assembly is in view, and the atoning sufferings were over before the assembly had its existence.
{210}
Ques. Would you distinguish between sufferings as the proof of love and what we speak of as atoning sufferings? I was thinking of the reference in @Genesis 2: 21, "Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man", but then it adds "and he slept". Is there some mysterious reference to Adam's part in that?
J.T. I do not think God intended that the thought of sufferings should enter into that great type, nor do I think the word *sleep* implies suffering. It is a question of Christ and the assembly as they are now abstractly. That is to say, it is a sinless condition, the assembly having a sinless history. The assembly has to be apprehended thus, and I believe the record of Adam and Eve implies that, because sin had not yet come in. If the facts there in @Genesis 2 were mentioned in chapter 3 then it would be different, but they are not. It is a question of the man and the woman, and it contemplates a sinless history of the assembly. It will appear eternally that her history is sinless. It is not that she is atoned for, as having been in sin, but she is sinless. She is suitable to be the bride of Christ in that sense. She is of Him.
W.C. What about the Lord's words, "Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?"
J.T. Well, that refers to what was necessary for the bringing out of the truth as to the state of mankind. But God is entitled to treat things abstractly, and He does so. The assembly is an eternal thought with Him, and it has had a sinless condition.
J.P.H. Are sufferings involved, or implied, in @1 Corinthians 11: 23 where Paul speaks of "the night in which he was delivered up"? Is there suffering there in love in sacrificing Himself?
J.T. Yes. I would not object to that, but, of course, the night in which He was delivered up does not refer to His actual death, but to the conditions of treachery and betrayal before that, when He was apprehended.
{211}
J.P.H. His betrayal at the hands of man?
J.T. Quite so. It would be at the hand of Judas.
P.L. Does it help to see, in regard of Thomas, that the going over of His sufferings as is suggested in the words, "Bring thy finger here and see my hands" and so on, related to one who had been unbelieving, and not to the assembly in her intelligent setting?
J.T. It is good to bring that up because we have to divide up @John 20 to get the truth. Verse 19 properly treats of the matter of Christ coming into the midst, and saying, "Peace be to you", having sent a message to them as His brethren. Then He speaks about their mission, as the Father had sent Him so He was sending them, and He breathes into them and says, "Receive the Holy Spirit". Then it goes on to say "whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". And then eight days after we have Thomas coming in. That is another thing; it is really typically the Jew coming in. There are three appearings in the end of John. The first to Mary Magdalene, the second to Thomas, and the third to Peter, and the other six disciples in chapter 21. We have to treat of those three characters in the chapters to get the truth of it. The one that relates to Mary Magdalene and the brethren, I believe, is just what we are talking about now; it is the sinless history of what the assembly is as united to Christ. She is fit to be united to Christ as having no sinful history.
Ques. Is the "deep sleep" typical of death?
J.T. That is just what it is; but, as far as I see, sleep in itself is not typical of sufferings, nor had the time for sufferings come.
A.D.T. Does @Acts 1: 3 help, it says, "He presented himself living, after he had suffered"?
J.T. Yes; after He *had* suffered. There is no idea of undervaluing the sufferings of Christ, Peter speaks of them, and says, "the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow", but we are dealing now with
{212}
the type of Adam and Eve, and that is not a suffering type. There are no sufferings implied in it.
Eu.R. Suffering and glory are rightly brought in in Luke as connected with the actual partaking of the Supper, but the sinless condition belongs to @John 20. The hands and the side relate to that.
J.T. I would think that, the sinless condition belongs to that part of @John 20.
Ques. The sinless condition, as you speak of it, the man and the woman, is the end arrived at. Is the Lord's supper rather the journey to it? Although we are in the light of God's eternal thoughts, there is considerable disparity between what we are actually and what we shall be. I wondered whether things worked out from the local setting in the Supper, and now through God working in us we are able to take up what is properly ours. Have you that in mind?
J. T. Yes, I have that in mind. There is thus liberty to take up, in the service of God, that we belong to a sinless condition as united to Christ. That is the eternal condition and relation in which the assembly stands to Christ.
E.C.M. Is not that the point in @John 20 where the Lord Jesus calls Mary "Woman"? He then adds, "Why dost thou weep?" as though the truth of union could be entered upon.
J.T. The message implies it too. The Lord says, "Go to my brethren". It is not simply the *disciples*, it is *my brethren*, and say to them, "I ascend to my Father and your Father".
F.C.H. Luke says, "Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?". Would "these things" refer to the particular sufferings that are presented in Luke?
J.T. Well, may be. There is no doubt, that neither Luke nor John record the atoning sufferings, that is, the forsaking of Christ by God. We have to respect that, as to what it means. There must be some way of
{213}
looking at the truth and leaving out, *at the time*, the atoning sufferings of Christ.
P.L. Does the Passover make that clear, as being distinguished from the Lord's supper?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Would you be free to say a word as to @Ephesians 5: 25 "Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it", as contrasted with @Genesis 2?
J.T. The expression "delivered himself up for it" has to be paid attention to, but there is a difference. John and Luke do not record the forsaking of God, whereas, on the other hand, Matthew and Mark definitely record it and all the sufferings that attended it and were in keeping with it.
W.C. Does not "delivered himself up" imply His death?
J.T. Quite so. But then, if we come to the idea of leaving certain things out, that helps us and enables us to leave things, and not to insist on them. We can just leave them as the Spirit of God leaves them, and see why it is that He does so, and why it is that God furnishes us with a type that does not imply sin either in Adam or in Eve.
{214}
LOCAL CONDITIONS AND SERVICE
@Acts 13: 1 - 13
J.T. The first verse of @Acts 13 is clearly to call attention to what was there in Antioch. It is said, in verse 26 of chapter 11, "And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd: and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch". Thus the first verse of this chapter clearly contemplates what was there, as if to stress the idea of the local position; that is what God had now in Antioch. We have before us what God had at the time at Antioch and what He could use in a wide field, the Gentile field. Then, in verse 2, we have "As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go. They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and thence sailed away to Cyprus". The local position at Antioch was thus evidently taken on by God as a means of enlarging the field. The work was carried on from a centre such as Antioch, in which the principles of the assembly were maintained. The stress would be on what was *there* in Antioch; the *assembly* was there. Clearly there was no obstruction at all, so that the Spirit had liberty to move; and so He said, "Separate me now ... for the work to which I have called them". Then He is free to send them forth, and they go forth, with great results.
F.C.H. There was a spontaneity about the work at first, but did not everything become regulated?
J.T. Clearly it was the work of God. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch. That is a definite name involving that the order that Christ would impart had given character to the company at Antioch.
{215}
Ques. Is there a suggestion in the fact that these men are called prophets and teachers? Where prophetic ministry and teaching are effective in a place, it will lead to an ability to minister to the Lord, and it is in those conditions the Spirit of God is free to develop something distinctive by way of gift.
J.T. The Spirit is, thus I suppose, speaking triumphantly, if we may speak of Him in that way, in His saying, "Separate me now".
Ques. Would the teaching for a whole year be in view of assembly formation, and would the presence of the prophets and teachers suggest the functioning of the Spirit so that there should be an answer to the Lord out of the place and in those conditions develop something that becomes of use in a wider area?
J.T. That is just what I was thinking, in connection with what has been remarked on chapter 11. There is, of course, what had intervened as given in chapter 12; what the enemy was doing, among other things, and how God met that. The field is thus clear for the divine service. It says, "Now there were in Antioch, in the assembly which was there". The reference being to the actual position of the assembly which was *there*. Then to augment all that we have the prophets and teachers whose names are given, and then it says, "As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said ..." Everything is ready, there, under the Lord, for the great work undertaken now; the wide field or scope of service which had in mind the ingathering of the Gentiles. The prophets and teachers would be ready, as there, to maintain the position that had been reached, which is a great matter.
Ques. In chapter 11, verse 26, the teaching is mentioned first. It says, "they ... taught a large crowd", and then in verse 27, we have "Now in these days prophets went down". I wondered whether there was some significance, now that the assembly status had
{216}
been arrived at, in the order being reversed to "prophets and teachers"?
J.T. I suppose Agabus should be taken into account, not exactly as a prophet in the assembly to support it, but bringing in what is needed in the way of information. In the government of God there was to be a famine, and Agabus¬ service would be to bring out what was there in the way of means to meet the famine. It came to pass under Claudius and it was over all the inhabited earth. But we are told that "they determined, according as any one of the disciples was well off", (a remarkable expression), "each of them to send to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea, to minister to them; which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul". It is not a collection; it is rather to show what was there, what God had governmentally and what would be available to support the testimony in a practical sense. I thought it would be just as well to touch on that section, as to the kind of prophecy that is in mind. It is a person having ability to testify as to coming events.
W.C. Would there be some link with @1 Corinthians 12, when he passes from the thought of the body to the assembly? It says, "God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers". We get that order, prophets first and teachers following.
J.T. It is similar in Ephesians. I suppose that prophecy comes next to apostolic power in ministry. It is a question of ministry and what the assembly needs in a spiritual sense.
A.B. Referring to the end of chapter 11, would the Spirit's ministry have in mind developments which might take place in the world and anticipate it by ministry which would tend to fortify the saints? I was thinking of the ministry we had before the War. We did not know the War was coming, but how valuable that ministry was when the War came!
{217}
J.T. Undoubtedly this country was in mind, and the number of saints in it, so that they should go through the terrible ordeal that God knew was coming. But we have no such ministry as we see in Agabus. Now it is rather to fit the saints spiritually for what may be about to happen, so that the saints should discern that it was about to happen.
Ques. Would it help us, in our local settings, to be more aware of the value, not only of teaching, but of the exercise of what is prophetic? Would the teaching be the steady, systematic building up of the saints and be universal in its character, all following the lead that the Lord may be giving, whereas the prophet, as functioning in a place, would bring in the mind of God in relation to conditions that might exist?
J.T. I think so. The prophetic ministry is seen in @1 Corinthians 14 when the saints in one place all come together. It is to show what God has in the place.
J.J.T. Does not the prophetic word keep us alive in regard to the truth?
J.T. Quite so. We are told who these prophets and teachers were, and then what they were doing. It says, that they were ministering to the Lord and fasting. These are things that have to be noted, because "ministering to the Lord" is purely spiritual activity on the part of the saints. Then fasting is another thing, for it is that which in itself reduces mere effort; fasting would reduce what might appear in itself, to be right, but brought about by natural effort. We are thus all the more ready for spiritual support.
Ques. Do you mean it would limit mere human activity?
J.T. just so.
G.W.B. Does the word "they" in verse 2 refer to the prophets and teachers, or to the saints as a whole?
J.T. I would say to the prophets and teachers. "As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said ..." Then we are told what He
{218}
said, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". Although it might be said that brothers and sisters alike have part in the ministering, I think what is in mind here is the special thought of prophets and teachers, and the part *they* have in this whole position.
P.L. Although they are levites, are their priestly functions pronounced here in the service? Is it to balance levitical activity?
J.T. Just so. "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law", @Malachi 2: 7. No doubt all that entered into this position.
P.H.H. Would the passage present the features of quality in the general assembly position?
J.T. They would. I think the thing to be specially noted is that they were fasting. There is a way made for the Spirit in the fasting process, so that there is more there in the spiritual side in intelligence.
Ques. I have thought of what you said about Daniel, that when he got light from God, instead of going at once to convey his message, he called his companions and with them went over the matter before God. Were they not, in principle, ministering, and did not that give them power in the testimony?
J.T. They were companions together. The word *companions* is used.
S.R. It says, "The boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah" and that precedes what is afterwards said that "Jehovah ... let none of his words fall to the ground".
J.T. God greatly honoured Samuel, even as a boy, in telling him about Eli. Some of us have been speaking about the years gone by in which the patriarchal order of things existed in this city, and how later the younger men came into activity and place in the maintenance of the service of God. I think Samuel may be taken from the prophets as a peculiar type of this, in the same sense that Joseph, in an earlier day, was a type. Samuel and
{219}
Joseph are types of young men and show what such may come to in their youth, on moral grounds. "Jehovah ... let none of his [Samuel's] words fall to the ground". They fell into the hearts of the saints. He would be a brother that would affect the saints, so that they took his words into their hearts, honest and good hearts.
Rem. It is said that "all Israel ... knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah".
P.H.H. Would you say a little on how the speaking of the Spirit works out now. First we have "the Holy Spirit said"; then presently, "They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit". In between, there are the brethren who fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them and let them go.
J.T. The Spirit is here, but He uses the saints, and the question is how He may use us. We have had much on levitical lines in recent years, which must mean that the Spirit has those whom He can use, and that He can send forth. We have to discern how what is seen here, in apostolic days, is to work out now, and, I would say, it is a question of measurement. The apostle, for instance, speaks about a measure reaching unto the Corinthians. It would now be a question of how this works out and how far the measure of brethren, whom the Spirit would send out in some sense and use, reaches. Whether they can go afield to far-off places where the work of God is or whether they are more likely to be used locally is, I think, a question of measurement. The question of measure is seen in the first chapter of 2 Corinthians.
Ques. Where things are normal, would you expect the saints to have a judgment as to a brother's measure in the way you are speaking of it? Anyone moving extensively would thus be anxious not only to have his directions from the Lord, but to carry the confidence of the brethren, particularly the spiritual?
J.T. Just so. How is he to have their prayers unless he has their confidence and there can be nothing done unless there is prayer. Here we have, "having fasted
{220}
and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go". Clearly there was no selfish motive as to these two men. "They let them go", and then it says, "They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit". But now we have to bring it down to our own times, because after all we have to come down to the limitation according to measure, and of the state of things in the localities where the ministry is carried on. It is a question of what place a brother has in the hearts of the saints and in their prayers. Hence the great importance of fixing a day for prayer, an evening for prayer, which is usually now a Monday. I think it is an immense advantage to the work of God that the brethren all know that Monday is the time for prayer.
P.H.H. Would the saints then begin to have an appreciation of the increasing measure, say, of Barnabas and Saul as the Spirit uttered these words? Should we have to be ready for increasing measure on the part of some who serve?
J.T. We can see it, and we should see it. It is well set out in the way these two men worked, and how they increased in efficiency.
F.C.H. Would the "me" in, "Separate me now", go alongside of what the Lord said of Paul, "he is a chosen vessel unto me"? Another divine Person is coming into the matter.
J.T. I think the point in our chapter would be to stress the Person who is in mind, namely, the Holy Spirit, because He is acting in a very outstanding way as a divine Person here.
Ques. Is the emphasis on what is here? The Spirit of God being here is not merely an objective idea, but there are available to Him those that He may use as indicating His mind at the moment. It would not be of much use my claiming that I am sent by the Lord, if I am not really carrying the confidence of the brethren in a spiritual sense. Would you agree?
{221}
J.T. Yes, I would.
W.C. Do you think these words would be voiced by a brother present? It says, "having fasted and prayed" and I was wondering whether the brethren, so to speak, felt their way to it and afterwards it could definitely be said that it was the Holy Spirit.
J.T. I think it would be in order to say that. The Spirit is not incarnate as Christ was, and therefore I would say that the orders coming from Him would be generally through persons.
Ques. Would the expression, "the work to which I have called them", suggest that there had been some personal indication to Barnabas and Saul of what the Lord had in mind for them? It would hardly have been a surprise to them to have been called.
J.T. It would not be a surprise, but I think it was immediate, for the Spirit has first-hand knowledge of everything; even if it is the birth of a child, or a marriage, the Spirit has first-hand knowledge of everything. Thus what is in mind in the divine operations is that what comes about is available to the divine Persons who are operating. The Spirit does not leave, as the Lord would. The Lord goes into heaven and comes to His own, but the Spirit remains with us, so that there is a first-hand knowledge of everything. Therefore as regards Paul and Barnabas the Spirit would have a perfect knowledge of those two men and what was current in their hearts.
A.D.T. Would there be a link here with the vow of the Nazarite? It speaks of "all the days of the vow of his separation", @Numbers 6: 5.
J.T. That is very good, because the Nazarite's vow would enter into the service of these men. Not only would it enter particularly into the service of Paul and Barnabas, but all the other apostles too for they were all men in that position; and, of course, every servant ought to be in the attitude of a Nazarite who has a vow. He is under the Lord; he is under orders.
{222}
C.W. Would this thought of *letting go* suggest, that as far as the brethren were concerned, they would rather keep them, but love would release them? We have some of our brethren leaving shortly and, so far as we are concerned, we would sooner keep them, but love would release them?
J.T. Just so. Of course, they will be missed; but then their absence may give opportunity to others to take on work that they have not hitherto been doing. The extension of the work of God in that way is another thing and shows how young men come into it, if they are fit for it morally.
Rem. There are only two out of five going here. The home front was being looked after.
P.H.H. "Sent forth by the Holy Spirit"; would that add the feature of authority to their going? I believe the word is very much akin to apostle.
J.T. I would say that. It is an apostolic suggestion. Then, there can be no doubt that what we are saying as to the home front entered into all this. It has to be guarded so that the enemy does not get in. Hence the importance of young men taking note of what elder brethren do. They must, of course, get experience for themselves, but if the elder brethren have to go afield, the work at home has to be carried on, and it is for them to do it. The wording is very striking, but it certainly is to bring out the personality of the Holy Spirit in the divine economy that is now taking form and extending out to the gentiles. What subsequently follows is to bring out how the devil at once attacks. Following on the verses we have been noting, it says "And being in Salamis, they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also as their attendant. And having passed through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man a magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus, who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man". This intelligent man is to be kept in mind and
{223}
the devil's activity to divert him. The work of God through Paul had reached such proportions that the devil made a point of getting in to attack the person that was in mind. This intelligent man fits in exactly to the period because it is a time for intelligence.
S.R. In that connection would you say something as to the word of God coming in here so forcibly? It says in the previous chapter that it "grew and spread itself". Do you think these prophets and teachers would come into the carrying forward of it?
J.T. Quite so. All that is mentioned here shows how extensive the service of God was and how everything was taken account of. Then these men are sent forth with the hearty consent of the assembly. Having the hands of the brethren laid upon them, they go forth, the Spirit of the Lord having selected them. Then this work proceeds and an intelligent man comes into evidence. How the devil would be set to overthrow the work; but he was defeated, and the great thing is to note how Paul was used at this juncture.
W.C. In connection with the sowing, Luke records the Lord's words that "The seed is the word of God" and, in the very first class mentioned, it says, "then comes the devil". He was defeated here, but does the passage in Luke suggest that he is always ready to move as God moves? That should be a warning to us.
J.T. Yes.
P.H.H. The word of God is brought in first to fortify us against the magician, the false prophet, Bar-jesus, and the word of God is used thus in our day.
J.T. Quite so.
P.H.H. The Lord speaks in Mark of those who were "making the word of God of none effect". The word of God *by itself* would be effectual, would it not?
J.T. So it says of this man, "having called Barnabas and Saul to him, desired to hear the word of God". That is important, because the word of God is not
{224}
simply the preaching, but what is in the mind of God. It is His mind at this time.
Ques. Do you mean it requires persons able to receive it intelligently? The "he" in verse 7 is emphatic, and then it says "the magician ... opposed them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith". The conflict seems to rage round this person.
J.T. I was thinking of that. We have the idea of intelligence in the material that is secured. How much it is needed. We may get others at other times, but at this time we need this kind of material.
Ques. Would he be potential assembly material? The apostle says to the Corinthians, "I speak as to intelligent persons".
J.T. This man would be one such.
A.B. In regard of Paul facing the enemy, it says he was "filled with the Holy Spirit". Would that suggest special power at the time in dealing with the enemy?
J.T. Well, it shows the accuracy of the selection the Holy Spirit had made; that Paul is just the man needed. Barnabas, of course, is there, but Paul is the man that is needed especially to combat this attack.
Ques. Is it significant, that at this juncture it says of Saul, "who also is Paul"? Paul meaning *little* shows that he is not elated.
J.T. Just so. As far as we can see it is not simply that he is called Paul, but rather that he is Paul. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch, which would mean that they *were* that. They *were* Christians; they bore the character of Christ instead of being Jewish. Instead of carrying a Jewish title or name they have their own name, and they are that. That is what comes out I think, here, and hence we have the word in verse 9, "But Saul, who also is Paul"; the stress is on the word *Paul*, which we understand means *little*. He had no selfish thoughts. That is the idea, I am sure, and it fits in here. This name comes in, because he *is* characteristically
{225}
that, and he is just the man for the moment. So we get, "But Saul, who also is Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixing his eyes upon him, said, O full of all deceit and all craft: son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness; wilt thou not cease perverting the right paths of the Lord?" It is a very solemn thing where there is any intrusion in the house of God, in the service of God, in the assembly of God, and so the word is terrible here, "And now behold, the Lord's hand is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and going about he sought persons who should lead him by the hand". Then it says, "Then the pro-consul, seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord". It was a question of the teaching.
P.L. So is this the great Pauline issue, so to speak, opposition blinded and intelligence assured where faith is found?
J.T. We may count on these things, I would say. They would be in reduced measure, not that the Holy Spirit can be reduced, but the limitations are there through our weakness or ignorance, whatever it may be. We have therefore just to gauge what there is and make the most of it and see how these qualities appear in the day of small things. That is the way I think we ought to work out the, truth. We have to see how they appear in the day of small things in which we are.
A.B. In spite of the opposition, the work goes on and souls are helped in the face of the enemy's activity.
J.T. The work goes on and the very kind of material that is needed is secured. The man, too, is assured of it, because he is amazed, it says, "at the teaching of the Lord".
F.C.H. Would not the teaching of the Lord include this power to deal with evil? It says, "seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord".
{226}
J.T. The teaching would show you what to do and it enters into the whole matter. It was a question of what was coming out. If the Spirit of God has liberty, this indicates what is coming out. Of course, if we are in a day of small things, then we have to measure according to the cloth, so to speak, and to work accordingly.
Ques. Is it not a fact in the history of the testimony, that what is distinctive has practically always found its place amongst the saints through conflict?
J.T. You would expect, that at such a moment, when these two great servants were being sent out, the devil would make his greatest effort. But he is defeated.
Rem. So that whether it be persons that are used distinctively, or the truth that comes out at any particular time with special emphasis, it nearly always is in relation to meeting some particular move on the part of the enemy.
P.L. Is not all this worked out in Zechariah? We have the brazen character of the accusing foe on the one hand, and "the day of small things" not despised, but then we have the Branch appearing and the two olive branches and so on. There is the golden thread, so to speak, of divine handiwork going through in the presence of the worst the enemy can put forward.
J.T. And so the Spirit of God comes in on that prophetic line. It says "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit saith Jehovah of hosts", @Zechariah 4: 6.
P.H.H. Would you say that even the "day of small things" should still find us naming things rightly?
J.T. That is just what I was thinking. Naming things rightly is one of the most important suggestions we can have. We need to put right names on things. God gave the lead in that Himself in the first chapter of Genesis, and then He passed on to Adam the ability to name things. Adam did that and God did not change them. But now we are in a time when things are misnamed.
{227}
You could hardly give the number of things that are misnamed and yet they are attached to the service of God.
J.W. Would you expect, in these days, where servants are moving under the direction of the Holy Spirit, that there would be a demonstration of the Spirit's power, which in this case blinds one and opens another's eyes and makes him more intelligent?
J.T. He is made blind for a season, which shows that it is a prophetic matter with God. He is not forgetting His ancient people and He intends to recover them. Although he is blind *for a season*, the thing *is* that he is blind, which is a most solemn thing. Anything like this may happen when God is working and when the devil works against Him.
W.F. Would the power to deal intelligently with evil result in a certain reaction in this intelligent man? It really helps forward the work of God in his soul.
J.T. Quite so. That is, God has triumphed.
Ques. Do you think it might apply, not only dispensationally, but also solemnly to those who may oppose the truth? Sometimes they seem to have something governmentally bound on them so that they are not able to see.
J.T. We have had exactly that very thing in New York lately, God coming in when we were unable to do anything, and subduing a man, and subduing him governmentally too. The saints did not have anything to do with it. God did it.
C.W. So that the Lord says to Philadelphia, "Thou hast a little power ... Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan ...".
J.T. Just so.
P.H.H. Would the proconsul be a man who would bring in not only intelligence but a measure of authority into the assembly? I was thinking of him as being a sample of assembly material.
{228}
J.T. I think we can trace men of this kind on that line through the book of Acts. The great basis of it is that the converts at the beginning, according to chapter 2, persevered in the apostles¬ teaching. That is to say, they had regard to authoritative and reliable teaching. They persevered in the *apostles¬* teaching. It was not that of Moses, nor that of the prophets, but the teaching of the *apostles*. It is as if the Lord was saying that He had made selection and these were His representatives and He looked for submission to their teaching. We know this came about, as it says, "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". Then as regards the Lord's supper, there was intelligence as to it. It was never said to be in the temple, nor is it ever linked with the temple. Although other things were linked with the temple, indeed the praises of God were carried on by those that were with the Lord after the Lord went up to heaven, as it says "*They* ... returned to Jerusalem ... and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God", yet the Lord's supper is never mentioned as in the temple. It shows that there was intelligence in what was being done.
Ques. Would it be right to say that the service in relation to the temple, when it says, for instance, "Speak ... all the words of this life", was with a view to waiting on Israel and bringing out the remnant into Christianity; but after Stephen there was nothing more of that, and, in the Lord's supper, we have what distinctively belongs to the assembly which was never connected with Israel at all?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Is there not a difference between the early waiting of God on His ancient people and what came about after the martyrdom of Stephen?
J.T. Yes. The mind of God was coming into evidence, so that the wicked attack on Stephen was observed. What happened showed that it was observed in heaven. Hence Stephen says, "I behold the heavens
{229}
opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God". It is as if the Lord is there still ready to serve, for the service is to go on.
J.G.W. It says in @Ecclesiastes 8: 11, "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set in them to do evil". Do you think there is an immediate sentence against the evil work here, so that the way is made clear for this intelligent man to be confirmed in the faith?
J.T. Things were done quickly. Of course, in a day of small things we sometimes have to wait for things. We go along and we have to be humbled about them and suffer with them, and suffer because of them, but God comes in in time. We can count on God to come in if there is an attack of any kind against the truth. If we give Him time and be patient, He will come in.
A.D.T. Would you say a word as to "Paul and his company".
J.T. That would show I think, that he was being honoured already. He had distinguished himself on moral lines, and not simply in ability, in the sense of gift. There was not very much being done so far, except in one man, but the moral side was there in Paul. The word *little* as indicated in the name *Paul*, was in itself enough, and now it is "Paul and his company". God does not hesitate to link on the idea of a company with Paul. God will respect at any time those who serve Him, and if they wait on Him He will attach others to them.
Rem. I was thinking of Paul's word to Timothy, "Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner", @2 Timothy 1: 8.
J.T. Just so.
Ques. There is always a danger of turning away from the distinctive feature of the moment?
J.T. That is just what is seen here.
Ques. Would Jerusalem be what had been accredited in the past?
{230}
J.T. I would think so. It says, "John separated from them". That was a humbling and sorrowful matter, for it was Paul's company that he was separating from. It says he "separated from them and returned to Jerusalem".
Rem. Is it a lower standard?
J.T. It shows that he was just governed by national feeling or that sort of thing.
Rem. It says in chapter 15: 38 that he "abandoned" them.
F.C.H. Is it not remarkable that, in the ways of God, Paul's first island and his last island are still under the authority of those whom God has used to preserve the truth of Paul's ministry governmentally -- Cyprus and Malta?
J.P. There was something in "the chief man of the island" (@Acts 28: 7) at Malta that would indicate that God was there. He took account of Paul and his company.
P.L. Does "his company" mean that you are going right through with Paul, and that together?
J.T. That is the idea. Let us not forget John, but cleave to Paul. That is the word for us today. Cleave to Paul. I have never felt the power of the place that Paul has in the mind of God in the testimony, more than I have recently.
Ques. Does not John really continue morally with Paul? The Lord says of John "If I will that he tarry till I come", @John 21: 22. Does he not fill out, in many ways, the substance of what Paul brings forward, so that he writes to Paul's assemblies in Asia?
J.T. He does. We have to begin with the place that Paul has in all these matters, whatever it be. Whatever critical matter we may have to deal with, then we had better see if Paul has said anything and then begin there.
P.H.H. What is the difference between Paul's review of things in this chapter and Stephen's in an
{231}
earlier chapter? I am not thinking of the detail, but what are we to have in mind in thinking now of Paul's review in Antioch of Pisidia?
J.T. Well, I think we ought to pay attention to David and what he says, for it is a question of David here. The Lord says in Revelation, "I am the root and offspring of David". David thus represents something unique and great. Christ is the root of David, and I believe that refers to the quality in David. It says here of him, "then they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul, son of Kis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, during forty years. And having removed him" (notice that it is not simply that he died in war but that he was removed) "he raised up to them David for king, of whom also bearing witness he said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will". I think that is what runs through here.
W.C. Is it not noteworthy that Stephen in his discourse is more or less occupied with Moses? He only just touches Joshua, Solomon and David in about one verse, but is mainly occupied with Moses. Would that be suggestive?
J.T. I think so. I think that David is the one here. You would expect Paul to stress David.
A.M. Would that bear on the governmental setting aside of Israel and all that is Jewish in view of making way for the gentiles?
J.T. Well, it comes in here. It is said in verse 32, "we declare unto you the glad tidings of the promise made to the fathers, that God has fulfilled this to us their children, having raised up Jesus; as it is also written in the second psalm, *Thou* art my Son: this day have I begotten thee. But that he raised him from among the dead, no more to return to corruption, he spoke thus I will give to you the faithful mercies of David. Wherefore also he says in another, Thou wilt not suffer thy gracious one to see corruption. For David indeed, having in his own generation ministered to the will of
{232}
God, fell asleep, and was added to his fathers and saw corruption. But he whom God raised up did not see corruption. Be it known unto you, therefore, brethren, that through this man remission of sins is preached to you, and from all things from which ye could not be justified in the law of Moses, in him every one that believes is justified". Therefore it goes on, "See therefore that that which is spoken in the prophets do not come upon you, Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish; for *I* work a work in your days, a work which ye will in no wise believe if one declare it to you. And as they went out they begged that these words might be spoken to them the ensuing sabbath". So that the work is proceeding.
Ques. Does not that show a great advance in the truth as it was proceeding in the Acts? Was not Stephen's address in the nature of an indictment against the nation that had totally refused God's overtures? It was hardly an appeal to repentance or the preaching of the gospel. But here is it, so to speak, a fresh start in the gospel?
J.T. How glorious it is! And they wanted to continue, so that we are told in verse 49 "And the word of the Lord was carried through the whole country. But the Jews excited the women of the upper classes who were worshippers, and the first people of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their coasts. But they, having shaken off the dust of their feet against them, came to Iconium. And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit". So the chapter is triumphant.
P.L. Would the forsaking of the tabernacle at Shiloh be more connected with Stephen's indictment, and the choosing of mount Zion which God loved be developed in David? (see @Psalm 78).
J.T. That is good. That is the point, I am sure, and that we might get into our minds what David represents in the Lord's mind, in the book of Revelation. "*I* am
{233}
the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". David is linked there with the highest line of thought; he is so near to divine Persons.
P.L. Do you think that Judah prevailing above his brethren has the quality of David in mind, particularly?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. The bringing forward of David ensures that the whole will of God will be secured. It says of him, "who shall do all my will". Is not that the platform on which the work is continuing even today?
J.T. The quality of the work is in mind too. The Lord says in verse 16 of the last chapter of the Bible, "*I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come". That is the end of the thing. David is linked up there, we might say, with divine Persons; although not, of course, having part in Deity. Then the assembly, the bride, also is near to divine Persons.
{234}
GOD'S PRESENT AND ETERNAL RELATIONS WITH MEN
@1 Timothy 2: 1 - 15
J.T. The apostle's mind is affected in writing this, as to the necessity for supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, and that they are to be for all men. It is likely that the race is in his mind; the idea of man, or men. I say this because of the word in verse 5, "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be rendered in its own times". I was thinking of the expression *all men* and what was in the apostle's mind as priority. He says "first of all ... for all men"; then "for kings and all that are in dignity". Possibly that is to help us in view of the modern tendency to bring all down to one level and to be disregardful of God's rights in according rank to different persons, different titles and services. It is no doubt to bring out the idea of man as a being, worked out in the feminine as well as in the masculine, but here, first of all, we get the rights of God in promoting certain ones for wise purposes, and that these gradations of men are to be kept and maintained, so that God should have His way in them.
P.L. He Himself being "the King of the ages" as Paul says in verse 17 of the previous chapter?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Do you mean there is such a thing as delegated authority, finding its origin in God, but coming down in public matters amongst men, that must be recognised?
J.T. Just so. It should be known that the wisdom of God is in keeping with His love, and that whatever provision He would make for men, through kings and those that are in dignity, is really intended to help men.
Ques. Why does it say, "I exhort therefore"? Is there a reference in that to what has preceded?
{235}
J.T. I would think so. It is a sequential thought. "The King of the ages" in chapter 1 is a very fine thought, and what comes into one's mind is the expression 'Father of the age' (see footnote to @Isaiah 9: 6) and that the Lord Jesus has a place as Father. It does not speak of the general thought of God as Father, but to the paternal care exercised by the Lord Jesus, as indicated in the prophets. The 'Father of the age' would bring out what God is in Christ. It shows what Christ will do among men just as they are today, only Satan will be bound and thus limited, and the Spirit of God will have a measure of latitude, for God is going to pour out His Spirit on all flesh:- Clearly it will afford a wonderful time in that sense, even to men as such.
Ques. Are you referring to @Isaiah 9?
J.T. Yes. And in chapter 8: 18 it is said, "I and the children that Jehovah hath given me". The Lord refers in John's gospel, to the disciples as children and it works out, I would say, in the Lord's supper too, in what He had as instituting His supper. It was in a family setting, but it had to be worked out later. It has to be worked out according to the wisdom given to Paul, in the letters to Corinth. Then it is to be worked out in the service of God, involving the Father Himself as such and the Spirit too. But first there is the idea of the house that the Lord had, His own house.
P.H.H. In referring to the disciples as children, did the Lord take the place of the father of the house, the house-father? Is that what you are referring to in speaking of the Lord's supper as a family thought?
J.T. Just so. He told the disciples to go into the city and that they would be met by a man with a pitcher of water. The Lord then says, "Follow him into the house where he goes in; and ye shall say to the master of the house, The teacher says to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?" @Luke 22: 10, 11. The household thought had arisen undoubtedly from what was current in Israel,
{236}
and the Lord's supper developed from that. It would therefore be a question of Christ's house in that sense, as He was here on earth.
H.Bd. In Mark He says, "my guest-chamber".
J.T. I was thinking of that. Instead of "the guest chamber", it is "my guest-chamber", showing that what I was remarking is emphasised. It is a question of the household and how the truth is going to work out. The Lord would bring it out in due time in relation to His supper. It was a household matter in that sense; not in the sense of God being Father there, but Christ being Father. That is to say, He would act in that capacity.
Ques. Do you mean that the Supper was really the provision of His care for His own?
J.T. Quite so. But, as has just been remarked, the Lord says "my disciples", the idea of the Passover entering into that. And so I would say it was worked out from @Exodus 12. Israel's children would be brought up with that understanding, as they developed into boyhood and manhood. The Lord Himself is called "the boy Jesus", in @Luke 2: 43, and in due time He made it clear that His Father's claim was paramount with Him. At first it was said "take ... the little child and its mother", @Matthew 2: 20. He was a child, and in Matthew that is the way it is put; it is "the little child and its mother". The mother would be there because of the little child, and the care that was needed at that time. Luke and Matthew would therefore help us on those lines and show how the truth of Christianity in its public aspect works out here on earth in the Lord's supper, and eventually in the assembly; in its full sense in the assembly.
P.H.H. Does that mean that alongside of the lordly or dominical thought, there is the liberty and simple affection which is linked with the family in the house?
J.T. That is what I was thinking, and whether the brethren have been led on in any way into what has been drawn attention to in the first chapter. The
{237}
apostle refers to himself, and says, "For this reason" (that is, because he did things ignorantly in unbelief) "mercy was shown me, that in me, the first, Jesus Christ might display the whole longsuffering, for a delineation of those about to believe on him to life eternal". And then, "Now to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God, honour and glory to the ages of ages. Amen". Then he goes on, "This charge, my child Timotheus", (here we have the same thought, the parental thought), "I commit to thee, according to the prophecies as to thee preceding, in order that thou mightest war by them the good warfare, maintaining faith and a good conscience; which last some, having put away, have made shipwreck as to faith; of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme".
J.S.E. Is the allusion to "the King of the ages" intended to register in our minds the sense of the supremacy of God, and does the opening of this chapter suggest that all delegated authority is under God's hand for the preservation and liberation of the saints in relation to His matters?
J.T. I would say that, and especially the element of discipline. We have two persons here who made shipwreck and were delivered to Satan, "that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme". We may count on that in God's government, now, in regard of our young, and how they are to be taught by discipline.
A.B. Would this thought as to God being "the King of the ages" run into eternity or would it be limited to the millennial age?
J.T. Well, it is more the latter. Of course, we have a term that is rather like that in @Ephesians 3: 14, where it says, "For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be
{238}
strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God. But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think, according to the power which works in us, to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages". That, I think, leads us on into eternal conditions, which I would not connect exactly with "King of the ages" for that is another line of thought. @Ephesians 3, I think, brings out what was in the apostle's mind, first as to what he knew as to the mystery, and then how every family in the heavens and on the earth was named of the Father. It is *every* family, but then the one family that is in mind is the assembly, "the assembly in Christ Jesus".
P.L. Do the two expressions fit into the two epistles? Where the house of God is introduced in its provisional aspect, we have the reference in Timothy to "the King of the ages", while the "habitation of God in the Spirit", in Ephesians, brings it into its eternal setting, and hence the reference to "the age of ages".
J.T. I think the *ages* in @Ephesians 3: 21, must be a suggestion of what is eternal to fit into our minds so as to enable us to compass what is in view for us as to the assembly. If the word *ages* were set by itself, or the word *ages*, then it would be more limited, and probably, it would allude to the millennial period, but the millennial period, in itself, must work out in some way into eternal conditions. It is not clearly laid down for us, but @1 Corinthians 15 says that "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God". We have to understand what that means.
Ques. Do the words, "Then cometh the end" (@1 Corinthians 15: 24), suggest that what is worked out in
{239}
various ages will find a certain culmination in the millennium; whereas the passage in @Ephesians 3 says the "generations of the age of ages"? Do you think that makes a distinction?
J.T. I think so, though I am not so sure as to be dogmatic. For a good many years, perhaps since the time of the Bristol meetings in 1931, the thought that this passage involves eternity has been developed. I think it does.
Ques. Do I understand the expression "now to the King of the ages" has in mind all the past ages that have been referred to in the earlier part of @Ephesians 3; what has been written from the ages or throughout the ages? Does not that find a certain culmination in the millennium and will it not be demonstrated at that time?
J.T. I think that is good. So if we use the term 'the Father of the age'; it says "The everlasting Father" in the Authorised Version, but literally it is 'the Father of the age', undoubtedly it is the age called the millennial age that is in mind. He is to be a Father, not in the sense of a father to his family, or to his son, but rather in the sense of care, which flows from wisdom and experience. Christ will exercise authority in that sense. It was well used in America many years ago; Washington was said to be *the father of his country*. God says, that Eliakim "shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah", @Isaiah 22: 21. The youth are to be brought up among us, and the brethren have great advantage in that they have this light from God as regards their children, starting from the very outset; the Holy Spirit being here in this particular age that we speak of as Christianity. The children of believing parents are even said to be holy, they have that advantage. All the instructions to the children of believing parents ought to be based on that light, taking advantage of what there is, what God is pleased to give us to use. What a word He gives us in saying, that our children are holy! The Lord Jesus was a Child. Speaking reverently, He was a Babe
{240}
and before He was born He is called "that holy thing". It says in Luke "that holy thing", but that is a substantial thought. That could *not* be said of the children of believing parents; such are only relatively holy. God is pleased to give us that privilege so that we are able to view our children according to that word. But then it is a question of how we bring them up and what instruction we are able to give them, and what example we are able to show them.
P.H.H. Does the term in Timothy, "our Saviour God", fit in with these thoughts of the King? In Titus also the term *Saviour* is used many times, whereas in Ephesians, which you have been speaking of, it is more God as the Father. Would the Saviour have to do more with the external side of things, where prayer is so much needed?
J.T. There is a reference in chapter 6 that might be touched on in regard of that. It says in verse 12, "Strive earnestly in the good conflict of faith. Lay hold of eternal life, to which thou hast been called, and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses. I enjoin thee before God who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession, that thou keep the commandment spotless, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall show, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship; who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom be honour and eternal might. Amen". That passage, I think, ought to be considered in connection with the first chapter. The "blessed and only Ruler", in chapter 6, is God Himself in His eternal relations.
P.H.H. It gives us the impression of the greatness of the One who is our Saviour God. Is that thought to be before us in our prayers? It says, "this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God".
{241}
J.T. All these references that we have now touched on enter into this first epistle to Timothy, and they work out in the idea of man, and then absolute rule in God. First there is a King and then the "blessed and only Ruler". He is the One who is to show, as it says, "which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall show, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship; who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom be honour and eternal might. Amen". So that in the "Amen" here we have reached, I would think, a fulness and a definiteness in the subject we are dealing with. It is all working out in God Himself.
Rem. So that His eternal glory and majesty are not, in any sense, diminished by the approach He has made in grace and mercy as a Saviour. They remain unimpaired and will do so eternally.
J.T. Quite so.
J.S.E. Do you make the expression "eternal might" in chapter 6 more extensive than the "King of the ages" in chapter 1?
J.T. Well, I think "eternal might" is one of the strongest expressions you can get, bearing on this subject. The *king of the ages* is not quite as strong, I would say, as *eternal might*. Some of these expressions occur in the first hymn in our book, but it calls, for adjustment, so that the thoughts may be clearly distinguished. What the first verse of the hymn speaks of is attributed in Scripture to God as such, whereas what is said in verses 2 and 3 refers to the Lord Jesus as in manhood. Generally, however, the hymn seems to be sung as though all referred directly to the Lord Jesus.
P.H.H. In the light of what you have said, perhaps we should have to reconsider the term "Father of Eternity"?
J.T. It really is the 'Father of the age', I believe, and would allude to Christ's care for that world, His fatherly care, not in the sense of God's care, but as
{242}
the Messiah and the place He will have in the coming world.
Ques. Does not that verse (@Isaiah 9:6) refer to Christ in manhood throughout, "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder"? It refers to the place the Lord has as Man in the millennium.
J.T. The whole passage depicts the Lord in manhood, the title "the Father of Eternity" included.
P.L. Filling out the great patriarchal thought in the fulness of His Person?
J.T. That is right. But as Man here, and as proper to the Messiah.
Rem. The whole passage reads, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity [or Father of the Age], Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with judgment and with righteousness, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this", @Isaiah 9: 6, 7.
J.T. That shows that it is Christ as Man that is in mind and yet these wonderful terms are attributable to Him.
W.C. Is the expression something like what Joseph says, in @Genesis 45: 8 "God ... has made me a father to Pharaoh".
J.T. The very same thought.
W.C. That means that God had appointed him father on behalf of Pharaoh, so that he is over all his affairs and people.
J.T. Joseph's moral greatness suggested to Pharaoh that he should give him the supreme place in the kingdom.
{243}
Ques. With regard to your remarks as to the first hymn, is your thought that the kingdom of God continues to eternity?
J.T. I suppose so. We would have to analyse the words, but @1 Corinthians 15 states that "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God". We have to work out what that really means and what a process the saved inhabitants of the coming age, what is called the millennium, will have to go through so as to bring them up to the level of eternal conditions.
Ques. Would you say that the assembly reaches her eternal conditions before the millennium?
J.T. Quite so. As soon as we are raised and glorified, we reach eternal conditions. The eternal conditions imply Christ glorified, not simply Christ as He was in the forty days here on earth, but Christ glorified, in the condition called "his body of glory", @Philippians 3: 21.
Ques. Even Christ in the forty days was not in flesh and blood conditions, was He? He says, "Flesh and bones", @Luke 24: 39. Is there not that distinction?
J.T. There is. What could be said as to Him showing His hands and His side? The question is whether these conditions are retained eternally, or whether they are not just used to bring out certain things at the beginning, so that our minds should be formed accordingly. We are dealing with things that are very great, and one would be very careful, lest one should, in any way, mislead the brethren; but I think these things are worthy of thought.
A.B. Would you distinguish between the earthly side of the millennial period and the heavenly side and the part the assembly will have in the millennial day?
J.T. Quite so. John says in @Revelation 21: 1, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea exists no more". We have there something that is after the millennial conditions, therefore we are entitled to think of the assembly coming down, for John also says, "I saw
{244}
the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband". Then he goes on, "And I heard a loud voice out of the heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them". The tabernacle of God thus may be rightly identified as the assembly in this passage. When we are raised with Christ, not according to @Colossians 2, but according to @1 Thessalonians 4, when the Lord descends from heaven with a shout, and the dead in Christ rise first, and those that are alive and remain are changed and caught up to meet the Lord in the air, to be forever with Him, that is the final condition into which the assembly is coming, that is the heavenly side of things. So that we are entitled to regard ourselves, that is as those who are of the assembly, as the first family in God's mind. The assembly comes into these conditions first, and then other families come in doubtless in the millennial day.
P.H.H. Does the testimony of all that have some influence upon us now? I am thinking of the remaining verses in @Revelation 21, which do not seem to be quite on the same level as the two verses you have read. Would you say they bring in the testimony of an eternal state of things bearing upon the present? The eternal state of things is then to be powerfully before our minds at the present time.
J.T. That is the meaning, I would say, of all testimony, for if it is presented to us, it is to form us. Therefore if we are to be formed for eternity, now is the forming time, and it is through our minds and affections.
P.H.H. Is it not right to say that the truth, some years ago, bore largely upon the world to come; but are we being helped now a step further into the influence of eternal conditions?
J.T. I think that is right. I think the Lord is helping us in dealing with the truth in dependence on
{245}
the Spirit. The truth thus gradually takes form in the minds of the brethren generally.
Ques. Does the promise, "I will give to him that thirsts of the fountain of the water of life freely", imply that the Spirit in His service would bring us up to that point, to eternity?
J.T. The whole passage, I think, would be in that line. Then verse 9 is to bring us back to millennial conditions, but *in the heavenly side of them*. The first eight verses of chapter 21 are to bring out what we are coming into presently. "He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son". Verse 9 shows the place that the assembly has in the millennium; it is the assembly *above*; it is not on earth.
Ques. Would things work out that way in principle now? If we touch the heavenly side of the truth, as associated with Christ and as answering to His heart, then as we turn to the sphere of administration, we do so as conscious of the place that we have in heaven?
J.T. Yes. The idea of administration is more emphasised in these verses beginning at verse 9 than anywhere else in Scripture. They are connected with the assembly in its bearing towards the millennial world.
A.B. Would that have a present bearing today on our position in the house of God?
J.T. It does. All testimony is intended to affect us, the Spirit of God bearing witness to the truth.
A.B. In verse 3 of chapter 1, Paul says to Timothy, "I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus". Does that have a bearing on the epistle, Timothy really being an Ephesian?
J.T. Very good. Ephesus was in the apostle's mind in writing the epistle to Timothy.
P.L. The saints, as together in love in the light of divine purpose, furnish a congenial atmosphere for the development of the truth of the assembly in its provisional setting here.
{246}
J.T. Quite so. You thus have statements as to the napkins taken from the apostle's body and what they could effect. These statements belong to that period and show the superior quality of things then and what could be said of that period.
Ques. Seeing that Ephesus is in view, with all the privilege that belongs to the light that shines there, is it important that, in the maintenance of things here, the good conscience is mentioned twice? In verse 5 of chapter 1, "But the end of what is enjoined, is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith". Then in verse 18, Paul says, "This charge, my child Timotheus, I commit to thee, according to the prophecies as to thee preceding, in order that thou mightest war by them the good warfare, maintaining faith and a good conscience; which last some, having put away, have made shipwreck as to faith". Is this a reference to the moral state that is to accompany the heavenly light that is shining?
J.T. Just so. Even if we are not formed up to it *fully*, yet if we have the light with purpose and honesty of heart, God will own that. He will own the light that we have and He will credit us with it. So that light in itself becomes power at the very outset. The formation that will be needed for eternity will come about in due time, but light comes in first.
F.P.S. Would you say what you had in mind in referring to the napkins taken from Paul's body, and how it affects us today?
J.T. Well, it only affects us as reverting back to it. That is to say, we are reminded of the superior power of the testimony at that time. It helps you to think of it.
P.L. So that you cherish the truth set out in its grandeur in pristine days, as in 1 Timothy, and stand by it in the evil days of 2 Timothy.
J.T. Yes. Then our minds are to be prepared for the eternal conditions, because we are coming
{247}
into these anyway. Even although we are now in a day of small things, we are coming into them, because God can do things quickly. He has His own mind and pattern to complete, and He can do things in the twinkling of an eye. What He has thus in His mind will surely come about. Therefore the importance of having these things in our minds and being able to think of them, and speak of them, even although we may not come up to them fully in our affections and understanding.
P.H.H. Would you mind saying a word about "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one"?
J.T. It is clearly better and more correct to say that "God is one", than to say "there is one God". To say that there is one God is, of course, the truth, but God being one implies the three Persons in infinite unity.
P.H.H. Does the further statement, "and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus", mean that the "man Christ Jesus" is in perfect unity with God?
J.T. Quite. What we were saying at the beginning, I think, is true, that man, as a being, is in mind in this chapter, and all is worked out in Christ being the Mediator between God and men. Humanity in Christ, the Man Christ Jesus, is the thing to have in mind. If we are to understand humanity at all according to God it must be apprehended in Christ.
P.L. Could we have a word on manhood and womanhood in relation to the approach to God by men and the setting forth of God in the deportment and dress, the modesty and discretion of women?
J.T. The word *man* here in verse 8 is man in contrast to woman, and not simply man as a race. Hence woman has her place and may be compared with him, and so the holiness according to God may be worked out in this, even to the birth of children. Clearly the idea of holiness is in mind. We might just run over the
{248}
passage from verse 8, "I will therefore that the men pray in every place" (meaning men and not women), "lifting up pious hands, without wrath or reasoning. In like manner also that the women in decent deportment and dress adorn themselves with modesty and discretion, not with plaited hair and gold, or pearls, or costly clothing, but what becomes women making profession of the fear of God, by good works. Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection; but I do not suffer a woman to teach nor to exercise authority over man" (again the same word is used for man in contrast to woman), "but to be in quietness; for Adam was formed first" (that is an important matter), "Adam was formed first, then Eve: and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been deceived, was in transgression". All this is brought in to develop what is comely in both sides, but especially in woman.
P.L. If women are to be silent in the assembly, are they, as in modesty of attire, peculiarly privileged to speak to God silently?
J.T. That is bordering on @1 Corinthians 11, where we have the headship of God brought down to Christ, and then to man, and then to woman. That is a very important matter as leading up to the truth of the assembly in that epistle. This epistle evidently is more from the standpoint of Ephesus, that is what was in mind in this first letter. Timothy, as the first chapter tells us, was left at Ephesus for a purpose; it was that the truth of God should be worked out there. It was to be the great assembly of the truth, setting out the primal thoughts of the truth, as seen in the seven assemblies in Asia. The truth of the assembly was to be worked out in Ephesus.
Ques. What was in your mind when you emphasised that "Adam was formed first, then Eve"?
J.T. It was just to bring out, that although woman failed, for she was the first in transgression, yet the man is brought into it. He did not transgress of himself, he
{249}
was brought into it. But then he is able to name Eve. That is, her title henceforth is not to be Woman, but Eve, "because", it says, "she is the mother of all living", @Genesis 3: 20. It is a very important thing that the idea of "the mother of all living" should be in our minds, and that Eve should have that place. It would mean that there must be a process gone through to bring out what is in accord with eternity, the mind of God having eternity in view. That would mean that the idea of man and woman, in the ordinary sense, gives way to Christ and the assembly, and that all below, that is such as the earthly side, must go through a process which would mean that they are in accord, in some sense, with the heavenly side, because "flesh and blood", it says, "cannot inherit the kingdom of God".
A.M. It elevates the present time of working things out in relation to the ways of God and our part in it.
J.T. It does. We are living in a great period, and we are soon to be conformed to Christ's body of glory. We will have bodies like His, so as to come up to the level of the divine mind. The Lord is working on those lines to bring us in intelligent affection up to the very highest level of the mind of God. When the time comes for it, God will operate so that everything is in accord with His own mind. It may happen in an instant because God is God.
P.L. The persons are being formed now, suited to be clothed with that body of glory.
J.T. Quite so. We are to be inwardly and outwardly in complete accord with the divine mind. Paul says, "We have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens", @2 Corinthians 5: 1.
Ques. In the meantime, has not God's ordering in creation to be observed? In spite of equality on the spiritual side, and what God has in His mind, we cannot, in the meantime, go beyond, say, a scripture like this.
{250}
J.T. While keeping that in mind, we are also keeping in mind the light that God is furnishing. He has His own mind about everything and there will be nothing out of accord with it. Not one will be missing, and not only the persons, but the state will be according to the mind of God. I am certain that there will be no discrepancy whatever.
W.C. Does the expression in Hebrews "the consummation of the ages" (@Hebrews 9: 26) describe this present period, in which God is working out now all the objectives He has had in mind from the beginning?
J.T. Quite so. The passage in @1 Corinthians 10: 11, "upon whom the ends of the ages are come", brings *us* into this.
G.W.B. John says, in his first epistle, "the darkness is passing and the true light already shines". Has that any bearing on it?
J.T. Quite so. "The darkness is passing". It is not viewed as having passed, but what we are speaking of means that it will pass. When we have a new heavens and a new earth, it will have passed, and @Revelation 21 contemplates that the full result will be brought out and will shine in the administrative side. God will have an administration in the millennial day in keeping with His mind, and the persons who will be in the administration will be such as ourselves, those who form the assembly, because the reference is to ourselves. The measurement of the administrative side is really the measurement of the assembly; it is a cube or solid measurement. It refers not to mere profession, but to what is solid and in holiness.
P.H.H. In @2 Corinthians 5 where the apostle says, "We have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens", he also says, "Now he that has wrought us for this very thing is God". A statement like that would help to bring us into line, in our minds, with God's eternal end.
{251}
J.T. Quite so. It says at the end of that chapter, "*We* henceforth know no one according to flesh". The question is, How are you going to arrive at that? Then it goes on, "But if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer". We must understand what that means.
P.H.H. Do we take the ground that "the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new: and all things are of the God who has reconciled us".
J.T. That is the abstract thought of it. It says, "if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation". It is not exactly that *he* is that, but there is such a thing as that, and that is all abstract.
Rem. That enters into our calculations as we view one another.
J.T. We have to learn to think as Scripture does. Literally, you cannot say that we do not know anyone after the flesh. Paul could say that, as being governed by the truth in the abstract.
Ques. To Philadelphia the Lord speaks of "the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem". Does that refer to eternal conditions?
J.T. That is to bring those things into the actual state of things contemplated in Philadelphia.
{252}
THE CHILDREN OF GOD
@John 1: 11 - 18; @John 21:1 - 14
J.T. The thought of the children of God is in mind, especially as referred to in the gospel of John. The spirit of the gospel of John is the spirit of grace. The passages read are put together in order to bring out these two things; that is, the children of God and then grace. Grace is seen in the first chapter, and it says, "of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace. For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ". Then, in the last chapter, the principle of the gospel is worked out in grace in the persons who were going astray. Clearly they were persons who had the Lord in their hearts, for the work of God had already taken effect in them, yet, for the moment, they were like the two going to Emmaus, they were on the wrong way. The Lord does not deal with them on the principle of law, but on the principle of grace. He does not say one word in the way of reproof to the seven who had gone fishing. That is in keeping with the first chapter, where we not only have grace set up in Christ, but grace received too, "of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace". What has therefore been received, in that sense, ought to be intelligible to us. We ought to be able to speak of it freely as received. It follows the thought of the children of God formally, as the passage states, "He came to his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God". The brethren will be aware that the thought of the children of God is more peculiar to John than to any of the gospels. Paul deals with it too, but John never mentions sons, except in @Revelation 21. John thus refers to us as in our place down here; we are
{253}
begotten of God and have the liberty to take the place of being children of God. This designation should help us all to think of the variety that is found in the saints. Gideon had that in his mind when he enquired of the men slain at Tabor. He said that they were the sons of his mother. The slayer said they were like him; "As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the sons of a king", @Judges 8: 18. One has been impressed with the variety of brethren here this afternoon, showing what God has on earth, at the present time, both as to assembly service and as to affection drawing us together, and as to actual levitical work too. "Children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation; among whom ye appear as lights in the world", @Philippians 2: 15. Humanity is drifting away from Christianity, especially in the East. It is therefore all the more incumbent upon us, as children of God, to bear that stamp, that is to say, the character of God in Christ amidst the general adversity.
F.C.H. Do you regard the expression, "To those that believe on his name", as bringing the thought of receiving Him down to the present time?
J.T. It brings out the character of John's gospel. It was written late, not simply to bring out what was current, but to bring out what *had been*, in the way of testimony at the beginning. John's writings, especially the gospel and the book of Revelation, bear a character suggestive of their being written late, and they bring out the truth as to God Himself. The word in chapter 1 is, "to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God". The Spirit of God would bring out what had been, and what had borne the brunt of the opposition against the truth before the final declension came in. Hence way is made for the last days. I should think that there is more in the beginning and the last days than in the middle of the dispensation. The first chapter
{254}
brings out the children of God, those who have the title to take that place. Then chapter 21, which we may call the appendix, refers to those who were astray; yet the defect was shallow, and so the Lord withholds reproach and shows grace. He would bring out the full thought of grace at such a time.
Ques. Have you in mind that this is the present counterpart of sonship down here?
J.T. I think so. The Spirit of God connects the full thought of sonship with heaven, for it is a question of the calling of God. The children are in the place where things are contrary, as we have said, "in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation; among whom ye appear as lights in the world". Abstractly the epistle of John would bring out what the work of God really is. He says, "Even as *he* is, *we* also are in this world", @1 John 4: 17.
Ques. Would the expression, "lights in the world" suggest the thought of variety which you have mentioned? Paul says, "For star differs from star in glory", @1 Corinthians 15: 41.
J.T. Yes; the difference is in glory.
Ques I would like to get clearer what you said about sonship in view of the word in @Galatians 4: 6, "Because ye are sons". Whilst the full development of sonship involves glorified bodies like Christ above, is not the fact of sonship extant now?
J.T. I would say it is a question of light at first. Paul says, in that epistle: "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus", @Galatians 3: 26. The light can be regarded as if the thing were substantive. God, I think, treats light in that way Himself, as He said, "Let there be light. And there was light". The apostle Paul brings that in, and, translating it into the New Testament, he says it is in the face of Jesus Christ: "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". It becomes substantial. I think the light is
{255}
thus regarded in Galatians, because it says, "But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father". The expression "because ye are sons" is taken up by itself as apart from the Spirit of sonship.
Ques. I was thinking of sonship involving the heavenly side, whereas John says, "Now are we children of God", @1 John 3: 2. The term *children* seems to apply to us as down here as rightly representative of God. We are *born of Him*, not of the generations of men; whereas sonship seems to involve God's pleasure in us as linked with Christ as above. I wondered whether they ran on concurrently at the present time?
J.T. What I was saying as to Galatians, I think, is helpful and should be kept in mind. Galatians treats the idea of sonship by itself, before the actual Spirit of sonship is viewed as in conjunction with it. Perhaps the brethren might do well to examine that a little more. The light is treated substantially, in order to bring out the truth, and that makes way for "a spirit of adoption [or sonship] whereby we cry, Abba, Father". But sonship is treated by itself.
C.G. Is not God's object in the glad tidings that men should be brought into sonship? He revealed His Son in Paul that he might preach Him in order to secure such.
J.T. That is right, but I think what I was saying as to keeping the two thoughts relatively each in its place in Galatians is important. I think the idea of sonship treated by itself, and making way for the Spirit of sonship is only found in Galatians.
A.B. Would the verse in @Romans 8: 14, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, *these* are the sons of God", give a characteristic of the sons of God?
J.T. "As many as are led". Just so. But then we are entitled to speak of the element of sonship by itself, as Galatians does. "Because ye are sons", (not 'because
{256}
ye are *to be* sons'), "God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying Abba, Father".
A.D.T. Have we the privilege to enter upon it in the assembly service?
J.T. We have, because we know the Spirit is here now, and is available to us as a Spirit of adoption. He is not only the Spirit in the sense of the Comforter, but a Spirit of adoption. We know He is available to us, and that, in fact, as believers, normally each one has Him. It is not, of course, certain that each nominal believer has Him, because Paul raises that whole question in @Acts 19 as to the twelve men at. Ephesus. They were not clear about the Spirit, but still they had the light of John's baptism.
G.W.B. How does the word in @Matthew 17: 26 come in, "then are the sons free"?
J.T. I would say that would be sonship in anticipation, which we are bound to recognise, because the Spirit had not yet come. The Lord has to treat of the thing anticipatively, and so the idea of sonship is illustratively spoken of as among the gentiles in @Matthew 17: 25. The Lord says, "Then are the sons free", meaning that He Himself and Peter were sons. But then He says immediately, "That we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up ... and give it to them for me and thee". That is, Christ and Peter were sons. Of course, Christ was a Son in virtue of His own Person and rights, but Peter was not a son in that sense; he was anticipatively called a son, for the time of sonship had not yet literally come, and that is what Galatians treats of, the time of sonship. It applies the idea of time to the matter of the doctrine of sonship. It is a question of time. The children, it says, were "under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father". In the Old Testament times, although the principle was there, the actual time of sonship had not yet arrived,
{257}
and that is the point of view taken in Galatians. I would like to make that clear, because it is one of the most vital points before us.
P.H.H. When you speak about the light of sonship being treated as substantial, what do you mean quite by the light? Are you referring to the light of sonship, for instance, as appearing in Christ as Son?
J.T. Yes, whatever light it may be. God said, "Let there be light". That was the first commandment. He commanded that light should shine out of darkness, but we cannot just say what the light was. We cannot analyse it until we come to the fourth day, but then we have the greater light and the lesser light in the sense of rule. When you have ruling, then the thing is clear as to where the light is and what it is, but in the first day we cannot tell what it is. At the same time there is something there in the sense of substantiality, because God calls it day. He "called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night". So that what I was saying I think ought to be clear to us all, that the two things have to be taken separately, the idea of light, and then the Spirit of sonship by itself.
W.C. When it says "that we should be called the children of God" (@1 John 3: 1), is that the naming of what is there? In the first reference you made in @John 1, it is that we should be children of God. Does the calling mean that the thing is there, and so God names it?
J.T. The thing was there, but there it is a question of birth. It is not the new birth exactly, for it is more than that; it is what Christianity in its result had become in the history of the world. So in the verses read, we have what the thing is, "but as many as received him" (that is, Christ) "to them gave he the right to be children of God". That is, in the history of Christianity, believers had the right or liberty to take that place. It is not the calling of God in heaven, it is what they are down here.
{258}
W.C. It says, "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God".
J.T. The first chapter would indicate that God had given to them the liberty of regarding themselves in that way, and John's epistle implies that whoever might use the term, "children of God", there are persons who are so designated.
Ques. Does John's epistle make a difference in that it says, "Beloved, now are we children of God", but immediately adds, "what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is"? Is the full development of that involved in sonship?
J.T. I would think so. When it says, "we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is", that is sonship. That is not the thought of children. "We shall see him as he is". It is not as He *was*, but as He *is*. It brings out what is referred to in Philippians, that we are to be like Christ and like Him in His body of glory.
E.A.E. Does that correspond with the passage in @Romans 8: 21, where it says, "the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God"?
J.T. The creation is to be brought into the liberty of that; not into *that*, but into the *liberty* of it. It is what shines out, I would say; "the liberty of the glory of the children of God" would be the glory of sonship.
A.B. Would the presentation of the truth in @Hebrews 12 help as to that practically? The matter of discipline, which we normally associate with children, is linked there with sons.
J.T. Quite so. It shows that God is preparing us, through discipline, to be in the light of it now; in the good of it too, and in the practical expression of it.
{259}
A.D.T. The footnote in @Mark 7 says, '"children" in the sense of being born of the family, used by John to signify this relationship in Christians, as born of God'.
J.T. John's epistle contemplates Christians as children, and so does John's gospel, and chapter 1 of John's gospel treats of what had come about in the history of the testimony; those who received Christ had liberty to take that place; God gave them that liberty; they were not children by mere profession, but as born of God. They were before the universe, I would say, as having that place, for God had given it to them, and John's epistle supports it.
P.H.H. Do you regard it as significant that all these references to grace in @John 1 follow the matter of the children of God? We have "full of grace and truth", and then "for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace", and then "grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ".
J.T. The idea of grace is brought out in the section from verses 14 to 18, "For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ". The word *subsists* is singular, showing that the two things are combined in Christ and this brings out the character of the dispensation. The children of God have liberty to take that place as *born* of God. The liberty is given to "those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God". Here, in chapter 1, is not simply the new birth by itself as in chapter 3, but the full thought of Christianity. The word *sonship* is omitted carefully to bring out the right belonging to those who are *children*, which God had graciously given the saints, in this day. They can take that place, and have full liberty in taking it too.
Ques. As we take that place, is it incumbent upon us to maintain the spirit of grace that has come out in Christ?
J.T. That is the thing, I think, and, of course, we ought to see that it is necessary, especially in discipline.
{260}
The idea of discipline has in mind that we are to get on together; it is not simply that we should be excommunicated from each other's company, but that we should be kept together. The word in @Galatians 6: 1 is, "if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest *thou* also be tempted". The meaning of the word *restore* is to set up the person where he had been, so as to function in the position and to shine in it.
A.McG. Would the reference in @1 Corinthians 1: 10 bear on that where it says, "That ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united", and so on. The note to *united* says, 'Where all the members have each its own place, or make a whole; or, if broken, are restored to one complete whole, as, "mending"'.
J.T. It is to bring out the idea of restoring the brethren. It is not to get rid of them. The principle is, as Paul said, "That the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus", @1 Corinthians 5: 5. The fact is that that man was restored long before the day of the Lord, for he was restored here on earth. The Corinthians were too slow to set him up again, but the idea was to set him up so as to function where he had been.
P.L. A dispensation so great, as is this one, calls for such an elevated relationship in the saints to give character to it.
J.T. That is the thought. God would have Christianity according to what was in His mind. At the time of John's writing, the great failure had begun, and the book of Revelation, of course, makes that clear. At the same time the full thought of God should be maintained, and John's gospel is to help us to maintain it, and to keep things on their proper level. However few we may be we should see to that. So the principle of grace is stressed in the first chapter, and illustrated in the last chapter. Although there was failure in the seven who went off fishing, there was not a word of reproach. The
{261}
evidence shows that the failure was shallow; the Lord knew it was not deep, and so He invites them to dine, after saying, "Children, have ye anything to eat?".
A.M. Would it be right to say that grace is the principle of supply as over against the principle of demand that had previously operated?
J.T. I think the man in Corinth must have felt that there was the principle of supply in the assembly. I would say he soon came into it. The word firstly was, however, "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves"; however short the time would be that that should take place. The facts are that he was restored long before the day of the Lord; he was restored in Corinth, but they were slow to restore him.
P.H.H. Would you say that there is evidently to be a balance in our minds between the assembly acting in discipline and this priestly matter having in mind the restoration of the person?
J.T. It seems to me very remarkable that it should appear in Galatians. It is as if the Galatians were short of the supply, as our brother has just suggested.
P.L. The oil and the wine were not there.
J.T. Quite so. The Samaritan *had* the oil and the wine. The oil, I suppose, is to anoint. It also appears, for that purpose, in the recovery of the leper. The wine would be to stimulate, which is a great matter. If a brother is to be restored, he must be stimulated, and stimulated on right principles.
A.B. Would @Galatians 6 contemplate an isolated act and @1 Corinthians 5 rather a course?
J.T. @1 Corinthians 5 was a course; one of the worst courses of sin we can get. On the other hand Galatians contemplates priestliness in the saints, in having to do with each other, particularly in regard of failure. I have no doubt there were some who were priestly in the assemblies in Galatia, because they are treated of as *assemblies*; it is not one assembly. Undoubtedly there were genuine men there, and so the apostle says, "Ye
{262}
who are spiritual". They were to "restore". This implies that the erring one is set up again where he had been, and set up to function. The act of putting away or excommunication at Corinth did not suggest that the man should be set up for recovery at the present time, but rather that he should be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus; not saved for the testimony here, that is not the point. Galatians, however, has in mind that the person should be restored at once. There is no idea of being excommunicated, but restored.
P.H.H. The same apostle who wrote to the Galatians about this restoration, has also written to the Corinthians about excommunicating the person.
J.T. I am sure it is right to observe the two sides. No one would be quicker to recognise the need of excommunication by the assembly than the man that was under discipline. The apostle carefully speaks of what was going on in the man's mind as a result, and how he might be overwhelmed. He also speaks of what was going on in the minds of the Corinthians themselves; "What revenge!", he says; but it was not fully applied, for the man had not been really restored by them.
F.V.W. Is it important to see that it was the *priest* who went to observe how the leper was getting on? It was not the rulers, although they were existent at the time and had their function and authority.
J.T. Quite so. The priest was the leading man in Israel at that time. Although there were rulers, the general position at the beginning in Israel was a priestly position. The high priest was in power. But then it is not the high priest that is in mind in the recovery of the leper; it is just *the priest*. He is never wanting; he is supposed to be there.
F.V.W. The priest would have holy tender feelings which would exalt his thoughts about the leper, in contrast to the regulation that marks the ruler. Perhaps we have sometimes gone in the spirit of the ruler, rather than in the spirit of the priest.
{263}
J.T. The power really lies in the priesthood.
A.B. In a case where the matter may warrant excommunication, is your thought that the ministry of mending as in @Galatians 6 in a sense should be brought to bear immediately on the person so that there might be recovery without the excommunication, or did I gather that you said, the excommunication of @1 Corinthians 5 must take place?
J.T. Not necessarily. The two epistles are to be treated separately. They would, of course, fit into each other, but 1 Corinthians is one epistle and Galatians is another. Galatians contemplates that the person taken in the fault *could* be restored back into fellowship; there was power there to restore him. There is no need of going through disciplinary procedure if the man is restored. The thing is what the priest can do, and there is much that he can do, and does do in @Leviticus 14. It may be a question of what is inward in the man, and if he is restored inwardly there is no need to publish what he has done. The thing is to set him up suitably so that he can function in the assembly.
F.C.H. You make room for repentance and confession and contrition in these matters.
J.T. Yes. They might take place one after another.
J.S.E. Does the scripture in @Luke 17: 3, 4 have a bearing on this practically? First of all it says, "if thy brother should sin, rebuke him; and if he should repent, forgive him". Then it goes on, "And if he should sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times should return to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him". Does the first remark have any bearing upon what you are saying, as showing that there is the ability and necessity to forgive immediately the element of repentance shows itself?
J.T. If the element of repentance is there, the work is really done and the finish will come. The priest will know what to do. Repentance is the basic thought, and Luke makes much of that. The Lord says elsewhere,
{264}
"I say not to thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven" (@Matthew 18: 22), showing how intense the idea of grace is.
G.W.B. In @Leviticus 14 the complete reinstatement of the cleansed leper depended upon a long detailed process of priestly service. What is the significance of that to ourselves?
J.T. It is a question of the levitical book, the third book, coming in after Exodus, and it shows what God had provided in the priest and how fully the priest would look into things. The man is thus set up inside, and finally oil is put upon him so that he comes out anointed. We get details even as to which hand the priest is to use for the oil, which brings out the full thought in the mind of God in Leviticus and indicates the provision God has made to help His people to keep moving together as His people in dignity. The detail is remarkable and is to be studied in relation to the whole Pentateuch, because it is a question of the economy of God in the Old Testament. But then it may be looked at as figurative too, and the figurative side is the thing to lay hold of. That side is surely more than the actual legal side at the beginning.
A.W.G.T. Does the full answer to what is set out in Leviticus really require the present dispensation?
J.T. I think it does, for it contemplates Christianity. You cannot get the full truth of the Old Testament without Christianity. The Spirit brings the truth out.
J.J.T. So that forgiveness is one thought, but is not the final recovery a moral course?
J.T. Well, it shows how patient God is, and what a world we are brought into, a world of priests! We are spoken of as "priests of God and of the Christ", @Revelation 20: 6. It is to show what we are brought into as Christians, a world of priesthood! That is the skill of keeping the law and conveying the mind of God at any time. It says "the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law", @Malachi 2: 7. It is the priest's mouth.
{265}
W.H. Everything is done for the man to be restored on the part of the priest at first?
J.T. Just so. Everything is to be done for him. There is no hospital in the world that will apply such care as the spiritual hospital. That is to say, what God has provided for the preservation and carrying through of His people.
W.C. When it says in @1 John 1: 9, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness", would you bring in, so to speak, mediatorial service there?
J.T. Quite so, "and to cleanse us".
W.C. That might be through the brethren?
J.T. Quite so. It is what we are here today, and what we are able to do as priests of God and of Christ. We are priests to each other too, for we are to serve as priests to each other.
P.H. In @Galatians 6, "ye who are spiritual" seems to be stressed.
J.T. That is to bring out the priestly state, which is the spiritual state. The word "priestly" is really not a Christian word; it is a word borrowed from the Old Testament, but it is a forceful word, and we rightly use it.
Ques. Is it not brought in there as in contrast to the general legality that marked the place?
J.T. I suppose so. There were a number of assemblies apparently in Galatia. The apostle is not saying, 'If there are priests', but "ye who are spiritual", that is, those who are priests, "restore such a one".
A.D.T. Is that power seen affecting Peter before the Lord died? "The Lord, turning round, looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord ... and Peter, going forth without, wept bitterly", @Luke 22: 61, 62. "When once thou hast been restored". Is that the position of restoration?
J.T. Quite so. Peter was thus ready, so that when the Lord went back to Jerusalem from Emmaus, Peter
{266}
was there. They were speaking about him too, saying, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon". It shows how quickly things can be done, and yet they *are* done. They are not partially done.
E.C.M. Would it be a question of our discerning and keeping pace with the work of God in such a one? I was thinking of @Luke 15: 20, "while he was yet a long way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell upon his neck, and covered him with kisses".
J.T. I would say that.
R.S.W. Regarding the recovery of Peter, would the Lord's dealings with him in @John 21 be the finishing work?
J.T. That is a John picture. It is not a Luke picture. It is in keeping with what we have in mind, how John at the end is in keeping with the beginning, in recording how the Lord treated those seven erring ones; the very best and the leaders were among them. Peter himself was there, and James and John, I gather, were there, and yet there is not a word of reproach. But then the Lord went through the thing, for when He had finished what He had in His mind, we come to Peter. We have Mary Magdalene, and we have Thomas, in chapter 20, but then in chapter 21 we have Peter. The Lord has Peter in His mind, and He is not going to finish the matter unless Peter comes into it. It says in verse 14, "This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to his disciples, being risen from among the dead". Now all that we have already spoken about, this third manifestation, was finished, and then it says, "When therefore they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?". The Lord takes up the matter of Peter, not to upbraid him with going off fishing, but to bring out love among the brethren, and whether Peter loved according to his claim, that he would do more than any of them in love. The Lord wanted to bring that out. He had more
{267}
the thought of that, than simply to say, Well, Peter, you know, you led the others wrong. There is not a word about that. It is a question of Peter's love for the Lord.
R.S.W. Is that in view of his status as a servant?
J.T. It is a question of whether Peter loved more than the others did. If Matthew's thought of him is to be maintained, where it says, "First ... Peter", then he must be first in love or he is nothing.
P.H.H. I suppose he would be greatly affected by what had preceded. There was the great multitude of fishes and then what the Lord had prepared. Is there a basis now, in Peter's soul, for the Lord's last appeal to him?
J.T. I think so. We really need to look into the whole chapter, at our leisure, to see how Peter's case is taken up, because it is an appendix really. It is the end of the matter, and it is as if the Lord were to say, This matter of the disciples must come up and their love for one another and whether there is any rivalry amongst them. Reading from verse 21 we have, "Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what of this man? Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me". That is the end of the instruction to Peter; he is to be set right, clearly, and set right as following the Lord. He is not to be occupied with his brother, or with anyone that might perhaps have a status as good as his, or nearly as good. The Lord says, "Follow thou me", meaning 'Keep your eye on Me'. It is a question for each one of us, in this critical time we are in now, as to whether our eyes are on Christ. John writes in verse 24, "This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things" -- John is thinking of himself, because the Lord had given him this place -- "and we know that his witness is true. And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written". That is John's tribute to Christ's glory and greatness.
{268}
Ques. Does not the word, "Follow *thou* me", being emphatic, remind us of what Paul said to Timothy? The emphatic *thou* goes through his epistles, and the word comes down to every one of us.
J.T. Each one has to take it home to himself.
A.B. Are those like the individual loops of the net, so that it will not break however many great persons there are in it?
J.T. I think the power of the net really refers to the Spirit, for it is a question of the dispensation of the Spirit. Of course, if each one keeps his eye on Christ, he would be a link there. What is written in John's gospel makes allowance for the dispensation of the Spirit. "The Spirit", we are told, "was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified", @John 7: 39. The time has come now and the Spirit is here and all hinges on that in this dispensation.
G.P. Referring to the grace of the dispensation, would the rebukes be those of love?
J.T. Yes, where there *are* rebukes; but we have only a mild one here in the Lord's remarks to him, "Lovest thou me more than these?". There is no doubt an allusion there to the claim that Peter made, but still the chapter is full of grace, and I believe, it is in keeping with chapter 1.
A.H. Does the word in chapter 11 have any bearing on what you have been saying as to grace, "that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad"? Is this operation of the Lord, in chapter 21, the maintenance of the gathering?
J.T. I would say that. The word is, "Yet will I gather others to him, with those of his that are gathered", @Isaiah 56: 8. That is a comforting word. It is a great thought in John to keep in mind, that the name of Father, whilst, of course, it is literal as to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is yet generally used to express grace in Christianity.
{269}
P.L. Would the gathering power of grace both in relation to the sea and the land in this chapter suggest the wide scope of the Lord's operations at the end of the dispensation, their universal character? The fish from the sea, and then grace operating on the land as regards Peter and so on. Does it mean that no realm is excluded from the scope of grace, so to speak, at the end?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord was operating Himself. Think of what was there: "Jesus says to them, Come and dine. But none of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them". I think that is grace. It is the fatherly care that Christ has toward His children. We have had it already in the idea of the children of Christ, and Himself as the Father of the age. I believe this chapter brings it out in this word *children*. It is not simply the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, it is more the fatherliness of Christ; fatherhood was there in Him. Look at the tenderness with which He cared for them; "Jesus comes and takes the bread". He does it Himself. Who cooked that bread? Who prepared it? We have to assume the Lord did it. But then He says to them, "Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken", as much as to give them credit in spite of their waywardness. He allows *them* to take the fishes; He accredits them with having them. The number is given too, showing that the whole position is to bring out grace, and how it acts even in the way the Lord provided the dinner for them, and then the dignified word He uses, "Come and dine".
P.H. Are we to expect this care of the Lord right through, He being "the Father of the age"?
J.T. I think so. Even if we may fail, be sure and get right terms, dignified ones, in the service of God. We are dealing with the greatest things and must have terms suitable. So the Lord Himself uses the word 'dine' here.
{270}
Rem. The apostle ends most of his epistles with, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you". We have resources in the Lord, and they are to be made use of; "of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace".
J.T. Grace is to be shown. If the grace is to be brought out, it is from the Father; we go back to the source of everything. It is the Father, as in Ephesians. I think John has that in mind in the use of the word 'Father' in his gospel.
E.P. In @Ephesians 4: 32 the apostle says, "Be to one another kind, compassionate, forgiving one another, so as God also in Christ has forgiven you". And then in chapter 5, "Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children".
J.T. I think, at such a time as this, when the brethren are together from different parts, and their variety as children of God is seen, we have to get to Ephesians. We are not to forget John, but we are to cleave to Paul. Paul's ministry gives the full divine thought for the saints, and I believe when it is a question of grace, we must go to the Father for that, and this comes out in Ephesians.
Ques. As to the question of grace, it has been thought that where a person has been on a course of sin, exclusion is necessary even if they are repentant, on account of the Lord's name being involved. Does that conflict with this thought of grace and restoration which you have been referring to?
J.T. I think we would have to go by circumstances in that case. If the thing has *not* happened openly, if there is nothing public causing discredit on the testimony, then it might easily be settled privately, because grace is grace, and it "subsists through Jesus Christ". We cannot say there was any action taken as to Peter and yet his sin was very serious. I mean it shows what can be done and how God can do things.
{271}
J.S.E. I think this was in the mind of a brother earlier when he was speaking about @Galatians 6 and enquiring as to whether such a case necessitated what we speak of as a meeting of assembly character.
J.T. It is a question whether it does. The brethren ought to know what to do. The Lord gives us understanding, as it says, "the Lord will give thee understanding in all things". If therefore we are with God, we are not driven to the wall; we know what to do in every case, whatever it may be.
Rem. So that your first reaction to a matter, however grave it might be, would be to have @Galatians 6 in mind. If the person proved to be adamant and not susceptible to the grace that was bestowed upon them, either in the Lord's dealings or in the dealings of the brethren, it may come to a case of @1 Corinthians 5.
J.T. That is what I would say.
W.C. @James 5: 19, 20 says, "if anyone among you err from the truth, and one bring him back ... he ... shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins". Is it a question of discerning as to whether that is possible?
J.T. Just so. The Lord will not allow us to be driven to the wall in the government of the assembly. He would give us wisdom in every case. Therefore the expression, "Ye who are spiritual", must surely have a place in the care meetings. It is not only those that are old, but those that are spiritual.
A.McG. Does the thought of bringing back the sinner from the error of his way suggest that we are to move in such wise with the scripture in mind, "ye who are spiritual", so that the man is helped to judge himself, and be brought back?
J.T. Quite so. The influence of the priest would lead him to that. Normally that would be the effect of it.
A.L.R.T. In @Leviticus 14 it speaks of "the day of his cleansing". Would that imply that there is a time to be looked for, for restoration?
{272}
J.T. There is. That is a very good point, because chapters 13 and 14, which run together, contemplate the man's recovery from the very outset. They contemplate his being brought inside from being an outcast, first to remain at his tent door and then, as one might say, to get in touch with his family, but ultimately, the priest sets him up in dignity, so that he can function in the assembly.
J.S.E. Is there any significance in that we have elaborate instructions in the book of Leviticus about the matter, but when the concrete case comes to light in @Numbers 12, it only took seven days to deal with it?
J.T. Well, but that seven days was a dispensational period. *It would refer to Israel in the future*. She will have to stay for a while, but she will be brought back as it says, "all Israel shall be saved", @Romans 11: 26. God has never given that up.
P.H. In regard of the lapse of the seven disciples in @John 21, you did not think that it amounted to the same seriousness as leprosy or even @Galatians 6?
J.T. Well, it did not. There are grades in the divine way of dealing with things, and, of course, @John 21 does not contemplate such things as are spoken of in Paul's writings, such as @1 Corinthians 5. We get nearer and nearer to heaven, so that we will be like heaven and those that are going to heaven are going to heaven, as it were, in full sail. It is a very wonderful thought that the Lord is bringing us near to the time when we shall go up, and it is a question of letting that light have effect on us now, so that we shall be ready to join in the throng of those who are to be translated. It is said of Enoch, "Before his translation ..." and that would apply to us too. It is now *before* our translation, so then let it be true that we have this testimony that we please God.
{273}
THE MOUNT OF OLIVES
@Matthew 26: 30; @Mark 14: 26; @Acts 1: 12 - 14
J.T. The thought of the mount of Olives in relation to the Lord's supper is in mind. The singing of the hymn after the Lord's supper is mentioned in Matthew and Mark, but it is not mentioned in Luke. It would appear that it is intended to affect us as to the Lord's supper and lift our minds out of any suggestion of its entering into the position of the remnant of Israel after the assembly's period is over. The link with Olivet would take the Lord's supper out of the realm of the millennium, especially as @Acts 1 also mentions Olivet. It is connected with the resurrection here, and also lifts the resurrection out of the Jewish settings, and places it in spiritual settings; that is the bearing of the mount of Olives. Added to that is the *upper room* which also takes both the Lord's supper and the Lord's resurrection out of Jewish settings in the book of Acts. In the gospel of Luke it is in a Jewish setting, for the Lord took them out only as far as to Bethany. It was not to Olivet. Bethany was the place of Mary and Martha, but it was still Jewish; it was the place of love, but in connection with Judaism, and the disciples are seen returning from there to the temple. It says in the end of Luke, "*they* ... returned to Jerusalem ... and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God", @Luke 24: 52, 53. But Acts would show that those who saw the ascension returned to Jerusalem from the mount of Olives. There are certain incidents, recorded in the synoptic gospels, in connection with the Lord's supper that might well be connected with what we are saying. In each of the synoptic gospels the Lord, as reaching the place for the institution of the Lord's supper, had the twelve with Him, and that fact is intimately related with what is in mind in these passages. The Lord suggests in having twelve that there would be full administrative ability as the
{274}
Supper was celebrated in its time. This would, of course, bear on the present time as to those who take part audibly, carrying out the administrative side of the truth in the celebration of the Supper.
P.H.H. Do you mean that they would know what part to take in the service?
J.T. Yes. They know what to do, which is in keeping with the thought of "intelligent persons".
P.L. Would that fit in with the "two of you" in local settings, in @Matthew 18: 19?
J.T. Yes. "Two of you" would be an assembly matter, two being adequate testimony to whatever the matter was and even as to prayer.
P.H.H. We understand that what the Lord said through Paul to the Corinthians is to mark us, particularly today, but what is the chief gain of the setting of the Supper in the gospels?
J.T. I think it would assist us in understanding the setting of the Lord's supper in relation to the service of God. Paul is, of course, explicit as to it, for it is an assembly matter. Although features of the assembly are brought in in a negative sense in @1 Corinthians 11, nevertheless it intimates plainly that the celebration of the Lord's supper is an assembly matter. The gospels alone might imply doubt as to that, but I think the connection of Olivet helps to lift it into its proper setting.
Ques. Does it lead to what is heavenly, which is peculiarly Paul's ministry?
J.T. I think that is just what it does.
Ques. Would the continuance in "the apostles¬ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers", be a kind of preliminary background for the reception of Paul's light?
J.T. I would think so. The apostolic position would make way for him, because he raises that question, "Am I not an apostle?", @1 Corinthians 9: 1. The brethren, I am sure, would gladly recognise his apostleship, although there were those that questioned it at Corinth.
{275}
The idea of apostleship necessarily carries with it the idea of authority.
P.L. In the allusion to the Lord's appearings we have "then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to *me* also", @1 Corinthians 15: 7, 8. Does the setting of these two appearings link up Paul authoritatively with the twelve?
J.T. Exactly. The twelve are mentioned twice by themselves, first as "the twelve" in verse 5, and then as "all the apostles". Then Paul is mentioned as being also an apostle. It is, of course, of considerable importance to connect Paul with all this, because his authority is direct from Christ, and he is viewed by himself. The others are linked up together, but Paul's apostolic authority was attached to himself, it was a personal matter to him.
W.C. Would you say a little more about the mount of Olives, what it means, and how it bears on the Lord's supper practically?
J.T. You will notice that there was a hymn, and the idea of a hymn is also connected with the Lord's own ministry, the Lord's own service to God, for in @Hebrews 2: 12 we have the idea of hymning the Father. The instances in Matthew and Mark as to Olivet are to bring out the link with heaven, and also that it was not simply that the Lord sang the hymn, but in Matthew and Mark it was a matter for them all. The Lord would thus impart the thought of mutual feeling in that connection. If therefore we connect Olivet with the hymn, there is the idea of mutual feeling as well as the heavenly setting which is very important in regard of all that enters into the Lord's supper now.
Ques. Would it be right to suggest that, according to these scriptures, Olivet is subsequent to the hymn, as though power to go there lies in the ability to join in this mutual hymn? It says, "having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives". It does not seem as
{276}
though the hymn took place on Olivet, but the journey there was subsequent to it.
J.T. The hymn was in the meeting, that is, in Jerusalem; but Olivet was in mind.
W.C. Is the point in your mind that this mutual feeling, suggested in the hymn, is essential to our really moving in that way?
J.T. I think mutual feeling is a very important matter connected with the Lord's supper.
Ques. Would you think the singing of the hymn in this setting largely connects with the local position, whereas when you are beginning to touch Olivet you are merging into the spiritual sphere that involves the universal position? They would leave all that belonged to that former position?
J.T. I suppose so. It says, "they went out", as if the time required it. The actual celebration of the Lord's supper was in Jerusalem, but the going out was in mind and the mutual feeling too. If therefore the Lord's supper is celebrated in Jerusalem, it would mean that it is where the Lord was crucified. The celebration of the Lord's supper is in the place where the Lord suffered. In the book of Revelation it says, "the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified", @Revelation 11: 8. That intensifies the importance and bearing of the Lord's supper as involving suffering and reproach.
P.H.H. The Lord's supper in the locality would entail that it may take place in circumstances of pressure, whereas the mount of Olives would be a realm without pressure.
J.T. Well, that is what I was thinking. Olivet is therefore more spiritual.
P.H.H. The reference which you have made to Jerusalem would stress the local position to which sufferings attach. Nevertheless, as you have said elsewhere, "the Lord is near".
{277}
J.T. This is a very important matter as to persons coming into fellowship. They should be given to understand that the fellowship entails suffering.
Rem. Is that confirmed in the Acts where they say, "The kings of the earth were there, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ. For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in this city", @Acts 4: 26, 27. That would apply to any locality where the saints were walking in the truth.
J.T. The idea conveyed in *this*, I think, ought to be carried with it. It is always *this* city. Although, of course, the *this* there is Jerusalem, yet one has often thought of it as to the actual place where the Lord's supper is celebrated. The idea of the city is there. Even if it is only a village, the idea of the city will be found there, and hostility against Christ will be found there.
C.W. It has been said that we break bread in the wilderness. What is the connection between that and the city?
J.T. The city, in that sense, is the wilderness. It is the world where there is nothing that will support you at all. We have to look up for support. The extension of cities in modern times is one of the greatest problems really in connection with the administration of the Lord's supper and the service of God generally. The cities are so extended and carry so much the character of the world.
J.J.T. Referring to the mutual side, is it well to remember that we come together loving one another? Some say they love the Lord, but is not the test in the early part of the Supper as to whether we have love among ourselves locally?
J.T. I think that is what the Lord is thinking about too. He is rather thinking of the love one to another, somewhat more than about our love to Him,
{278}
because it is a question of a collective idea. The assembly involves the collective idea and, unless there be love one toward another, the Lord can hardly own it. Of course, it is a question of what He would come to, and then of what He finds when He comes. He is concerned about what He finds, and love one for another is the best test. He says Himself, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine" (not because ye love me, but) "if ye have love among yourselves", @John 13: 35.
A.M. Does the matter of the covering in @1 Corinthians 11 indicate the proper state of subjection amongst the saints? It is said of Rebecca in @Genesis 24: 65 that "she took the veil, and covered herself"; Isaac would be peculiarly pleased with that.
J.T. I would think so. What corresponds with Rebecca's action now would afford pleasure to the Lord.
Ques. Does what Rebecca says show how thoroughly in keeping she was with the means provided for her? She says, "Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us?".
J.T. The *us* means that she is one of the company, and the feminine side is stressed, too, before that. Then she enquires about Isaac, and she is told that it is the servant's master, and she veils *herself*. That links on with what has been said about @1 Corinthians 11.
P.H.H. According to the matter before us now, would the question be as to what kind of power is carrying us through the service of the Lord's supper; whether it is in the power and grace of the Spirit or whether perhaps just in correct terms?
J.T. It raises the whole question of the public position. The denominations have only an external position, and they are condemned by what is suggested in the fact that she rode upon a camel. The camels were provided by Abraham of old at the outset, but he is not mentioned now. As Rebecca rode upon a camel she enquired about Isaac, but he was taking notice of the
{279}
means of transport, referring to the power of the Holy Spirit.
W.C. When it comes to the actual service is the type the well? That is, we draw from the Spirit. The transporting power brings us to where He is, for the well is always there, so to speak.
J.T. I thought so. It is as if he were intimating that he has that in his mind. The wording would indicate that he has the well in his mind. It had historical significance in his mind in regard of the camels that he saw coming. Then Rebecca's inquiry from the servant makes the thing very vivid, because the servant is really the Spirit. I believe it is a figure of the Spirit, and synchronises with the idea of the well. It is a question of the Spirit and the place the Spirit has in these matters.
Ques. Would the mount of Olives be more the sphere of the Spirit, rather than the Spirit personally?
J.T. Just so. The sphere of the Spirit.
Rem. I was thinking of your suggestion of the mutual side and then going out to the mount of Olives. Does that raise the question as to whether we have availed ourselves of the power of the Spirit through the wilderness, so that when this time comes to leave it and move into the spiritual sphere, there is power in our souls to do it.
J.T. Yes, power in our souls.
W.C. Is not that the well, the power in our souls? Do we leave the well behind at all as we go through the service?
J.T. No, I do not think so. The Spirit is there from the outset. He is taking care of us in every detail, the question even of the children in the house, whatever the house may be, which we leave as we go to where the service of God is celebrated. The Spirit is constantly active in the whole matter even in regard of such. Then too, He is concerned with what happens on the way, on the road, and what might defile us, because He is intensely
{280}
occupied with the Lord in it all and would have us ready for the great matter.
W.C. What I meant was, does the figure of the Spirit carrying us through, taking charge of all in the wilderness, merge into the thought of the well when we are actually gathered in the service; and thus become the power for the service subjectively?
J.T. Yes. In John, the well in chapter 4: 14 is "a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life". I would say that must continue in the whole service, because it is a question of the upward trend of everything. We begin at the very bottom, so to speak. The Spirit is there, even in regard of our households, and our leaving them and entering into where the emblems are, and where the Lord's supper is to be celebrated.
Ques. Whilst the actual partaking of the loaf and the drinking of the cup together have a very unifying effect, would not the bearing of @1 Corinthians 10 greatly tend towards unity in our remaining true to the claims of the fellowship through the week?
J.T. I would say that.
Ques. So that any defect that might show itself at the time really arises from some constitutional thing, to discover which you would have to go further back?
J.T. "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: Therefore let us keep the feast ... with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth", @1 Corinthians 5: 7, 8. That is a great matter too.
P.L. Would Rebecca's willingness to give drink to the camels suggest the personal cherishing of the principles which work out in collective support when we move forward towards Christ? The very camels she had cared for were now supporting her, were they not?
J.T. Yes. She was not staggered by the work implied. You can see how much work was involved in her proposal and yet she goes forward with it.
{281}
Ques. Directly it is said that the camels had done drinking, you get the idea of ornamentation. Would that imply attractiveness?
J.T. Yes. The servant's amazement, too, is one of the most remarkable statements of the whole figure. He was amazed at Rebecca and what was there.
P.L. Does it prefigure the amazement of the greatest Servant of all? The Lord wondered.
J.T. Yes. He wondered at the centurion. It says, "When Jesus heard it, he wondered and said ... Not even in Israel have I found so great faith", @Matthew 8: 10.
P.L. So that all ministry of a levitical kind should be punctuated by this priestly amazement and thanksgiving, interwoven with the service, as with Paul, breaking out in worship from time to time.
J.T. Even Romans, the very basic gospel epistle, has these punctuations as you say. But they are more than punctuations, they are doxologies.
Ques. Does not that show where he was in his spirit even though ministering to the saints? He speaks of serving God in his spirit in the glad tidings. He was not occupied merely with the doctrine he was putting down, but he was in touch with God at the same time.
J.T. Quite so. In sufferings too, in the jail in Philippi, according to @Acts 16: 25, he and Silas were singing; that is, *hymning* as the word means. That was one of the most remarkable things, that in their prayers they sang praises to God by a hymn.
A.D.T. "My heart is welling forth with a good matter". Would that be the condition for the Supper?
J.T. Just so.
J.O.S. In @Ephesians 5: 18, 19, the apostle says "Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs". Would that be preparatory at all times for our being together at the Lord's supper?
J.T. I think it is more than that. That does not allude, as I understand, to mere formal service or
{282}
meeting, but at all times. It refers to the power that there would be in the Christian circle, the fulness of joy.
Ques. Would not the understanding of the assembly's place with Christ as being in our hearts as we assemble, greatly increase our esteem for one another, and our willingness to merge together as in this position, so that we may move on happily to the spiritual sphere that the Lord leads us to?
J.T. You just wonder sometimes how many join in the thing, because, whilst there may be present those who are in fellowship and those who are not, yet there may be those actually breaking bread who do not follow on; their heart is often outside. So that the stress is on the mind in these matters as the service of the Lord is to begin. *For the calling Me to mind*, the Lord says. That is to say, the mind is a faculty over which we have power, as Paul says, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". It is a question of what we have power over. Then it is said, "We have the mind of Christ", @1 Corinthians 2: 16. The Christian has the mind of Christ, so that he has power over his own mind, and that is essential if we are to serve the Lord in the Supper, because at the beginning it is a question of *the Lord*. It is the *Lord's* day and His supper, and according to @Revelation 20 we are priests, not only priests of God, but of Christ also. We thus have ability to serve in that sense at the very outset of the service.
Ques. Would you not think that the best way to help those who perhaps need help is for those who can go on to move on?
J.T. That is true. At the same time you would love to be in touch with one another, because there is that in the constitution of the assembly involving that we are linked on with one another inwardly. It is not only outwardly but inwardly, so that we are able to carry one another, so far as that is possible. We are carrying one another in the attitude of our minds, because the assembly is constituted thus. We are all linked together.
{283}
A.D.T. Is that the thought of the body?
J.T. Yes, it is. And so, "I speak as to intelligent persons" implies what is said as to our being one body, "We, being many, are one loaf, one body", @1 Corinthians 10: 17.
P.H.H. Is this collective side particularly emphasised in relation to the mount of Olives? It says, as you have remarked, "having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives". We have it likewise in Mark, and, in a different connection, in the first of Acts, "then they returned ... from the mount called the mount of Olives". Do you think we need to be feelingly together, to know that we are together when the higher part of the service comes before us?
J.T. I would say that. So that @Acts 1 contemplates the ascension, but before we have that given it is said, "Being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God; and, being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which said he, ye have heard of me". Then it says, "They therefore, being come together, asked him saying, Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel? And he said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority; but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. And having said these things he was taken up". Now you can see what was going on in the Lord's mind in all this when He was taken up. Speaking reverently, it was just full of the immediate surroundings, and they were the centre of things in His mind. It is a question of what *they* were. So that it says earlier, "he presented himself living" (verse 3). In fact, the whole passage runs thus: "having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up; to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days,
{284}
and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God; and, being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which said he ye have heard of me". The Lord, as I said, is just full of the environment and they are the very centre of it. So much so that He presented Himself living to, *them*; "to whom also he presented himself living". He is thinking of them, and that is before He ascended.
Rem. It was after *He* had suffered, but they were in a position where suffering would be entailed.
J.T. Quite so. Suffering was all over as regards Him in that sense, but He *presented* Himself, which is a very beautiful thought.
P.H.H. "Presented himself living" and "assembling with them" correspond with things which we know something about now in our assembly position.
J.T. Yes. Hence in @Acts 20: 7 Luke says, "We being assembled to break bread".
P.H.H. I was thinking of what came out last year in relation to the brethren, and the bride and the sons, and wondering whether in your mind the movement to the mount of Olives provides on the part of the saints with the Lord the environment where we can begin to be engaged with these heavenly relationships.
J.T. I would say that. Then what was in the upper room is part of all this that we are speaking of. It says in verse 12, "They returned to Jerusalem from the mount called the mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's journey off". The sabbath day's journey has something to do with the distance; where they had come *from*, and now where they have come *to*. They had come from Olivet, but they had come to Jerusalem and the upper room which is in keeping with Olivet. They do not go into the temple, as @Luke 24 says, but they go to the upper room, and we are told that Olives was a Sabbath-day's journey off. That has its own meaning, I am sure. Then it says, "When they were come into the city, they
{285}
went up to the upper chamber, where were staying both Peter, and John". So that we are now occupied with the quality of the persons there; the statement is "where were staying", these persons; and included in these persons were the Lord's own brethren and His own mother, with certain women.
Ques. When it says *staying* it does not mean visiting, does it? Does not the word "staying" here mean that they were characteristically there all the time?
J.T. I would think so. I would think this was a sort of rendezvous at that time, the beginning of Christianity. It is as if the Spirit of God would keep before us how things were at the start.
Ques. Would you say there is a distinct link between heaven, mentioned four times in verses 10 and 11, and the mount of Olives and the upper room? Are they all links in a chain? There is a sphere in touch with heaven spiritually, it is *in*, the city, and yet apart from it.
J.T. The upper room means that there is moral elevation in the position. It was in Jerusalem, but there is this moral elevation in spite of that.
P.H.H. Might the sabbath-day's journey bear on that, the distinctive place that Christianity has as completely separate from Judaism?
J.T. I think there must be something in that. It was not that the person could not literally walk more than that, but, I suppose, it was ordained, that they should not walk more than that distance. There must be something in the sense of nearness between the upper room and Olivet, Olivet being the spiritual sphere. The upper room refers to the persons who were there; we are affected by the persons.
Ques. Is Olivet, generally speaking, what is heavenly enjoyed here?
J.T. The Lord went there. Luke mentions that thought, which is a very touching thing. He says, "By night, going out, he remained abroad on the mountain called the mount of Olives", @Luke 21: 37. He must be
{286}
with the Father there. The others went home, but He was there, and then, in the morning, He is ready to teach them.
F.C.H. Do you connect the thought of glory with this cloud that received Him out of their sight, and what is said later that He "shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven"? Is that connected with His being "received up in glory" and the thought of glory entering into the service?
J.T. The glory is to be linked up with the *terminus* rather than with the way in. It is a question of the end. He was received up. The expressions "receiving up" or "received up" are a feature in Luke. It comes in early in Luke, "the time ... that he should be received up", @Luke 9: 51. When we come to the end, He is "received up in glory", @1 Timothy 3: 16. It is Paul that tells us that. We go from glory to glory; that is the way. Beginning from the very bottom, we go from glory to glory, and the terminus would be God.
Ques. But if the service of God according to Paul's ministry is to be entered upon, is it not essential for us to be able to leave what is merely circumstantial? Is not the mount of Olives the suggestion of the place where we leave what is circumstantial and get into what is spiritual?
J.T. I think 2 Corinthians greatly helps us in this matter, because the Spirit of God, I believe, intended to affect Paul as to the assembly especially, and the order of it. So the first epistle is the actual Lord's supper and the order of it, but in the second epistle it is not only the order of it but the *spirit* of it. Whatever it be that we are dealing with, the second epistle is more the spirit of things. That is to say, we are advancing on the upward line.
P.H.H. Might I ask what the difference is between the Spirit presented in the setting of water, and in the setting of oil?
{287}
J.T. Oil would be what is applied externally, whereas the water, in @John 4, refers to our *drinking* and implies satisfaction. In a sense it would be the same thing, only that the Spirit is used, in the oil, as external to give dignity. "Now he that ... has anointed us, is God", @2 Corinthians 1: 21.
Ques. Would water have also the thought of purification in view, whereas oil would be more the thought of spiritual dignity?
J.T. That is what I would think. Water would be cleansing, but I am sure the dignity is in the oil.
J.C.T. Would the saints as viewed as "sons of oil" afford conditions for the enjoyment of things now?
J.T. That is the connection in Zechariah.
Ques. Would it be right to say in connection with the mount of Olives, that it is not only the spot upon which we enter the spiritual sphere in view of the service of God, but it is to give character to those that are engaged in the testimony here? Is that somewhat the view of it in the Acts?
J.T. I think we might see now, in view of all that we have said, that they *come from* Olivet. In the gospels where we read, they go to it, but now they are coming from it, and they are coming into the upper room. That, I would think, is where the testimony lies and we come out of heaven, so to speak, from the realm of the Spirit, in order to bear testimony. Hence, if we apply it in this practical way, when we have prayer on the Lord's day evening, it is a question of what we are coming into now. We have the Lord's supper, and entrance into all there is with His Father, but as coming from Olivet, we are coming out from all that, and coming down to the level of the testimony. So they come to the upper room from Olivet but it is still the upper room, implying elevation in testimony.
If it is a question of the testimony, we must think of gift. When it is the question of the Lord's supper and the service of God, that is *God*ward and you are not
{288}
thinking of gift so much as the affections; but when you think of the testimony, preaching or teaching, for instance, you must think of the gifts, because you cannot teach or preach without gift. Teaching is a gift, and preaching is a gift, and hence the importance of gift in all these matters. So that when they come down from Olivet, it was a question of gift and of the power there was for the testimony. That is the way I would look at it.
Ques. Is that why these persons are named? It says, "both Peter, and John". There is room for them both, and then these others, all named persons.
J.T. We have to go back to Matthew and Mark and Luke to get these persons in other settings, but here, I am sure, it is a question of the position of Olivet; that is, the power of the Spirit in public testimony. Hence the importance of these persons. Even the Lord's mother is there in her dignity, and certain other women; we are not told who these women were, but they are there. It shows how sisters have a place in the public testimony.
Ques. Does it correspond morally with the idea of the holy city, new Jerusalem, "coming down out of the heaven from God", and coming into the sphere of testimony and display in the millennium?
J.T. Yes. "Coming down ... from God".
W.C. Would those mentioned in verse 14 suggest the saints generally supporting the testimony? It is not gifted persons, but mostly women, and, it says, with His brethren. There is substance in the saints generally which is available in the way of support.
J.T. That would make way, I would think, for the children even. I was sitting beside a little child this morning and I was very struck with how he took things in, all that passed at the Lord's supper. How important is this matter of *support* with the children in the households, in their prayers on the Lord's day evenings for the gifted persons who go out to preach. These young
{289}
people know that such-and-such has been invited to preach, and he is a gifted man. They get the idea of the gifted men, and what does that mean? They ought to ask, and they will, but the question is, what answer do they get? So here the women would be the persons who would carry the whole position in prayer. "These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren". Mary was the one who knew most about Jesus in a certain sense, and how she would join in the support of the testimony of the gifted men. The gifted men must be supported by what we have enjoyed in the morning at the Lord's supper in the place of privilege, and then in the afternoon, what we are having just now, in instruction by the Scriptures, and then the prayer that follows and the children coming into it, and the wives coming into it. The whole position is thus carried, and heaven is in it. The upper room being in Jerusalem is connected with the public position. The position is there and known to be there, because they are staying there; it is not a visit. The apostles, these great men; for they were great potentially; and then these great women too, and the prayers, are all known to be in that position. That position is now fixed and known to be there.
J.C.W. If there was a more real continual prayer we might expect more results from the preaching.
J.T. The Lord has greatly aided us in connecting the prayer meeting, having it on the second day of the week; that is the Monday. We have all the savour of the Lord's day, at least we may assume that, if we are really exercised in continuing in the fellowship. From the fifth chapter on to the tenth chapter of 1 Corinthians, it is a question of continuance, involving discipline, but continuance in the fellowship. Then we have the question of headship; that is, the head covered, and then the coming together of the saints for prayer. So that the whole position really in the first and second epistles to
{290}
the Corinthians is a public matter. It is what God has. These women, I believe, that are mentioned here with the Lord's mother, all imply that there is a public position. It is a Jerusalem position, although a dignified position. The upper room is just a suggestion of dignity. It is lifted out of the ordinary level of the streets of Jerusalem, but the thing is public. I think it is just as well to have in our minds that there is such a thing as a public position. Even although we are very small according to what there was at the beginning, yet, in some sense, the thing is public. Then there is the thought of continual prayer. It is known that we are a praying people. Other things are known too, and it would be a poor thing if they were not known. The better known they are the better, and the better known they are the more power there will be.
Rem. In chapter 2 they evidently heard them speak the wondrous things of God, so the public thing is obviously there.
P.L. "Clothed with power from on high".
C.W. As coming *from* the mount of Olives the preacher would get the gospel message from that level?
J.T. That is right. Then we are to bring the children into the matter. How susceptible they are even to the most elevated thoughts! They may get away from them, but in time, through God's mercy, they come back, and we can count on God to bring them back to their earliest thoughts. So the kneeling down in the houses on the Lord's day evening for prayer, just before the preaching, I think, is highly pleasing to heaven. Children may not know that, but the Spirit of God is active all the time, heaven is by us to help us to bring up our children. We begin with the thought of our children being holy (@1 Corinthians 7: 14). The children of believing parents are regarded as holy, and therefore there is room for the Spirit to operate in the house.
{291}
J.O.S. Would you say that in the absence of her husband the wife would carry on the service of prayer in the household?
J.T. As serving thus she would need to have her head covered. She is to have on her head a symbol of authority (@1 Corinthians 11: 10); that is, the authority which she recognises, and which extends back through her husband to Christ, and from Christ to God. In the recognition of this there is power.
{292}
THE SUPREMACY OF GOD
@1 John 3: 20 - 24; @1 John 4: 1 - 4; @1 John 5: 20
It is in mind, dear brethren, to speak about supremacy, and it need not be added that supremacy must be in God, whether He be viewed by Himself, or viewed as in Christ, or viewed as in the Spirit, in us. Supremacy must be in God. Hence I have chosen John for my address tonight because he, alone of the evangelists, presents us with God at the outset of his great work. Matthew has his own point of view, Mark has his, and Luke also, but John begins with God, as indeed does Moses, so that the writings of Moses and the writings of John are closely related. Moses, by the Spirit, speaks of God almost immediately, and it is not God as He might have been apprehended as having to say to the chaotic condition that had come about, but God as in the beginning, before the chaos. He presents Him in a word that is plural; that is, Elohim; that is his first reference to God. Now that is not a commonplace matter, it is an important matter as, no doubt, most of us know. The intent of Moses is to bring God to the mind immediately, in the narrative; "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth". It was intended that God should be impressed on the mind immediately. He would undertake to offset the chaotic condition that had come in and to make a new world, and the Lord Jesus is pleased to call that the beginning. It is great enough to be a beginning. So the Lord speaks of certain things, such as marriage, and refers to *the beginning*. He says of men's doings, that "from the beginning it was not so". Many things are happening, dear brethren, that are not according to the beginning. Hence, as Christians, it is obvious that we all should be concerned about the beginning. God was in the beginning; and what was not at the beginning must be disregarded. God should thus have His place in our minds and in our hearts. Hence the place that God has, as I said, immediately,
{293}
for as Moses began to write, it was to call attention to God and that by the use of the plural name. He would impress us with the supremacy of what the plural name implies, so that our minds should be accustomed to the fact that God is supreme. Supremacy sometimes is now indeed handed down to kings, those that are in authority, but it belongs to God, *power belongs to God*. That is why, as I said, I have selected John's writings, because they bring in God.
The first passage I read begins with this, "that if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart". Well, you might say, That is not very much to say. Nevertheless, God is concerned that each of us should know, that He is greater than our hearts and knows all things. There is so much to baffle us, dear brethren, and to distress us, that it is a great matter to be assured that God is greater than our hearts and knows all things, It is John that comes in and tells us that "In the beginning was the Word", but he does not stop there, he would bring in the thought of God in the beginning, and so he adds, "and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". It is John's God, so to speak, that I have in my mind, and how He would ingratiate Himself with us, so that our hearts should not overwhelm us. There is so much that is happening to deter the brethren, hence the importance of having God in our hearts and knowing that He is supreme. He is supreme in Himself, but then the point for each of us is to be assured that He is supreme in each of *us*, in our hearts, and that He is greater than these. I have ventured to say all that in a prefatory way, so that the dear brethren might have the thought of God before them.
Now to proceed, in the epistle of John we get instruction as to our Lord Jesus Christ, and especially as to eternal life, the thought of which runs parallel with what I have been saying, and when we come to comparisons, what life is of any value at all except eternal life? The Lord Jesus is "the true God and eternal life".
{294}
These words are remarkable and are intended to assure our hearts as to eternal life, that there is a life worth speaking about, a life worth preaching about, and we are to lay hold of it, for it is within our reach. We should have it in the sense of enjoyment and support, and understand the greatness of God as bringing it in. As I said, it is John's God I am thinking of. You will understand the form of my speaking, when I say John's God; there is only one God, but, at the same time, John has a way of presenting God that is unique. His presentation of the truth of God runs down to the end of this dispensation; he is concerned about *this* dispensation. He is reserved by the Lord for specific purposes, the Lord having in mind that his ministry and what he represents is to be available at any time.
So I speak of John's God, because John traces the blessed and great and glorious subject of God as supreme, and he traces Him in Christ. He begins with the Lord Jesus, not exactly as in the Deity, though of course He is always God, He is never other than that personally, but He traces Him as the Word. John begins with that. "In the beginning was the Word". It is the *logos*, that is to say, One who can tell us about God, and He tells us that He is Himself God. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God ... All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made". The Lord Jesus is thus seen by John as a Man down here, under the title of *the Word*. He is One who can tell us all things; that is the scriptural thought. The woman of Samaria had it in her mind when she said, "when he is come, he will tell us all things". So it is that John would instruct us from the very roots of divine things, from the very basis of the knowledge of God. As reserved by the Lord, it is John's line of things, the work that He intended him to do in relation to the whole dispensation in which we are. I am speaking in a way to encourage young people to follow, and get instruction about God,
{295}
for the One who knows about Him is the Word; that is to say, Christ in incarnation is the Word. Therefore, if we want to know, we want to consult the Word, John tells us that the Son of God "has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life".
The question now is understanding, and I have ventured to select John because he is peculiarly intended to present the spiritual side of things to us. He touches on physical things, of course, and especially *the expanse* in which God operates. The expanse is the place of divine operations, and also Satan's alas, for Satan has got into it, and he is not failing to do what he can. The sphere is wide, involving good and evil, but, at the same time, God is carrying on in spite of the evil and overcoming the evil, for He is supreme in regard of the evil. John would say to us therefore that there is nothing to fear; even as the Lord said to John, "Fear not". Such a word is needed in view of what is in the expanse, which God Himself calls Heavens. It has a wide significance, and a wide bearing, and touches us at every point, but God is supreme in it. Satan is not supreme in it. John's line of thought, and his way of thinking and speaking, has in view that both old and young should be assured as to the fact that God is supreme.
The first thing is as regards our hearts. There is a considerable difference between the mind and the heart, and God addresses us first through the mind. It is a faculty that is given us for discernment, for distinguishing between things that differ. It is so that we should know Him, know Him objectively, if I may use a common word. It is a well used word, yet, at the same time, a word we can hardly do without, for we have to begin learning objectively. That is how I get on myself, if you will allow me to speak of myself. I always find relief in looking at things objectively. If things seem to discourage, and they are not wanting in discouragement,
{296}
for as you rise in the morning the enemy will not fail to bring forward something to discourage, but the way to meet him is with objective truth, and the greatest objective truth is God, that God *is*, not has been simply or will be, but *He is*. That is one of the greatest facts knowable, and a fact that every heart should be acquainted with, and acquainted with constantly, that *God is*. We have the thought in the Scriptures of God known historically, what He has been and then the prophetic thought of God, what He will be, but then there is God Himself, what He is in the present -- *Himself*. He surrounds Himself with Himself. I trust you will understand what I mean. He dwells in light unapproachable, but as made known, He is approachable. So that as you approach you gradually get nearer and nearer, and more at home, and more comfortable, more happy, and you are more assured that it is God. He would Himself come into the environment in which we are, so as to assure us and make us steadfast. Therefore, John says, "If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things". That is one of the most assuring things we can speak of, that not only is He greater than our hearts, but that He knows all things. Well, that would mean, that if the discouragement comes, God would introduce some further knowledge of Himself to encourage us. He surely has more pleasure in *en*couraging than *dis*couraging. *He* will not discourage; He will encourage. If there be discouragement, and it comes into our weak hearts, well, God would put Himself in there. He would put Himself in, so as to surround our hearts and give us encouragement and tell us, in the encouragement, that He is greater than our hearts, even if there be something to condemn in our hearts. It is not that God condemns us, but our heart condemns us, for it may do so, if there be something to condemn. If we are upright, and there is something wrong, the condemnation will come, but God would say, Well, let it be so, I know all about
{297}
that. He knows all negative things as well as positive things. Whatever they be, if indeed they are to be condemned, well, God says, I know all about that, and He condescends to measure Himself with the condemnation that may be in our hearts, and to assure us that He is greater than the condemnation, whatever it be. It is the God we have known, beloved, the God who is known in Jesus, the God about whom the Word has told us. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God", notice that the Word was *with* God. There is companionship there between the divine Beings, that is to say, there is liberty and love between Them, there is a community of thought, happy, holy community of thought, so that the word *with* can be used, and it says "the Word was with God", before it says that "the Word was God". We learn thus that there is companionship between Them, and then the great and glorious fact that the Word Himself is God. The Word, whom we know, the Jesus whom we know, whom we know in redemption, whom we know in the forgiveness of our sins, the Jesus who died for us, is the very Same. He is the Word who knows all about God, and He is with God, and then, great and glorious fact, He is God Himself. This is all, dear brethren, beyond our power to elucidate. We may as well say, I do not know; but I *do* know that the Word is precious to my heart. He has told me things; He has instructed me; He has given me an understanding, and I know Him that is true, and I know who He is. Then John says further, "He is the true God and eternal life", that is to say, He has brought about the great fact of eternal life, a life we are to enjoy for ever and for ever. Well then, there is every reason to be encouraged.
So this third chapter brings out the thought of God in His supremacy, and then the Spirit in the same chapter, as John says, "Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us". This shows that the Spirit is here in a subjective way, for He is on our side as an Instructor, and He is supreme as come down
{298}
here, as near us, as with us, and He is ready to assure us, and so John says, "Hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given to us". God has given us the Spirit; it is not simply that He is a divine Person here, but He is a gift: "the Spirit which he has given to us". This raises the question, dear brethren, as to the possession of the Spirit, and how it comes in and links on with what I am saying as to supremacy. The Spirit is supreme, and He is supreme in the position He has taken up, and, in that supremacy, He teaches us. We thus know things, and know we are in Him, that is, in Christ or in God. It is not in the ordinary sense of knowledge or science, but by the Spirit which He has given us.
Now to go on to chapter 4, we see how the Spirit is greater as in *us*, as it says in verse 4: "greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world". That is to say He is greater *as in us*, not as in heaven. John is not speaking of a divine Person as in the Deity, but the Holy Spirit *as in us*; the Spirit as in us here below; that is, in us as we are here tonight. If it be we go out into the street, or we are in our businesses, or in our households, the Spirit is in us, and He is greater in us than he that is in the world. Now these are great facts; whether it be he that is in the world in the political sense, or in the industrial sense, or in the social sense, or in the religious sense, the Spirit is greater in the saints. He is greater in you and in me than he that is in the world, so that we are not to be overcome. God is saying to us in this that we are not overcomable. We do not need to be overcome because of who is in us. However you look at it, "greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world", and He that is in us is the Holy Spirit.
Then, as I was saying from chapter 3, the Holy Spirit tells us that we are in Christ. Sometimes in John's writings we can hardly discern whether he is speaking of Christ or of God, for his use of pronouns is unique. In presenting the truth, John makes so much
{299}
of the divine Persons, without repeating their names formally, but using pronouns. To follow the thought in mind, if it be the Holy Spirit in the Christian, He is greater in the Christian that what is in the greatest man of the world, and there are great men, of course. Although there are few kings, few royal people, yet the greatness of man still remains, for man knows how to hold it. When men are set up as rulers, they know how to hold fast what they have in that sense; they know how to make the most of their supposed dignity; but alas, that only gives room to the devil, and the more they make of their greatness, the more they make of the enemy. But then the Christian is told that "greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world". Be they who they may, the Spirit in the Christian, not simply the Spirit Himself, or in heaven, but in the Christian, is greater than he that is in the world. Well, these are very important facts. How we may lift up our heads and exult in the thought of what we are made in the presence of the Holy Spirit which is given to us!
As I was saying, in chapter 3, John is speaking of God, God Himself in His infinite supremacy, and how the knowledge of that affects us. God is making so much of our hearts, the Christian heart, and that He is greater than it, even if there is something to be condemned. Then He is greater, as I have been saying, in chapter 4; and now, in chapter 5, He is greater because He is the true God. The word *true* is added there. Paul says, "There are gods many, and lords many, yet to us there is one God, the Father", @1 Corinthians 8: 5, 6. John says, "He is the true God and eternal life". In the Person who is the Word, we have One who instructs us as regards everything and assures us and gives us an understanding, and that is why I alluded to the mind of the Christian, because of the need of instruction. The Lord's supper is for the mind, as well as the heart. The first thought of it is in regard of the mind of the Christian. It is 'for the calling of me to mind', says the Lord
{300}
(see footnote to @1 Corinthians 11: 24). It is a question of the mind, a faculty that is controllable by the Christian, as the expression in @Romans 7: 25 shows, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". As a controllable faculty it can be employed to shut out other things. The mind has great power to shut out other things, and the Christian has that power, so that he might make full room for Christ. That is the idea in the Lord's supper; full room for Christ, for He is to be everything, and in all. The mind is the great faculty to keep before us as regards learning and as regards understanding, and as regards enjoyment, because of its power of discrimination and for the rejection of evil. God has placed within us this power which is greater than the evil; so that the evil is not as great as the Christian. However severe it may be, or however much to be condemned, yet the Christian is greater, and that is because the Spirit is in the Christian. "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world".
Well, that is what I had in mind to enlarge on, and I hope it is clear to every one of our minds. It is only as in the Christian, or in the assembly, that you can conceive of the Spirit having a footing down here. He is not in the air, nor is He in the unbeliever; He is in the assembly. "And hereby we know", says John, "by the Spirit which he has given to us". The *us* there means the assembly, for the assembly is the sphere of the operations of the Spirit, and these operations imply that the mind is available. Hence in the great opening up of the truth as to the mind of the believer in the seventh chapter of Romans, Paul, individualising himself, says, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". The mind is a faculty that we can use, and Paul does use it, and then opens up the great truth of the Holy Spirit in chapter 8. The great truth of the Holy Spirit in the Christian is opened up there because the mind has its place in chapter 7, and that has in view that the Spirit might have full scope in the believer. The Spirit is mentioned a great many times, as most of you know, in @Romans 8,
{301}
and it is because the way is made, or cleared, for Him by the mind, now under control, being allowed to be active. The mind has been given to the believer as a faculty to be used; it is under his control, and what is put under my control by God, I put under the control of the Spirit. The Spirit is a great and blessed Agent down here on our behalf; to act for us and to serve us, and to aid us as we need help. He is not doing everything. He would say to us, You do that, and I will support you in doing it. The Spirit becomes known to us in the way He acts with us in supporting us in times of difficulty, and then the way is clear for the Spirit to open up the things of God to us.
We have much in @Romans 8 about the Spirit, leading on to "a Spirit of adoption". It says, "Ye have received a spirit of adoption", and that is not a spirit of fear. It is a spirit; it is the principle of the thing received. We have a spirit of adoption and what do we do with it? Well, we cry, "Abba, Father". We use it. The Spirit would aid us in using it, and in speaking to the Father. We have "a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father". God is pleased with that. What it involves in speaking to the Father came out in the Lord Jesus Himself in Gethsemane, and now it is our part to speak thus, the Holy Spirit aiding us, so that we are great enough for it. The Lord is pleased to give us the liberty and power to speak rightly to His Father; we have "a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father". It leads us into worship, and enables us to speak suitably to the Father, having in our minds all that that name implies. The Father is in our minds, intently in our minds as we speak to Him. Why should we not? "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God", @1 John 3: 1. The Father has opened up that to us, and I would urge it on young people, to learn to use that word. You have a *spirit of adoption*. The word *adoption* is really the word *sonship*; we have a spirit of sonship, by which, the mind laying
{302}
hold of it, and the heart expanding to it, we understand the thought of the Father. We little realise, I am sure (I know that in my own soul), how heaven is enjoying what the Father gets from the saints, but that is what He has just now. "The Lord's portion is his people", @Deuteronomy 32: 9. That is true of ourselves, our very selves. I am speaking simply; we are the ones, there are a goodly number of us, we are well entitled to speak in the plural here today. There is here a great number of saints together and that is a great thing for heaven, and God is getting something for Himself.
The woman in @John 4, so often spoken of, was of little account at one time, but presently she becomes of very much account. She left her waterpot which she brought out to the well, and went her way into the city, not indeed to speak to God or the Father, but to speak to men. The Lord had spoken of the Father to her. She went to the men; she became evangelical, and I doubt, as to ourselves, if anyone will become evangelical who does not speak to the Father first. The heart of God, beloved, is the source of everything; and so true evangelising is from the Father. This woman evangelised; she went her way into the city and went to the men and told them, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?". She was evangelising, but I fully believe, that in some sense, she already had responded to what the Lord told her of the Father. The Lord says, "The Father seeks ... worshippers". It is the intent of God, that we should, as knowing Him, be evangelical; the heart of God flows out, beloved, through Christ by the Spirit, to men. What a moment it is for us to be evangelical! but it is a question first of the service of God, of speaking to God. God would have the households of the brethren in liberty, every one of them. We have houses to eat and drink in, but then houses in which to bring up children and in which to teach them the truth. The truth of God is brought to us in the gospel, and it is our privilege at this present time to
{303}
pursue the gospel, even in however small a way it may be, however few the listeners. Pursue the gospel! Keep it going! and it will grow in importance and become more attractive. I believe the woman of Samaria, dear brethren, is to set out the working of the system in which Christ is operating, because He is the great Operator on the part of God. "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand", we are told in the third chapter of John. This woman comes to Him, and she leaves her waterpot, and having learned from Christ, she goes to the men; she becomes evangelical and tells them, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done; is not he the Christ?". What a question it was! So they made room for Christ at that time in Samaria.
Well, that is all I have to say, beloved, and as I have said, it is the matter of supremacy, the supremacy of God. There is what God is in our hearts, then what He is in the Spirit as teaching us, and then what He is in the Son. "The Father loves the Son", and "He is the true God and eternal life". So that the thought of the true God is brought down to us as in Christ. First it is in God Himself, as I have been saying, the first mention of Him in Scripture by the plural name denotes His supremacy. Then He is supreme in the Spirit as teaching us, and then as the Son as the Instructor and the Giver of eternal life. "He is the true God"; not simply God, but the *true* God; our position is in relation to the true God. There is no other; whatever people may say and assume, there is no other than the One we have. "He is the true God and eternal life", and it is for each of us to be assured of it, that He is the true God, and that we also are true. We are true in relation to Him and true to one another. John would bring out all these things; the reality of the truth; the reality of Christianity; the reality of what we profess and what we have in the Spirit. He brings out what the service of God really is, and all else that goes with it. May God bless the word to us!
{304}
LIGHT
@2 Corinthians 4: 5 - 7; @Ephesians 3: 7 - 10; @Matthew 6: 22
I have in mind to speak about light, the first great element that God spoke of and brought forth in creation as we know it. According to what I read, the apostle Paul says, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". The idea of light is thus plainly before us in the scriptures read, and it is urgently hoped that each here may be concerned about it, and about what is said in Matthew in the verse read, "if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body will be light", or, as we might say, luminous. This brings out the importance of the believer's body, and leads to the truth of the assembly, in which all believers have part, and, in order to have part in it, we must be luminous. Each one is to be luminous, each is to be light. Light is of very great importance, as its place in the order of the present creation shows. God commanded that light should shine out of darkness, and it did shine; that was on the first day, and besides that we have the further statement that the light was called Day. Later we have two lights set in the firmament of the heavens, or the expanse, and they were to govern, they were to rule; but this is not said on the first day. What is said of it on the first day is that "God called the light Day". God thus divided the light from the darkness; but on the fourth day we have the two luminaries set in the expanse, the greater and the lesser luminary, and they are said to *rule*.
Now I am saying this especially at the outset, because of what I have in mind to bring out. "God is light", but we are not luminous if our bodies are not light, and if we do not value the light that is available to us, then we shall not belong to *the ruling class*. The ruling class of
{305}
the present world come into being now on the principle of election, which is based on the assumption that power belongs to the people. That is simply an assumption; not that I am here to say a word about any government, but I would point out that the governing class according to God are those who have light. That is plainly brought out in the book of Revelation, chapter 21, where we read of the assembly being a city, which is a political thought involving rule, and are also told that she has light. "Her light was like unto a stone most precious"; that is light *par excellence*. There is nothing to be compared, in that sense, save God Himself, with the idea that is in the heavenly city, and we belong to that. The heavenly city is just ourselves; not that we form in any sense the totality of it, far otherwise, because it is an immense thing. The immensity of it is conveyed in the measurement, a cube, twelve thousand furlongs in length, breadth and height. It is next to inscrutability and yet it is not inscrutable for it is human, it is composed of human beings, supremely formed, and formed into a city. We are told of its measurement, and that it lies foursquare, meaning that it is universal in its bearing. In the light of it, the question arises at once, Who are to rule? The ruling class are there. This question is of supreme importance; not indeed that we enter into politics at all, because we do not, except in the sense that our citizenship is in heaven. We do not deny that, we glory in it, and we await the time of its display; but in view of that time we are to be luminous in a moral sense here on earth. We have the thought of rule in the two lights that God set in the expanse on the fourth day. They involve, as in the expanse, what is nearest to the earth, and they are to give light on the earth. As set in the expanse, they are in touch with the earth. There is a certain inscrutability in them, but yet they are not beyond the reach of understanding; the expanse is not beyond the reach of understanding. It is called an expanse, because it is great and wide; but
{306}
it bears on the earth. It is not far from it; in fact, it touches on the earth.
Referring again to what I have already said, there is great importance in the matter of light, and that it should affect our bodies, not simply our heads; "thy whole body will be light". Now that bears on what has often been remarked, that the saints as the temple of God are viewed as growing. @Ephesians 2 shows that it is not yet final, for we are, as it were, in the making. The epistle to the Colossians points out that very thing, for there it is a question, not of what *has* been done, but of what is being done. It is a question of the working of God, and of faith in it too, for what is currently done by God is on the principle of faith. If we are to come into the light that I have spoken of, and rule, then the thing is to be active in getting all that we can. Many have made long and expensive journeys to come to these meetings. They have braved the difficulties and they have come; carried safely, thank God, for we have heard of no losses in that sense, and we thank God for it. The enemy would cause losses, for he hates the brethren; those who are the brethren of Christ. "One is your Master", says the Lord Himself indeed, "and all *ye* are brethren", @Matthew 23: 8. The devil hates Christ and he hates His brethren, and would damage them; but then, as I said, the work is proceeding. We are all here tonight, I suppose, certainly the one who is speaking, having in mind to give a little light or to freshen the minds of the brethren as to this matter of illumination, or radiancy, as seen in the heavenly lights. They are set in the expanse which God called Heavens. The expanse was something added by God in order to effect His thoughts at the present time, so that presently it will be said, "What has God wrought!". God would say to us, as it were, 'Well, you have been in what I have wrought'. Paul makes much of it; that he was in it there is no doubt; he says that he laboured more abundantly than all. He was in it in the greatest way as an individual.
{307}
Now I come back again to what I have already said, that unless we take account of all this and go in for it, we shall not become the ruling class. It is not that we wish to be that now, but presently. Paul says that the building, which in the coming day will be a holy temple in the Lord, is growing, and when it is completed it will be seen above. The holy city Jerusalem will come down from God, from above; it is the assembly. Let us not forget that, and that it refers to ourselves. The Lord would impress upon us what we are, and that it is the time of growing and acquiring things, in view of being what we should be. It is the time of putting on everything needed, and putting off everything that should be put off, everything that would dim the light in us. Paul speaks of the saints as the temple of God, and stresses that it is holy. The word is, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God?" @1 Corinthians 3: 16. It was said to the Corinthians, "ye are the temple of God, and ... the Spirit of God dwells in you". But then Ephesians, which is, you might say, the supreme epistle for the truth of Christianity, for it deals with the truth as the truth, tells us that the assembly increases to a holy temple in the Lord. It is not that yet exactly; in that sense it is not completed. Paul uses the word *complete*, and in writing to the Colossians says it was given to him "to complete the word of God". He has in mind here in Ephesians that we should understand that the assembly is not yet completed; it is being continually added to. The adding began at the first day of the Holy Spirit coming down. What a day it was! And what a day it is, because it remains in its effect. It says, "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved". There were three thousand of them on the first day, as if God would say to us, That is what I can do. But then how much more can He do? It remains for the future day to disclose all, when things are revealed or manifested; we shall then see the wonderful thing that is going on. The wonderful thing that began on that day, which we
{308}
call the day of Pentecost, and which is going on now, eighteen hundred years or more after. Then the word is "What hath God wrought!". That cannot be just said now, although what He has wrought can be spoken of. It is not complete, because He is still working, and that working is by the energy of God.
All is a question of faith now, not so much what we shall be eternally in heaven, but what we are now. The mighty power of God is operating now, and it is to complete something, and oh! what a glorious thing is to be completed! The Spirit of God reserves it for the Apocalypse; that book, which the Lord received from God, has a peculiar place in the Scriptures. His receiving it from God, gives force to the Lord's word in @Mark 13: 32, "Of that day or of that hour no one knows, neither the angels who are in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father". We must not go beyond that, and just say the Son does not know everything. We must not say that. What He says is, "Of that day or of that hour no one knows neither ... the Son, but the Father". What is known thus is undoubtedly in mind in the beginning of the book of Revelation; the book is full of interest and to it is added a premium for the reading of it and the meditating on it. "Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things written in it", @Revelation 1: 3. We need to belong to those classes of people that are so distinguished in Scripture, and especially to those who read and understand. Then in relation to that, and consequent upon it, we have the idea of the saints, as builded together, growing to a holy temple. It is not an indefinite matter; it is a creature thought, of course, for the temple is a creature, resulting from the growth of the saints together to a holy temple in the Lord. The Lord, of course, has part in it, for He is the Head of creation, as it says, "firstborn of all creation", but He is not a creature.
Let us keep clearly in mind that He is a divine Person, and if the temple of God is holy, and that the saints are
{309}
growing unto it, as Ephesians teaches us, to a holy temple in the Lord, it is to come out as available in the Lord's hand to instruct the millennial world, for the millennial world is to be instructed. In that day, the knowledge of the Lord will fill the earth as the waters cover the sea. Satan will be bound then; he is not now; he is not even cast out of heaven yet, but in the millennial day he will be. Michael and his angels will cast the devil out. But besides all this, as I said, there will be a temple which the Lord has under His hand and through which He will instruct the millennial world. It will not be our time of instruction then, He is instructing us now, for *now* is the teaching time for *us*. I do not believe at all that we shall continue to grow and to be instructed eternally. In heaven we are complete, we are perfect. God is to have a heaven filled with persons who are complete. Paul laboured in his service "to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ". It is due to God that we should think thus; for He is God and He would finish things. We have had before us here these last three days how it comes about. There is the mighty *working* of God through faith, but that will not be said eternally. It is *now* that that is said, for now is the time for faith's operations. It is well to think of what faith can do, but then, after all, it is what God does, and God is working through faith, and it is to bring about this growth to the holy temple. So that, in due time, the Lord will have under His hand that by which He can unfold everything according to God to the millennial saints, and, we might say, to the universe. It will be a wonderful time, things will be brought out and be made intelligible to all below. There will be the heavens and the earth; not yet the new heavens and the new earth, for God is reserving this earth in view of the period of a thousand years, in which He will show what He can do with man, just as he is. He will instruct him on the principle of light, coming through the assembly. The assembly is growing to a
{310}
holy temple in the Lord, and, through that vehicle or means of instruction, the Lord will instruct the millennial world so that "the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea", @Habakkuk 2: 14.
Now I did not intend to be prophetic simply, but only to try and bring out this great matter of light. We ought to be alive to it and understand that there is to be a governing class, and that that governing class is the assembly. Let men say what they may, or do what they may, or aspire to what they may, all is in the hands of God. It is only a moment and God can change everything, and bring in His thoughts and make them perfect, and that is what we are to be aiming at, dear brethren. These meetings are for that very purpose, and we have come here, and it has cost us money to come, and it has involved travel, and care, and so forth. The thing is to *get* something, because the greatest things are obtainable, because the Holy Spirit is here in everyone who is a Christian. It is for us to take advantage of the moment and get things, and what we need to get, particularly, is light. "If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be light". What a great fact!
The passages in 2 Corinthians and in Ephesians bring out how Paul was the example of all this. Like Moses, who had the pattern of things, Paul has, you might say, the pattern of things from the heavens, and things are made according to pattern. They are made with exactness, and hence, if we are to deal with them, or if we work at them, we must be exact. We must be like those who built the tabernacle; they were full of wisdom, God filled them with it, and God is filling us with wisdom. "The spirit of wisdom and revelation", as expressed in Ephesians, is a great thought. Why not be marked by "the spirit of wisdom and revelation"? because these things are obtainable and the Holy Spirit Himself is here to invest us with them. So Paul himself
{311}
is unique, for the Lord has taken him up as His own particular vessel, "an elect vessel to me", He says, @Acts 9: 15. Then the many things that he tells us about only confirms us in that, how he did things, and now they are done, and the Spirit is here to effect them in us.
So in the first passage read in 2 Corinthians, the first of Genesis is quoted by the apostle Paul. I read it on that account for it serves at this time to show what I am speaking of. It shows that a person like ourselves, a man of like passions as ourselves, was taken up by the Lord to effect what is said, the things that we have spoken of So he says of himself in @2 Corinthians 4: 5, "We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus¬ sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". And then he adds a remark, which shows how human he was, not human in the ordinary sense of the word, but what he calls an earthen vessel; that could never be said of Christ, but it is said of Paul: "We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us". We thus see where we are, however feeble in our speech, or in our affections, or in our minds, whatever we are doing, we want the excellency of the power to be of God and not of us. Whatever we are doing, we are doing it as earthen vessels, we are nothing more, we must not assume to be anything more than that. I mean to say, we are not divine. I am speaking of Paul, even as of ourselves, in this sense, for he was just an earthen vessel as we are. Although converted and recipients of the Holy Spirit and indeed the Holy Spirit indwelling us, we are yet earthen vessels. God is pleased to use us in spite of the fact that we are but earthen vessels. It is a humiliating thing, in a certain way, but then it is God's way, and we must not assume to be anything more than that. We
{312}
are just creatures; even if we belong to the new man or the new creation, it is a creation, and, as believers, we are all of it.
So Paul is the pattern, and I speak of him in this light because it is very important to have a pattern. Moses had a pattern and Israel had it, and it is God's way of bringing out things. Really, in a way, we must say that Paul is not exactly the pattern, for Christ is the pattern; it is Himself. So Paul speaks about Christ here, "the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". What a thought! He says, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost". What a terrible thing to be lost! I hope there is not one in this audience that is lost. I do not believe there is. We belong to the saved, we belong to the redeemed. So Paul says, "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost". What an awful thing that there is such a class as the lost! There is no hope of them, no hope of them eternally. It is well to keep that in mind, and to be sober about it. There is much that could be said about it, but I just touch on it, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost". It is because Satan, "the god of this world", has blinded their eyes. We have already been speaking of him and his machinations against God and against Christ, and we have been speaking of the expanse as the area of it and how Satan gets in. We have thus to be on the watch as to him. "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost". If there are such, it is because the god of this world has blinded their eyes so that the light should not shine for them. It shines, but it does not shine *for them*. The sun shines, and we may say it shines on everybody, and, in a way, it does, for the Christ comes in and shines on everybody. But then there is what Satan is doing, terrible thought, for he blinds the eyes of the unbelieving, "that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ ... should not shine forth for them". There is no hope of them.
Hence the importance of the thought of being
{313}
luminous, dear brethren, and superior too, as sensibly of the ruling class. We are coming into that; we are not assuming to be it now, although there is moral rule that goes on in the assembly, and the Lord is supporting it too. But the ruling class will be seen presently when the temple of God is in heaven and when it comes out to illuminate the world and to instruct men on earth. The devil then will be bound; but now he is blinding the minds of those that do not believe. It is a most terrible thought. So Paul goes on to say, "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord", showing what a man he was. He was not thinking of himself or his great power as a preacher. He was a humble man, even allowing himself to be belittled by his traducers as we learn in 2 Corinthians. Then he adds here, "And ourselves your servants for Jesus¬ sake". Paul's ministry would leave that impression, and anyone that serves Christ would have that same spirit. The one who in his own little way speaks here tonight, and serves, he is your servant for Jesus¬ sake, not for his own sake. Whatever service is rendered to the brethren here tonight, and I hope there is some, it is for Jesus¬ sake.
Then the next thing is, as I remarked, "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us". No servant is thinking of himself; if he is, he is not fit to serve. It is a question of God, as Paul said, "that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us". Paul tells us that there was a messenger sent from Satan to buffet him, and he besought the Lord three times that it might be removed. It must have been a most excruciating experience to have such a thing; a thorn for the flesh, a messenger from Satan in order that Paul might not be exalted above measure, that is what *he* says. But then
{314}
he says more; he says, "Most gladly therefore", referring to what the Lord was doing in not answering his request, not removing the thorn for the flesh. It was not removed, it was left, and, as far as I know, it remained there till he died. But the apostle was glorying in it. "Most gladly therefore will I rather glory", he says, "in my infirmities, that the power of Christ", which is the same as the power of God, of course, the energy of God by which we are affected, raised from the dead, that that power "may rest upon me". That is a great thought and shows how like Christ the beloved apostle was, although an earthen vessel, as he says, yet he was very like his Master. That is what one would aim to be, and every one of us, I am sure, who is in the service today. There are a good many here, and I rejoice in them myself, a good many young brothers who have ability to serve and they are serving well and serving for Jesus¬ sake. I trust it will go on and that there will be no rivalry, for the greatest danger there is, is rivalry. The devil fell because of it; he fell because of his beauty. We are thus to be on the watch, so that there should be no rivalry in the service. It is a question of "for Jesus¬ sake", and the service should go on, and go on, so that the temple should be completed, that the assembly should grow and be finished, because it is a finishing time. Thus the work goes on and we have had all these meetings and we have been greatly encouraged too. We are thankful to God for the number that is here tonight. There is no question of glorying in ourselves, but glorying in what God has; that God has so many children as it says, "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God", @1 John 3: 1.
Well now, I read that passage in the epistle to the Ephesians just to bring out simply that the assembly, as a whole, is the great illuminating vessel. That is what it is going to be, but it is already, as the passage I have read says, "of which I am become minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me, according
{315}
to the working of his power. To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ, and to enlighten all with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God, who has created all things, in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God, according to the purpose of the ages, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord".
That is what I want us to have before our minds distinctly, to see that the assembly has this place. It has it today and will have it millennially and eternally. I mean to say, its distinctive place will remain and Paul is the minister of it. He is stressing that here, and I brought it in, so that we might all see that it is available to us. Paul being like ourselves, presents the light of the mystery, even his knowledge of it, so that the youngest of us may aspire to the understanding of it. Matthew says, "If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be light". It is a question of the whole body of the believer; it is not simply your mind or your head, but the whole body. We have already spoken of the thought of the whole body, that it is a substantial thought, so that, not merely the mind, but the actual physical body of the believer is to be full of light; indeed, it is to be light, to be luminous.
In closing, it is in mind just to show briefly that the fourth day in creation, as we have it, brings out the two luminaries that I spoke of, and that one is a governing body. Really, it is typically Christ in heaven. It is Christ, of course, in the sense in which we can speak of Him in relation to the testimony of God, for it is a question of the testimony of God. Although Christ is in heaven, He is there in relation to the testimony of God and He is active there. If He wishes to come down to earth, why not? He is a divine Person, and He can do
{316}
that; He has done it. Then we have the lesser light, as it is called, which is said to be ruling the night. Notice it is *ruling*, for I take that to mean that through all that is current among the nations, whatever they be, whatever is going on, whatever is being done, whether great things or little things, the Lord is governing everything and the assembly is governing everything. The Lord is governing the day; the Lord in heaven, in the sense in which I have spoken of, as the greater light is ruling the day. It says, "to rule during the day". I say *rule*, for it is not simply that Christ shines, but He *rules*. Let men do and say what they please, that fact remains, that heaven rules. Then, even in the night, however bad things are, and we know what they are, in the great cities of the world, what terrible things are current, at the same time, the lesser light is ruling. It says again that the light is to rule *during* the night. The whole night is in mind, for God has not given up the idea of ruling. It is in the assembly, for the lesser light is the assembly, and it comes in on the fourth day, as if God would amplify what He had in His mind on the first day. That is to say, He brings in the thought of the *two* lights, the greater and the lesser. The first one being Christ in heaven, ruling in whatever way He may act in relation to the testimony, the second one being the assembly, whatever it may be, but on earth here. It is ruling on earth, or, at least, the word is "to give light on the earth". The expanse is near the earth, but it towers beyond it, as we have had it here today already, in @Psalm 36. It refers there to the great mountains; there are the Himalayas, five miles high, and other such mountains. Well, they are still all in the expanse. But then there is One that is higher than they. Whatever men may do, and whatever combinations they may form, God is higher than they, and He is ruling every day, and He is ruling every night. He is ruling in Christ by day, and He is ruling in the assembly by night. Then the question is, Do I realise that I belong to that company? How
{317}
needful it is that I should be luminous to belong to it! If I come into contact with these men who are ruling in the world, I am to illuminate them, as having myself put on Christ. That is all that I need to say now in putting this matter of light before the brethren. First, that if our eye is single, our whole body is light, and then that, collectively, the whole assembly is luminous, as we see it in the book of Revelation. It says, "her light was ... most precious". May God help us into these things at this time!
{318}
KEPT ALIVE
@Joshua 14: 6 - 15; @Romans 5: 17
It is in mind to speak of being kept alive. Death is current all about us in a physical sense, and particularly in a moral sense, and so I have selected Caleb to illustrate this thought of being kept alive. He is a great personality in the book of Joshua, and indeed in the whole of Scripture, and especially in this matter of being kept alive. He says, "And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses", @Joshua 14: 10. He specially stresses the period that intervened from the time that Moses spoke to him until that day, the day in which he spoke to Joshua. Much had intervened in their history, but he stresses these forty-five years of promise, and the fact that Jehovah had kept him alive during the period.
No doubt most of us remember the other facts relative to Caleb and his daughter Achsah and how Othniel and she contribute to the thought of Christ and the assembly, is a subject which has become pronounced especially in recent times. According to @Joshua 15, Achsah, Caleb's daughter, asked him for the upper and the nether springs. These springs must be linked up with what is called "the expanse" in @Genesis 1, for there the upper waters were separated from the lower waters. The Spirit of God would use these facts so as to link up with them what Achsah said to her father. She, in type, represents the assembly, and therefore she has a right thought in alluding to springs above and springs below. In alluding to her in this way I thus have in mind to enlarge on the thought of Caleb. He was a household man, such as the Lord speaks of: "every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder", @Matthew 13: 52. Caleb was a householder, and this fact enhances his history,
{319}
and then he was kept alive in view of coming into God's promises. *We* are now, beloved, the children of promise, as Paul says in @Galatians 4: 28. It is a matter of importance that we should think of the promises, and, above all now, of the Lord's promises to Philadelphia. He said, "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth", @Revelation 3: 10. There is a terrible period coming to try those who are earth-dwellers. It is a matter of supreme importance, that we should *not* be earth-dwellers, but that in so far as we can, we may have part in heaven-dwelling, and what we have here today is the nearest approach to that; for we are dwelling together in nearness to heaven. The "expanse" clearly indicates the great sphere of divine operations. God is operating, and all is through Christ, the great Operator, and in the power of the Holy Spirit.
Now, it is important that we should be alive, kept alive by God in accord with His promises, whatever they may be. So Caleb has come into one's mind as peculiarly fitting. Scripture is full of fitting things, if we have to deal with the things of God, and full of fitting persons too. Every person in the divine realm is fitted for it. Heaven will be full of persons who are fitted for it; they will be there, each filling his place; they are not too small nor too large to fill it. Here upon earth some are too small and some are too large to fill their place of responsibility, but, in the divine mind, everything fits, and now is the fitting time. I would say to the young people, Look out for the fitting time. See to it that you are in it, and that you are suitable to any particular time or age in which you may be. John would say to you, 'If you are a little child spiritually, then *be* a little child'. If you fill that position you will find that there is a word for you as in it. John writes to the little children with a special message for them. Then, he has something to say to the young men. John wrote to the young men, saying, "Because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you". The word
{320}
of God abiding in one is not exactly the Scriptures. It is not just used in that way; but it is a question of the mind of God, and its particular application to believers. Then again, John says, "I write unto you, fathers". In that particular section there is nothing said about sisters or women, but John does not leave them out. He writes to one of them, whom he calls "the elect lady", showing how he knew the sisters whom he addressed and to whom he ministered. How dignified they were in his mind! "The elect lady and her children".
You may wonder why I bring all that in, in relation to what I have intimated, but it is to point out the things that marked Caleb. Firstly, he was a leader amongst his brethren. There is a great dearth of leaders in the true sense, but Caleb was a leader amongst his brethren. When a crisis arrived, he appeared with his brethren and addressed Joshua, and the first thing he mentions is that he was sent to spy out the land; he was under orders. Now I want to say to the young men and the young women here, that I know of nothing more important than that they should be under orders, not their own orders, nor their own resolutions simply, but under orders from above, even if it be only as high up as your elder brother or your elder sister. There is some authority there that is greater than yours. So Caleb was under orders to spy out the land, and he says, "I brought him word again as it was in my heart". It was not in his *mind*, but in his *heart*, showing that he was a loyal person; he was a reliable brother. The spying out of the land of Canaan was a very important matter and Caleb was to be trusted. Not only was the land to be conquered, but the inhabitants were to be destroyed. In the ministry of Joshua we have the idea of the destruction of the inhabitants of the land. Under David it is the *subjugation* of the people, but under Joshua it is the *destruction* of the people, because the Canaanites were to be destroyed. This matter of spying out the land was therefore very important, from a military point of view,
{321}
and stresses the need that the report should be accurate. Caleb was a reliable man and says he brought word as it was in his heart; he told the truth. Let us be watchful about telling the truth in every matter; not simply the truth in the sense of the scriptural truth but the truth in itself. When matters have to be told, let the truth be told; let the whole matter be told. Let nothing be held back. Caleb was a man who told things as they were; he brought the word as it was in his heart. His heart was his trustworthy spot and he could be relied upon. If you had met him on the way, he would tell you the truth; the truth was in his heart, the whole truth, and nothing but it. Nothing is more important, dear brethren, than this matter of truth, and Caleb is an example of it. He not only searched out the land with the other eleven heads of the tribes, but he put the matter in his heart; he made it safe there. He would only tell it out where it would be right to do so. He would not scatter it abroad carelessly. It was important that the truth should be kept in a safe place, and his heart was the safest place he knew.
Now in connection with that, he refers to the promise made to him, that Moses swore to him that he would have the land on which he had trodden in the spying enterprise. He was under orders from Moses as a true military man under orders from his general, but he was also under orders from Jehovah; he says, "I wholly followed Jehovah". He was reliable in that sense, that his discipleship, his following, was entire. It was a full and complete matter. He wholly followed the Lord. Then, as I said, he had the promise and an oath, and the oath was by Moses; it was not by Joshua, for it was earlier than Joshua's leadership. He is referring to past history, and all of us who are in the Lord's service in any way, we have past history. We are not of much account if we have not, but let that history be marked by heart matters, holding things in the heart, and holding them securely. Then if they have to be told, tell all the
{322}
truth, the whole truth. Caleb did that; he kept the report in his heart, and it was told accordingly.
Well now, I just refer to those details so as to enhance the thought of being kept alive. Caleb was thinking of literal death, as it had occurred in the wilderness for forty years. Perhaps literal death has been more prevalent during recent wars than at any time in our histories, but then there is *moral* death. The military leaders, political leaders, social leaders, and the industrial leaders, may be morally dead, and to have to do with them means, if we are Nazarites unto God, that we may be defiled by them. Now this is a widespread suggestion, because, as you think of the population of the world, the dead are certainly more numerous than the living. I mean the morally dead people, and they cause defilement. Hence the necessity of keeping apart. We are so apt to be thrown into touch with them and, in many senses, it is unavoidable. What is legal and right may be allowed and continued in, but if we go beyond that, then we are touching persons who are dead morally, and they defile us. The world is full of them, and that is why I am stressing the thought of life and of our being kept alive. Caleb would have held himself as alive from the dead. There were six hundred thousand in Israel at that time, and they all died in the wilderness. Caleb and Joshua alone of those who came out of Egypt went into the land; the others all died. Terrible thought! The wilderness was strewn with their bones. In the great cities of the world today we see these defiling things; things that are pitiable to look at; people moving into wicked places of so-called amusement; they are on "the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death". "The dead are there". Solomon tells us these things. I am speaking to the young particularly; if you ignore what I am saying, you will be defiled and become entangled in the world. You will be disqualified for a place among God's people. The world is strewn with dead bones, with persons morally dead.
{323}
It may be that they excel among men in their natural pursuits, the football game, or whatever they may choose, but they are morally dead, and thus defiling. Hence the importance of Caleb's example when he says, "Jehovah has kept me alive". There is no thought that he was defiled by the dead, for he kept himself alive.
Now the scripture in Romans builds up the question of life in connection with the gospel, and in it there is the thought of *reigning in life*, both at the present time, and in the future. The millennium will be particularly and literally the time of reigning in life, yet there is such a thing as reigning in life at the present time, and those living thus are immune from moral death. There are various means of being kept alive. The meetings we have had today are meetings of life. They afford the means of life and of our being kept alive and being rendered immune from the death that is all round us, the dead bones that are strewn around us. All the gatherings of the saints, one might say, serve to this important end. We are thus kept alive by God. Then there is the idea of keeping ourselves alive too, as we have in Jude, "praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life", @Jude 20, 21. Keep *yourselves* in the love of God. But how? By "praying in the Holy Spirit". It is not simply, formal prayers, but prayers in the Holy Spirit, and that brings out, beloved, the fact that the Holy Spirit down here is the power of service, and the power of worship and of prayer. Whatever it is that is due to God, in the sense of service, it is to be in the power of the Spirit. It is not a mere formal matter, but in power. There is a remarkable word in 1 Corinthians, "no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", @1 Corinthians 12: 3. You might say, 'Well, anyone can use the words'. Yes; but the words, in themselves, have no power. It is a question who uses them, and the power in which they are used, so that they go up to God as a sweet savour. As
{324}
Stephen yielded up his breath, he said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit", @Acts 7: 59. What a word that was! How it went up to heaven in the sweet savour of Christ! How the Lord was delighted with that! It just indicates beloved, what I am saying, and the idea of being kept alive by God. Whatever number of years it may be, and some of us are quite old and weak according to our age, the question is whether we are being kept alive morally by God.
This is one of the greatest thoughts, I suppose, with those of us who would remain with the saints, and, of course, it is our privilege as it was Paul's to desire this. There can be no doubt that if we were really concerned about the needs of the brethren and that we should stay here instead of dying and departing to be with Christ, the Lord would hear our prayers, for a prayer of that kind is doubtless quite acceptable to the Lord. There is great need at the present time, and so there is an opportunity for many of us here to be on those lines. It is not done selfishly, it is not for our families, or our own interests, but for the sake of the saints. Paul did not have a family, but he had the saints; he called them his children, and he was a father to them; he says to the Corinthians that they had not many fathers, but he was one, and John was a father to the saints too. There is, perhaps, nothing the saints need more than fathers. A young man is not a father. A father is a person of age and experience, and he knows that the age and experience going with it qualify him to be of some service to the Lord's people. He thinks of the Lord's people, and prays to the Lord that he would like to stay with the brethren. I do not hesitate to say that; for I have an exercise about that very thing, to stay with the brethren, if it be the Lord's will. For that we must be kept alive, for if we are not alive morally we are of very little use to the brethren. We may have means, money and the like, to help young people, but there is very little in that. The real value of money is very small,
{325}
unless the moral side is behind it, and the moral side is in the person who has it being kept alive by God. It is a very great thing that God does such things as that. He kept Hezekiah alive, adding fifteen years to his life. He kept Moses alive until he was one hundred and twenty; and He kept Caleb alive till he was eighty-five. I do not know how many years more, no doubt it could be found out, but he was alive till he was eighty-five, and he was a good father, too, and would be a good neighbour, I am sure, and a good brother. The point, in any case, is to be kept alive by God, and God is occupied just now in keeping alive His beloved people. He has us here on earth, and He watches over us, and not only would He keep us well in body, but keep us alive in the true sense of the word, so that we are walking about this earth as a living people.
Now Romans is the great book to encourage and help us, as to this matter of being alive. It would help us to be like Caleb, so that we are able to talk like him, to recount our histories as he did, and amongst the incidents which he recounts is that he was kept alive for forty-five years. Of course, he was alive the previous forty years, but he is stressing the fact that he was alive during the promised period, during the oath period, and I am concerned about that too. God has made promises, and He has taken oaths in regard of us, committing Himself to us in His love. We can thus count upon Him, and especially to keep us alive, and as alive, to make us useful amongst the Lord's people, and in the gatherings of the Lord's people, and in the Lord's service. It is not simply that we are alive ordinarily, but kept alive by God. In Romans we have the principle of life. Paul says, "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be
{326}
saved by his life. And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement (*footnote: or reconciliation*) Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: (For until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ"), @Romans 5: 8 - 17 (A.V.). I read the whole passage so that we should all get the link as to life, and that instead of being downcast and despondent, we should be *reigning*. It is not that we are to be dogmatic, and the like, but reigning in a moral way, being dignified in our methods and ways before God and men, *reigning in life*. I do think that a great change will come over us, if we take to heart what I am saying as to the idea of reigning in life. As I said, the idea will be fully expressed in the millennium. It is not so much the eternal state of things, although the principle of rule, or reign, must go on eternally too. We are told that, in that day, the Son Himself will be subject that "God may be all in all". The great end in everything is God. It is not simply the Father, but God, "that God may be all in all". He is now, and He will be, in every one of us in that day. Paul says, "One God and Father of all, who is ... in us all", @Ephesians 4: 6. God reigning in all of us is the thought,
{327}
and we are to learn now how to reign, and to reign in life. As thus triumphant spiritually we are to give up and cast away despondency. It is not indeed that natural affection, by which we feel things, is not right, or that sorrow is not right. When death happens, for instance, sorrow *is* right, but in general, Christianity implies life and joy, and victory in a moral sense. Paul exhorts Timothy to "lay hold of eternal life", and the point that I am making now is that we should reign in life so as to be completely victorious in every circumstance. The circumstances at times now are very severe and they may be worse, but the millennium will come, and the millennium will be the time of reigning in life. I believe that in the assembly now, as understanding life, even as we have it today, we are learning the idea of reigning in life. We are not small in our thoughts, although we have suitable feelings of humility. We would not be like the hyssop that grows out of the wall, but like the cedars rather, "the cedars of Lebanon". That is to say, we are in the joy of sonship which constitutes us living and enables us by the Holy Spirit to reign in life.
I ventured to bring forward these points as to Caleb, that we might see how God teaches us by His people. The people of faith are mentioned in @Hebrews 11 and these are the reigning people. A little while ago I was venturing to speak of the ruling class, those who rule during the night and during the day, as suggested in the fourth day of @Genesis 1. The ruling class are the saints, beloved, and they are seen ruling; the greater light rules during the day and the lesser light during the night. But now I am speaking from another angle, that is to say reigning in life. The fourth day does not bring out the idea of life in the sense in which Caleb exhibits it or as in @Romans 5, where it is a question of spiritual life, by which we become the ruling class. It is not that we are attempting to be that, or aping it, but we are that really, for we are constituted that by God. God has His people
{328}
here below, and they are superior enough to be ruling and to be influencing people around them for good, and that on the principle of life. We are "alive to God in Christ Jesus", @Romans 6: 11. Romans develops the great thought of life, as I have been saying, and it comes to the point where we are said to "reign in life by the one, Jesus Christ". It is "by the one" Man, but our reigning together too. As believers in Christ we reign in life by Jesus Christ. May God bless the word.
{329}
FRUITFULNESS
@Romans 7: 4; @Psalm 1: 3; @Psalm 92: 12 - 15; @Romans 6: 22
It is in mind to speak about fruitfulness. The word belongs to the third day of creation, the earth, being brought again from the deep, was to cause grass, vegetables and trees to abound in it, and the thought becomes applicable to man, for God uses what He places in creation to illustrate what He places in man. The idea of fruitfulness abounds in Scripture, not necessarily in the creative sense, but in the sense of righteousness, which we are to follow. In the prophets, Jehovah says to Ephraim, who is in mind in the book of Hosea, "From me is thy fruit found", @Hosea 14: 8; that is to say, God is the source of fruit, whether in the ordinary creation or in man, he too being a creation. Man belongs to the sixth day, not the third, and so he is placed with cattle; indeed Jehovah says to Job that He made the cattle with him (@Job 40: 15). They were all made the same day, but the idea of man transcends all else in the creation outside of God Himself, even angels. "What is man, that thou art mindful of him?" meaning that he had the first place in the mind of God in the creation. We all know how longevity marked man in the beginning before the deluge, but how it was reduced. It is always intended to be a question with us as to whether we number our days, or whether in our youthfulness we are unduly hopeful. We are to number our days so as to acquire a wise heart, for God was pleased to reduce the number of man's days.
The allusion in @Psalm 92 is that he becomes old, and he may as well accept that, but then the point is that he is to be fruitful in his old age. God would encourage us in our old age not to give up, not to give up too soon, not to give up at all until the last breath. The Lord dismissed His spirit, involving an act of power; not that any of us may be spoken of in that way, because falling
{330}
asleep is not an act of power. Jesus did not die from exhaustion. God forbid we should think so. He dismissed His spirit. He took life so as to lay it down. He had power to lay it down and to take it again. That is a great matter to keep in our souls. But then our days are limited and, according to @Psalm 92, the point that in one's mind is that even if we become very old, we bear fruit in old age; there is no withering up, but always fruit bearing. There may be signs of the disappearance of life, and weakening, and of course those of us who are old are not unaware of that, not weakness but weakening, a process, a condition. It was seen in many who shone in the testimony, such as David. There is a striking difference between the David of 1 Kings and the David of 1 Chronicles. In the latter he is vigorous and able to stand on his feet and speak to his people, and in his old age, speak the most wonderful things of God. It is something that those of us who are old might well covet, to stand on our feet and not to pine away, or expect to be carried, but to stand on our feet and speak to the saints, speak a word in season to him that is weary, as the Lord says Himself, because there are many weary, many alas, and it ought to be a stimulation to the young people if they are weary, to see the older ones speak a word in season to the weary. So as I said, David shone in his old age. His life was worth writing about, it was worth recording. Not that those who seek to serve the Lord think of their lives being recorded, but they are registered in heaven. That is more than a record here on earth, very much more. Each of us has his place there for the Lord says, "But rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven". That is a very great matter; whatever there be in those names on earth, it will be recorded in heaven, the bearing fruit will be recorded, it will be known. They are already known there as fruit-bearers. We do not want to be removed because there is no fruit. It is a most solemn thing to be removed for that reason, that there is no fruit for God.
{331}
The first scripture read refers to bearing fruit unto God. He is looking for fruit and it comes from Himself, but still there is the Spirit's work which has to be kept in mind. He is here constantly, from the time He came; He is the other Comforter. Since the incarnation the earth has never been without a divine Person. God has never forsaken it, nor is He doing it now, and if He is here we may reckon on Him for all that is needed, even in regard of political matters, to say nothing of the Spirit's matters, the matters that refer to us as Christians. If the Spirit is here He will attend to what is needed for the testimony, and what is needed pre-eminently is fruit for God, as the passage read in @Romans 7 says, "So that, my brethren, *ye* also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God". The *we* includes all of us. All men are not bearing fruit; if anyone here is an unsaved person, he is not bearing fruit unto God. He may have a farm or business which he regards as fruit-bearing, but it is not for God.
Fruit-bearing for God is from the believer, from the Christian, and so we are to be set free from legalism. If we are tied up by it, and many are, we shall not bear fruit. We need to get delivered from the bondage, whatever it be that is binding the soul, in that sense, and the epistle to the Romans is just for that very purpose, that we might be free to bear fruit unto God; that we might do it not simply when we are met together as we are tonight, but always. The idea of fruit-bearing goes on in its season, "bearing fruit in its season", as the Psalm says. So the seasons govern our positions, the question of what a season may be, and that we do not forget we are in it, and use what is provided from God in order to augment the idea of fruit-bearing. And so we have our readings and our prayer meetings, and so on. Whatever it be that augments the position we are to avail ourselves of it, so as to render fruit in its season.
{332}
We have had a season lately, many of us, a peculiar kind of season too, we have been thinking of the one thing for months. Not, of course, excluding other things, for the service of God has to go on, and it did go on, even in the time of war. One has to thank God that in many places where the war raged, even as in this country, the brethren were able to proceed and carry on the service in such a time. How God honoured that! The brethren were to bear fruit in such a time, and they did. What we have had lately was a pre-eminent sort of time. Our brethren have had to do with it for months and it has cost toil and expense and all that, but God had His eye on it. It was to be a season, but it was only for three days and three nights, although these seasons are becoming more frequent than they used to be: meetings for three days take place every year in some places. It is a great matter, and these seasons bear fruit in the saints, fruit unto God. They are not holiday times, they never will be, they are times for fruit-bearing, spiritual fruit; and for drawing upon what there is in the sense of promoting spiritual fruit, fruit unto God. Further, the tendency in these meetings is to liberate the saints, to liberate us from legality or worldliness or whatever else it may be that interferes with the fruitfulness God looks for.
These seasons are important and we have the thought of a season, in the book of Revelation, in which Satan is bound. He is not bound now, but the day will come when he will be. He will be cast out of heaven too; that day is near, and yet we have to wait for things: One of the most important things is to wait for what God promises, because God has made promises. The Lord says He is to come quickly. You say, It is a long time, and He has not come yet; but He has made the promise and the moment will come, it will come to the moment of the calendar. "He that shall come will come, and will not tarry". He is never said to tarry. He may delay deliberately in order to let things happen, but He is never said to tarry. He is to be counted upon to come at the
{333}
season appointed, and so Satan has to be bound for a season, that is to say, one thousand years. It is a very important thing to have in our minds that this earth is going to see that wonderful period -- the thousand years. That is not simply for persons to speak of in a prophetic sense; it is a fact to be waited for, because we shall reign over the earth then with Christ in that day. Satan will be bound and the earth will bring forth its fruits. It will be a wonderful time, I would think, for all that is created. What God will do for man and for His creature! The creature itself looks for it according to @Romans 8. He looks for deliverance, he looks for the salvation that is coming; the revelation of the sons of God. The spirit of sonship will pervade that period, for in the true sense, the spirit of sonship will be in the millennial day, because the saints who form the assembly will come out to reign over the earth and they will be all sons of God, and will have an immense influence over the earth. It is a very precious thing to have in our hearts such seasons as that, so that we should not become drooping or depressed, but lively and walking by faith and not by sight. When the millennium comes, they will be walking by sight, but the present is the time of faith. The time of faith is a time of fruitfulness, when we should bear fruit for God.
Now I refer to the first Psalm because it gives the thought of fruit. The Psalms are really a sort of counterpart of the Pentateuch. The Pentateuch is God's disclosure of His mind in the early days of Moses. The thing was in purpose and the Pentateuch opens up the mind of God, it opens up the law. "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ". But still the law had its place and conveyed light in its time, but it brought forth the idea of the godly man and, dear brethren, I would appeal to those of us who are here as to godliness, and the first element would be righteousness. The second epistle to Timothy places righteousness as the first item in the list. We are to
{334}
follow righteousness. We are to follow it, we are to pursue it. It is a question of the fruit that God is looking for. The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them who make peace, and there can be no healthy assembly unless there are peacemakers in it. There may be troublers, but the peacemakers will overcome them. They are the fruit of righteousness.
The local assembly should be marked by peace and peacemakers will overcome the troublers, not that I would insinuate there are any here who are troublers, and yet there may be. There may be troublers; Achan was a troubler, the troubler of Israel. I need not enlarge on that, but in spite of the fact that there are troublers, there are peacemakers, not simply sons of peace but peacemakers, people who *make* peace. It is more to be a peacemaker than merely to be a peaceful man. Solomon means *peaceful*. His name means that. It did not cover everything in him, but a peacemaker is more than a peaceful man, and I would mention that specially, because there is always a need for peacemakers, if there is any little trouble, to put things right. Sometimes we are safer in saying nothing, if there be trouble, for if the trouble is waning, let it die out. Sometimes it does. God in mercy operates so that trouble wanes and disappears, so that there is no need of discipline. That is a great comfort, for if there be no trouble there is no need for discipline, for cutting off. We have the expression in Scripture, "I hate putting away". Putting away is a very sorrowful thing. The word now is to *withdraw*, but to have to withdraw from somebody who once shone in the service is a very humbling thing, both for him and for the persons who have to withdraw from him; if they love him they feel it. The word *withdraw* is used in 2 Thessalonians for a person who does not work. He is not doing anything violently bad, but he likes to be idle, and all that promotes idleness and slothfulness is contrary to God. It is said in 2 Thessalonians we are to shrink from everyone who walks disorderly; and there it is one who
{335}
does not work. There is no fruitfulness in that. It does not mean that he is put away, or withdrawn from in the full sense, but to shrink from such a one as unworthy of the confidence of Christians. He is not a peacemaker or a peaceful man. If he were, he would be doing what he could.
The word to us is, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might". This would break up Trade Unionism, which is one of the crimes of the moment. It is robbing man of his liberties, and God does not intend that. Governmentally, God has given this country to have laws that are more or less healthful and wholesome, but to rob men of laws God has made for them governmentally is a crime, and the saints ought to have in mind to pray for the laws God has made governmentally through parliaments. God ordained these institutions and the men who rule, too. He has ordained them for the moment and they have inaugurated laws that are wholesome and liberating to a point. We have to go further than that as Christians, for the fulness as to liberty is that we are set free from the law in the sense of legal bondage in our souls, to be married to another. That is to say, to be to Christ, to be to Him who is raised from the dead. Think of that! What a world He will bring in presently, what a season He will bring in for this poor benighted world! a season marked by life and marked by the fruit of the earth in its fulness, and "the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea", @Isaiah 11: 9. We are entitled to look for these things and glory in them too. We anticipate them, but we do so because we are set free to be to Christ, not to be to any union or combination of men, but to be to Christ who is raised from among the dead, to bring forth fruit unto God.
So the godly man is seen in the Psalms. I was speaking of the Pentateuch, and how law came in that time, and bore on David, because Moses had David in mind, for he was to rule. Judah was to rule and David was to be
{336}
a ruler, and so he wrote psalms. He was the sweet psalmist of Israel. Israel was well off in David who wrote the Psalms. So he wrote down the suggestion of the godly man, and the suggestion in @Psalm 1: 3 is that he bears fruit. What a man! Think of the earth being peopled by men like this. The man of @Psalm 1 is not a member of the assembly, of course; he is earlier; but God did not have to wait for the assembly for godly men, He had His godly men before. There is much said about the godly man in the prophets, and the Psalms. Elisha is a suggestion of a godly man, and so here the description is, "he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper". He is not taking things away from other people. He is not a robber. We do not want to be robbers, taking away what belongs to other people. "So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain: which taketh away the life of the owners thereof", @Proverbs 1: 19. That is what an unfair man will do, take away the life of his fellows, saying, 'I want what you have and I will take it by force if you do not give it me'. That is not of God, and we do not want to have the least sympathy with that. If we are to be godly men we must hold to what is right, and walk about the streets as those who do what is right. We are to follow righteousness, and that must include everything that is righteous.
The next passage is what I have already alluded to, the old brother, the old sister. The Lord would turn all the elderly ones into fruit-bearers. The younger are glad to help. It is a poor thing if a young person does not extend a hand to the older one, but at the same time, the older one has to learn to be dependent on God and His sustaining grace, so that he or she would not simply be going to the seaside to die. He or she would stay where he has been earning, and where he has been serving God and the brethren, to bear fruit there, to bear fruit in season. That is what you get here. The word is, "The
{337}
righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God", @Psalm 92: 12, 13. Think of that; planted in the house. No one planted in the house will forsake the meetings, you may be sure of that. Being planted in the house means your roots are there, and all your joys are there. I mean to say you are to take root where you are planted. The Lord Jesus said, "I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit". The older ones are to bear fruit in season, and see to it that the fruit is there, that we are not withered up. "Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God". That is a testimony. "To show that the Lord is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him".
I thought that would be worth while enlarging on in @Psalm 92, and then to point out what we get as to holiness in @Romans 6: 20 - 22. It says, "For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life". There is something in the idea of everlasting life that is peculiar, in the sense of its being the end, whether the end in time, or the end in effect of what is being done. Eternal life is a triumph, and we are to lay hold of it. Whether it be it is the end of our lives, or the coming of the Lord, or whether it be the end in effect, of what our service has been or is; it is a great triumph that it terminates in eternal life. We may well finish with this, that we have eternal life. We are to lay hold of it. It is a real thing, something that abides, something that is not measured by finance or whatever it be that governs matters of business and industry. It is another thing altogether, it is to be the end of what I am doing. It is God's end: it is a great triumph from His side. "There
{338}
the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore", @Psalm 133: 3. It is the end from God's side. But then the end of what we are doing, fruit-bearing, is everlasting life; "ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life".
It is what is due to God pre-eminently, because God is God. Holiness becomes His house for ever, and so if one has continued there he is marked by holiness, not simply by righteousness, he goes beyond that. The fruit of righteousness is holiness in one sense, but holiness is what is due to God in a peculiar way in the fruit that we bear. "Ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life". So we have triumph and these things make us victorious. We are apt to be depressed because of conditions. Conditions are very bad in some parts of the world, even in parts that may seem prosperous; but the triumph is that God is ending with what is very good, and the end is not only life, but holiness, meaning that God's house is taken care of. We are concerned about His house, and that the things in it are done rightly, and done in a holy way, so that there is testimony to holiness in every local assembly.
May God use the word. I believe it is important and one would commend it to the brethren.
{339}
THE BEARING OF PETER'S EPISTLES ON THE PRESENT DAY (1)
@2 Peter 1: 1 - 21
J.T. I had in mind to begin with the first epistle, but the characteristics of the second epistle are needed at the present time. This epistle deals with sin. The epistle of Jude is a similar book dealing with apostasy, but Peter deals directly with sin and how we overcome. The point is that we should be overcomers according to the book of Revelation. The Lord's remarks point to overcoming. They refer to ourselves, especially to the young people, at this present time, that we may be overcomers, overcomers of sin, walking in the light as He is in the light, so that we have fellowship with one another.
R.W.S. Do you discriminate between sin as in 2 Peter and apostasy as in Jude?
J.T. Quite so. Of course, we are dealing with 2 Peter, I only made comment about Jude to make comparison.
R.W.S. Would Jude be a later stage in the process involving apostasy? Does 2 Peter lead up to it?
J.T. I think if we would look at Jude we would see how emphatic he was. "Jude, bondman of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to the called ones beloved in God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ: Mercy to you, and peace, and love be multiplied. Beloved, using all diligence to write to you of our common salvation, I have been obliged to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith". Now, the comment I would make on that is Jude was very urgent. He had to turn aside from something else to meet a condition, and there is something similar to that at this time in Indianapolis. There may be a condition that has to be met. And we will have to find out as we proceed; the Spirit of God will probably indicate to us that there is a
{340}
condition to be met or something that has to be dealt with. But at the same time the idea of sin is more in Peter's epistle than in Jude. Peter had to write the first epistle and then the second epistle, one after the other, but Jude had only one epistle. It was a matter of urgency to him to turn aside from what he had in his mind, as he says, "I have been obliged to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints". That is to say, it is not simply a gospel address, it is the faith once delivered to the saints that they had turned aside from, and the reason of it is given, "For certain men have got in unnoticed, they who of old were marked out beforehand to this sentence, ungodly persons, turning the grace of our God into dissoluteness, and denying our only Master and Lord Jesus Christ". So the distinction between the two epistles is very clear. The one has to do with sin, that is Peter, and Jude has to do with apostasy. But he is urged to deal with it as something that had to be dealt with urgently.
J.T.Jr. @2 Peter 1: 9 says, "has forgotten the purging of his former sins". Is that the first allusion to what you have in mind?
J.T. Quite so. Former sins, not sins well known in the world, but the former sins. "For he with whom these things are not present is blind, short-sighted, and has forgotten the purging of his former sins". So that we shall have to be dependent on the Spirit as we proceed to think of what there may be in Indianapolis in this sense of former sins that have to be adjusted, so that we may come back to what we have been going on with fully, because the great scope of the truth has been opened up from time to time in this very town, away back for fifty years. And now we are here at this time and the question is what may be urged particularly and if the brethren are free to search their hearts we may be helped at this reading to give a lead in the other readings.
{341}
C.A.M. As you remark there has been much in the way of powerful testimony in this city in past years and Satan might seek to spoil it.
J.T. Quite so. We have to be on guard lest we should spoil it.
C.C.T. What is the thought as to the divine power in verse 3 of this passage: "As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness". Does that enter into the question of sin, that we would move in power in connection with it?
J.T. We are fully provided from God's side to deal with all matters that interfere with the progress of the truth. We may too have in our minds something that will be helpful in that respect that should come out as we proceed at this time.
J.T.Jr. Would not "all things" be very extensive? "All things which relate to life and godliness". That is the extent of what has been given to us.
J.T. Life and godliness, that is a great phrase, life first and then godliness. Peter has a way of using one phase of the truth to develop another. So that it is not simply a question of God here, but His divine power which has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness. His divine power has done that, provided for us.
C.C.T. Does the thought of knowledge enter into that also? It says, "through the knowledge of him that has called us".
J.T. That is what I am trying to speak of. One phase of the truth is used to develop other phases. So now it is a question not only of life and godliness, but of knowledge. The brethren ought to be concerned about knowledge. Hence the readings that we have are for us to get a knowledge of Scripture on the Lord's day or in the week days. It is a question of acquiring knowledge. The Spirit of God is here to help us and we are to help one another; any gift we may have is for us to use to help the brethren.
{342}
J.T.Jr. The word 'through' would be the instrumentality, one thing or another, through the knowledge, then through which we are called and then through these ye may be partakers. The word 'through' is connecting all these things.
J.T. Just so, instrumentality. God had provided it too. But what God has provided is one thing and what we may be able to provide is another thing. We ought to be able to provide something, to add to what God has provided. God loves His people to be with Him in what He is doing. He is operating and He is ready to have His people join with Him in what He is doing in unfolding the truth through them.
L.E.S. Would you mind saying a word as to verse *one*, "through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ"? I was wondering whether the bringing forward of the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ would not be the preservative from sin. I would be glad if you would say a word as to that.
J.T. "To them that have received like precious faith with us through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ". This is the opening part of the book, and it is a question of Peter, not in his first epistle, but in the second epistle, the one that has come into his mind after the first. Evidently something had happened and he needed to write again so that what had happened might be dealt with. The question is whether anything has happened here in this meeting and whether we are dealing with it, or whether the persons involved are dealing with it, because there is to be a turning-point and these meetings are in mind for that very purpose.
L.E.S. So that the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ involves the whole moral dealing with sin. Would that be right?
J.T. Just so. I suppose we might go back to Genesis to get help on these matters. How many times Genesis stands out in dealing with matters. Genesis affords much
{343}
in this respect. It is very early in the Scriptures, but Peter is very late and Peter was the leading apostle at first. Paul of course came in later. Clearly "first ... Peter" is mentioned (@Matthew 10: 2), he was the leading apostle. It is right to have someone who leads in the things of God. Peter was the one to take it up here in the first epistle and now in the second epistle. In the second epistle he is dealing with certain sinful conditions and the point is therefore whether we are challenging our hearts as to whether these conditions have any existence at all or whether they can be met.
R.W.S. Is that a feature of the second epistles generally such as the second epistle to Corinth and to Thessalonica and now of Peter?
J.T. Quite so. What do you say about these second epistles?
R.W.S. The change that came in at Corinth required the second letter and some error at Thessalonica as to the day of the Lord caused the second epistle to be written, and now you have suggested that something had come in which Peter knew of and which required the second letter.
J.T. Well I think that confirms what I have said and it is quite important and really enters into what has been in mind in these meetings as to the second epistle of Peter; of course what you have said about other second epistles has a great bearing on this. So it is a question of what the brethren have in their minds whether they can unfold anything to us and help each other. You have taken notice of the second epistles, I can see you have by the way you speak of them, and it is a question for each of us to see whether we have taken notice of them and whether we have anything to deal with in answer to them.
W.McK. Peter's use of the word "our God and Saviour Jesus Christ" suggests that this matter of righteousness has a peculiar bearing on ourselves.
{344}
J.T. It certainly has. It is the foundation of the gospel, righteousness. There can be nothing right without righteousness.
C.A.M. Would you say that the Holy Spirit is stressing this matter of righteousness because things are deteriorating everywhere?
J.T. Quite so.
A.S.B. So that the reference in verse one, "To them that have received like precious faith", is very beautiful, Peter being a family man and the quality of faith and measure of faith being received from God; as it says, God has given to each a measure of faith. The truth is not to deteriorate, as you are emphasizing, so it says, "Grace and peace be multiplied". That is the grace of God and the peace of God are to be extended or expanded in relation to ourselves.
J.T. Quite so. So we can see what a fine opening up we have.
J.T.Jr. Is the word "precious" another keyword in the epistles? Things become precious to us.
J.T. I think it is particularly a key word in Peter. He has remarkable ability to deal with language, although not a man, as we would say, of any special education, but he was taken up by the Lord, and the Lord knew what ability he had; he had great ability in language, he was one who could use fine words, expressive words. So here, precious faith, "like precious faith with us through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ"; and then, "Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord"; and then again, "As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the knowledge" -- let us notice all these words -- "of him that has called us by glory and virtue, through which he has given to us the greatest and precious promises, that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust". So there is a fine set of words here
{345}
that the brethren do well to notice and use in time as we have opportunity.
C.C.T. Would it be right to say that it is only a man like Peter who had gone through great exercise who is able to speak like this, and use such great words?
J.T. You want to be a man like that, we all want to be men like that, because it sets an example to us. He is not a man that was specially educated, he was a fisherman, but God took him up nevertheless and he fitted the matter exactly.
C.C.T. So the language of Peter is really assembly language is it not? -- preciousness, and so on.
J.T. I would say without hesitation that Peter's words are characteristic. That is to say God is not dependent on the colleges for men to bring out the truth. He has taken up men that are not distinguished by great knowledge. But He brings out the men that are suitable to convey the truth at the moment, and that is the reason why he has been carefully selected at this time; and it has been thought if we were short of further words, we might take up Jude because Jude is very like Peter, only Jude deals with apostasy and Peter deals with sin directly. But there is not much difference, apostasy is the worst word to be used, a turning away from things.
J.K. Does "partakers of divine nature" seem to be the great end in view over against the question of sin that you have been speaking of?
J.T. And then we have to notice that the divine nature is not simply the nature of divine Persons solely, but certain qualities that believers have, not divine Persons exclusively, but believers have part in the divine nature.
J.K. I was wondering if that is why it says that "through these ye may become partakers".
J.T. That is right, Christians have part in the divine nature. We have to understand what that means. It is not simply the nature of divine Persons as such, but the qualities that believers have by the Spirit.
{346}
J.W.W. Is it that we are morally like God?
J.T. That is very good, morally like God. I am trying to make clear that divine Persons are not necessarily in mind, that the divine nature has become imparted to believers, that is we have part in it because it says so very distinctly, that we might partake of the divine nature, "having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust".
J.W.W. You have emphasized the idea of these things. Would these things imply that we are in the gain of all that comes to us from the divine side and are morally in accord with it?
J.T. What has come to us from the divine side we, as believers, have part in. In one sense the divine nature has to be strictly kept to divine Persons, because the divine Persons are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. They are the only divine Persons that we have any mention of and They are the Persons that have the divine nature exclusively. But then believers becoming partakers of the divine nature are mentioned here, and that has to be understood as has also the difference between that and what only divine Persons by Themselves have.
J.T.Jr. That is deity, you mean. We are not partakers of deity.
J.T. That is right, that is good.
T.U. Would there be a suggestion in verses 1 to 4 as to the position in the mind of divine Persons for us and then verse 5 to 11 would be requisite in a cumulative way to the end that we be neither idle nor unfruitful?
J.T. Very good as far as it goes; you are saying what is in the scripture.
T.U. And then in verse 12, it speaks of our being established in the present truth. Is that not a necessity?
J.T. To be established in the present truth? Yes.
R.W.S. Peter adds one thing to another as it says in verse 5, "But for this very reason also, using therewith all diligence, in your faith have also virtue, in
{347}
virtue knowledge, in knowledge temperance, in temperance endurance, in endurance godliness, in godliness brotherly love, in brotherly love love". Would the way these matters are added one to the other bear upon the way we take on the present truth, the recent matter as to the Holy Spirit viewed objectively, and now the exercise as to the part sisters have in the assembly; does it add up to what we have in our own souls of present truth?
J.T. What I might venture to say is that no other writer uses this form of presenting the truth, no other writer but Peter, so that we have to deal with it by itself. Peter alone uses this form, using one feature of the truth to express another, and then another, and another and another.
J.T.Jr. Is it like a chain? One link running through another.
J.T. Just so.
A.S.B. The word "existing" in verse 8 has to do with our present circumstances, and then it says abounding, not merely existing, in you.
J.T. Peter was an ordinary man, a fisherman, not what you call an educated man as men say, but the Lord Jesus took him up, and the language he has is wonderful. No one else is found using it as he does and it is a question of how much we get out of it at this meeting at this time, because it is so full in the use of language all his own. There is no other servant or apostle uses this form that I know of. It is Peter, it is not Paul. Peter speaks very wonderfully of Paul, but we are speaking now of Peter to show what a man like Peter can do and what God can do with him. So that we are all seeking to be available to God if necessary for the unfolding of the truth or the dealing with these things.
J.T.Jr. Do you think the personality of Peter comes into what he is saying? He is an unlettered man evidently, he was not a college man as you were saying.
{348}
He learnt the thing himself and his own personality comes into his ministry.
J.T. So the service of God is available to all of us you might say; and now the sisters are coming into it; they also can have to do with it, only of course they are limited under certain statements mentioned by Paul himself.
C.C.T. Is this the outcome of Peters following Christ as the Lord told him in @John 21?
J.T. The Lord said to him several times, "Lovest thou me?". The Lord challenges him in that way, and then says, "Follow me".
C.C.T. That is right. That would be the main thought for Peter's affections, to follow Christ.
J.W.W. Peter uses the word 'virtue' here, a very rare word in the New Testament.
J.T. I had often wondered about that myself. A very fine word is the word 'virtue'.
J.T.Jr. It says of the Lord virtue went out of Him.
J.T. The Lord says it of Himself.
J.W.W. Does it convey the idea of power?
J.T. It is virtue, a good English word, and has its own meaning, and it fits in with Peter excellently.
J.T.Jr. We have the virtuous woman.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Would it indicate the virtue of the Lord?
J.T. See what the word virtue means, the moral quality.
J.W.W. I think at one time in Detroit you worked on the word, as applying to us as bringing forward the idea of moral courage. Am I right in that?
J.T. Very good.
W.H.C. I was going to ask about the word 'diligence'. Three times at least he uses the word diligence in this chapter. You suggested at the first that we should be diligent. At the prayer meeting last night there were exercises that we would have something specific and it is interesting that you should say the first thing this
{349}
morning that we might have something specific for this city.
J.T. I do not know that we need to say much more because the actual words contain themselves.
G.M.W. Would the footnote as to knowledge in verse 8 stimulate us as to our individual links with the Lord? It says, 'personal recognition'. I wondered if that would encourage each one of us, brothers as well as sisters, to strengthen our links with the Lord.
J.T. Quite.
C.A.M. Speaking of the woman who came to the Lord on the occasion when the Lord said that virtue had gone out of Him, do you not think that we should be marked by the diligence that was seen in that woman? She wanted something to counteract the terrible moral illness working in her.
J.T. Quite so.
J.T.Jr. And it says she could not be hid.
C.A.M. It is remarkable that the Lord singles her out in that way. In an address of yours years ago, in speaking of that woman, you raised the question with us as to whether we had experienced what it was to be alone in a crowd. So that she became intimately acquainted with the Lord in that way.
J.T. A very remarkable statement that is, alone in the crowd. You are not conscious of the crowd, you are conscious of something else.
T.L.S. Do you think it is of importance that there should always be a reason for whatever we may do (verse 5), seeing that God has always good reasons for what He does, dealing with sin and so on?
J.T. It says, "For this very reason also, using therewith all diligence, in your faith have also virtue". So that virtue has a prime place in this scripture. "In virtue knowledge", so that the recurrence of the word virtue is very remarkable. "In virtue knowledge, in knowledge temperance, in temperance endurance, in
{350}
endurance godliness, in godliness brotherly love, in brotherly love love: for these things existing and abounding in you make you to be neither idle nor unfruitful as regards the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; for he with whom these things are not present" -- note the negative -- "is blind, short-sighted, and has forgotten the purging of his former sins". It says former sins now.
J.K. Do we get a picture of this in the woman in the last chapter of Proverbs?
J.T. The virtuous woman, just so.
J.K. What she has.
J.T. Quite so, a very fine consideration. We should read that in the last chapter of Proverbs.
J.K. Yes, I was just noticing some of the things. It says, "She considereth a field, and acquireth it; of the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms. She perceiveth that her earning is good; her lamp goeth not out by night. She putteth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle", and so on.
J.T. Certain things that add to a woman, a virtuous woman. It is remarkable.
N.B. The apostle Paul seems to have in @Philippians 4: 8 a very wonderful chain of thoughts similar to what we have in this chapter of 2 Peter; he speaks of what is true and noble, also he uses the word virtue in that section, "if there be any virtue and if any praise, think on these things".
J.T. It all fits beautifully, and one feels that we have come here today to get what we are now dealing with because it is so full as to Peter's way of doing things and how we are reminded that we are not dependent on the colleges or the learning of this world, but on the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God is a great power for dealing with things, and of course it is divine power; it is the Spirit of God and is the great power by which things are accomplished at the present time. The power of God is
{351}
here with His people and is remaining here where the Spirit of God is.
C.C.T. Is it of any importance, that the last link in the chain that was just mentioned (verses 5 - 7) is love? Is there great importance in this thought of love, not only brotherly love but love, as any might seek to rectify what might be in the city?
J.T. Quite so. There may be something else as well that has to be noted. I would not say that love is specially to be noted; not that I would like to say a word about the brethren in Indianapolis. I am sure there is love among us, but that is not the only thing we are dealing with, but that there may be something amongst us that has been overlooked and that the Lord is calling attention to. Are we challenging our hearts as to whether we are dealing with anything that is contrary or interfering with the work of God here in Indianapolis?
C.C.T. I was wondering if that thought of love would be prominent in dealing with anything on that line.
J.T. Of course. Love never fails.
J.T.Jr. The point is if love is here we are better able to deal with sin.
J.T. Quite so.
A.S.B. Is that why it says in verse 9, "For he with whom these things are not present"? It is not a beautiful picture, is it? Our brother has referred to @Proverbs 31, and the end of verse 10 in our chapter says, "for doing these things ye will never fall".
J.T. So that it says, "Wherefore the rather, brethren, use diligence to make your calling and election sure". Now that is a very fine word because it is not God that is to do this, you are to do it, to make your calling and election sure. "For doing these things ye will never fall", not 'never fail' but "never fall", that is to say there will be no breakdown. "For thus shall the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ be richly furnished unto you". The word is
{352}
therefore what you can do yourself, not what God can do for you, but what you can do yourself. That is what I see here.
A.S.B. You have been emphasizing that recently, and I wonder at what has been accomplished by divine Persons, but I believe I see more clearly today that in relation to ourselves, while the power is towards us and operating in us, it is a question of what we do ourselves.
J.T. That is right, what you can do yourself, not what God can do. God can do everything, "I know that thou canst do everything", Job said to Him (@Job 42: 2). But then it is a question of what I can do, what each one of us can do.
Rem. Who could speak so impressively as Peter himself? he knew what it was to fall.
J.T. Quite so. He had fallen.
W.H.C. What you were saying is to have the effect of stirring us up, as Peter says. Moses could say, "As the eagle stirreth up its nest". Is that the exercise -- that you are stirring us up?
J.T. That is a great point for these meetings -- what has been done at Indianapolis, and that is why we selected Peter, and if Peter does not suffice, we will take Jude, because he deals with matters more drastically. It is apostasy, it is a terrible thought.
Ques. Is it not remarkable that the Lord takes up a fisherman? He does not say you have to change your occupation, but the persons are going to be changed.
J.T. Quite so.
J.McK. After Peter's address in @Acts 2: 37, 38 in relation to what Israel had done to Christ, "they ... said to Peter ... What shall we do, brethren? And Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit".
J.T. That is just what we are trying to convey. That is what Peter says; he tells them what to do.
{353}
J.McK. Then it says, "Those then who had accepted his word were baptised; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls".
J.T. The great result is the point, three thousand souls, and then five thousand. He made great headway.
J.McK. "And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers".
J.T. The whole matter is set out by those words, because Peter at that time was the leading man in the establishment of Christianity, the setting of it up here in the world.
J.McK. I thought that was connected with the working out of your own salvation with fear and trembling.
J.T. It was a very remarkable place Peter had at the beginning. "First ... Peter" is mentioned in the book of Matthew -- "first, Simon, who was called Peter". He is the first apostle at that time. Paul came in later. Peter says, "As our beloved brother Paul also has written to you ... as also in all his epistles"; he says, "things are hard to be understood". But they have to be understood. There were people who would say, I do not understand, but Peter would say that you have to understand, you are obliged to understand. If the truth is set out you are obliged to know it.
C.C.T. Is that why he uses the word 'careful' in verse 12? He says, "Wherefore I will be careful".
J.T. There is another word in the note there.
C.C.T. 'Use diligence', 'take care it shall be so'. Would it be the mark of perfection of one who is ministering that he is careful as to what he says?
J.T. We are dealing with the most precious and greatest things and we are not to deal carelessly with them, but are to be careful, be careful of what we say and to whom we say it too.
T.L.S. Could we speak of this as a priestly approach by Peter in the matter?
{354}
J.T. Well, quite so.
J.W.W. He uses the mind quite effectively, do you not think? Is that the reviving organ for us, the principle that he has in mind is that these things should come into moral expression in the saints. He speaks of their mind and his mind, all active in view of the establishing of what is the present truth.
J.T. Quite so. I think we must go on now to get all that there is in the chapter, because it is very full.
A.S.C. So that Peter seems to indicate the need of their having it in their power to call to mind these things. And his soul yearned over that matter that it might be formed in them and made available as under the help of the Holy Spirit.
J.T. He knew that the time would be short and he wanted to make the most of the time he had. And we are very well in that situation now. There is more to be done than can be done, than we are able to do with the instrumentality we have. So he says, "I account it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance, knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is speedily to take place, as also our Lord Jesus Christ has manifested to me; but I will use diligence", -- notice this, he is doing it himself -- "that after my departure ye should have also, at any time, in your power to call to mind these things. For we have not made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, following cleverly imagined fables, but having been eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory:" -- think of these wonderful words, how full they are, how rich they are! -- "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight; and this voice we" -- emphatic again -- "heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain. And we have the prophetic word made surer", -- notice the word prophetic word -- "to which ye do well taking heed (as to a lamp shining in an
{355}
obscure place) until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts; knowing this first, that the scope of no prophecy of scripture is had from its own particular interpretation, for prophecy was not ever uttered by the will of man, but holy men of God spake under the power of the Holy Spirit". This is wonderful phraseology that is used by this servant.
T.U. Would there be any significance in the fact that he himself speaks of the positive use of diligence in view of not only setting out the ministry orally, but setting it out in himself?
J.T. Quite so.
T.U. I was asking in view of the fact of Peter's positive use of the idea of diligence, if it would not be a searching question for all of us as to what we are as regarding ourselves, not just speaking about it but using it.
J.T. That is the word that is going to run through these meetings -- what we can do ourselves, what each one can do.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the last verse? It says prophecy was not ever uttered by the will of man but it is by the power of the Spirit, not the will of the Spirit, but the power of the Spirit.
J.T. What would you like me to say? Cannot you say it? You just say what the meaning of it is.
Rem. I know what it is but I cannot express it; I just wondered what it was as to the power of the Spirit as over against the will of man.
J.T. You have gone to the public schools, you know how they teach, but now that is man's way, but you have learnt something else since you left the schools, you have learnt something about the Scriptures, have you not, and so you should be able to unfold things from the Scriptures to us now. You are here for that purpose. So tell us now what you think about prophecy never uttered by the will of man. It is only the power of God that can do it.
{356}
Rem. We cannot say much about the power, it cannot be explained.
J.T. Quite so, I feel that myself. But it is a question of what can be done here by ourselves today. So it says, "(as to a lamp shining in an obscure place) until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts". Think of that -- in your hearts; it is not arising in God's heart or in the heavens, but in your heart. "Knowing this first, that the scope of no prophecy of scripture is had from its own particular interpretation". So that you cannot base everything on one particular word or interpretation. It says, "For prophecy was not ever uttered by the will of man, but holy men of God spake under the power of the Holy Spirit".
J.T.Jr. The word 'uttered' in verse 18 is directly from heaven. That is they heard the voice from heaven. And then the word 'uttered' in verse 21 is the same word, but now through man. Is it not wonderful that you get God's direct voice uttered on the mountain, but then later it is through man, in the power of the Spirit?
J.T. Very good.
N.B. What application would there be of this to the meeting for ministry?
J.T. For ministry? It says, "let two or three prophets speak", but particularly two rather than three. I think we should notice that, not simply three, we can have three but two *or* three; two first.
N.B. I suppose the will of man would be excluded there too.
J.T. It would indeed, but I think the two rather excludes the will of man. If you have three you are apt to go too far, you know.
R.W.S. Would the allusion in verse 20, "No prophecy of scripture is had from its own particular interpretation", bear on the current ministry? Some have quoted @1 Corinthians 14, the matter of women being silent in the assembly and yet over against that, as you have pointed out, there is the word in the great assembly
{357}
chapter -- @1 Corinthians 11 -- as to women praying and prophesying.
J.T. That is one thing that has been on my mind for several weeks as to how these sisters are going to prophesy. The great point is that they are to be covered. But how are they going to do it, how are they going to prophesy? Now what do you say about that? It has been in my mind for months. What is to be done on the tenth chapter of 1 Corinthians? Just read that (@1 Corinthians 10: 23 - 33, 11: 1 - 16 read). First of all I want to speak about the reference to women there, how negative it is. She is not told to prophesy, she is told to be covered. The point is not prophecy; we have to decide how prophecy can be carried on and prayer, but the point here is the covering. The tenth verse, "Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head on account of the angels". But when is she to prophesy? She is not to prophesy unless she is covered, that is the point, but then we have to decide eventually where she is to prophesy, whether it is in a hall or a meeting room. Now I would just like the brethren to say what they think about what I have been saying.
J.T.Jr. The point you are stressing here in chapter 11 is the covering -- the authority that is to be on the woman. She could not do anything until that was there.
J.T. So it is not so much the fact that she prophesies, but the covering. But the time will come when she must prophesy because it is implied that she must do it, and it is a question of whether they can prophesy in the assembly or how it is to be carried on. I would put it to the brethren as to what they think about this. We have all to come to this -- the true meaning of chapters 10 and 11 of 1 Corinthians.
N.B. In the Old Testament we have Hannah's prayers, and Deborah's song, both of those seem to be marked by prophesying.
J.T. But then we have to come down to Paul, and he comes in later. The Lord gives him a supreme place
{358}
in regard of the assembly. He has the mystery, that feature of the service of God is in Paul's hands, and he is looking after it. What I would say and urge on the brethren would be to think of all this in chapters 10 and 11 in 1 Corinthians and how these matters are to happen with the sisters. There has been a great deal clarified for them lately, but this point is not clear as to where the prophesying is to be carried on.
C.A.M. May I raise a question about that verse, "every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered puts her own head to shame"? Would that mean she was praying or prophesying in the presence of men?
J.T. Well, I am just leaving it open; I am putting it to the brethren as to what they think about it because that has to be settled in all this instruction that we have recently had about chapters 10 and 11 of 1 Corinthians.
J.T.Jr. We have noted that Anna did at the temple.
J.W.W. It is said of her that she "spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem".
J.T. That needs to be taken up too, I do not say should be done, I am only asking the brethren to think it over. We have not any more time in this meeting, but there is time for thinking over the matter, how these things are to be met. Scripture deals with certain things and the instruction is not very clear, at least it is not to mg and I would like to think of it and would like the brethren to think of it - how the question is going to be met.
N.B. Is it of any consequence that in @1 Corinthians 14 prophecy is referred to and in that same chapter it says, "Let your women be silent in the assemblies, for it is not permitted to them to speak".
J.T. But then the prophesying must go on, you see. God does not put things to us that cannot be solved; they can be solved. It is a question of spirituality.
T.L.S. Is the concern first as to the covering?
J.T. That is what is being dealt with, and we can think over these matters.
{359}
THE BEARING OF PETER'S EPISTLES ON THE PRESENT DAY (2)
@2 Peter 2: 1 - 22
J.T. We have already alluded to the ability of Peter to set out the truth. It would be difficult to find a more striking evidence of ability than we have in this chapter -- ability to denounce error, for almost every word of this chapter denounces error. No doubt it is needful that this should come before us at the present time because there is great ability abroad in the way of language; as I was remarking, you could hardly find anything so strong and effective as this second chapter of Peter's second epistle, and undoubtedly the Lord would say something to us as to the error that is abroad in the world.
J.T.Jr. You are specially thinking of the recent doctrine that has been promulgated?
J.T. Yes; I was referring to the error of Rome as to Mary, the mother of our Lord, one of the most bare-faced statements of error that could be produced.
Ques. In chapter one of this epistle the truth is presented positively, whereas here it is dealing with things in a negative way. Mr. Darby opens up the truth to the saints in his book *The Irrationalism of Infidelity*, would that be like this?
J.T. Very much like it. We surely can thank God that He raised up such a man to lead. in the denouncing of error, inclusive of that held by the Romish church.
C.A.M. It is remarkable that the terrible conditions of evil go back so far. God spared not the angels who sinned, but cast them down. Would you say that it is necessary for all this matter of evil through these many years to work itself out? Would it be God's way to allow the thing to develop? I was thinking of verses 4 and 5, "God spared not the angels who had sinned", and "spared not the old world". Has He allowed these things to go on, to show how impregnable the truth is all through history?
{360}
J.T. Very good. You marvel that the truth really has been able to stand all these centuries; it has been able to stand, defended by such ability as God gave certain ones, Mr. Darby and others like him, perhaps no one like him in modern times. We can give thanks for this truly, especially the young ones who are growing up in the truth, because they learn to form a judgment about the evil that is so pronounced in the world, especially Rome. Although God has allowed Communism also to develop, in itself as erroneous as Rome is, only Rome has the field before it and great ability in men to set out evil. God had in Peter a man to denounce error, and we can hardly get anything so strong as this chapter affords us.
L.E.S. Would the day dawning and the morning star arising in your hearts be the impregnability of the truth? I am linking it on with the Lord's word in Thyatira.
J.T. Just so, the dawn refers to an incoming day, but the morning affords a certain freshness, peculiar freshness - the morning star.
G.M.W. Would a knowledge of the Scriptures preserve us in the truth?
J.T. Quite so.
G.M.W. Peter refers quite often here to Noah and Lot. I was wondering if that would not connect with the truth because the Scriptures were stressed in the first chapter.
J.T. And then the extension backwards as Peter alludes to it here, "for whom judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction slumbers not" (verse 3). How far back we cannot just say, but "not idle" is a negative word.
J.T.Jr. It speaks of the lake of fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
J.T. Just so. Another illustration of what we have been saying in the Scriptures, is the lake of fire in the book of Revelation. A lake is striking; it is limited, but yet it is condensed, it carries the idea of condensation. It is
{361}
condensed so that it should be effective. There is the thousand years too that Peter alludes to; it is striking that God affords Himself latitude, so to speak, as to all these matters: "One day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day".
J.K. What is involved in the latter part of verse 2, "through whom the way of the truth shall be blasphemed", not the truth, but the "way of the truth". What is set forth in that?
J.T. The expression "way of the truth" is remarkable.
J.T.Jr. We get "the way" in the Acts of the Apostles.
J.T. Exactly.
J.T.Jr. Would that allude also to what we are in today, we are in something, the same things at the present time; the way has come down to us.
Rem. Thomas said, "How can we know the way?", but the Lord Jesus could say, "I am the way".
J.T. Just so.
R.W.S. Would a consideration of the way of the truth make our senses more acute as to false prophets and false teachers, because we may become inclined to have too much latitude in our thoughts and be too tolerant of evil doctrine?
J.T. Maybe you would enlarge on that a little.
R.W.S. I was thinking of the safety of being in the meetings and coming to the meetings, in the way of the truth, so that we should have a proper standard in our minds as to evil and know how to name evil as evil and not be too tolerant as we may be naturally.
J.K. I was thinking of what you were saying this morning as to moral conditions being worked out in the saints here upon earth. It has pleased divine Persons to work these things out in a concrete way as seen here upon earth. Would that not be involved in the way of the truth as it is seen here in individuals and corporately?
J.T. What comes to my mind just now is that God has led to the sisters taking their place amongst the
{362}
saints under certain limitations. And coming together as we are now affords the Spirit of God opportunity to work out things in a conversational way, between the meetings the brethren and the sisters should be occupied with speaking of the truth as it comes out in the meetings, so that it should become practical in our lives and m our observations.
J.W.W. In that light would John's second epistle to the elect lady bring out the principle in mind?
J.T. Just so, the elect lady and her children. She had children, so as to say the idea was carried down through children.
J.W.W. She was not to receive into the house those who did not bring certain doctrine. So the way of the truth would stand connected with the profession of things.
J.T. The devil would work amongst the sisters in an adverse way, adverse to the truth. So the necessity of their observing the truth and defending it, speaking in a general sort of way amongst themselves in defending the truth. They themselves have the armour on ready for defence, defence and attack as well.
L.E.S. Would the corruption of all this be seen amongst women in the religious world and in the way they are dealing with what is corrupt in teaching?
J.T. Just so.
C.C.T. Aquila and Priscilla were able to unfold the way of God. Is that the same thought as the way of truth?
J.T. They are spoken of equally -- husband and wife spoken of equally.
C.C.T. I was thinking of the ministry that you have been giving us recently in regard to the sisters, how they would fall in line with the brothers in this remark as to Aquila and Priscilla, that they would have their responsibility as to being able to unfold the way of the truth.
J.T. Well now, take a sister like Deborah in the Judges, she would push Barak forward; he rather slackened himself, but she was a peculiar sister in that
{363}
sense. She says, "Until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel", @Judges 5: 7. She was a mother in Israel, and then several others are mentioned at the same time by her. These are great matters as to sisters and fathers, and sisters seen in relation to fathers.
R.W.S. Since the meeting this morning, I have been thinking over what came before us, and I was wondering if there would be an opportunity in a meeting for care for a sister to prophesy.
J.T. That is what we spoke of this morning and I do not know how much we have thought of it since.
R.W.S. I was thinking and praying about it and I think many of us were. The care meeting is not exactly an assembly meeting, although it might develop into an assembly meeting; but if it were not an assembly meeting could a sister in a comely way give a word which might bring in the mind of God?
J.T. I suppose God laid out the necessity for the balance of the truth and that the lead should be with the brothers, masculine. The lead should be masculine, whereas the sisters should follow on according to the power and wisdom they may have and there is so much opportunity amongst them of conversing together in a practical way, supporting what the brothers lead in, because it is quite evident that it is not God's will to have sisters leading in things, but rather taking part in aiding and supporting what the brothers, the masculine side, would advocate, because God evidently has set the man first. "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion", @Genesis 1: 26. The word "them" includes the feminine, but they have dominion, they have dominion together.
J.T.Jr. In @Acts 18: 26, where Aquila and Priscilla are referred to, he is mentioned first. It says, "And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to them and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly". That is the lead is in the man, but both of them evidently were in the instruction.
{364}
J.T. Just so. They took him to them, that would be Apollos.
L.E.S. Would not the word of a prophetess furnish support in the working out of the truth?
J.T. Well I think it will if the sisters do their part comely and in a seemly way; they will have great power in confirming what the brothers lead in, because we should be with God in everything, and God has ordered it that the man should be first, but at the same time the woman is from Man (@Genesis 2: 22). It is a remarkable thing that God ordered that for us. We have to learn something from it.
L.E.S. Is it not suggestive that the first part of the section you referred to this morning brings in the sisters and the last part refers to the sisters. I mean in @1 Corinthians 11 and 14?
J.T. But the strong word is, "I do not suffer a woman to teach nor to exercise authority over man" (@1 Timothy 2: 12); that is very striking. But at the same time it is offset so that the sisters do their part in a comely, seemly and sisterly manner.
L.E.S. Would it imply anything in that it is not said, 'I suffer not a woman to prophesy'. Paul does not refer to prophecy, but he refers to teaching.
J.T. What we were saying as to those two chapters in 1 Corinthians will need more attention than we have been able to give.
T.L.S. In @Exodus 15, "Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the tambour in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambours and with dances. And Miriam answered them, Sing to Jehovah, for he is highly exalted: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea". She just said what Moses had said before.
J.T. She is a sister of Moses of course and of Aaron, and gave way to feminine weakness too in attacking Moses, which is a remarkable thing. We are not to forget that; a certain tendency to rivalry, I would
{365}
say, in which Aaron and Miriam had part. All that is just to be thought of in our meditations on this whole matter in @1 Corinthians 11 and 14.
G.M.W. Would you define the meaning of prophesying?
J.T. Well there is something very peculiar in it. I am not ready to undertake to define it. It is something that begins with God. We have false prophets here.
J.K. I believe you have said that Mary in @John 20 had a definite word from the Lord to bring to the disciples, but the woman in @2 Kings 4 was rather out of her place, even though in the house, so that death was found working in the house. Is that right?
J.T. Quite so. Perhaps you will point out the actual details so we would know a little better what you mean.
J.K. I was just thinking that in @John 20 Mary brings a definite word from the Lord to the disciples and they accept it, whereas in @2 Kings 4 the woman seems to take the initiative; death is working and when death comes in she says, "All is well". Then she goes to the prophet, and she also says to the prophet that all is well. But nevertheless death is there. So when the prophet is brought into it, does he not have to walk to and fro in the house to see what is wrong?
J.T. That is right. Something possibly in the way of newspapers and other things like that which would bring in leaven which would be poisonous. So Elisha had to look after that; he had to attend to it and he did attend to it. He is the man of grace, you know.
J.K. I think you pointed out very helpfully that he brings in grace, but nevertheless when death is working it is exposed, is it not?
J.T. Yes it is, that is quite right. Now what would you say as to overcoming that?
J.K. I think what you have been bringing before us today is helpful in that way that there is that which is being found morally amongst the saints which is able to deal with it. Is that not so?
{366}
J.T. Just so.
A.S.B. With regard to your reference to Roman Catholicism, and our scripture here as to false prophets and false teachers, the falsification of the truth and the bringing in of destructive heresies, it says, "and deny the master that bought them". The work of redemption is involved in it and our Lord Jesus is set aside by a vicar on earth which is the masculine side; it is falsifying the truth. And now in our day they have brought something forward in an extreme way falsifying the truth concerning the mother of our Lord, blessed as she is, but exalting a woman to be, in a certain sense, commensurate with divine Persons.
J.T. And it is remarkable that the Lord Himself speaks of Mary, His own mother, and calls her woman. He says, "What have I to do with thee, woman?", @John 2: 4. These persons who advocate Mary would do well to think of that. I have thought of it a good deal. There are about ten women spoken of in the gospel of John that might be well considered as to all these matters.
Rem. I was thinking that the end of @Matthew 12 would fortify the brethren, because it says there, "But while he was yet speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking: to speak to him. Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, seeking to speak to thee. But he answering said to him that spoke to him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? And, stretching out his hand to his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother".
J.T. Quite so. That brings in a very good line of thought and I am glad you mentioned it. The person who told the Lord His mother was waiting for Him outside was not spiritual at all. He should not have said that. He should have had more respect for the Lord than to say that. And that reminds us how we should have
{367}
respect for divine things and have respect for anything that refers to the Lord Himself.
A.S.C.Sr. The last verse of the previous chapter indicates that holy men of God spake under the power of the Holy Spirit. The absence of that in much that is recorded in chapter 2 would indicate to our hearts the need of being spiritually sensitive to what is in the power of the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so. The Spirit of God being here is the great point that is stressed constantly, because He is sent from heaven, and He has taken a lowly place, a wonderful lowly place all these centuries.
Ques. Should not the matter of sisters speaking have a great place with them? It was when Elizabeth was filled with the Spirit that she began to speak. Should we look for that among the sisters that they speak spontaneously under the direction of the Spirit?
J.T. just so.
T.U. In connection with the sisters prophesying, and your remark as to the propriety of making room for what is masculine, I wondered about the four daughters of Philip who had ability to prophesy, whether the comeliness of these sisters is seen in making room for the prophet, the man, Agabus.
J.T. Just so. What we began with in this chapter should be followed up a little more. There were false prophets also among the people. They would find opportunity no doubt among the people, here being no protection against error in that sense. We should note in verses 1 to 10, expressed in Peter's wonderful language, the respect that he has for the Lord, his Master, and the way in which he stresses lordship, for God would maintain that thought and principle of authority and dignity amongst the brethren. Peter also draws attention to the agencies that were operating and using what was false -- well-turned words.
J.T.Jr. I think if anything defective is apt to be amongst us -- anything brought in that is defective --
{368}
it should be condemned immediately as it is going to affect the fellowship.
J.T. Quite so, condemn it immediately. And now the question comes in as to how sisters, although they are not brought in here, can prophesy in mingling together in a holy way with others, so that a thing is confirmed. It is set out in a way to commend it in a very orderly sense, in a seemly way by sisters.
J.McK. I was thinking of Hymenaeus and Alexander, Paul says as to them, "have made shipwreck as to faith; of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme", @1 Timothy 1: 19, 20. I was thinking, in view of the remarks that have been made, that anything that is not according to the truth should be taken up and judged. Sometimes we think of small matters, so that Paul here speaks of the matter of shipwreck as to the faith and he connects it with blasphemy.
J.T. And it is to be dealt with immediately, as was remarked.
J.McK. I was thinking of the connection, in the chapter we are reading, between the way of faith and those who blasphemed the way of the truth.
J.T.Jr. I notice that sentence runs from verse 4 to the middle of verse 10, a very long sentence, perhaps one of the longest, very extraordinary really in regard to the grammatical working of it, and yet it is all connected.
J.T. Very good. And then in verse 10: "Bold are they", he comes back to that, "self-willed; they do not fear speaking injuriously of dignities". I think the idea of dignity is very important, that is the dignity that belongs to those who are on God's side in the truth.
C.C.T. It should be a great encouragement to us this afternoon, in view of all the untruth that is going through the scene at the present time, that the Lord knows. Would that be an encouragement to us to stand for the truth?
{369}
J.T. Just so. The Lord knows those that are His.
C.C.T. I was not thinking of that so much. That is true, but I was thinking of verse 9, "The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of trial".
A.S.C.Sr. In @Acts 16 Paul and others having come to Philippi, moved out by the river where it was customary for prayer to be and they spoke with the women assembled. Is there an encouraging thought that there was such a state there among the sisters that Paul could delight to converse with them?
J.T. And there was a certain one whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul.
Rem. In chapter 1, verse 12 it says, "Wherefore I will be careful to put you always in mind of these things", and then in verse 13, "But I account it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance", and then in verse 15, "But I will use diligence, that after my departure ye should have also, at any time, in your power to call to mind these things". He would fortify them against the evil about to come in?
J.T. Quite so, and that after he was put to death.
W.McK. Are the other references in this chapter to fortify us in our souls? The way of truth has been referred to, the apostle also refers in verse 15 to the straight way, and then in verse 21 to the way of righteousness.
J.T. Very good. I think we are profiting by what we are saying, these readings afford special help, and then the conversation that occurs between the meetings carries on what is said in the meetings. In the meetings when we are convened the Spirit of God has peculiar power, but in the interim, although we are not so particular so to speak, there would be something for good in the conversation that transpires.
Rem Reference was made to the woman of worth in Proverbs. It says of her, "She surveyeth the ways of her household".
{370}
J.T. Very good. "She surveyeth the ways of her household". The children ought to be under her control.
C.A.M. Would it not be a practical matter to realise that when Noah was preserved, his wife was preserved and the wives of his three sons? The feminine was preserved in that way; whereas with Lot the feminine was disastrous; I mean the outcome of it, on account of the terrible wickedness of the world.
G.M.W. If a sister is prophesying, bringing the mind of God to bear for the moment, that would not of necessity have to be in the assembly, would it?
J.T. No, not necessarily, we can talk of it at any time, if it is right to do so.
G.M.W. So if, in conversation, a sister brings the word of God to bear upon my soul if I had done something wrong, that would be a prophetic word to me.
J.T. Surely, where are sisters to prophesy if they do not do it on those lines? We cannot have it in the assembly, so they must do it somewhere, and the households of the saints would be the best place to do it. We are counting on God to give sobriety in all that is said and done.
J.T.Jr. Sarah's words in her house became scripture, did they not?
J.T. Quite so.
J.T.Jr. "Cast out this handmaid and her son", @Genesis 21: 10.
J.H. So are we to make a difference between that which Paul speaks of in assembly and the thought as to Mary bringing word to the disciples?
J.T. What do you want to say about that?
J.H. Well, I was thinking about the distinction between the two occasions. "Comes bringing word to the disciples", would be informal, you might say.
J.T. Quite so.
J.H. But the word 'in assembly' is on a higher level, is it not?
{371}
J.T. We must not forget the word "Rabboni". That became current amongst the saints, I am sure, -- that is Teacher.
Rem. In regard to sisters prophesying, what you were bringing before us from @1 Corinthians 11 seems to be important; you stated it was not so much emphasizing the idea of prophesying, but the idea of covering. I feel how needful this is. We would feel we cannot expect them to prophesy if they do not accept the matter of covering. These matters should be accepted among the sisters.
J.T. That is very good. Just let us observe whether sisters are covered when they should be. Some are not, they pay no attention to it whatsoever, and therefore it should be noticed and spoken of because it is a public matter that the sisters should be covered when they should be covered, and we should be able to speak of it properly.
M.O. Would the fact that Philip had four virgin daughters that prophesied link more with the household than with the assembly?
J.T. Very good. It would be the household; there were four of them.
M.O. They would not be his daughters in the assembly, would they?
J.T. No, they would be sisters. But they prophesied, they were prophetesses. Of course they are very rare now, a prophetess is very rare, not that I would despise the sisters in any sense, but it is quite rare to find anyone who prophesies.
A.S.B. Would Rhoda, the young sister in @Acts 12, be in principle carrying out the service of prophecy?
J.T. Quite so, she stood by the truth, she suffered for the truth; she maintained that it was really Peter who was there.
A.S.B. She recognized the voice of Peter. The answer to prayer in principle would be a voice of a divine
{372}
Person and she reported that the apostle was there. They said, Thou art mad, but she stood by the truth.
J.T. Very good.
C.C.T. How does Phoebe come into the matter? she was a minister of the assembly, a deaconess.
J.T. Whatever was right to be done, she would do in a right and comely way. She was comely in what she was doing. It is remarkable that these cases have come up for us because they help us at the present time in view of all that has arisen in regard to sisters. It is only about eighteen months ago when the question arose in Bristol, I think it was, that the sisters should be present at all the meetings, not just brothers only.
J.K. Deborah arose and went with Barak, so that in that way Barak took the initiative in one sense.
J.T. But it says she arose herself, that is to say it was her doing. God was in it of course, but it was her doing. "Until ... I arose a mother in Israel", @Judges 5: 7. She took that distinction herself, and God supported her in it.
J.K. Yes. What she says is, "I will by all means go with thee, only that it will not be to thine honour upon the way which thou goest, for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman". Then it says, "And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh", @Judges 4: 9. So that she moved with him.
J.T. I should say all these facts are very important and we can see how important they are in the way they are coming before us at this present time in Indianapolis.
T.U. Have you any thought as to the service of the sisters in connection with Apollos? Aquila and Priscilla unfolded to him the way of God more exactly. I was thinking of the sisters in the idea of teaching. He knew only the baptism of John, but now that he had been taught he could announce publicly that Jesus was the Christ.
{373}
J.T. Well she and her husband took him to them. Is that what you have in mind?
T.U. I was thinking Priscilla had her part in that matter. Earlier it says, "He spoke and taught", and later on it says, "He with great force convinced the Jews publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ", @Acts 18: 28.
J.T. What a valuable man he was -- Apollos!
M.O. Does not Deborah add a seemly note to her song when she says, "My heart is toward the governors of Israel"?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Would not Hannah be an example for good for our sisters, the comely way in which she answered?
J.T. Quite so. She suffered too. When you get suffering as with Rhoda and Hannah then you may be sure that God is peculiarly in it.
Rem. Eli observed her lips moving; she was not speaking audibly.
J.T. Quite so.
W.H.C. Are the sisters included in the matter of casting lots in @Acts 1: 26? It says, "And they appointed two, Joseph, who was called Barsabas, who had been surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou Lord, knower of the hearts of all, shew which one of these two thou hast chosen, to receive the lot of this service and apostleship, from which Judas transgressing fell to go to his own place. And they gave lots ..." That is what I have in mind. Are the sisters in that matter?
J.T. Well, God had recognized that both in the Old and in the New Testament. We do not do it now, because we do not have to, we have the Holy Spirit amongst us and He makes up for everything if we make way for Him. We do not need anything more in that sense if we make way for the Spirit.
Ques. Would casting lots be the same as voting today?
J.T. You said voting; did you mean ordinary voting?
{374}
Rem. Yes.
J.T. That is a political idea and I therefore would not use it much; only the idea is there. I would be ashamed to use the word among the Lord's people, such as, I vote for him. I would be ashamed to use it or do it.
Ques. Would not verse 14 of chapter 1 of Acts indicate that the women were there?
J.T. Clearly they were, of course they were, and they have been here so to speak ever since -- they are here today. And they come to the care meetings in London and in New York too.
Rem. In Minneapolis too.
J.T. Very good. The truth is making its way therefore.
Rem. They were there giving sanction to what was going on.
J.T. We have however to say this, that when the Lord instituted the Supper, the sisters do not seem to have been there. He sat down with the twelve. It is only to be mentioned; that is all that is needed.
C.A.M. But before the house was prepared for the incoming of the Spirit, they were there then, were they not? I mean to say the Holy Spirit came to indwell the house when the sisters were there. I am only drawing a distinction between the Supper, when the Lord just had the brothers, and the time when the Spirit came; I take it that there were sisters present to make up the material for the house.
J.T. Quite so. Have you anything more to say about that?
C.A.M. I just wondered whether it would be right to feel that that matter of the brothers in connection with the Supper was prior to the coming of the Spirit. That is all I meant, that the thing was complete really when the Spirit came.
J.T. Quite so. The coming of the Spirit settles everything. He has taken a lowly place and was sent from heaven, and that settles everything. "He abides
{375}
with you, and shall be in you" (@John 14: 17), as He is this very day amongst us here.
J.K. Does not the first verse in @Romans 16 show the great place a sister can have, "But I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is minister of the assembly which is in Cenchrea". Minister of the assembly.
J.T. You will have to decide how she ministered; she must have done things which could be done by a sister, clearly.
J.K. So that she had a great place in that sense, did she not?
J.T. Quite so. She is a remarkable woman; one has often spoken of her.
M.O. If it is not diverting would you say a word on @Acts 2: 4: "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth"? Would you include the sisters in it?
J.T. I think so, in regard of what is before us now.
J.T.Jr. Does it not say, "Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy"?
J.T. Quite so.
T.L.S. Just how do you view the daughters of Zelophehad?
J.T. What I would say especially about them is they spoke right; it was a great matter.
T.L.S. It says of them, "And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and the whole assembly, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, saying ...". The evidence is they spoke, saying such and such a thing; they were in the proper position.
J.T. We cannot apply the Old Testament to the assembly, it is not a guide for that, you know. The New Testament is the New Testament and there is no equal.
A.S.C. I am encouraged in relation to Anna -- what characterized her in her service. She was waiting with
{376}
prayer and fasting on the coming of the blessed Lord, a thing of great value for us to know something about, the sisters having a special part; it says of Simeon that the Holy Spirit was upon him, but the sister was characterized by fasting and prayer, so that she was able to speak to those in Jerusalem of the coming of this blessed Person.
J.T. Very good. Would the brethren now be kind enough to let us go on with the chapter because it is a most weighty chapter? Notice the comparison Peter makes between persons, and how he brings it to bear upon the truth.
Ques. That is like Jude, is it not? -- "Spots in your love-feasts".
J.T. Just so.
R.W.S. I wanted to ask about the way the Spirit of God speaks about Lot, as a righteous man, "righteous Lot". I was wondering why, under these circumstances with this Old Testament history, the Spirit of God is speaking that way.
J.T. I think Peter is gracious, you know; he gives latitude, speaks in a gracious way about these persons. Why should we not use all the grace possible that we are entitled to use? I think Peter is governed by grace in all he is saying here.
R.W.S. Would it fit in with the next chapter in which we have God's unwillingness that any should perish?
J.T. Quite so.
T.L.S. I would like to ask about verse four of our chapter, "God spared not the angels who had sinned". I was wondering if that would be a kind of lesson to us in the matter of dealing with sin, no personal preferences.
J.T. Just so.
T.L.S. God spared not the angels, it was His own creation.
J.T. The question of angels has often been mentioned, but it is mysterious; you cannot say too much because you might be in error. At the same time I remember in Auckland, New Zealand, we had a meeting
{377}
on miracles, and it was pointed out that you cannot be too sure. We know when man was created, but we cannot tell when angels were created, nor how many there were. So that we have to be careful in speaking about angels. "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?", @Hebrews 1: 14. That gives you the light I think that we have in speaking of angels. We cannot be too sure as to them except what Scripture says of them.
B.I. Reference was made to the sisters being present on the day of Pentecost. They were speaking with tongues. The apostle says, "Greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues".
J.T. What is your point?
B.I. We were speaking about the part the sisters might have in prophesying; we have no record of sisters prophesying in the assembly, but they were there when they were speaking with tongues.
J.T. Quite right.
M.O. Would it be right to say that in this chapter evil is dealt with summarily, whereas in chapter one it is more the saints having power to extricate themselves from it?
J.T. Quite. And then Peter speaks of sin, not apostasy but sin.
J.W.W. Would Noah stand out in the midst of these evil conditions; he was a preacher of righteousness?
J.T. More honoured than any of them you might say at that time, a preacher of righteousness.
J.T.Jr. Unestablished souls (see verse 14), that is those not founded in the truth, may be easily allured and upset.
J.T. Then this word, children of curse, is a terrible thing. Notice the strength of Peter's remarks here, "Children of curse; having left the straight way they have gone astray, having followed in the path of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the reward of unrighteousness; but had reproof of his own wickedness -- the
{378}
dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the folly of the prophet". These are remarkable words, I am struck with them and the power of Peter's speech here.
C.C.T. "These are springs without water". Just the opposite from what we understand as coming to us through the Spirit, there would be the flowing forth with freshness, but here it is springs without water. There is no freshness in the thought at all, is there?
J.T. Christians have water; that is what I pointed out this morning; we need water at these meetings.
C.C.T. That is right, the idea of springing up.
J.T. Springing up unto everlasting life.
{379}
WHERE TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER
@Matthew 18: 15 - 20
In selecting this scripture in Matthew I have in mind to treat of it according to its setting in the assembly gospel. Notice how the word *assembly* is used in the passage I read. It does not indicate *what* assembly, it is "the assembly", as if it were the only company in the universe called by that name. In truth, the word is unique. It is a word that has a great place in heaven, and, as we have indicated in this chapter, has a great place on earth. Matthew has in mind the heavens and the earth. They cannot be divorced; that is, they cannot be divorced morally.
It will be observed that we have the idea of "thy brother", not simply a brother, but *thy* brother. I am endeavouring to use words carefully and the brethren, I know, will be very sympathetic on these lines. So I refer to the expression "thy brother", and that, in effect, should affect every heart here, for it is not simply the word *brother*, but a Christian that is in mind. Therefore it might be a sister that would sin against another sister. The Lord selects His words in infinite wisdom. So the word is, "If thy brother sin against thee ..." It is not sinning against God, but "sin against thee". There again is a careful selection of words, for the word *brother* is prominent and the word *sin* is prominent and the word *thee* is prominent. Each of these words is brief but each is distinctive. The passage says, "Go, reprove him". It does not say write to him; it does not even say speak to him, but *reprove* him. Do not hesitate. When reproof is needed we are not to hesitate to extend it. But it is to be alone, "between thee and him alone".
The next thing I would stress is, "If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother". It is a great matter to gain a brother! "He that brings back a sinner
{380}
from the error of his way shall save a soul from death". Not simply a man, but a soul:,"... shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins". These are very important remarks in regard to assembly relations and services. I am keeping to the word *assembly*. I am using it now objectively. It is a matter of assembly relations and the question is whether I can gain my brother in these relations. "If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he do not hear thee, take with thee one or two besides". Notice that it is "one or two", not several -- one or two besides. These are to be most carefully chosen; this is phraseology which is most carefully selected by none less than the Lord Jesus Himself. It is in view of gaining a brother. It is the negative side: "If he do not hear thee". And then, "... take with thee one or two besides". Personality is in mind in all this, for it is "that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three". Now notice a further word that is to be stressed, and that is matter. It is "every matter". So that it is not this particular matter only, but a general idea that is being propounded -that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three.
Now the next thing to be noticed is, "If he will not listen to them", that is the two or three, "tell it to the assembly". The assembly is therefore an entity to be spoken to, and to be told, and to be complained to if it is a question of complaint. "Tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly ..." -- now listen to this word -- "let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer". The word *tax-gatherer* is to be noted. Tax-gathering was an employment that was belittled. It was a degraded employment. Therefore, when it says, "Let him be to thee as a ... tax-gatherer" it means that he is to be under reproach in your mind.
So I go on further in the chapter: "Verily I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in
{381}
heaven". Now you will remember what I said a few moments ago: that the heavens and the earth are not to be divorced; they are to be held together for assembly purposes. They are, in a sense divorced because of man's will, and there will presently be a new heaven and a new earth, but that is a different matter. This present earth and heaven are in mind here. So it says, "Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven".
Now the next thing is, "Again I say unto you, that if two of you ..." Now notice that this is another injunction entirely. It is another matter, different from the one with which we have been dealing. "Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens". Now notice that the matter comes from heaven. It is not from an angel; not simply from heaven, but from "my Father who is in the heavens". And it is not simply "from my Father" but "from my Father who is in the heavens". The Lord Jesus is speaking about two persons, but not simply two persons, but "two of you". I want you to notice that; the value of two such persons is in mind -- the relative value of two such persons. And I would point out that we have here an illustration of the word that "two are better than one ... and a threefold cord is not quickly broken". This statement is related to what I am speaking about. Here it is two of you; "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter". It happens on earth but it relates to heaven. It is just "two of you", and they are mentioned as agreeing on earth as touching any matter. "Whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens". This is what the Lord says, and I am urging it on the brethren because it relates to assembly relations. "It shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens".
{382}
Later it says, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name ..." You will notice, now, that it is "two or three". But I have been speaking of two, and I will just limit myself to that for a moment: "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them". Now notice that it is "to them" -- not to others, or simply that it will come to pass, but it will come to them "from my Father who is in the heavens". That is what the Lord Jesus says in this wonderful passage.
It is a real satisfaction to be here, I may say, without any other motive than to be simple. I have been here many times during the past fifty years, and the brethren have become endeared to me, and I am thankful to be amongst them again, but I do not know of anything that I should more like to bring to the brethren here than this very passage in @Matthew 18. This passage is basic as to assembly relations. I repeat that word, that the Lord was bringing in something basic in assembly relations. That is so important! And then He says, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name ..." Notice that it is *unto my name*, not simply gathered together, but "unto my name". And then, "... there am I in the midst of them". It is not only in the midst, but in the midst "of them". It is these particular persons -- two or three of them. It is the virtue that lies in the idea of two or three such persons. "Where two or three", and these are the words of Jesus, "are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".
Now I shall seek to analyse what I have in mind, for I want to enlarge on this phraseology which the Lord uses about two or three. "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". I have used the word virtue and it is a sort of principle entering into phraseology -- a principle that has power in it. There is power in the
{383}
principle of being gathered together; but not only gathered, gathered *together*. There is virtue from the Lord's own lips in that phraseology.
Now it may be that there are some here that are not breaking bread, or not in fellowship, as we say, and I would aim especially at them. Or if there are some who have not been long in fellowship, one would desire that all such might get the principle of this passage into their souls -- especially the young people. But I would not confine the word to the young people, I would not limit it. Quoting from the facts we have about the Lord's own life I would say that the age of twelve should govern, largely, the principle of persons coming into fellowship, taking their places in the fellowship of God's Son. We have the Lord's own example, that He was found in the midst of the doctors at the age of twelve, hearing them and asking them questions, and His mother rebuked Him. Reference to the mother of the Lord brings to mind what is being said of her by certain nominal Christians, that she has been exalted even bodily into heaven, which is falsehood. The devil is using it, and it is quite right to speak of it and to denounce it with all our strength. It is a terrible thing that has come into the profession at this time.
But I proceed to enlarge upon the phraseology in our scripture, and I want to say immediately that it has a great bearing on the present time amongst the brethren. Numbers are few, but the Lord brings them down to the very fewest number -- two or three. This phraseology bears on the whole position of the assembly at the present time. If you traversed the whole continent of America, the continent of Europe and the continent of Asia, this phraseology has to do with conditions everywhere in the assembly at the present time. But I am trying particularly to make much of the word 'together'. It is not simply gathered, but gathered *together*. And it bears on how we come into the assembly or place of meeting. I would say that we use the word
{384}
*meeting* far too much. We should use the expression 'gathered together' more frequently, and I trust that this will result from what I am saying, that the phraseology 'gathered together' should be used far more frequently among us in preference to using the word *meeting*. The idea of meeting is that *we* do it. The brethren meet, of course, but think of the virtue that there is in the idea of gathering together! I would urge very strongly that we want to take this on and see how we reach the idea of coming into the assembly, the place of gathering, the place in which we gather, where the assembly *gathers*: "Where two or three are gathered together". In gathering we are really touching the idea of the assembly, whether composed of two or three or more in any given place or locality.
I have in mind that when we disperse, if the Lord pleases, we should go to our localities carrying back in our minds the idea of gathering together. It is a heavenly thought come down to earth and it has peculiar virtue in it. The word *meeting* does not have the same virtue. It is a word that can be used, and is used by the Holy Spirit, for the saints shall meet the Lord in the air and go to heaven together. But gathering together is another idea. The words have great virtue in them because there is a point in the power of gathering together. Some indefinable thing happens when the actual gathering together of the saints takes place. There is something virtuous in it that does not attach to merely coming to a meeting place. So that I would emphasize again the thought of gathering together so that we might take with us from this meeting the thought of gathering together. It is a divine thought, but I think we will prove, as we apply it, that this great thought is recognizable amongst the brethren now. Years ago it was more so than it is now but I am seeking to mention it as I have done several times of late.
So I count upon God to help us as we separate after these meetings and go to our several localities, that we
{385}
carry with us this great idea that "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". It is not simply in the midst, but in the midst of *them*. It is the persons who gather thus, for the virtue is in persons - such persons - that is where the power is.
I will close now, but in doing so I would again stress what has been said about the Lord's phraseology so that we should have a fuller thought of virtue. The woman of @Proverbs 31 is spoken of as a virtuous woman. I use the word in that sense. There is virtue in what I am saying about the power of gathering together unto the Lord's name.
And so, dear brethren, I place the word on all our hearts as we separate from these meetings.
{386}
LIGHT
@James 1: 17; @John 12: 36
I have in mind to speak of light. These two scriptures treat of this subject; there are many others that treat of it too; indeed, in some sense we might speak of the measure of the use of a subject in scripture as an index of its value or importance. Scripture speaks much of light; it is one of the first things that scripture speaks of, as if God were to say, I am entering on a new series of operations and what I am about to do must be done in the light. Later on He is more explicit in saying He is Himself in the light. "God is light; and in him is no darkness at all" (@1 John 1: 5), and, "If we walk in the light as *he* is in the light, we have fellowship one with another" (@1 John 1: 7). So that we can see how God had this matter in His mind; and Paul says, "God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine ... has shone in our hearts", @2 Corinthians 4: 6. The apostle brings the matter into his own heart and the hearts of the saints; God has shone in them, a very searching matter as to whether we are inwardly illuminated, and whether, as illuminated ourselves, luminous, our bodies full of light.
So I began with the Father of lights; that is what we have in our verse in James. "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning". Now we have come to the turn of the year, you know, when kings go forth to battle. And we need not remind the brethren that it is battle time, and if we are not going forth we are hardly with the kings. So being the turn of the year it is battle time, but then it is gift time; that is a matter of importance, at least in the minds of many, the time of expectancy, in that sense, and it is well to be in accord with what is going. God crowns the year with His goodness, and so it is well to be in line. There is a gradual diminution of food and other supplies, as if God were telling us that man's devastations are to be
{387}
felt; that these wars cost something. And so there is lack of needful things and probably this will increase, so that the minds are turned in that way by circumstances, which is right -- not always right, but certainly circumstances do affect us and are intended to -- our minds turn to the matter of supply, a very important matter too. We are told and we have learnt by experience that God is pleased to supply His creatures, but perhaps we do not remember enough, perhaps not at all, many of us, that this matter of physical supply is dependent upon the place Christ has, and God has made dispositions in the physical world; He is over all, in all, and through all. But He is in the physical world too, and sustains it. He gives to all liberally and upbraideth not (@James 1:5 -- A.V.): He is very little thought of but still it is so. God knows no variableness; if He undertakes a matter such as the supply of the human race, He is not turned aside from what He set out to do. He says at the beginning, "Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest" -- notice, God has afforded the means of food in the harvest-seed time and harvest; they go together. God is saying that He is not niggardly in His arrangement or proposals. If He gives seed time, it is balanced with a harvest time, and even the seasons are balancing too -- "cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night" -- they are balanced. So that there is perfect balance in these matters. They seem to be just accidental matters, but God has brought them about and this time of the year He crowns the year with His goodness, and as things are beginning to be short, dear brethren, it is well to turn back and look about, rather, and see what is to be seen. It has often been said, 'If you have any difficulty in scriptural matters, you will always find the key'. If it is a difficult matter if it cannot be unlocked; if you know how to look around, you will find the key. You will find that God leaves the keys, in that sense, so they will be found. But we are to look for them. God has no interest, I might say, in
{388}
fools and disinterested people; people who do not have ears to hear what is happening and eyes to see. He looks for interested people. He will use them, too, and so to get things unlocked. If we are going about to find things that are needed we have to look. Sometimes men have skill for finding the water or anything else, finding water by certain instincts God gives them. God gives men instincts (I am speaking now of natural instincts) and He intends us to use them, these instincts.
I am speaking about food and about giving, but James says, "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning". So that if things are short, the thing is to turn to the right place, the source of supply, and God is that; God is that in everything. He is "rich towards all that call upon him", whatever the thing may be, so that I want to begin in that way, dear brethren, to impress all with the liberalness of the times. There is no stint with God; there is no stint at all, and therefore if there is a sense of need, it is the giving time, as I said; it is a giving time, and the word here is, "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning"; the word is 'come'; it comes; therefore it is a continuous matter. But God would say to us that we have something to do with it. He turns the rivers; He causes them to take certain courses. God has means of diverting or directing all other things, as is needful and as to this matter of giving; you will understand, although I am speaking in a certain hortatory way -- I always like to bring that in, to exhort -- but I am not on that tonight; I want to encourage the brethren with the things being given, and as we need, they are being given, because the word is "comes down". God has got them but they are coming. "Every good gift and every perfect gift" -- the brethren will just have to enquire as to the difference between a good gift and a perfect one, because we will never
{389}
arrive at the truth unless we think and understand; "the Lord will give thee understanding". But it is not only He gives us understanding; He opens our understanding. The Lord does that; He opens our understanding. To understand what? No question of being scientific men; God is not much interested in that, although of course we know well enough much is made of it. But God is not really interested in that; it is science, really, falsely so called. But God is ready to give understanding in all things and to cause us to understand the Scriptures. God is not concerned about everything we might be interested in; He is concerned from His own point of view, and He is concerned for us. He thinks for us; He calculates for us, and He wants us to be on that line, because it is the giving line, and He is without variableness or shadow of turning. And if there is any need with anybody then it is a question of getting into line with what is going on.
Now, as I was saying, He crowns the year with His goodness. That is a beautiful figure, but think what it means. Here we are in the midst of winter; this is New Year's Day, and, of course, the children think of the giving time, by the grandparents or whoever wants to give, they are willing to receive; they are not much concerned with giving themselves, but it is a giving time with God and with parents and with all alike. It is a giving time and God says, If you make the seasons so that they fit in, then I am with you. So it is that we have these meetings at this time; God did not ordain these holidays but still He says, If they are there I am with you because they afford you opportunity to be where I want you to be and I am with you. God is the giving God. I want everybody to take that in; of course, it is a simple matter, and it has been said millions of times. "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift", @2 Corinthians 9: 15. But then I am speaking too, not only of that, but of the coming down; it is coming down. And you want to be in line with that. If you are in an arid part of the earth
{390}
(there are many, where you hardly ever even get rain), you do not go there to look for rain; you go where it is. God intends us to be sensible; hence, if you want rain or if you have a crop or the like, the thing is to go where the rain is. And if you want to get things for your soul or your business or for your family, go where the things are given. Things are coming down; every good gift and every perfect gift is coming down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning. So that it is a question therefore of getting into line. Do not let anything interfere because if this matter is urgent then the thing is to go by the prescribed way to where the thing is being given. Hence when the gifts were given, for instance, it is said they had been given in a divine way. We do not get much of the idea of giving spiritual gifts in the Old Testament, not that they were not there, because prophets were given. But in the New Testament when the Lord Jesus became Man, this is the time to think of what is available. Heaven is going to be very liberal; it has got its Man, the Lord Jesus. When He was baptised, He looked up to heaven and saw the Spirit coming down. That is, the Lord was brought into that. Of course He was in it Himself, divinely, but He saw something; it was a coming down. The Spirit came down; the heavens were opened to Him, and the Spirit came down. Well, think of that! That was the giving time; the greatest suggestion is there, and then God is saying there that there is going to be an expansion of this, an enlargement of it. The Holy Spirit came down when John baptised the Lord Jesus; He saw the heavens opened to Him. I do not know that anyone else saw them, but He saw them; that is the point, and He saw the Spirit coming down as a dove, and it abode upon Him, and the Father's voice was heard; God is not seen -- not there, although the Father, Son and Spirit were there, as a matter of fact, but no one has seen God at any time, we are told. But God was here; He was heard, and the voice out of heaven says,
{391}
"This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", @Matthew 3: 17. It is not *all* My delight; but *My* delight, because, as I have already said, there was to be an expansion of the giving. The giving was of the greatest possible gift; it was the gift of the Spirit, for it was the Spirit, as for the Son Himself. And He saw everything, and then there was the word, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight".
Well, that happened then; that was, you might say, the great beginning of giving, which was extended some three years later; the heavens did not open at the day of Pentecost; they did not open there. There was a mighty breathing, we are told, on that day; the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing, it was running its course. God selected that particular day to amplify the thought of giving and there was a mighty breathing, a powerful breathing; you say the word 'wind' is used there, but really it is breathing, meaning that it is the outcoming of God, His outcomings. And then His incomings, that He was going to come in Himself to be with His people. I want you, dear brethren, to let these things in because I am speaking of the greatest things; they have often been spoken of before but in the constant speaking you get more and more; this is a great matter of the mighty breathing of God at that time, and the sound was heard. And it says it filled all the house where they were sitting, just as we are here now -- think of it. Suppose it happened now; it never happened before, but it happened that day in that city -- a mighty breathing from heaven, a sound out of heaven. You say, It is all imaginary. It is not imaginary; I am speaking of realities. Think of the happening, and the sound filling the house, the sound out of heaven. Who can describe that sound? Nobody, except those who heard, but the sound was heard; it filled all the house where they were sitting, as if God said, Be restful. God is very, very generous, and He is very considerate too. How thoughtful He is, each of us can look back on our history and see the
{392}
incidents in which the thoughtfulness of God has been displayed in our history. How thoughtful He is! And so they were sitting. You might say, Well, they should be in a reverential attitude. We should be reverential, but God is God, and He is love, and He is saying, Sit where you are. There is a time when you should bow down, of course, and worship; the proper word used for worship means it is toward God, a bowing down toward God. God is looking for that too, and He does not like it if you are sitting upright looking around the room when you should be worshipping God. He hates carelessness in His house. He looks for reverence in His house. But there is not a word about that at Pentecost; they were sitting; the house was filled and it was as if God said, Sit where you are; be still; it is a giving time, and a receiving time. It is a question of whether I am great enough to receive, to take care of, as it were, to consume what there is; what is given. And that was Pentecost.
Well, now, the point that I am stressing is that matter of the Father of lights, and this matter of giving, and this matter of receiving, so that the brethren may be impressed with the day we are in -- the day of Christianity. Now, it says, is the day; now is the well accepted time; now is the giving time. God so loved, you see; that is the idea; John is taken up particularly to stress that, and it is for us now, this very night, in this city, to see the wonderful position God has created. The Lord has gone up to heaven, and the Holy Spirit come down from heaven, and then it is a matter of receptiveness, receiving the power for everything in our souls. So this question of the Father of lights; it has to be stressed, what He is, in that way; that in giving, He has lights, so that if necessary the light can be turned on even more fully. You can see better. God is like that. We have great lights, and a great light, and a greater light; we are in the dispensation of the greatest light, and God is meaning amongst other things that we
{393}
might see the gifts He gives us, the wonderful gifts that are coming down. Because the word is active; the things are coming down; the Holy Spirit has come down; we can say that historically, He has been here all these years. But there are other things coming down, and I was already alluding to the idea of spiritual gifts -- how great the time of that was -- God selected it when the Lord Jesus had gone down to the lowest depths; "He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens", @Ephesians 4: 10. He descended into the very heart of the earth; the bars of the earth closed upon him (@Jonah 2: 6). But then the same One has gone up and He has gone beyond all the heavens and from thence is the giving. And beginning at the top, the greatest gift is the gift of apostleship; that gift has been here; I cannot say it is here now; I know it is not, but I am not sure there is not something very near it as regards the general position on earth. There are some apostles, some prophets. I have not a doubt but what there are prophets, and that gift has come from the uppermost point, the very top, as it were, to which the Lord Jesus has gone. So it comes to us, the greatest possible things come to us in that sense: "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning". As I said before, they are coming down, not apostles, but certainly prophets, certainly evangelists, certainly pastors and teachers, dear brethren. It is the receiving time, and God is looking for some kind of interest in what He is doing, that if there are gifts, if there are prophets, evangelists, they are not to be regarded as ordinary brethren. Do not misunderstand, dear brethren, but we are apt to be altogether too democratic in our minds. If God has given a gift from the top, through the Lord Jesus -- He received gifts in Man, and He has given -- He looks for some appreciation of them, some respect for them, some room being made for them.
{394}
Well now, I have to stop there and just say a few words more on the second scripture read. That is the question of sons of light, because what I have been saying is leading up to that time. I take home to myself what has been given, because as I said before, it is a continuous word, it is continuous gifts -- gifts are coming, coming, coming, coming. Get into the line of them, and be sure to appreciate them, and have respect for them, make room for them. The assembly is in mind, and the greatest thought, you might say, next to divine Persons, is the assembly. And sons of light are the ones that will rightly value this matter of the assembly, persons who are illuminated themselves, so much so that they are regarded as sons of light, grown up as the word is, developed in the thought, fully developed in it. So you look for the assembly. They did not in the middle ages; the Roman Catholic church prospered in the darkness -- that is where it prospers, where there is cold and darkness and damp. And so when Paul was on the ship, @Acts 27, it says neither sun nor stars appeared for many days -- not a word about the moon. It was as if nobody knew what the moon meant. There would be no use in talking in the middle ages about the assembly; it would not be understood. It awaited a certain given time, down the line, when God began to work again and the thought of the assembly became understandable. Now we must have three ideas of light. In the middle ages there were just two; they were the sun and the stars; they are alluded to, but in those many days there were neither sun nor stars, but there is no word about the moon, as if the people on the ship did not know about the moon. It was no subject of their knowledge, but the sun they understood: Christ in heaven, there was some light about that, and some light too in godly men, gifted men; they are the stars. Thank God for the Wesleys, so to speak, and the Whitfields, and hundreds of others down the line who are stars. He made the stars also; He does not make much of that although He
{395}
counts them and gives names to them all. One star differs from another in glory, and we fully recognize that that is our brethren who have gone away, have been here and ministered the gospel, and perhaps we have been converted through them. They did not give us the assembly, but we now have it. I want you to think of that, in what I am saying, that the assembly is here, not in heaven yet; the greatest thought outside of divine Persons is the assembly, and that came about at Pentecost, that great breathing. And then the tongues sat upon each of them; they did not get up, as if God would respect the brethren; He would say, You are in my mind, you see. They were in His mind in that sense, not as creatures then, but as persons who sit down and collaborate; that is the idea at Pentecost. There is to be an assembly; the word assembly acquired a new meaning I might say, at that time -- this great matter that God has effected by the coming in of the Spirit, and all the administrative powers and the works that marked the assembly and mark it still.
So, dear brethren, I want you young people to think of it, this great matter, as I called the third light, so to speak. The sun is Christ in heaven; the stars are the brethren, individual brothers, but the third great light is the assembly, the complement of Christ. He is head of His body, the assembly, "the fulness of him who fills all in all". I want you to get that into your souls. I am speaking about this giving matter and that then you might, in getting these things into your souls, begin to shine. Every face here should begin to shine as we take in these things, and that is while we have the light. The Lord says, "While ye have the light" -- the true light; there is only one; the light which sheds its light on every man. "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light". John hardly ever uses the word son, except in relation to the Lord Jesus Himself, but he does here. He uses "sons", and that means the brethren, and takes in all these things that
{396}
are set out so voluminously in John. You get a fine cluster of stars, so to speak, so "that ye may become sons of light". You may say, You are talking about the assembly, but we all know something about the cluster up in the heavens; well, there is light. It is a number of stars fixed so that they are luminous, sons of light. And so we get understanding from the heavens as to these matters, and God is telling us now that the time for light is now. I have been speaking about giving, but I have been speaking also about the time of light, about persons being luminous, not only being enlightened themselves, but as sons of light, enlightening others. The assembly is made to enlighten others, so in every matter we have to do with, whatever it be, whether the gospel or administration, or discipline or fellowship, the assembly is the thing; the great operational thought is the assembly, that God has that Himself; He has that available to Himself. He is working in it. Thus the building grows to a holy temple in the Lord. And so the assembly will be luminous as it comes down from God out of heaven. It is one of the things that is stressed about it. The light is most precious.
Well, I will just leave all these things, dear brethren, that we might go away with the thought of giving, and the thought of illumination and the thought of the Father, the unvariableness of the Father in His giving; how good He is! "Open thy mouth wide", He says, "and I will fill it". That is God! The cattle on a thousand hills are His, in a natural sense, but in a spiritual sense there is no limit at all, and the presence of the Spirit here is the proof that God has given to all men for He is a giving God, but He is unvariable in giving; He is on the giving line, and He wants us to be on that line, and on the line of receiving, to become wealthy and luminous. So God would send us away, as I said before and as I hope it will be, with some of these thoughts and with a sense of the giving of God -- how bountiful He is, and
{397}
how there is nothing to fear as we are dependent upon Him, even in physical things. "Ask, and it shall be given to you. Seek, and ye shall find", @Matthew 7: 7. May God bless the word.
{398}
THE COMPANY IN WHICH DIVINE IMPRESSIONS ARE TREASURED
@Acts 1: 12 - 14
What has been said in our hearing may well be made to culminate in these verses; that is why one has ventured to read them. We began with the abiding place of our Lord Jesus in our hymn, allusion being made to John's gospel, chapter 1, verse 18 -- "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father". That is, it is the place He has as Man; it is not who *was* in the bosom of the Father, but who *is*. And this passage in @Acts 1 contemplates where the apostles abide, contemplates the rendezvous, as one might call it, of those who were loyal to Christ. As we are loyal to Christ in gathering up what is presented to us in ministry, we shall feel the necessity of the right company, for persons are needed for the conservation of the truth, and this book brings in persons; not exactly as in John, where it is a question of family status, but persons qualified to act in an official way; that is, in the sense of appointment, as we have been hearing, of being trusted with the charge, and hence the instinct in those who were loyal in regard of that. They were loyal to Christ in regard of what is presented in ministry, presented to us in an objective sense; the instinct leads us, too, to those who are loyal and who are under the charge, who have accepted obligation as to what belongs to Christ. In the end of Luke it will be recalled how two heard much from His lips, a most wonderful exposition of truth; the Lord Himself, as risen from among the dead, began at Moses and all the prophets, and expounded to those two persons the things concerning Himself. The exposition did not lead them back to Jerusalem but it entered into their journey back, and what governed them in going back, what led them to go back, was the appearing, or the making Himself known to them, of the Lord Jesus; they returned
{399}
the same hour, and found the eleven. What they had, needed more guarding than they were capable of, and that may apply to any one of us; that what we have, as receiving the truth, requires more guarding than any one of us is capable of; it involves a sense of loyalty. And so they found the eleven; they were the bearers of the treasure. We have this treasure in earthen vessels; this treasure which robbers, so to speak, would value, and it has to be guarded. We see, for instance, in the history of Ezra how concerned he was about the treasure he carried back to Jerusalem. He was ashamed to ask the king for protection and yet he was conscious that he had something of value. And so they found the eleven; that is where the authority was -- those who represented the Lord. And here these disciples, we are told, "returned to Jerusalem from the mount called the mount of Olives". Objectively great things came before them; that is, the Lord was seen going up. Think of the impression on loyal hearts, seeing Him go up. "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven". What an impression! -- that must not be taken away from them; it is precious. Satan would be bent on robbing us of it, and of any impression which we receive, as I have been saying, in this way; two men in white clothing instructing them: "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven". What an impression on all that would be: two men in white clothing; the Lord going up, and the cloud receiving Him. Never did any, perhaps, carry such a treasure into that famous city as these. The two from Emmaus carried the treasure unto, I may say, the eleven themselves. The Lord led them as far as to Bethany when He arose; He went up from Bethany, and they went on to Jerusalem. They carried unspeakable treasure into the city. The eleven went into the temple and the two went and found the eleven, and now then,
{400}
we are told, in the verse I read, "They returned to Jerusalem from the mount called the mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's journey off. And when they were come into the city, they went up to the upper chamber"; that was the safe place to carry this treasure to; it was the divine treasury. That is really what is was, guarded divinely. These men were fitted, like the bars of the treasury, to shut out all attempts at robbery. These men -- their names are all given -- qualified, formed, educated persons; not only educated, but such fibre in them, such fibre as they possessed, to contend with the opposition of any attack on Christ, for it was a question of guarding all that pertained to that Person, who had gone up.
That is what I had before me, that we might have in mind the kind of persons we seek out, whether they are loyal to Christ and loyal to the truth; indeed, if we are loyal to Christ we will be loyal to the truth, and will be where it is guarded; it will not be guarded anywhere in Christendom, save where the Holy Spirit is, and those that are subject to Him. The fellowship is involved in this position.
And so, "when they were come into the city, they went up to the upper chamber where were staying ..." and then we have the names of the eleven apostles, every name meaning something spiritual, every name denoting the work of Christ, qualifying these men to be guardians of the truth. That is the first great point, that the truth should be guarded, and not let slip away, as in Jude later on, and mentioned here. He says, "I have been obliged to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints", @Jude 3. That is the sort of thing that is so essential, and dear brethren, it is to warn us and encourage us too as regards these precious things that come to our attention, that we might find the right company where these things are valued; where there is loyalty to Christ, and not be in other company, because it is as sure as possible,
{401}
if we get into company that is not loyal, that "evil communications corrupt good manners", @1 Corinthians 15: 33. We should be most zealous as to our companionship.
"They went up to the upper chamber ... These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren". There is no such company in the whole universe as this was then, and they have their counterpart in some little way now, at least; there is loyalty to Christ and loyalty to one another, for it is a question of that, closing the ranks, that the enemy may not get in and rob us of the precious things that the Lord has brought to us. They are to be held together in this way; all these men represent loyalty to Christ. They abode there, not only military men, but women too; especially Mary, the mother of Jesus; one who had treasure in her heart as no other person; she knew about the Lord in certain respects as no other person, and the enemy would rob us of that treasure Mary had; indeed, he has robbed us of Mary herself, as she has been made the subject of idolatry. We have been robbed of her in that sense; at least, many have been robbed of her. But we want to retain Mary in that sense in which I speak of her: one who had the greatest knowledge of Christ from His infancy on, and these impressions were to be treasured.
So should everyone who loves Christ retain the impressions, because they are common property; they belong to the assembly; they enrich the assembly, and it is incumbent upon us to treasure and care and value these things, and protect them.
{402}
THE LORD'S PREVAILING POWER
@Matthew 3: 13 - 15; @Acts 9: 10 - 17; @Acts 22: 17 - 21
I wish to speak about how the Lord prevails, universally, of course, but also in individual cases. I have selected these three instances; there are many others. It is His attitude to man constantly to bring us into accord with Himself, and in doing so to prevail over us, prevail over our arguments. It is said of Judah that he "prevailed among his brethren". It would be an allusion to his moral power and moral suasion amongst his brethren which came out in David and Solomon and other distinguished servants. The tribe was marked by prevailing power; Caleb had that power, and so had Solomon; all of them only reflected the prevailing power of Christ, and no one of us, I am sure, would wish, at least in principle, to be other than prevailed upon by Him, whether in general or in detail, whatever our arguments may be. And He goes to great pains to bring this about, as we get in other illustrations, as in Peter, whom He had trusted with the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, a very important trust, a trust that forbad any exercise of will, for if anyone who is commissioned of the Lord exercises his own will in any way he is sure to do damage. The more distinction he has, the more damage he is likely to do if he exercises his own will. So it was with Peter having the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; the Lord was concerned that he might use them in a dignified and effective way, and in order to ensure this the Lord had recourse to a vision. Peter was in the house of Simon, the tanner, a namesake of his own. He stayed there many days; it was by the sea. And while waiting for a meal, he became in an ecstasy, and the Spirit of God tells us, and Peter tells us so himself, that a sheet came down from heaven, bound by the four corners, containing the different creatures of the earth and the fowls of the heaven. There was a state in him
{403}
that had to be dealt with and that would forbid his using the keys, would forbid his execution of the mission entrusted to him, a most serious matter; if a mission is entrusted to any of us and we fail in it because of our own wills, it is a most serious matter, interfering with the Lord's operations. And so the word from heaven was, "Rise, Peter, slay and eat", @Acts 10: 13. He was in the house of the tanner, which implied slain animals, for a tanner has to use skins of animals. Peter had no difficulty as to the slaying of animals, but he had great difficulty about eating certain ones. And that was the point. A crisis had arisen in his service; he did not know it perhaps, but it was a crisis; a serious crisis had been reached in his history, in the history of God's service too, because it was a dispensational matter, namely, the opening of the door to the Gentiles, who were awaiting outside. It is a very fine thing when someone is waiting to be admitted, but it is a very sorrowful thing when someone is there to hinder the admission, and Peter was that one. So the Lord went to great pains to prevail and He prevailed. The voice responded, "What God has cleansed, do not *thou* make common". You are at variance with the mind of heaven -- a most terrible thing, and yet it applied to a great apostle, a great servant, but that servant was to be prevailed upon. The Lord is here tonight to prevail on some of us, on all of us; there may be something we have on our conscience, that is hindering us in the things of God; it is hindering us, and we are hindering others; it is a more terrible thing still, that we should be hindering others from entering. So here Peter succumbs to the prevailing power of Christ, the Lord. The Holy Spirit was there ready too, for the Spirit said to Peter, after the sheet had gone up to heaven for the last time, "Behold, three men seek thee" -- a remarkable thing -- already. And He says, 'You go with them; do not use your will or your prejudices; I have sent them, and I have sent you; I am sending you now'. That is a feature of the Acts that
{404}
the Holy Spirit is acting as a divine Person, acting administratively, of His own accord: "*I* have sent them".
I say all that to preface what I have to say, and I think you will see the weight of it, because I think nothing can be more serious than that I should have a different mind from heaven and that I should be holding to it, but it would prevail upon me in grace. That is what these three great illustrations of my subject would teach us. It is a prevailing time in grace; grace is reigning. It simply means the prevalent power of Christ at the right hand of God; the power He has to prevail in grace, not in persecution or penalty, not punitive, but prevalence in grace. "Grace might reign" -- one of the strongest terms we can get -- "through righteousness", @Romans 5: 21. That is what is in the hand of Christ, and the skill that He uses to make it available and effective.
Well now, my first example is John the baptist. He was carrying on a great work on the banks of the Jordan. One never refers to this service of John without a feeling of admiration for the servant, a young man, not more than between 30 and 35 at this time. He was slain when he was about 35, as I reckon, so that his example comes within the range of most of the brethren here, young men who are aspiring to serve. The service was bringing him into great prominence. The Lord had come all the way from Galilee to be baptised of John, not simply to be baptised with the others, but to be baptised of John -- what a distinction that was! He came all the way from Galilee. And it says here, "Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him". Evidently he had no curates to join in, to help him with the crowd. He was the one that was baptising -- heavy work. It was not sprinkling; clearly it was immersion, and in the Jordan. Large numbers of men and women came to him and challenged him, but I am not speaking of that now. But when the Lord came to him, it says, he forbad Him. Now, dear brethren, do not let us forbid the Lord. Do not let us forbid Him. John forbad Him.
{405}
The natural man would say, Well, he had a good reason; it was not pretension or pride. It was humility that led him. But there is no justification for forbidding Jesus at all, however right you may seem in doing it. Humility may be the outcome of pride. That humility is no good at all; a humility that would lead me to forbid Jesus is of no value at all. And yet we do it in our minds often. Some people say, I am not good enough to break bread, for instance; the brethren have been watching you and know you are the Lord's and know you have the Holy Spirit, but your humility is hindering you. It is of no value at all; it is sinful. The Lord has said, "This do", and you say, No. That will not do. You say it is humility, but it is not; it is sinfulness, to say, I will not do what You told me. You say that; you may not say it in words, but you may say it in effect, and things done in effect are pretty well equal to things done in action or otherwise.
So John forbad the Lord and he says to Him, "I have need to be baptised of thee; and comest *thou* to me?" Well, that was true; John did need to be baptised; that is true, but one truth cannot set another one aside. But the thing today is the prevalent power of Christ; that is entitled to prevalence; He is entitled to prevail. And what He is doing is wise. Why can He not have people to be humble? Can the Lord Jesus not have people to be humble? Can I forbid Him to be humble? He is humble; He has been baptised, and He did not need to be personally, but He is doing it for the sake of others, and it is remarkable, He says, "For thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". You are saying that you need to be baptised of Me, but I am saying that I have come to be baptised of you, and thus there is righteousness in that, and you, John, see it. And the Lord says, "For thus it becometh us", that is, John, it becomes you and it becomes Me. The Lord links us on with Himself in this great matter; it is to induce us, as it were, to fulfil all righteousness. Some of us are content with half or one-quarter, but the Lord says, It is *all* righteousness
{406}
and I will be with you in it, to make it a matter of principle to omit no matter of righteousness, and I will be with you in it. I have omitted no item of righteousness; it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness -- one of the greatest things there is -- to fulfil all righteousness. It takes up all our time. If I undertake to fulfil all righteousness, I will not have much time to spare; it comprises righteousness to my husband, righteousness to my wife, righteousness to my children, righteousness to my master, but above all righteousness toward God, toward Christ, toward the Holy Spirit, toward the brethren, toward the assembly, toward the government and a host of things. The Lord took up that matter; that was the attitude of His mind at the Jordan and it is beautiful to see that the Spirit of God said, "Then he suffers him". He is prevailed upon. Let nobody be out of this, bend yourself, give way to the prevailing power and wisdom in that prevalence of the Lord Jesus. It is the path of happiness; anything else is the path of will. John did not go very far; he soon succumbed. How can he be out of accord with the Lord Jesus? "Suffer it now", He says, "for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". The Lord has been in the thing; He says, I have been in it, fulfilling all righteousness; I am ready to be with you now; I will prevail upon you to continue no longer to exercise your own will; I will be with you in it.
And then to go on to Ananias, a well-known passage. It is remarkable the distinction he has in the scriptures, and it all stands connected with the great servant. He seems to be there for the sake of Saul of Tarsus. The Lord converted Ananias and gave him the Holy Spirit and we hear no more of him after his having had to do with Saul, having done a good work, that is much more than many have done who are just men like that. He had to do with Saul; the angel Gabriel would have been glad to do it; it would be an honour to do it, he had to do with persons of similar kind; Gabriel had to do with John the baptist's father and he had to tell him because
{407}
he could not prevail on him, "Behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak". I cite that as another illustration. But Ananias comes on the scene in connection with this great servant, and that is all we hear of him, although Paul speaks of him himself. But it is a great work to adjust another servant. If I am wilful, I cannot do this. I may have ability; I may have gift, but no opportunity comes unless I am subservient to the prevailing power of Jesus. I shall be of no use but a hindrance, and this challenges all of us here tonight. I am certain He has special work, special jobs for us, special services, but He determines that He must prevail over us if we are to be of any use. Ananias is in Damascus; it is said, "And there was a certain disciple in Damascus by name Ananias". He was there, and the Lord Jesus was there; He had been outside Damascus -- a remarkable thing, in the history of Paul. Damascus¬ distinction spiritually is in relation to Saul of Tarsus, and so is Ananias¬. The Lord has been outside the town; now He is in it. And Saul was outside the town, and now he is in it; he is in the town in a house of a man called Judas in a street called Straight. These are the three persons involved in this narrative. The Lord Jesus has part in this meeting this afternoon; others of us have part in it, too, some of us in a more distinctive way than others. But there are three persons here, and one of them the Lord Jesus, and this man called Judas. This matter is engaging all heaven; it is a great matter, and there is one man of the three (I am speaking of the Lord Jesus and Ananias and Saul -- Judas is just incidental; I am only speaking of these three; he only came into it in that it was his house. Thank God there was a house on that street called Straight in Damascus!) It is a great matter this that the Lord has in mind; it is a great matter in the Lord's mind. He came out, as it were, of heaven into this district because it was in His way. Think how He left heaven to come down into this matter; it is one of the most important
{408}
incidents you can get with regard to the service of God. He came down Himself - "Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?", @1 Corinthians 9: 1. That is a spiritual saying; he actually saw the Lord outside the town and now the Lord is hovering, as it were, graciously and holily to see this matter through, and He is doing this all the time, spiritually now, and if anyone is standing in the way, woe be to him! The Lord is saying, I must prevail in these things. It is said, as I said before, "Judah prevailed among his brethren, and of him was the prince", @1 Chronicles 5: 2. It is a prevailing kind of thing: of Judah was the chief ruler, the Lord Jesus. David is only a foreshadowing of the Lord Jesus; so is Solomon; the chief ruler is the Lord Jesus, and He is foreshadowed in this sense that He prevails among the brethren. Do not get in His way with your will. Woe be to you sooner or later, however pretentious, however apologetic you might be; however you might satisfy yourself that it is justified. Do not get in the way; He is going through.
He says to Ananias in the beginning, "Ananias". And he said, "Behold, here am I, Lord". Oh, you say, we are going to get good things; he calls Him Lord. That is, he means that the Lord must rule; he had been accustomed to speak to the Lord doubtless. Had he ever questioned what the Lord said before? I cannot say. Think of a man questioning what the Lord says, and as much as telling Him, I know better than You do. That is what it means, and that is what I say if I am standing in the Lord's way; you are saying, Well, so-and-so, and so-and-so -- see what they did to me? The Lord says, I know all that; I want you to succumb to Me; I am not asking any more than that. It is a remarkable piece this, a remarkable position, such a servant as Saul of Tarsus is in mind. So the Lord says to Ananias, "Rise up and go into the street which is called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas one by name Saul, he is of Tarsus; for, behold, he is praying". That is something, surely for him to take into his mind.
{409}
Well, you can picture to yourself this man. He knew about Saul, but he was not up to date in his knowledge, and it may be I am not up to date in my knowledge. Divine things go on by the minute, by the second; one of the greatest things happens in the twinkling of an eye, you know. Do not forget that. The Lord Jesus comes down from heaven; He will take us all up in a twinkling of an eye; at least, He will take us out of the graves, and change our bodies. The same thing is happening spiritually constantly, so you must not go by history, and say, I knew that brother; I know what he did, and all that sort of thing. Oh, you are not up to date; what happened last night; what happened today; what is happening now? Well, the Lord is up to date. He knew all about what had happened, what had gone on in Saul's soul; it happened outside the city, and Ananias was not there, and did not know anything about it, nor did it come into his mind that something might have happened that he did not know about. It did not come into his mind. Listen to his speech: "Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many" -- he says Lord again. As far as you can see he is a subject man, but our words are not always expressive of what is inward. He says, "Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man". Now, there is the Lord of glory, you see, by his side. The Lord of glory and He is telling this man to do something, and this man is saying, Lord I have heard so-and-so, and so-and-so, and so-and-so; he is setting the Lord aside. Did the Lord not hear? Doubtless, Ananias is a humble man, but think of the state of heart, in the presence of the Lord of glory, questioning Him. Did the Lord not hear? Did He not see? Did He not know what Saul of Tarsus had been doing? Well, this is what Ananias says, and he says further: "And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name". You do not know anything, Lord, about that. He calls Him 'Lord', remember. He is orthodox; he will tell you the Lord Jesus died on the
{410}
cross and was raised; He will tell you about His wonderful miracles; He has gone to heaven, but he is now speaking to Him, and he assumes to know better than the Lord. That is a fact; he goes over the history of this man Saul. Well, the Lord says, -- I want you to see the grace of the Lord in prevailing over him -- He says, "Go ..."; He does not rebuke him sharply; He does not ridicule him; He does not say, Ananias, do not I know? He does not say that; it is grace, the prevalence of grace. How can I stand up against it? How can I do anything but submit to it? It is the reign of grace. And this is what comes out here. He says, "Go, for this man is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel: for *I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name". You see that is all the Lord says. He might have said much more; He might have said, Ananias, it is perfectly absurd for you to take this attitude in My presence. He does not say that; nor does He say, I met him outside on the road here and converted him. He says what would affect Ananias; He conveys to Ananias, I am operating; I am carrying on the service of God. This man is now in My service. That is the greatest of services, that of the great Administrator; it is in the hands of the Lord Jesus. He says he is an elect vessel -- that would touch Ananias. It was intended to touch him. You say, You touch my conscience -- well, this is a great matter. He is an elect vessel; and the Lord goes on to tell Ananias that Saul is going to be taken up and that he is going to suffer. He says, "This man is ... to bear my name before both nations and kings". Note that he is "an elect vessel to me". It is a question of Ananias¬ affection for Christ, and no one can profess affection for Christ if he does not keep His commandments. Ananias is tested on those lines; it is a question of what the Lord is to Ananias. Do you really love Him? You know how the Lord appealed to Peter on these lines -- Do you love Me, Peter? The Lord would probe everyone of us. Do
{411}
you profess to love Me? Well, now, this is My elect vessel, My servant, My vessel -- not God's but Mine. Ananias is a disciple; you know the word 'disciple' has great force in the gospels and in the Acts, very little in the epistles, hardly any. This man is a disciple and the point of the appeal is that it is to a disciple; what do you think of your Master? You have learnt everything you know from Him; He has taught you everything you know. I want this vessel, and you are not in accord with My mind. So He says, "This man ... is to bear my name" -- what a thing that is; what an appeal to us. We love that name, the name of Jesus. He is to bear that name, and oh! what sufferings -- sufferings untold, bearing that name, not his own name, but that name, the name of Jesus. And He says, "To bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel: for *I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name". It is a question of what you think of Me, Ananias; do not talk to Me of anything else. What do you think of Jesus? What place has He got in your heart? How can you fail to acquiesce? How can you fail to submit to that Person, to be prevailed upon by Him? It is a question of "my name"; a "vessel to me" and the sufferings for that name: "*I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name". And then it says, "And Ananias went" -- it was the Lord's way; the Lord would place him in that way -- "and entered into the house; and laying his hands upon him he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me, Jesus that appeared to thee in the way in which thou camest". The Lord did not tell him that, so far as the scripture tells us, but the Lord must have said something to him about it. But Ananias put his hand in affection upon the great servant who had been portrayed before his eyes in the word of Jesus, and says, "Jesus that appeared to thee in the way in which thou camest, that thou mightest see, and be filled with the Holy Spirit". That is all. That is the message -- what an occasion! Visualize the two men; nothing is said about
{412}
Judas, or whether Judas entertained Ananias; it is Saul and Ananias. It is, "Saul, brother". His hand was laid upon him. Jesus made that hand affectionate; Jesus made that hand useful, to convey the message of affection to a brother. The very essence of Christianity is here in this, Ananias sitting down and saying, "That thou mightest see, and be filled with the Holy Spirit". That is the great thing. There is no Christianity without the Holy Spirit. You say, That is a very sweeping statement, but it is the truth. What about new birth? Well, new birth is not Christianity, not this; it came before Christianity, and goes on after it. It was the Holy Spirit that Saul needed. He got the touch of one who had the Holy Spirit, and he speaks of it.
Finally we come to Saul himself, as to how he was persuaded. In the verse I read, "And it came to pass when I had returned to Jerusalem, and as I was praying in the temple, that I became in ecstasy". You can see what Christianity was in those days. We have it in Peter. He was in an ecstasy in the house of Simon the tanner when the sheet came down, and now Paul is in ecstasy. It says, "I ... saw him saying to me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me". But Paul -- had he ever heard the story of Ananias? Did Ananias ever tell Paul the conversation he had with Jesus about him? Unquestionably. There cannot be a doubt that Ananias or someone else would have told him what the Lord had said to Ananias, and how He had prevailed upon him to go and visit Saul. And now here it is Saul himself, and he is ready with his arguments that he should not leave Jerusalem. Years afterwards he suffered on like lines; he would go up to Jerusalem. The Holy Spirit, he says, in every city testified to him what he should suffer at Jerusalem. So he went on, and he came to the house of Philip the evangelist and a prophet was there called Agabus; he took Paul's girdle, and he bound himself in the presence of Paul. He says, Paul, that is what will
{413}
happen to you in Jerusalem. Paul would go to Jerusalem; he was not to be persuaded, and he went to Jerusalem and he suffered at Jerusalem. He was imprisoned four years at least from that time; he was unable to visit the brethren for four years or more -- two years in Caesarea and two years in Rome. He was not prevailed upon; had he learnt from this incident perhaps he would have been saved from what I have spoken of. I am not here to say a word against the great servant Paul; it would be unseemly. But I am stating facts. He said to the Lord, "Lord, they themselves know that *I* was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those that believe on thee". That is just what Ananias said to the Lord; he had already said that Saul did these very things, and now Saul is saying the same to the Lord. He has an argument to prevent him from doing the will of God. These are most remarkable facts, dear brethren, and ought to appeal to everyone of us as to whether we are with the Lord -- whether He is prevailing, or whether I am prevailing, prevailing in my own will instead of His. Well, Paul went on to say further, "And when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by", as if the Lord did not know, as if the Lord looking down from heaven upon Stephen did not know; there was never such a delightful person under the Lord's hand as Stephen. Did the Lord not see Saul, the young man there? Of course He did. But Paul is speaking now as if the Lord did not know about this, and in order to persuade the Lord to let him stay at Jerusalem and maybe be killed. That is very likely what would have happened had he stayed in Jerusalem. He did not stay. And so he says, "He said to me, Go". He would not argue with him at all. And that is what He would say to anyone here who is holding on to his own will, his own way of looking at things, disregarding the Lord's will, the Lord's mind. He is seeking to persuade, to prevail with us; He prevails amongst the brethren. We should not be here today if He did not
{414}
prevail. So the Lord says, "Go, for *I* will send thee to the nations afar off". That was a touch that Paul could not but observe; the Lord says, I am going to make you a great minister, for that is what was implied. Had Saul clung to his own will and stayed at Jerusalem, could the Lord carry on His will? Saul would have been slain and the Lord would have been robbed of him. So he went and sure enough he was sent among the Gentiles, and from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, he fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ (@Romans 15: 19). Yet, Saul, if I were to speak to him (I hope I shall some day) I should say, If you had not bowed to the Lord's will that day in Jerusalem you would never have had that honour; you would probably have allowed the Lord to be robbed of you in Jerusalem. He would say, Yes, I know that. He knew that. The Lord said, "*I* will send thee", and he could not but admit that the Lord did.
Well, now, if you follow the next verse you see the force of what the Lord is saying to him, because as soon as he says that, it says, "And they heard him until this word, and lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a one as that from the earth". And that would have happened long before this if the Lord had not told him to depart. And now he is in the hands of the Jews in Jerusalem and is imprisoned for four years; I am saying all this to show the importance of allowing the Lord to have His way; letting Him have His way on the principle of grace. It is not on the principle of penalty, but in grace; He appeals to Paul -- I am sending you afar off, will you fail to serve me? Paul tells us afterwards how far he went to serve the Lord Jesus.
{415}
THE LORD AS OBJECT OF ATTRACTION
@John 12: 32 - 36
The Lord has been before us as led of the Spirit; He is an Example, as it is said, "led by the Spirit in the wilderness", @Luke 4: 1. The whole wilderness period would be characterised by the leading of the Spirit, not simply by being led *into* it. And this scripture being characteristically from the gospel of John, presents the Lord to us as an Object of attraction: the light and the judgment of the world and of the prince of it; and it seemed to me to be needful to bring it before us at this time, so that we might be stable, as having come out unto Christ. John's ministry is intended to stabilise us. "And I, if I be lifted up out of the earth", says the Lord, "will draw all to me". Obviously the "all" is to be understood in the context; those that may be called drawable; those that are not are exposed as not being the subject of the work of God. John would present Christ as a test in this way. The whole gospel stresses the personality of Christ, and this verse presents Him as attractive -- in an astronomical sense, in order to be understood. The attraction is irresistible, as referring to what is intended to be attracted. All else will be negative.
So that in the passage already quoted, chapter 6, there is a great drift away from Christ, largely because what He was teaching could not be received. "This word is hard; who can hear it?" (chapter 6: 60). The Lord is helping us, I believe, in the truth, the whole truth. This gospel enlarges on the truth - "Ye shall know the truth" (chapter 8: 32) -- not simply *truth*, but *the truth*, the whole matter; and again, John quotes the Lord as saying that the Comforter "when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth" (chapter 16: 13), not simply *all truth*, but *all the truth*; and remarkably, the Comforter is the "Spirit of truth".

And the Lord is saying to us that He is not mitigating the truth; he is not bringing it down or adding to it to meet our consciences or our standards.
"Who can hear it?". They complained in chapter 6 several times because of what He was saying. It was hard; they could not receive it. And so the drift began; the drift backwards -- a retrogression. Then many of His disciples, we are told, they were actually disciples of His, went away back at that time and walked no more with Him. They were turning back. Had you met any of those disciples on the way back, what would they have said? Well, they would not speak very respectfully of Him, I suppose. They might call Him Rabbi, but His saying cannot be received; it is too severe. And the Lord looked on those who were not going back, and that is the worthwhile side of it. There were those who were not going back, and we hope that we are all amongst them; we are not going back. There might be hard things said amongst us, difficult to understand. Even Peter speaks about Paul's ministry, and says of some things they "are hard to be understood" (@2 Peter 3: 16), but he did not complain of this; he complained of those who wrested the scriptures. It is what Paul is teaching in the scriptures. How do you read what Paul ministers? How do you read it? If you read it from the standpoint of current religious report you begin to speak disparagingly of even Paul. They did, you know; they did not read aright. Peter said it was hard to understand.
And so they did at Capernaum where the Lord was teaching; they went away back, many of them. You would say, Well, the fellowship has been broken up; maybe we are too severe. But the Lord does not indicate that in the least degree. He turns to those of His disciples who were not going back, and we are here tonight, I trust on those lines. We are not going back. Whither are we going? From whom are we going? From where are we going? Some years ago, a well-known
{417}
brother said to me, 'I will withdraw from fellowship' Only recently I had a letter from these parts of the city, from a certain person who said she and her children were 'withdrawing from fellowship' -- that is all. Well that is this: turning away back from Christ. No, they do not say that. That would be too glaring to say that. But that is what is meant, for what is the fellowship? If it is worthy of the name, it is the fellowship of God's Son; it is the fellowship of His death, and it is the fellowship of His Spirit. It refers to what is of Christ; am I going to leave that? Do I understand it? I am referring now to facts. Here the Lord turned to those who were not going back; He looked with pleasure upon them. One would look through the gospels and note the instances in which the Lord looked on His disciples. It would be very interesting. He was speaking, for instance, about a certain man -- "how difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!" @Mark 10: 23. "How difficultly" -- well, what do the disciples say? "And who can be saved?". That is what they were saying, commenting upon what the Lord had said. The Lord looked at them, looked at Peter, looked at John, looked at James, as much as to say, How were you saved? He looked at His disciples, and He says, With God these things are possible; the salvation of anybody is possible with God -- even yourself. You were hard to save -- God did it. And so in several other instances, the Lord looked at His disciples.
Now what pleasure He has in His disciples. They are not going away back, if they are worthy of the name of disciples; they have come out to Jesus. "What went ye out into the wilderness to see?" says the Lord, @Matthew 11: 7. What have you come to? Well, the fellowship if it is worthy of the name, involves the fellowship of God's Son, the fellowship of His death, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and are we going to leave that? Then we are apostates, if we are saying it with deliberateness. We may not mean that, but we are doing that.
{418}
That is the idea. So He turns to those who were not doing it, and says, "Will ye also go away?". Oh no! Peter says. Peter, on more than one occasion voiced the real thing, the real truth of the moment; it is a great matter to find one who can do that. He says, "Lord, to whom shall we go?" And he gives the reason for saying it -- "Thou hast words of life eternal". That is where we are -- are there any words of life eternal? Is there any spiritual ministry? Is the Holy Spirit at liberty amongst us? You cannot think of not staying there where that is. There are the words of life eternal. And it is not only that, but "we have believed and known" -- that is, he refers back to the experience that he has; that is the thing. What have I proved in that fellowship? Some of us here have been longer in it than others and have proved more, but Peter says, "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". Can I leave Him?
Well, that is all I had in mind, dear brethren, and this passage strikingly illustrates what I am saying. "I ... will draw all to me". If there is nothing in me that can be thus attracted, it is clearly evident that I am not a subject of the work of God; if I am at all a subject of the work of God I am smothering it up with my own will. And so the Spirit of God would have us to be under no misapprehension as to what the Lord meant in being lifted up. It means He was lifted up on a cross, to die; it was reproach. "This he said", it says, "signifying by what death he was about to die". There is no doubt about that; that is the crucified Jesus, the Object of attraction. John would say, He is worthy of all my mind and soul and strength. So that there will be no doubt left; in fact, one has noticed in John's gospel how things are made plain; for instance, if it says, Rabbi, John says that means Teacher, so that we are to be under no misapprehension, because we are apt to have wrong thoughts. So John would have us to understand the right thing. The bystanders say, "We have heard out
{419}
of the law that the Christ abides for ever; and how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up?". Had they read @Isaiah 53? Had they read that chapter, you might say, the greatest chapter in Isaiah? The greatest prophet speaks about the death of Jesus. They had not read that. I speak of that to show how easily our minds are just baffled, misled by current religious thoughts. So Jesus said unto them, "Yet a little while is the light amongst you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you". That is to say, I am going back into darkness if I leave, and not only so, but it goes on to tell us that He hid Himself. How sad, that now the Lord is fully shining upon us, and we turn our backs upon Him! The next thing is He hides Himself and we do not see Him at all. He said "Walk while ye have the light", and then hid Himself from them. That is one of the most solemn things you can get; the Lord not only hiding Himself, so as not to be apprehended, but from them. He hid Himself from them. Most solemn, that you do not see Him at all. Now it is clear sunshine, as it were; the light is shining. Walk in it, and ye will be sons of it. So that you illuminate what you come in contact with; otherwise He hides Himself. Going away He hides Himself from that. That is what I had in mind, perhaps fitting in with our current exercises.
