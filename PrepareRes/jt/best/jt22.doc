PRAYER: CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PERFECT MAN (1)
@Luke 3:21,22; @Luke 5:15 - 17
J.T. A line of thought came before my mind that may commend itself. The Lord is seen praying frequently throughout Luke's gospel, and in looking into the subject it occurred to me that these instances have a constructive bearing, not in regard to His Person, but in regard to the *example* He sets, and the results that accrue from prayer as seen in these various instances. The consideration would enable us to touch on certain features of Luke's gospel that I think would prove helpful.
In order that we may have the instances before us, the first is in chapter 3 -- His baptism, the second in chapter 5, the third in chapter 6, the fourth and fifth in chapter 9, the sixth in chapter 11, and the last in chapter 22. We may now take up chapters 3 and 5, and see how we get on.
I suppose we have all been struck with the place that prayer has in Luke. The Lord is seen engaged in it in Luke more than in any of the other evangelists, and the book of Acts shows how the example set by the Lord in Luke is taken up by those who followed, particularly in the great vessel through whom the light of the gospel came to us Gentiles. The Lord's commendation at his conversion was, "Behold he prayeth". @Acts 9:11. He said this to Ananias. In order to bring the great value of prayer more closely to ourselves, the great work at Philippi, inaugurating the work of God in Europe began in prayer. Paul and Silas and those with them arriving at Philippi are found in connection with a few who prayed by a river:
{2}
and later it says that as they went to prayer a damsel with a spirit of Python met them and would discredit what they were going on with by calling attention to them as "the servants of the most high God". @Acts 16:17. They were not engaged in that connection. They were about to introduce the gospel into Europe, and Satan would defeat this if possible. They are cast into prison, but are said to be engaged in prayer. Paul and Silas in praying praised God, and the prisoners heard them, and thus the work began. There can be no doubt that God intends to impress us all by that -- the need of prayer if the work is to be sustained -- if the testimony is to be sustained. So I thought if we looked at these two passages, perhaps the first would help us as to how the believer takes his place publicly with the people of God, because that is what we see here in @Luke 3 -- the entry, so to say, of one's way in connection with the testimony of God -- identification with His people. It says, "When all the people were baptised, it came to pass that Jesus also, being baptised". There is a word in it especially to young Christians, I believe, as to how they take up their place with the people of God.
E.B.McC. I think it is most important to see how the Lord sets the example as the dependent Man.
J.T. If one identifies himself with the people of God in this attitude he is not likely to be a public charge spiritually.
J.C.S. I think that is very good. The Lord Jesus here is introduced as the Pattern; and, as you said, the work with Paul and Silas was all the fruit of this Pattern.
J.T. We see how Paul became identified with the people of God. He was recommended to them as one who prays.
J.C.S. So that, as you say, the man who prays will not be a charge or grief to the brethren. He will be one who can contribute.
{3}
J.T. It is a very important point -- very remarkable and practical; because, as taking our place with the people of God, we are either going to be a liability or an asset; but one who comes in in this way will be a contributor, which every one of us should be.
Ques. Would prayer follow baptism as a consequence?
J.T. In baptism there is the renunciation of all you might rely on in the flesh, so that now you need God. You need God in this position.
E.B.McC. He leads in this way. Others were baptised, but it does not say they were praying.
J. T. He leads here. The Lord is leading the way for all who should follow in taking their place in relation to the people of God. This is the way to enter.
J.C.S. I think you said the other day that the Lord Jesus was prepared to wait until everyone else was baptised. Should that spirit mark one coming amongst the people of God?
J.T. I think so. All the people having been baptised, Jesus was baptised.
Rem. Baptism is a public thing. Not so prayer.
J.T. It is here. Later we shall find the Lord praying alone, and in secret, but here it is necessary that the brethren should know that you pray; otherwise they might think you are going to be a charge. Not that they might not take you on as a charge, because the people of God are wealthy, and they can carry one a long way; but those who come in and identify themselves publicly with the people of God ought to indicate at the outset their trust in God.
S.F. And in that way they would be recognised as additional support for the company.
R.McM. I suppose you would say it will soon be apparent to the brethren whether one prays or not.
J.T. No doubt. But you have the idea in Scripture of a good report. Timothy had the testimony of a good report among the brethren; and in speaking
{4}
to Ananias the Lord does not say of Saul, 'I appeared to him', but "behold he prayeth". @Acts 9:11. That is what the Lord refers to as a commendation for this young brother coming in.
Ques. Was it not important that those who were to bear testimony to the resurrection of Christ should be acquainted with the Lord as found in Luke?
J.T. That is where the assembling began. The nominee for the apostleship was to be one who had assembled with them during all the time the Lord Jesus went in and out among them, beginning with the baptism of John until He went up, so that one would have knowledge of this incident in assembling with the brethren at the outset.
J.C.S. So that the first incident would really show the impression they received when they heard Jesus praying at the beginning.
J.T. And a thought would come up into one's mind that He prayed. And as He prayed the heavens were opened. That is, we get the idea of the approval of heaven, which is another feature; for young believers, in taking their place with the people of God, should inquire, 'Is heaven satisfied?'
J.C.S. Heaven would not be really satisfied with other than a person who prays; that is, it is a praying person who draws out the approval of heaven.
S.F. Is one thought in connection with prayer, that we realise we have no resources in ourselves? Such a revolution has taken place in our souls that we turn to a divine source for supply.
J.T. You are qualifying for the assembly as you begin thus.
Heaven owns Him. There is a very distinct word in that. "Jesus, having been baptised, and praying ... the heaven was opened". Heaven was taking account of what was there -- what was coming out. It is not a question of God's knowledge of the Person
{5}
who was there, because that is ever true. It is heaven taking account of what was developed publicly.
Ques. I suppose we have to learn that we have entered into death by baptism, and all our spiritual resources come from heaven.
J.T. That is the thing, and as we recognise that we qualify for the assembly. We are learning to depend on heaven -- on God.
J.C.S. It is beautiful to think that such conditions existed here on earth in that Man that heaven opened and took account of those conditions, and endorsed everything that was found there.
J.T. Exactly. It is beautiful.
R.J.W. Is that why the voice in Luke is directly to the Lord Jesus? In Matthew it is more in reference to those surrounding Him.
J.T. Quite. In Mark it is also direct.
R.J.W. Luke's presentation suggests something most important in connection with prayer.
J.T. You see in a man like Apollos, who only had the light of John's baptism, how he is prepared for adjustment. Some are at a disadvantage through receiving only partial light at the outset; but, that being received rightly, it lays the basis for further light. It lays the basis for adjustment. Anyone who receives the gospel, even although it is presented partially or imperfectly, if he receives the element of light rightly, will be ready for adjustment later. We know that a very imperfect gospel is preached today abroad, but nevertheless there is light in it, and where that light is received honestly there is hope, because there is readiness for adjustment. If one is not ready for adjustment there is no hope of fitting him into the assembly. He might be an eloquent man like Apollos, and mighty in the Scriptures, but unless he is ready for adjustment he will never fit into the assembly. He may go abroad and preach, getting converts and renown, but he never
{6}
comes into the assembly as fitting into it practically. But you see with Apollos, he knew John's baptism -- "Knowing only the baptism of John", @Acts 18:25 it says. He knew that, and he is ready for adjustment, so that Aquila and Priscilla take him and show him "the way of God more exactly", @Acts 18:26. It is a great thing in taking one's place with the people of God, according to the light one has, to be ready for adjustment, because there is more light than one has, but if one has the thing honestly he is ready to be helped.
R.McM. There are those who have not much light, but if they are true to the light they have they will get more.
J.T. I think what is going on is of great service. Those who have the light of Christ and of the assembly are to help in adjusting others. The gospel is going *but*, though imperfectly. Nevertheless there is light in it, and the great service that is open to those who have light is adjusting others as they are ready for it.
C.H.H. That is where the value of prayer comes in, In depending on God you turn from the path of independence to the path of dependence, so that there is room for the adjustment you speak of.
J.T. The service of adjustment is within the range of sisters. Anyone may humbly help one like Apollos. It will be observed that both Aquila and Priscilla had part in the service rendered to him. It was no question of preaching, nor was it a question of teaching exactly, but of unfolding the way of God more exactly. One who is on the way can show it.
J.C.S. It is very encouraging that even where the light has been only partially received it has brought elements into the soul that make adjustment and construction possible.
J.T. I thought Apollos stands out as a model in that way.
{7}
J.C.S. So you would encourage us to be free and on the look out for such souls. Even sisters may help them.
J.T. Take one like Anna, the prophetess. She served God instantly night and day with fasting; but she also spoke of Christ to all those that looked for redemption. That is, wherever anyone was exercised she would speak to him, and did. That service is within the range of sisters. It can be done as Aquila and Priscilla did it. They did not say to Apollos publicly, 'What you are preaching is not exactly right'. "They took him unto them" @Acts 18:26; but they rendered a great service, not only to him, but to the whole assembly, because it says he contributed much to the brethren; and that is the idea -- one is to contribute to the brethren.
L.D.B. It says that Aquila and Priscilla, having *heard* Apollos, took him unto them. Doubtless they discerned that he had light from God.
E.B.McC. So we never know how far reaching our service may be. As you say, he contributed to the brethren. He was able to help the brethren after he had been helped himself. Would you say we always need to be ready to be adjusted?
J.T. I am sure that is so, and being ready to adjust others too.
M.P.M. The disciples felt their lack when they asked the Lord why they could not do as He had done. He said, "This kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting". @Matthew 17:21.
J.C.S. So it must be by prayer. Are we alive to the possibilities there are in our position? It is full of possibilities.
J.T. I thought the Lord might help us to see these possibilities in looking at this prayer in Luke.
Rem. Luke would encourage us greatly. He opens the gospel with people praying.
J.T. He opens the gospel with a man -- a priest.
{8}
and his wife of the daughters of Aaron -- who was devout, and walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless. He serves in the order of his course. He waited on his service, which was to offer incense. That is in connection with prayer. As he offered incense at the altar, the people were praying outside -- a very beautiful spectacle for heaven. It is very remarkable that Luke should begin in this way. Then an angel appears on the right side of the altar of incense and tells Zacharias that his supplications and intercessions had been heard. You see at the very outset of the gospel we are encouraged with the thought that we are heard. He evidently asked for a son; but then he begins to question in unbelief, and the angel says, "Thou shalt be dumb, ... until the day that these things shall be performed". @Luke 1:20. Thus while Zacharias is a remarkable example of prayer, yet he shows that in our prayers we may be unbelieving. It is not merely our prayers therefore; it is a question of the prayer of faith -- that we believe the Lord will give us what we ask for.
Rem. Cornelius is a beautiful example of that. It says, he "prayed to God alway", @Acts 10:20 and his prayers were heard.
J.T. I think he is a very remarkable example. He prayed and he gave alms, showing how genuinely he had been affected.
Rem. I suppose true prayer and conditions suitable for God to give light go together. Prayer would produce conditions in which God can work.
J.C.S. Cornelius would also be illustrative of what you said earlier: that one who prays is one who contributes.
Ques. Is he in the light of the assembly?
J.T. No, he is not in the light of the assembly yet. He is pious, but he has not the light of the gospel nor of the assembly yet; but he presents very beautifully what comes in through prayer. Then it says Peter
{9}
went up to the house-top to pray, and in his prayer he fell into an ecstasy, and saw a sheet coming down. There again you have heaven coming into view. The man of God is impressed, with the result that the Gentiles are happily brought in.
E.B.McC. That is very remarkable. You find these conditions there, and in Luke. Wonderful conditions they are.
J.T. Luke makes a point of that. God takes account of whatever may be of Himself, and enlarges on it.
C.H.H. Is it not a wonderful beginning with the Lord Jesus -- the beginning of His public testimony? It would indicate the gain for one who begins with prayer. He is a pleasure to heaven.
J.T. You may be sure that what heaven approves will soon be approved by the brethren.
G.R.G. Is prayer possible apart from the Spirit?
J.T. Well, you couldn't pray in the Holy Spirit unless you had the Holy Spirit. But I think the Scriptures show, as in the case of Cornelius, that one who has not the Spirit may pray and the prayer be heard. In @Luke 11 it is said that the heavenly Father gives His Spirit to those who ask Him.
Ques. I was wondering whether we should distinguish between prayer and "praying in the Holy Spirit".
J.T. I think we should. Many pray, and it cannot be said to be a prayer in the Holy Spirit, because one may not have the Spirit. Saul prayed before he received the Spirit; @Acts 9.
J.C.S. So a person might pray without the Holy Spirit and be very mixed, but what is of God will be taken account of by heaven.
J.T. The passage in Jude refers to the saints together. Of course we should all seek to pray in the Spirit. Inasmuch as we have the Spirit, we may pray in the Spirit, whether individually or collectively.
{10}
S.F. Still, it is encouraging to see heaven so attentive to a prayer like Cornelius's.
Rem. You would say that a praying brother or sister would be of great value to the assembly. I was thinking of Epaphras labouring fervently in prayer for the Colossians.
J.T. I do not know of any greater service, and it is within the range of all.
Ques. Would you say our prayer meeting is one of the most important meetings we have?
J.T. Yes. @Acts 16 shows that the introduction of the gospel into Europe began with a prayer meeting. There was a place there "where prayer was wont to be made". @Acts 16:13. Then again, "as we went to prayer". @Acts 16:16. They were to pray collectively. @Matthew 6 emphasises individual prayer: "Enter into thy chamber, and, having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret". @Matthew 6:6. No one can be rewarded openly -- for instance, be able to pray acceptably in the assembly -- unless he learns to pray to God in secret.
J.C.S. So that the Lord, in the second scripture we read, would be the Pattern. He withdrew into the wilderness.
J.T. Yes. That is what we all need to do. The next thing is, you begin to feel the great need there is, and you look abroad and see it. That is what comes out in the fifth chapter. The leper had been healed, and it says, "The report concerning him was spread abroad still more, and great crowds came together to hear, and to be healed from their infirmities. And he withdrew himself and was about in the desert places and praying", @Luke 5:15,16. The desert brings up another line. He is praying amongst the repentant remnant in the third chapter, after His baptism, and heaven opens to Him, and the Holy Spirit comes down. Heaven is restful there; but here He is in the presence of need. They come from all directions to be healed. How is this going to be
{11}
met? That is what comes up in the fifth chapter, so that the Lord sets us a pattern. He withdrew. The fact that the multitude is there and you are there is not enough. Of course fulness is always there in the Lord, but we are speaking now of the pattern He sets us. You have to go into the desert, where there is nothing for the flesh. A large congregation tends to minister to the flesh; and the platform tends to minister to the flesh. The desert is where we learn that the flesh is not respected at all. It says, the Lord withdrew Himself, and was without in the desert places and praying. They had come from all directions, and, instead of meeting the need, He withdrew into the desert. That is the experience that has to be gone through if we are to be effective. If the power of God is to be seen in us, we have to understand what it is to withdraw into the desert and pray.
Rem. So that one has constantly to be in the recognition that everything must come down.
J.C.S. The Lord Jesus is a Pattern of a heavenly and dependent Man in that connection, although, as you have already noted, while He was here as Man there was in Him fulness of power. He had taken the place of dependence here.
M.P.M. Would withdrawing into the desert be akin to the thought of fasting?
J.T. It shows you are determined not to feed the flesh, because a large congregation to minister to, for anyone who has ability to preach, is food for the flesh, and we have to be on our guard against it. The Lord had taken a place here in dependence, and He sets out the way of service. You must retire, so that the flesh may not be strengthened or ministered to.
R.J.W. The gain of it seems to be in that connection, because the report is spread abroad of His fame. He withdraws from all that.
{12}
J.T. He shows us how to avoid the snare of the devil through popularity or prominence.
A.H.R. Would what you are saying be anything like Philip? He was successful in his evangelistic work, but he is told to go down to the desert after one soul.
J.T. That is a good illustration of it.
J.C.S. Do you think that if we really laid hold of the spirit underlying all this it would draw us aside, and we would be with the Lord in all that was engaging us, so that we might have a right perspective?
J.T. Quite. The flesh is so insidious. It asserts itself on all occasions, and the Lord shows us here how we are to check it. It is not that there is any- thing of that in Him; it is that He graciously sets us an example. "*He* withdrew himself" -- the pronoun is emphatic in the New Translation.
J.C.S. Heaven must have looked on with peculiar delight, as it witnessed the Lord Jesus in these conditions, seeing Him alone there.
Ques. Was not this what God had been looking for from the outset?
J.T. It says, "I have found my delight". The word 'found' is to be noted.
D.B. When the Lord came out of the desert "the Lord's power was there to heal them".
J.T. "It came to pass on one of the days that he was teaching ... and the Lord's power was there to heal them" (verse 17). The "Lord" there is Jehovah.
L.D.B. The thought of healing is very touching.
Ques. Would the Pharisees and doctors of the law illustrate the flesh -- its ability, etc.?
J.T. What could put all that in its place save the power of God? Get all the education -- the theological training that the seminaries are able to afford -- and set that down alongside the power of God, and where is it? It is put into the shade. The power of God cannot be gainsaid, and it comes in through prayer.
{13}
Take a man the Lord intends to use. At this time He had just revealed Himself to Peter. Peter, James and John were just fishermen. What were they against these doctors of the law and Pharisees? What were they according to the ordinary estimate of religious leaders of the world? They were nothing. But they were to have the power of God, which these leaders had not. The power of God was to come in, and it comes in through prayer.
J.C.S. So that a man who goes into the desert and prays learns how the Lord did things. That would be effective in the assembly and in public testimony.
R.J.W. When the Lord comes back to the need He knows how to meet it, as having been with God.
J.T. He meets it, too, in men who had repute. We have to face this, that need exists in the world, even in these doctors of the law and Pharisees. Not only were they unable to do anything, but they themselves needed help. Well, how are we to meet these circumstances save as we turn to God in prayer? We may say we are on the right ground and have the truth; but that is not enough. The power of God is needed, and where it exists it cannot be gainsaid. The power of the Lord was there to heal them. It does not say they were healed by it, but it was there, and it was there through prayer.
S.F. So that having the power present is greater than the effects of the power. There will be no effect without the power.
A.H.R. Have you any thought as to the difference between the two companies, one in the 15th verse and the other in the 17th? They are two different companies.
J.T. The company in verse 17 is brought in as a test. Unless you have the power of God you come into ridicule. As to the company of verse 17 it says, "There were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by".
{14}
They would take notice, and, you may depend, would not be slow to criticise, so that what we need is prayer to meet all this. The power of God cannot be gainsaid.
G.R.G. It says, "the power of the Lord was present to heal them". Would it magnify Christ?
J.T. It did. The grace of God is here for all men, and the doctors of the law were men, the same as others; that is the attitude to maintain. The heart of God is towards the religious dignitaries of Christendom as well as towards the common people.
Ques. Would you say power is available for every one of us?
J.T. It is. I think that is what we ought to see.
A.R.G. Do you attach importance to the conditions as well as the prayer?
J.T. Yes. Here it is "in the desert places". The flesh in us is averse to going there.
J.C.S. So that a man who prays loses confidence in himself and in everything outside of God.
J.T. I suppose that every seminary in the world makes provision for the flesh. Now the desert is the opposite of that -- it makes no provision for the flesh. Religious training that makes provision for the flesh is the opposite of what we have here.
Ques. Would not the result of this be really to humble one and magnify God?
J.T. That is the thought -- it brings the flesh to nothing.
Ques. A man of this kind would have power with God and men.
J.T. He would. In coming in from the desert to preach you have learned the worthlessness of the flesh. You do not commend the flesh -- you do not appeal to it; it is no better in you than in anyone else. One who has learned to disallow the flesh in himself will not appeal to the flesh in other people; he will not say anything to influence the flesh.
{15}
A.H.R. I was wondering whether He withdrew Himself from the first company so as pot to be made anything of, and the second was His test as to site.
J.T. I think that is right. These Pharisees and doctors of the law represent the religious power of Jerusalem. Still, the power of God was there even for them.
W.J.P. Would you say if we accept popularity there is no power?
J.T. We have seen it at times -- one accepting popularity with the result that there was no power.
Rem. In connection with the gatherings, sometimes we have occasion to be very concerned about a certain trouble, it may be a brother taking part when he should not. In prayer we have an effectual remedy, for the removal of that; but we so often lose sight of the true remedy for the removal of many things, and we take our own way to remove them, and this only makes the trouble worse.
J.T. Instead of bringing God in. It says, "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens", @Matthew 18:19. Any local difficulty arising can be most effectually met thus, if there are even two that are of the assembly and they agree.
Ques. Would this incident expose to us the impossibility of fleshly ability meeting need? In the presence of the need the doctors were sitting by, and there was inability to meet it in any wise. The Lord alone can do that.
J.T. I thought verse 15 is, as has been remarked, the result of one's fame going abroad. Then the people begin to come to hear Him. The flesh in us would take advantage of that. The Lord withdraws; and then it is on one of the days after that, meaning that the Lord did not fix the day. It was as if any time you came to Him the power would be there. It
{16}
was not a fixed meeting like this we are at now, but "one of the days" -- any of them, so to speak. It is quite right we should pray and prepare for special occasions, but the thing is to be in the power at *all* times.
J.C.S. So the Lord Jesus was really characterised by prayer and power.
J.T. On any day you met Him the power would be there.
J.C.S. I think that is where perhaps we are so deficient; we are not always equal to the occasion.
J.T. We prepare ourselves for special occasions, which is right truly; but how am I on my ordinary days, when there is nothing special on hand?
J.C.S. It seems to me there is great encouragement in all this. It brings something within the reach of the youngest person, and one sees wonderful possibilities wrapped up in it if we are prepared to follow the pattern.
Ques. Do you suggest that the doctors of the law were delivered from the theological line and brought into dependence on God?
J.T. I do not think you can go that far. They were there: it does not say they were healed. The fact that they were doctors of the law would show that there was an element there that would be a test. If you got the Archbishop here and the leading clerics of the city, whatever motive underlay their coming, they would be a test to you. But the power of God cannot be gainsaid, whatever their reputation for learning might be.
Ques. Would you say the Jewish leaders missed their opportunity?
J.T. No doubt they did; but in the next verse we get "men bringing upon a couch a man who was paralysed", and they set the couch before Him. This man is going to get the blessing. It does not say the others did. There is one man going to receive the
{17}
blessing; that is, you have men exercised about one. They are carrying him; they are concerned about his state, and he receives the blessing. The Lord says, "But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralysed man, I say to thee, Arise, take up thy little couch and go to thine house. And immediately standing up before them, having taken up that whereon he was laid, he departed to his house, glorifying God". That man got it; he was borne in by others, and he is sent to his own house carrying his bed.
M.P.M. Their faith and prayer were owned by the Lord.
J.T. Quite.
Ques. Do you think there is to be movement on the Lord's side in view of bringing this in at the present moment?
J.T. Well, I thought He would move in that way. The service of prayer is really as effective as any service available, and it is within the reach of all.
{18}
PRAYER: CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PERFECT MAN (2)
@Luke 6:12 - 18; @Luke 9:1 - 20
J.T. What came before us in chapter 5 may be connected with the exercises of the individual, who sees the need that exists, and learns that the flesh profits nothing in meeting it, so that he turns to God and finds the power of God available. But then it needs more than one. No true lover of the Lord Jesus wishes to arrogate to himself all the service, either locally or generally. He sees that the service involves variety, so I think the Lord, in chapter 6, brings before us this feature -- that you look for others to be used. You see the need is so extensive that it requires more than one. Hence the Lord's extended prayer, as it says, "all night". He went out into the mountain to pray, and he spent the night in prayer to God, and "when it was day he called unto him his disciples, and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles". Elsewhere he enjoins that they were to pray the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers, because the need was so great; and I believe the Lord would, at the present time, lay it upon us that the need is great, and that labourers should be sent out. It is the Lord who sends them out, of course; but He would send them out in answer to our desires.
E.B.McC. In connection with the chapter this morning you were pointing out that the scribes and teachers of the law were with the Lord, and the power was there to heal them. I suppose they would set forth man characterised by the flesh endeavouring to carry on the service of God. Now He spends all night in prayer in order that He might send out whom He would.
J.T. The miracle in the synagogue preceding this
{19}
prepares the way for it. "There was a man there", it says, "and his right hand was withered". @Luke 6:6. However much intelligence one may have, if his right hand is withered he can do nothing. The right hand denotes a man's ability or power, so that it would suggest what there is in the synagogue -- what there is in the religious world. As it says, "Looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so; and his hand was restored whole as the other", (@Luke 6:10). There you have the preparation for the prayer; one's right hand restored indicates his ability for service. There may be many who have ability for service -- the Lord has given it to them; but the next thing is that He should dispose of that.
J.C.S. Do you think the disciples who had been with Him up to this time had had, so to speak, their right hands restored? That is, their hands were really being prepared in view of service, and now the Lord spends a whole night in prayer to God in view of that selection.
J.T. That is it. There are many who have ability, but the next thing is they should come under the Lord's direction.
Rem. Would you say that such conditions can be met only by prayer -- "He continued all night in prayer"?
J.T. We shall be in each other's way, unless we come under the Lord's direction.
E.B.McC. The hand would then be at the Lord's disposal.
J.T. That is it. All your power or ability for service is held now for the Lord, and He disposes of it; otherwise we shall be in each other's way. He makes the selection.
J.C.S. So that the Lord in that way recognises the existing ability.
J.T. He recognises the ability that there is. It is
{20}
seen here in the man's withered hand being restored. It is to be used, but then how used? Therefore it says, "God has set certain in the assembly". @1 Corinthians 12:28. *God* has done it. We have to look to the Lord for the disposal of the ability there is, that it should be used to the best possible advantage. It can be used thus only as He disposes of it. The matter was so serious that He spent all night in prayer. This is the only instance in which we have the Lord spending all night in prayer. It says, "He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God". We have often spoken of long prayers as inimical to liberty in the assembly. I believe they should be short in the assembly, but this passage shows you can make them as long as a whole night *individually*. No one could spend his nights to better advantage, especially if sleepless nights, than in prayer.
S.F. I would suggest, too, that this dispensation should be marked by prayer; it is the dispensation of God, which is in faith, and so prayer should be constantly going up to God, showing dependence upon Him.
J.T. I think that is what is emphasised in Luke.
J.C.S. One is impressed with the way in which the Lord Jesus depends absolutely on heaven in connection with. His selection. That is -- one hardly likes to say it -- but it almost suggests that He wants to trust entirely to heaven for the selection.
J.T. You may be assured that it is set down here not only to show how entirely dependent He was, but that *we* should be dependent. It is all very well to say that such a brother has gift, and preaches beautifully, but you want to see him disposed of so that he is available to the best advantage to the saints. He has to come under the Lord's direction if he is to continue to be profitable, and hence we must bring him to the Lord.
{21}
Rem. Would you say continuing all night in prayer to God involves a knowledge of God? I think of how little some of us can sustain prayer in that way.
J.T. We lack an extended view. Our outlook is very narrow. As we think of the Lord's service the whole field should be before us. It says, He bought the field; and He has a right-of-way in it in that He has bought it. So that the whole field is before one if interested in this way, and you can easily spend a night, if you are disposed to, in going over the field, touching on the different points in which active work is proceeding.
Rem. I thought if we knew more of priesthood we should be able to pray more in the way that is true of the priest; he had the saints on his heart. Perhaps it would depend on how much we have the saints on our hearts. I had in mind to refer to the thought of the right hand in Ecclesiastes. It says, "A wise man's heart is at his right hand". @Ecclesiastes 10:2.
J.T. This gospel has priesthood in view.
Ques. Is there another thought connected with the mountain? Would that give a good view of the field?
J.T. You are withdrawn from the influences of the plain; but it is in view of coming back into the plain, as the passage states. If you are to be with God you must be withdrawn from the influence of the plain. Moses was with Jehovah on the mountain, Aaron was with the people. Hence the great difference between them. Aaron was employed by the people in making an idol; whereas Moses, as with God, was able to come in and destroy the idol, and make the people drink of the water.
M.P.M. It states later, "having descended with them he stood on a level place" (verse 17); that would be the contrast.
J.C.S. You were speaking of the vastness of the field, and how the Lord would enlist our interests in it, that we might pray sympathetically and intelligently
{22}
in regard to all that He has under His eye to do. Thus, as you say, we would bring the servants to the Lord for the disposal of them; and if He disposes of them there will be no overlapping.
Ques. How do we bring them? Is it assemblies that bring them, or those who are exercised?
J.T. We all should be concerned, and so we shall pray individually and collectively.
E.B.McC. Do you think the prayer that the Lord may send forth labourers into the harvest always holds good?
J.T. I am sure it does; and I think the Lord would impress it upon us now. The need is great.
R.J.W. Is it not interesting that in the next chapter He sends out the very ones whose hearts He set in the line of prayer? He works through their hearts.
J.T. You see Saul; he corresponds with chapter 3, as we had it this morning, as becoming identified with the people of God; he is praying. But then, as with the disciples in Damascus, he begins to preach. There is nothing about a commission as yet. I mean, there is nothing said as to his being told to preach in Damascus, but he did preach. In this way he corresponds to chapter 5. He sees the need, and, as he tells us later, he went into Arabia. Arabia would correspond with the desert in @Luke 5. The desert was the place for the practical annulment of the flesh in him. We find he is sought out by Barnabas, who saw the need. He was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit. He represents one who would unjealously think of the needs of the saints, and that they should be met by others as well as by himself. So, knowing of the conditions at Antioch, he goes and seeks out Saul. Doubtless he had prayed about it; he brings him to Antioch, as if he felt that he was a brother who would be used at Antioch. He and Saul laboured together at Antioch for a year, and yet there is no
{23}
commission. Barnabas sees the need, and he gets Saul. Then the call comes: "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them", @Acts 13:2. I believe that as we look around and see the ability there is, and bring it to the Lord, we shall have a disposition of it such as will be effective in the maintenance of the ministry and in meeting the need of the saints.
Ques. Do you make a difference between the call of the servants and sending them forth by the Spirit as in @Acts 13?
J.T. Yes. The call in the apostle's case was earlier; he had to wait for his direct commission.
E.B.McC. Your thought is that Barnabas recognises the ability that was with Saul -- that he had been prepared for the service?
J.T. I think he corresponds with the man whose right hand is healed. Now he is available for the disposition of the Lord or of the Spirit.
Ques. Do you think the synagogue is purely local, whereas the Lord has the world before Him? Saul preached in the synagogues.
J.T. That is good, because levitical service is never restricted to a locality. The Levites were round about the tabernacle. The other tribes had special locations allotted to them at a distance -- east, west, north and south, but the Levites were round about the tabernacle. Their service is general -- it is universal.
J.R. Do you suggest that the multitude come into blessing on account of the Lord spending all night in prayer, and afterwards calling to Himself His disciples whom He names apostles?
J.T. Quite. You see, He calls them out according to the wisdom that would flow from prayer. Of course He was Himself Wisdom, but here He is dependent, and He is a pattern. He is praying to God all night, and so He names them, as it says,
{24}
"When it was day he called his disciples, and having chosen out twelve from them, whom also he named apostles". He names them in the order in which He intended them to serve. Peter comes first; that is a question of choice.
L.D.B. If things are held by one person only -- one servant -- they remain within restricted limits, whereas the number is increased here to twelve -- the sphere of divine operations is extended.
J.T. That is what comes out. Then He comes down with them. It says, "having descended with them, He stood on a level place". Now He has, so to say, twelve right hands under His own direction, and then He comes down with them to the level place. They are safe, as coming down to the level place as appointed, and thus accompanied by the Lord.
J.C.S. So you think the Lord indicates here, in the order of the names, that He is arranging their service. They are to serve in that connection; that is, it is not left for them to arrange for themselves.
J.T. I think He has indicated their work in the order of the names. In Luke it appears the reading should be as it is in the Authorised Version, the conjunction between each name. They are not set out in twos, as in Matthew.
L.D.B. What is the thought in that, that they are severally mentioned?
J.T. I think it is that each one is to take up his own service in relation to the Lord.
E.B.McC. These were men of ability for service.
J.T. Quite. Luke has in mind the whole dispensation under Paul's ministry, and the suggestion is that those who serve are selected severally. I receive my work from the Lord directly, and carry it out without consulting another. Of course we are not to be independent of each other.
J.C.S. That is, to your own master you stand or fall; that is the principle.
{25}
J.T. Yes.
M.P.M. Service is thus individual, but not independent.
J.T. No, not independent; but each has to get his direction from the Lord, and carry it out.
J.C.S. So that the Lord did not allow Peter to interfere with what John was doing, as you pointed out.
J.T. That helps. "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me". @John 21:22: Peter had his work laid out for him, and it was for him to do it. The Lord had His reserve in John, and He would maintain the secret.
L.D.B. I suppose our prayers should be in accord with what the Lord has done. In praying for the Lord's servants one would pray that what He has given to His servants might be developed; that each might correspond with the name that has been given to him.
J.C.S. I suppose there was development in the twelve. The Lord names each one, as you have remarked elsewhere, but development has taken place morally before it is officially recognised.
J.T. Yes; the withered hand restored points to the ability for service which they had.
J.C.S. I think you wanted to call our attention to the fact that it is open to us individually to take these matters up with God in prayer so that the whole field of His operations might be of interest to us, that we might pray to the Lord for an increase on these lines.
J.T. That is what comes out in this chapter, and it should enter into our prayer meetings as well as our individual prayers, because the field is one. In moving about one hears prayers, and one notices the limitations that appear. How narrow our field often is! Of course it is right that we should pray for our immediate locality, but a priest has all on his heart.
{26}
The High Priest had the names of all, and Aaron's sons would obviously have the opportunity of reading the breastplate as they were with their father. So the nearer we are to the Lord the wider will be our view of the field. He would bring the whole field before us. One would be as much concerned about South Africa as he would be about New Zealand, because it is all the Lord's field. The saints are all alike in that they are all in the breastplate, and every son of Aaron would be concerned as to all the tribes. It is very interesting to see that in the book of Judges, in the darkest period, when Benjamin was about to be almost wiped out, it is said that Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, was priest, and stood before the ark in those days. What an immense advantage it was for Israel to have a priest like that. At that time, in the darkest day, he would be greatly concerned about Benjamin, for his name was in the breastplate. It had its place as much as Reuben's or Ephraim's. So that the more we understand priesthood the more we should be in prayer for the whole field of the Lord's interest.
S.F. As you have remarked, through the death of Christ He has made a right-of-way into every part. So that where there is just a little garden, or cluster of saints, that locality is of personal interest to Christ.
J.T. That is what I was thinking; and how easily one may be of service. After the assemblies had been formed, Paul proposed to Barnabas to visit the cities where they had preached the word to see the brethren -- to see how they had got on. He and Silas went and visited their brethren, but there is nothing said about teaching or preaching; there is nothing said about the exercise of gift at all in that journey. It was a question of seeing their countenances. "Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend". @Proverbs 27:17. Hence the visit of a spiritual brother or sister to a locality has an effect,
{27}
and the service is brought within the range of all. There is not a word said of the exercise of gift in the missionary journey of Paul with Silas until new ground was reached at Philippi. It was more that Paul's presence amongst them encouraged them. It says, "The assemblies, therefore, were confirmed in the faith, and increased in number every day", @Acts 16:5.
S.F. When the Lord Jesus moved in and out among His disciples He would leave a deep impression on them, even apart from His words.
Ques. You drew our attention to verse 17 (@Luke 6): "Having descended with them, he stood on a level place". Could you help us a little on that?
J.T. The "level place" means that in carrying the glad tidings to men you would get down to where they are. Paul says, "To all I have become all things". @1 Corinthians 9:22. In order to reach souls we have to get to where they are.
E.B.McC. Giving the apostles names was His sovereign choice, but now He could come down with them to the level where men are.
J. T. And He can identify Himself with them now before men. They are His qualified representatives.
J.C.S. Do you think He is, in principle, doing now to them what heaven had recently done in regard to Himself?
J.T. Just so; and it raises the question whether the Lord can really be with me in my service here. "He came down *with* them". Can the Lord stand beside me in my service? If He cannot, there is something that is inconsistent with Him.
E.B.McC. It takes some of us so long to be healed. We are not qualified for service.
J.T. And many of us are mixed up with associations the Lord cannot approve of; thus He cannot be with us; He cannot identify Himself with us save
{28}
as we are in correspondence with Him in our principles and ways.
J.R.F. Before entering on the level place with Him we must be on the mountain with Him, and then we can maintain what is suitable to the levitical position on the level place.
J.T. So coming down is the idea in the gospel.
J.R. In connection with your thought about where men are -- do not the multitude come under His influence?
J.T. Quite. You see how it was carried out in Paul, in coming into Antioch of Pisidia, for example. He entered into the synagogue and *sat down*. He was, as it were, a Jew in the synagogue, but Christ was in his heart. Think of what was in that man's heart as he sat there, ostensibly an ordinary Jew! Presently they invite him to speak. He acts wisely. He, as it were, was on the plain; and now he is invited to speak, and he speaks the word. When he came to Thessalonica, he entered in *among them* as if he were one of them, and for three Sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the Scriptures. We learn from these things how to carry on service for the Lord.
R. T. What was your thought in Paul and Silas visiting the saints; was it on the line of house to house?
J.T. No doubt they would go from house to house. They visited the cities where assemblies had been formed.
J.C.S. Paul knew well how to take these things up. No matter what the circumstances were, he knew how to adapt himself to them in divine power.
J.T. So at Athens he goes about the city and takes note of things, and he saw their shrines. In order to serve God among men we have to take account of what is going on amongst them. His spirit was painfully excited in him in seeing how the city was
{29}
wholly given up to idolatry. He read the inscriptions on the altars, and so forth. He said, "I found also an altar on which was inscribed, To the unknown God", @Acts 17:23. There is instruction for us in seeking to serve men. We have to take account of what they are going on with, because in that way you learn what they need, and how they are to be delivered. He identifies himself with them as a man; to the Jews he became a Jew, and to the Greeks he was a man, or one of the race. So he says, "In him we live, and move, and have our being". "He is not far from each one of us". @Acts 17:27,28.
Ques. Does the level place suggest that the Jew is now on no better footing than the Gentile?
J.T. No. He was recognised at the outset as the "Jew first", but after the apostle Paul visited Rome I think the position is changed. It says, "The salvation of God is *sent* unto the Gentiles, and they will hear it". @Acts 28:28.
E.B.McC. So we would find much room if we were in the right state to be used.
J.T. The need is unspeakable. The Lord is saying, as it were, 'Whom shall we send?' In answer to this, it is a question of what ability there may be. The Lord will dispose of it if it is available. The idea of a Levite is that he is given to the priests -- to Aaron and his sons -- for service. They are to be for the Lord's disposition.
W.J.P. You do not confine that to ministers, do you?
J.T. No; it is for every saint.
L.D.B. In chapter 9 the Lord inquires, "Who do the crowds say that I am?" This was as He prayed.
J. T. I think that in chapter 9 in connection with the prayer we have just read, we have what follows on constructively with the appointment of the ministers. That is, in serving we need to be assured as to the Person of Christ. We need to be well grounded
{30}
in the knowledge of who He is, because the erroneous thoughts that are abroad are dreadful; and, obviously, the Lord praying alone has in view that we should know who He is; not only who He is officially, because that is indicated in chapter 6, but who He is personally.
E.B.McC. If He is with us in the plain we must be assured as to who He is.
J.T. This question that is raised in chapter 9 is of immense importance now, because of the wicked doctrines that are promulgated in Christendom about the Lord Jesus. If we would serve aright we must be very clear in our souls who He is; and I think His praying alone would be in view of this.
J.C.S. What do you mean by 'knowing Him personally'?
J.T. It says here, "And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him; and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am? They answering said, John the baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again. He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God" (verses 18 - 20). He had the light.
Ques. Is that light got from personal intercourse with the Lord?
J.T. I think it is. In this gospel there is nothing said about a revelation in this connection. I think Peter had discovered it. No doubt it refers to the revelation he had. According to Matthew it is not so presented. There the Father made a revelation to Peter. But here it is as if Peter said, 'You are the anointed vessel for God's service of grace -- the Christ of God'.
J.C.S. Would it be a just inference, since Luke so constantly presents Him to us in that praying attitude, that Peter picks up who He is largely through His prayers; that as He is alone praying he gets to
{31}
know who He is personally through seeing His intercourse with God?
J.T. Well, I think that is a just inference.
D.B. It was not information about facts with Peter; it was personal acquaintance with Him.
J. T. The evidence that He was the Anointed of God was there. Things were done according to God. Peter says to Cornelius, that God "anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power". @Acts 10:38.
M.P.M. It says later, "As he prayed, the fashion of his countenance became different". @Luke 29:9. The disciples would take account of that.
J.C.S. I notice, too, in Luke, where the sower operates, the "seed" is the word of *God*.
J.T. Yes, Luke presents God -- God in grace; and God has now One who is anointed to set out His grace. That is what Peter says. In Mark it is "*The Christ*" -- the One who does everything; but here it is "The Christ *of God*". That *God* has One who does everything, and does it according to His mind.
W.J.P. In @John 6:68 Peter says, "Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life".
J.T. His confession is in keeping with John's gospel. He *had* "words of eternal life". It is not that He had simply spoken them, but He *had* them; and He was the Holy One of God. Here He is "the Christ of God".
S.F. He was a man here in ordinary daily circumstances, moving absolutely for God's pleasure. All His consideration was that way, and through doing so He met perfectly whatever came before Him. Would you agree with that?
J.T. Just so; and now the apostles are to know this. He would bring out from them the confession of who He was.
Rem. It says they were *with Him* as He was "praying alone". In chapter 6 He descended *with them* to the level place.
{32}
J.T. They are with Him; seeing Him "praying alone" would give them an apprehension of what He was with God. John says, "We have contemplated His glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a Father". @John 1:14. They would see that; they contemplated Him. In Luke He is with the servants, who had been serving very successfully, and in successful service we are apt to get our eyes turned on ourselves; hence this question, "Whom say ye that I am?" If He is the One who is doing everything for God, the little I am doing is not of much account. I am just a vessel or instrument for His use.
A.H.R. So we get here God's Anointed.
J.T. Yes; and the servants, however successful, are to have this before them. He is doing the work.
J.C.S. So that the next time they stretched forth the right hand in service they would be in the sense of who He is.
J.T. That is just the point. They had been successful; but now they were to understand that the work was really His work -- it was He who was doing it.
J.C.S. Sometimes we are hindered by allowing our service to assume too great proportions in our minds. It becomes everything to us, and we really lose sight of the fact that it is Christ who should be everything to us.
J.T. That is the thing to get hold of.
D.B. Would ability to feed the crowd indicate who He was?
J.T. I think so. Peter had doubtless acquired the knowledge of who He was through observing what He was doing.
W.J.P. You remarked that it was necessary to have an impression at the prayer meeting before you preached the gospel. Is this the way to acquire confidence as to addressing God?
J.T. No one should attempt to address men who
{33}
has not first addressed God, because you acquire your power there.
A.H.R. With regard to the servants, are there not two sides -- one being occupied with service, and the other being timid owing to lack of faith, and thus not being able to take up service?
J.T. That was the case with Timothy. He was timid. He had to rekindle the gift that was in him. Many have ability, and are not using it.
F.H. The thing to recognise is that the Lord has a claim upon us. In restoring the man's hand the Lord was establishing His claim for the service of that hand. He that has power to restore the hand has power to direct it in service.
J.T. And then in the service there is sure to be success if the Lord is supporting you; but the danger in successful service is to be so occupied as to accredit yourself with it. Paul speaks of the things that Christ had wrought by him. What he had done was Christ's work. He says, "From Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, I have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ", @Romans 15:19. Who had preached? It was Christ; as he says, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me". @2 Corinthians 13:3. It was Christ, and that is what makes ministry so serious. If it is taken up as presented in Scripture the minister represents Christ. Paul further says, "Coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and the glad tidings of peace to those who were nigh", @Ephesians 2:17.
J.C.S. One's service would be on the line of distinguishing Christ; it would be as of one anointed.
Rem. So it is easy to detect true ministry; it calls attention to Him.
J.T. It does. The hearers are impressed; it has come from God.
R.J.W. In chapter 9, when He handed back the child, they wondered at the glorious greatness of
{34}
God, and in the case of the demoniac, they confessed how great things God had done.
J.T. We can see how the Lord "praying alone" impressed those with Him. Peter confessed Him "The Christ of God".
L.D.B. The praying would emphasise that He -- the Anointed One -- was drawing upon God.
Ques. Would "The Christ of God" indicate the dignity of the service?
J.T. I think it does. Think of what we are connected with, even at this present time! It is the work of the Lord. The Christ of God is carrying it on; He is doing it. We are all more or less instrumental, but it is His doing; and anyone who receives benefit receives it from the Christ of God. God is the Source of all blessings, and Christ is Mediator; but He is the Anointed Mediator, and all blessing comes to us in that way.
J.C.S. If we see that the Lord is really behind the servants, and He is working through them, it takes away any feeling of rivalry.
J.T. It conveys the sense of dignity. We are dealing with very great things. However restricted outwardly, it is no less than the work of the Christ. The anointing is on it, and the anointing involves moral weight and distinction.
E.B.McC. It would imply assembly formation, and headship would be known.
{35}
ADJUSTMENT
@Proverbs 25:1 - 13
I have in view on this occasion to speak a word in relation to adjustment. I have selected a passage from the book of Proverbs because it is intended for adjustment, to the end that there should be vessels of usefulness and of ornamentation. These are two features that mark the house of God. Those who are in it aright are at the same time ornamental and useful. The Son is over the house, as we read in Hebrews, and He is concerned that the house should be in every way according to God. To this end the process of adjustment continues with every one of us. God, having brought in a model in Christ, proposes that each one in the house should be brought into accord with that model; and so the Epistle to the Colossians in large measure corresponds with the book of Proverbs.
One feature in Colossians is adjustment; that is, everything is to be according to Christ. "As therefore ye have received the Christ", it says, "walk in him"; @Colossians 2:6 and whatever is not in accord with Christ is to be rejected. That is the principle in Colossians, and we are told in that epistle that the Father "has delivered us from the authority of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love", @Colossians 1:13. The book of Proverbs is the book of the Son of the Father's love. It is the book of Solomon's proverbs, and he is the son of David, we are told.
You see, therefore, beloved brethren, that the adjustment is in the hands of One who will deal gently with us -- who will deal in affection with us, and yet with the utmost firmness and precision. For Solomon, who built the house, being imbued with the most extraordinary wisdom known up to that time,
{36}
would of necessity act according to that wisdom in all his dealings, and so "the Father ... has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love". @Colossians 1:13. Notice, it is not into the 'house' of the Son of His love, for we cannot be in the house save as we pass through the kingdom. It says, "who has delivered us from the authority of darkness". @Colossians 1:13. We need to come under another authority.
What exists abroad in what is called Christendom is the authority of darkness. That is to say, certain doctrines and systems have authority over men's minds and consciences by reason, in some instances, of their antiquity, and in others by reason of human greatness and learning. In every instance it is the authority of darkness. Men are held in it with a good conscience, for the reason that their consciences are darkened, and darkness has authority over them. Many of the Lord's dear people are held in that darkness, and what God is doing at the present time is delivering souls from the authority of darkness.
Mark that word 'authority', as it should be rendered. From whatever cause -- what power such a doctrine or system has over my conscience, and the more restful I am in it, the worse it is. Hence God moves -- the Father moves -- to deliver souls from the authority of darkness, and to translate us "into the kingdom of the Son of his love". @Colossians 1:13. Think of the difference, beloved, between the authority of darkness and the authority of the Son of the Father's love. Those of us who have come under the latter know the blessedness of it, that while the Lord is firm in His dealings with us, they are all the dealings of love -- they are the dealings of love combined with infinite wisdom. So that it is an immense thing for everyone, especially the young ones, to know that they are placed by the Father under the authority of the Son, for it is His kingdom.
Well now, as I said, Solomon is a type of Christ
{37}
as the Son of the Father's love. He is the most interesting babe in the Old Testament. His history is given to us from the very outset, so that we might have a full view of Christ, in type, as the Son of the Father's love. I do not know an expression that is, in a way, more interesting than that -- "the Son of the Father's love". John says, "We have contemplated his glory". "The Word", he says, "became flesh and dwelt among us". @John 1:14. One thinks with pleasure of the Lord, "The Word" as become flesh, moving about among men here upon earth. It is not that He visited among us, but He *dwelt* among us. He came within the range of men in that way -- into their houses, mingled in their families, dwelt as a neighbour, so that He might become known to men. Hence John says, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", @John 1:14. It is not *the* Father there. It is an only one with a father; a figure that is intelligible to everyone on the earth, as one may say, for who is it who has not some idea of an only one with his father?
John contemplated the Lord Jesus as dwelling amongst men as an only one with a father. Who can undertake to define the details on which that statement was based? But He was known to the apostles, beloved, in that way. He was known as an only one with a father. So in chapter 1 of Hebrews, where the glory of Christ is unfolded before us so that He might become the supreme object of our hearts, we are told that God said, "I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son", @Hebrews 1:5. This is a quotation, as I understand, from @2 Samuel 7:14, enforced as it is in @Psalm 89, showing that Solomon is to be taken as a type of the Lord Jesus as the Son of the Father's love. Throughout the book of Proverbs we have the rule of the Son of the Father's love.
As I said, Solomon is the most interesting babe in
{38}
the Old Testament. I do not wish to eclipse others, such as Isaac, but what you find is that when Solomon was born he received a name prophetically from Jehovah. He had the names of Solomon and Jedidiah at the same time. God Himself loved him, and he is nurtured in the light of what he was to Jehovah both by David and Bathsheba his mother. He was his father's son; as he says, "I was a son unto my father" @Proverbs 4:3 -- that is a word for young believers. It is not simply that he *was* David's son, but he was a son *unto* him, which is a different idea. In contra-distinction to Absalom and others he grew up in his father's affections and his mother's affections. As he says, "Tender and an only one in the sight of my mother". @Proverbs 4:3. So he is nurtured in tenderest affections in his father's house, and is qualified to address himself to all those that are transferred from the authority of darkness into the kingdom. Hence this book of the Proverbs.
Now, having said all this to make the situation clear, I want to come to my subject, and that is -- adjustment. I use this word because it is a very forceful one -- an expressive one -- as applicable to every believer. I suppose there is not a believer in the whole world who does not even now need adjustment, and we need it in order that we should be on the one hand ornamental, and on the other useful. The word comes to us thus severally as to how much we ornament the house of God, and how far we are useful in it. For the idea of a vessel, as we get it here, is that it is to be useful, and we all know how vessels may be ornamental at the same time as being useful, and that is the divine intent.
The idea is that there should be a vessel for the refiner, and one covets the thought of it. The word is applied peculiarly to Paul. I think he stands out, after Christ, as the ideal of heaven as a vessel. The Lord said of him, "He is an elect vessel unto me". @Acts 9:15. What an immense thing that was! And then He
{39}
appointed him as a minister and a witness. I want you to note for a moment, beloved, the great thought the Lord had in that vessel. He appointed him a minister; that is, an official servant; not a slave, but one set up in dignity in service. And then He said further, "and a witness"; the two things go together. The idea of a witness is martyrdom, but service is carried out in authority. He is a vessel to be employed as a servant and a witness.
So that I take it the apostle Paul is our model after Christ. He was called from heaven; the light shone round about him from heaven; he received his commission from heaven; and he said, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision". @Acts 26:19. He is here now in entire subjection to Christ, and in entire availability to Christ. He is for use -- he is "sanctified, and meet for the Master's use", @2 Timothy 2:21. Think, dear brethren, of what the Lord had in that vessel. One never tires of referring to Paul as a model in that way. Well now, this chapter, as you will observe, was transcribed by the men of Hezekiah. It begins the third division of the book of Proverbs, and incidentally calls attention to the great gain of research -- of diligence. These Proverbs had continued to exist in Israel for many years, and apparently no one obtained any good from them until the days of Hezekiah. I mention that because of the great importance of research -- of inquiry. The Lord says, "Search the Scriptures". @John 5:39. We cannot do without that. Every line of Scripture was inspired of God, and is profitable -- every Scripture; so that we cannot do without the Scriptures. It is not enough to know the Bible in all the versions; we have to "*search* the Scriptures". @John 5:39.
It says, "the *men* of Hezekiah". That idea, I take it, corresponds with Solomon's times. "Happy are thy men", @1 Kings 10:8, @2 Chronicles 9:7 the queen of Sheba said; and Hezekiah has men. It is a great thing to get hold of the idea
{40}
of *men*. The epistle to the Corinthians is mainly to bring that about in the Corinthians. They were babes. He said he could not write unto them as unto perfect. He could speak among the perfect the hidden wisdom that God had before the world prepared for those that love Him. Babes, on account of their state, shut themselves off from the precious hidden wisdom of God. But Hezekiah has his men, and they transcribed the Proverbs that are recorded in this chapter. What a find it was in those days! for Hezekiah's days, as our own, were days in which adjustment was needed.
This chapter opens up with the idea that God hides. "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing" -- a very remarkable fact to stand out. If it is the glory of God to hide a thing, then we may be sure there are things hidden which have to be sought out. For God, in the exigencies of His nature, values the things that He has; and He conceals them in order to disclose them to those who love Him. "God has revealed them unto us". "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him", @1 Corinthians 2:9. Hence He conceals things. I mention this because it stands out in the forefront of this great principle of adjustment that there are things that God hides.
Then it says, "The honour of kings is to search out a matter". That is, what God, in the exigencies of His nature, may hide, Christ searches out officially. We have to take in the idea of His mediatorship, and one feature is that He searches out things for us. Solomon himself represents the principle of a king searching out; he had right-of-way everywhere. If Solomon needed to investigate anything in Beersheba he could do so; he was king. If he needed to investigate in Dan he could do so. The king has right-of-way. Thus the Lord Jesus, having gone on
{41}
high, is in a position to search out everything officially, and He does so in the gift of the Spirit. We have here the power of search: "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God", @1 Corinthians 2:10. Think of what is within our range, dear brethren, on the principle of inquiry! As the men of Hezekiah transcribed these neglected Proverbs, so the inquiring believer, as having the Spirit, may reach the depths of God.
Then the next great principle that confronts us here is that of *height*. It says, "The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable". You see, adjustment is not local merely; if I am to be adjusted I am standing in relation to the highest heights and the deepest depths. Think of the vastness of the divine thought, beloved! We are told that "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens", @Ephesians 4:10. How far who can tell? But I am to be adjusted in relation to Christ in that position.
Then it says, "The earth for depth". You might inquire, 'Is that the crust of the earth?' as geologists say. Which of the strata does that refer to? It refers to them all, and more. We are told that the Lord Jesus was three days and three nights -- not in the crust of the earth -- but in the *heart* of the earth. He could not go lower than that. "The earth for depth;" you say, 'Are you speaking geologically?' No, I am speaking spiritually. The Lord Jesus Christ went down -- He went down in love. As the thought of His descent enters into my soul it prepares me for the wonderful adjustment which God proposes. He lay three days and three nights in the *heart* of the earth. He went to the very lowest possible point in His love. Ephesians contemplates that, through ministry, we are to be brought "to know the breadth and length and depth and height". @Ephesians 3:18. Think of the depth!
I would urge everyone here to look at this -- that
{42}
your precious Saviour lay three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. Would you not like to see where He lay? The angel said, "Come, see the place where the *Lord* lay", @Matthew 28:6. We have to take account of it spiritually. He went down to the lowest possible depth, and we are to know it. So we have "the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable"; as one may say, "The love of Christ which passeth knowledge". @Ephesians 3:19.
The next thing, dear brethren, is, "Take away the dross from the silver". That is a process that we have to submit to. Young people especially are very slow to admit the presence of the dross, but it is there, and in a large measure. The silver is there, too, thank God. It is there in everyone that is "born again"; but the dross has to go. It may be an irksome experience, but the Lord loves us too well to allow that to stay. As you see it go, you see the wisdom of His love. He seeks to have a vessel, and so the dross has to be removed.
Then it says, "Take away the wicked". There are those who allow the wicked in their communion. You cannot have anything suitable unless there is the principle of taking away the wicked. The fellowship of God's people repels the wicked. "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves", @1 Corinthians 5:13. It is obligatory on every company of Christians in the world to remove wickedness. It has to be dealt with authoritatively. It is a question of the king's authority, otherwise there is not establishment. Things were tottering at Corinth because the wicked was allowed. He had to be removed, and he was removed, thank God. Then the door was open for God to come in and open up His heart to them, as we see in the second letter to the saints there. It was only a little while ago that, on the ship on which I was sailing, there was celebrated what is known as Holy Communion at seven o'clock in the morning, and
{43}
it was open to all. Think of that! Think of throwing open to all the precious symbols of the body of Christ and the blood of Christ! How can His throne be established when wicked persons are allowed to sit down and partake of the emblems?
Then it goes on to speak of our relations one with another. It says in verse 6, "Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men". That is the next thing. This is a word to young men who would serve the Lord. May He add to their number! As Moses said, "Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets", @Numbers 11:29. The need is great, but before we can serve we have to learn to take the low place. "Put not thyself forth in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men". That is a principle of adjustment that every young man aspiring to service should take special notice of, because the Lord is over the house, and your place in it must be determined by Him. True enough that your gift merits room for you; it does, but nevertheless your gift does not determine your place in the house; the Lord determines your place there. The Son is over the house, and He gives you your place. No right-minded person would wish it otherwise; you want everything regulated by the Lord. Hence it goes on to say, "for better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up higher, than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes see". There is a word; wait for that word from the Prince, "Come up higher".
Then, as I said, it goes on to speak of our relations one with another. I must hasten through the following verse, "Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame". Here we have a word for everyone of us, for the tendency with us is to strive -- to contend for our points and our cause;
{44}
and this verse enjoins us to avoid that. You may be put to shame; it may mean your ruin, for your pride may get the better of you and "a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city", @Proverbs 18: 19. So that one has to be on his guard amongst his brethren about contending -- about entering into strife. The principle of the house is that it is composed of sons of peace. "Solomon" means 'peace', and so the house is to be marked by that -- by peace.
Then follows, "Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself, and discover not a secret to another". If there is a cause between us, let us debate it in secret. "Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself". What a simple and yet practical and effective principle this is! We have elsewhere, "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother". @Matthew 18:15. You see how practical all this is, that the saints should be adjusted in relation to the height and the depth, and then in relation to one another. So that you are to debate thy cause with thy neighbour by himself, and as it says, "Discover not a secret to another, lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away".
Now, dear brethren, I have come to the end of what I call adjustment. We are set in relation with one another in the light and in the presence of supreme height and depth -- the love of Christ in the depth to which He went, and the height to which He has gone. We are in the presence of that wonderful love. We are adjusted in relation to all that; we regard each other in that light, and now we look for ornamentation. It says, "A word fitly spoken". How delightful to heaven it is that a company of God's people should be set down thus adjusted! Then, "a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver". How delightful to listen to a word like that! The house of God is ornamented by
{45}
such words. Scripture abounds with them from the lips of Christ and from the lips of others.
Then the next thing is, "as an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear". Under these conditions, dear brethren, we are allowed to listen to reproof. "Faithful are the wounds of a friend"; and heaven looks down as a brother seeks to gain his brother by reproof; and as that brother attends in subjection, it is like "an earring of gold". As one bends over humbly and in subjection to hear a wise reproof, it is "an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold". A wise man using his lips to convey a wise reproof, and an attentive ear receiving it, is likened to an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold in that way.
Thus in these simple practical ways, dear brethren, the house of God is ornamented. Then in the next verse, which is the last one I intend to speak on, we have what accrues to God under these circumstances. It says, "As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him; for he refresheth the soul of his masters". In these simple ways we have the ornamentation of the house in vessels fitted for it, and then we have refreshment for the blessed God Himself in a messenger. The idea of a divine messenger is of immense importance, for it involves a question of trustworthiness. Is there one that God can entrust a message to? So a faithful messenger is like the cold of snow in harvest; he refreshes the soul of his masters. Notice the "masters". Philip had two. You will remember the angel sent him, and then the Spirit of God sends him. So that the position of a servant is that he has masters, and in faithfulness he is like snow in harvest time; he is refreshing. "He refresheth the soul of his masters".
I suppose the greatest accruement from the gospel address is what goes to God. I don't know how many
{46}
preachings -- gospel meetings -- Noah held, or whether he held them at all. I do know he was a preacher, such a preacher that the Spirit of Christ is said to have preached in him. I don't know how many heard him, but I do know that he refreshed God. He had no converts as far as we know. The results of his service were outwardly small, but we may be sure of this, that during the 120 years of his service he refreshed the soul of his Master in his faithfulness.
I say that so that we might not be discouraged in our preachings. The first great principle in a messenger is to be faithful. As Paul says, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision". @Acts 26:19. He went from Jerusalem round about to Illyricum. He says, "I have fully preached" -- marvellous statement of faithfulness -- "I have fully preached the gospel of Christ". @Romans 15:19. How much refreshment there was for God in it! He was a sweet odour of Christ unto God in those who were saved and in those that perished; even in those that perished, for he says, "We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved and in them that perish", @2 Corinthians 2:15. So that we have every encouragement to go in for adjustment, so as to be vessels for ornament and for use in the house of God.
{47}
PRAYER: CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PERFECT MAN (3)
@Luke 9:28,29; @Luke 11:1 - 13
J.T. We might look at two passages -- one in chapter 9 and the other in chapter 11 of Luke. What has engaged us in our previous readings is that there is a constructive line of instruction in the instances in which the Lord is seen in prayer in this gospel. We have seen how at His baptism He is so engaged, and is approved of heaven, the Father's voice speaking to Him. Then in chapter 5, in the presence of need that had come into evidence from His fame, He retired, and was in desert places praying, so that the power of the Lord was there. The believer, in his progress, corresponds to that; but in seeing the need, his own need being met, turns to God, disallowing the flesh, which the desert places would suggest. Then in chapter 6 the Lord is seen praying for a whole night; not so much because need is immediately before Him, but because He would have workmen; as if to suggest that one cannot do all. So He names His apostles, and comes down to the plain with them to meet the need in the plain.
In chapter 9, after they had been successful in their ministry as sent out, they return. The multitudes have to be fed, and the Lord puts it upon them to feed them. But it comes out that they could not, and this brings in a fresh glory of Christ. He feeds the multitudes. Then He raises the question with them as to who the multitudes said He was; following this with the question, "But whom say ye that I am". Peter says, "The Christ of God". @Luke 9:20. In Peter's confession the light is there; the Christ is there; so that the workmen humbly take their places under Him. What is done is done by Him; a very important and salutary lesson, for it keeps us lowly, and saves us from pride.
{48}
The next instance is in the passage read in chapter 9, where He is seen on high praying, these three disciples being present; and what comes out is that He becomes altered or different. What suggests itself is that the believer, in his progress, corresponds at this point as apprehending the heavenly -- he is different. His service now is carried on in a different way; he is no longer on the level of ordinary religious activity -- he is *different*. In other words, as having thus progressed, we are actuated by heavenly principles and manners in our service. I think it well to link it all up, so that we may have the thing clearly before us, and get the teaching of this passage in chapter 11. It is not that we should become Quakers or monks. Christianity involves a difference from all that is of this world: "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly" (@1 Corinthians 15:48), and this enters into our walk; ways, and service in this world.
A.H.R. Is it on the line of "beholding the glory of the Lord" @2 Corinthians 3:18 you are changed from glory to glory?
J.T. It is that line. So you have here Moses and Elias, who, appearing in glory, speak with Him. It would bear out your thought -- they appear in glory. The heavenly element, entering into our position here, involves a change; in fact Christianity is established on the ground of the light of Ephesians; hence what follows is coloured by what is seen here.
R.J.W. Would there be an indication of what was new and heavenly in the fact that it was *eight* days after?
J.T. Yes; eight is a change -- a new point of departure.
Ques. Is it necessary to be in an elevated position to take account of it? It is only there it is seen.
J.T. I think so. It is said, "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us ... hath raised us up together and made us sit together
{49}
in heavenly places in Christ Jesus" (@Ephesians 2:4 - 6); so that we come out as heavenly.
M.P.M. The difference is seen very markedly in Saul. He was changed from being an insolent, overbearing man, to one who was characterised by prayer.
R.J.W. Do you suggest that as you pray you take on these features?
J.T. Well, I think at this stage of your progress the thought of the heavenly comes in. It is not at the outset, although the light may be there; but the time arrives when you take on the heavenly.
J.C.S. So that when you take on the heavenly it will impart tone and character to all that you are and all you do.
J.T. There are some textures that will not take on certain colours. I think the Christian texture should take on a good *blue* -- the heavenly colour.
Rem. And your preaching would come out in that way?
J.T. Yes; you begin now to present things differently.
A.H.R. You come to God in prayer, and you obtain the heavenly colour -- the blue, and you come out in it.
J.T. That is what I understand; the texture is prepared for that. The believer's life is like a web of cloth. Principles are laid down. Principles are the warp in the piece; they are laid out the whole length. The weft is woven in bit by bit; it is, as it were, a hand-loom -- the shuttle acts this way and that way constantly. Romans prepares for what is heavenly. Romans lays out the principles, and then you begin to weave in, and gradually you begin to take on the colour -- to take on a good dye; because it has to enter into the whole piece -- the warp and the weft.
J.C.S. So Romans brings in all that establishes one on the line of recovery, but you have not yet
{50}
come to the reception of what is Ephesian truth exactly.
J.T. That is it.
Ques. And would Romans bring you to Ephesians?
J.T. It prepares for Ephesians; so the apostle speaks of the mystery which had been hid during the ages. He desires that the Roman Christians should be established according to it.
J.C.S. Do I catch the thought that this heavenly thing that is being introduced is really a process?
J.T. That is what I think. At this point of your progress as a believer you go in for what is heavenly, and that enters into local responsibility. Chapters 10 and 11 deal with the testimony in localities, and that must be heavenly. Local furnishings, which we may see in chapter 11, correspond to heaven. It is a question of the Lord going into the cities and places, and preparation being made for it. He appoints seventy, and sends them out two and two into every city and place whither He Himself would come, so that there should be conditions in each city and place suitable for Him.
Rem. So what you put on can be taken account of.
J.T. Yes; the furnishings are according to heaven..
R.J.W. Is that why Luke emphasises the thought of shining -- what is heavenly is shown?
J.T. So we have two men in shining garments at the end of Luke's gospel. And here His raiment is "white and effulgent".
Rem. Would you say we get it on the line of contemplation?
J.T. I think we do. "We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image". @2 Corinthians 3:18. The glory of the Lord is involved in the question, "Whom say ye that I am?" @Luke 9:20. The knowledge of the Lord leads to the change.
{51}
J.C.S. So that the Lord Jesus comes in here again as a pattern. If we think of Him intrinsically, there is no change; but He is there as pattern for us.
J.T. That is what I thought.
L.D.B. Following up the thought of Romans, would Peter and James and John stand for those who have reached this point?
J.T. I think that He selects those who would be, so to speak, capable of taking on the heavenly colour. He knew them, and He intended that they should reflect all they saw. As Peter says, "We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye witnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount", @2 Peter 1:16 - 18. They were with Him so that the effect of the vision should be reflected in them. He knew what they could take on, although apparently they then acted very poorly. Nevertheless the result came out later.
J.C.S. So it was the Lord Jesus who went up to pray. He took them with Him that they might witness all that was transpiring, and take it on.
J.T. Yes, that is it; they came to it afterwards.
S.F. Peter understood it much more later when he wrote his epistle, and refers to it then; but the impression remained with him from this time forward.
J.T. He speaks in his epistles of an unfading inheritance reserved in the heavens for us; and goes on to say that the gospel is preached by the Holy Spirit come down from heaven. Then, in chapter 2, he links it on beautifully with Paul's doctrine governing local assemblies by calling the attention of the Jews of the dispersion to what they were. "To
{52}
whom coming", he says, "as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 2:4,5. He was separating them from Jerusalem, and setting them up in a spiritual way in what they were themselves; *they* were a spiritual house. All that links up with what we may see in @Luke 10 and 11. Here local furnishings must take on the heavenly, and be independent of metropolitan centres. Peter's epistle teaches the saints that they are independent of earthly metropolitan centres.
J.C.S. So that the local assembly should be the repository of what is heavenly. Heavenly conditions should be found there, and heavenly furnishings, as you have remarked.
L.D.B. Would you say a little more about Peter's epistle? How does he show that there is nothing metropolitan on earth now for the Lord, and that the heavenly is in view?
J.T. I link it on with his service as recorded in @Acts 9. After Paul was converted Peter seemed to discern the new point of departure. It says, "Peter, passing through all quarters", and coming down to Lydda, raised up Aeneas, and says to him, "rise up, and make thy couch for thyself", @Acts 9:34. There I think we have a plain intimation that he discerned that God was about to abandon Jerusalem. It took some time to do it, but the principle was laid down in his word to Aeneas that saints in different localities must learn to make their beds for themselves. Then he raises up Tabitha, and presents her *alive* to the widows and those who were mourning for her. Hence you have one who can make one's bed for oneself; and then, in Tabitha, the energy of life in localities; so that his epistle amplifies these principles. He brings in the heavenly instead of occupying the Jews of the
{53}
dispersion with Jerusalem or the earthly promises. He speaks about an inheritance in heaven unfading and undefiled, and says they were begotten again to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and that they were "kept by the power of God through faith", @1 Peter 1:5. Then he goes on to speak about the Spirit coming down from heaven as the power of ministry. Then he says, "as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby", @1 Peter 2:2. It was a thing to grow up to. That would free them from the system at Jerusalem. Following on this, he says, "To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as lively stones are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 2:4,5. In all that, it seems to me, he detaches their minds from Jerusalem, where the visible temple was, and corroborates Paul's ministry, which set up local companies officially, and calls them "assemblies of God".
G.R.G. The source of all that light was heaven. Peter was an eye-witness "of his majesty". @2 Peter 1:16.
J.T. All that enters into it. He goes on to say at the end, "She that is elected with you in Babylon salutes you, and Marcus my son", @1 Peter 5:13. He links up, it seems to me, the east (that is Babylon -- the work of God there) with the west, unifying the work of God.
J.C.S. That was only possible by bringing in the heavenly. So long as things were attached to Jerusalem the possibility of break-up was there, but the transfer of the centre to heaven brought about a permanent result.
J.T. The heavenly element now began to assert itself. In @Acts 9 a light from heaven came to Paul; and in chapter 10 a sheet from heaven came to Peter. All that enters into Peter's ministry. The metropolis
{54}
was transferred to heaven, and it remained in heaven. "Jerusalem above ... is our mother". @Galatians 4:26.
G.R.G. Do you think the sovereignty of the Lord comes out in that connection?
J.T. He knew them. Peter and James and John were evidently more spiritual than the others. They were taken into Jairus house when the little girl was raised up. So I think we are reminded here that we are privileged according to our progress.
R.J.W. Then do you suggest that as we reach a certain point in our soul's history we correspond to this?
J.T. That is what I was endeavouring to emphasise. At this point you begin to take on the heavenly; you want the heavenly because it is better.
R.J.W. There was a great change in Job after he judged himself.
J.T. Quite. All this is instruction, involving a change in us. The heavenly colour enters in, I think, to the teaching of chapters 10 and 11. That is the idea of a place suitable for the Lord in the end of chapter 9. It says, "It came to pass, when the days of his receiving up were fulfilled", @Luke 9:51. The time was arriving when He would be received up into heaven, where everything is in keeping with Him. But in the meantime He was going to visit cities and places, hence He sends messengers before Him, as it were, to prepare. So that in praying in a *certain place* He had in mind that that place should be furnished. It refers obviously to the need of furnishing in it, because He had been to Bethany, to the house of Martha, and, although He was received, the furnishings were not just right. Martha did not reflect just what was heavenly; things were not altogether right there. Hence one would look around in one's locality and see how much the conditions correspond to heaven, because the Lord is heavenly. He is in heavenly
{55}
surroundings, and is entitled to something like heavenly surroundings on earth as He comes.
J.C.S. So that when He comes the surroundings would be agreeable to Him. There would be no discomfort, so to speak; all would be according to Him.
A.H.R. If we got hold of that it would be an immense thing for our spirits, would it not?
J.T. Surely. In the beginning of chapter 10 it says, He chose seventy, and sent them "two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come" (verse 1). That has a meaning beyond what is literal; it has a meaning for us. If one goes as a representative into a locality, the Lord follows him up; and it is a question of what He finds. Take Luther's ministry -- wonderful energy of the Spirit, but the Lord would follow that up. What did He find? What was the result of that movement ecclesiastically for the Lord? There were not assembly conditions as far as we know. So with everyone who represents the Lord in ministry; the Lord follows you up, and what does He find as the result of your ministry?
R.J.W. Do you think then the objective is the assembly? Your works are not complete until that objective is reached and the furnishing brought in.
J.T. That is what I think is found in service -- "I have not found thy works perfect before God", @Revelation 3:2. There were works and conversions and much done in Sardis, but the work was not complete. There were no furnishings locally for the Lord. Take the Lutheran church of Germany, and the churches of England and Scotland, and then the establishment in Switzerland and France, and the later off-shoots in English-speaking countries; what do they afford for the Lord?
G.R.G. Do you think it is suggested that the messengers were not successful in these villages?
{56}
J.T. You see that in a city of the Samaritans. It was not to the discredit of the messengers, because a national feeling was there of rivalry between Samaria and Jerusalem, and there was no reception of the Lord at all.
Rem. Does anything take place before they go out two by two? The Holy Spirit goes before them, as it were.
J.T. We get the Holy Spirit in chapter 11. It is another consideration, because the Holy Spirit is the solution of all this. The Holy Spirit is really the means whereby local conditions are brought about that are acceptable to heaven. You cannot have it without the Spirit. Hence He says, "Much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him", @Luke 11:13. That is the solution, but I don't think any of these systems which I referred to have made room for the Spirit; hence the assembly is lost to view, and there are no suitable local furnishings.
E.B.McC. You might point out what you mean by furnishings.
J.T. It means that I have a peep into heaven, and get to know something about what the living conditions of the Lord are. To use a figure: I have some idea of Buckingham Palace; anyone of us who has been to London knows that is where the king lives with his family. Now, the living conditions in the house of the king's representative in this Dominion would, be, in some sense, a reflex of that. If the king were to come to Wellington he would go there, because that is the idea; it is a reflex of his own living conditions. Paul's ministry enables us to understand what is heavenly, and local conditions must correspond in some sense to what is in heaven.
E.B.McC. Then it must be borne in mind that we are heavenly?
{57}
J.T. Yes, indeed. "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly", @1 Corinthians 15:48. I think the Lord, as He prayed in a certain place, had in mind that there should be others in that place suitable. Hence the disciples say to Him, "Teach us to pray". This is the first time we get that. It does not say, 'Teach *me* to pray'. We have been on the line of the individual; now we come to the collective. It is the question of the saints in a locality learning how to pray there.
J.C.S. So that Buckingham Palace would really be the model for the Government House here. We become, in that way, acquainted with what is in heaven and what is heavenly; the local assembly is patterned after that.
J.T. That is what I had in mind. Now you have the added thought here of place -- He was praying in a certain place. He had already said they were to go before His face into every place whither He Himself would come. Martha received Him to her house, but she was not heavenly. There are many of us perhaps who are not heavenly, and we are ready to receive the Lord only on our own terms, so to speak. It is one thing to go into a man's house on his own terms, but another thing for him to receive you on your terms; in the latter you are much freer and happier. Now Martha did not receive the Lord on His own terms. I doubt whether she knew Him rightly. She would have Him bring Mary into accord with *her*. There was no question of Mary being suitable to the Lord. In other words, it is like a brother in the meeting wishing the whole meeting to be brought into accord with him, which is often the case.
J.C.S. In Martha's house the Lord found something that was really foreign to heaven.
J.T. I can understand the Lord turning aside into one of the rooms and praying for that place.
{58}
That seems the only solution of it -- praying for Martha because the conditions are not right. It does not say so here, but it is the thing carried forward. He was praying in a certain *place*. He had just been to Bethany.
W.J.P. Would you say there were mixed conditions?
J.T. Martha received Him into her house; she was the responsible one, but Mary was of a very different spiritual calibre. It is a very good type of a meeting; a very good example perhaps of all our meetings.
R.J.W. Would the result be seen a little later in the place where there was a large upper room furnished?
J.T. You get that further on. It is a question of the furnishing here. So there is the praying in a certain place, it may be in Wellington or any place. If things are not right that is the way to deal with the matter.
S.F. In a way, Martha was holding the reins. Mary's submission suggests she had surrendered everything to Him.
J.C.S. So you would impress us with the necessity of being acquainted with what is in heaven, that in our localities we might place ourselves in relation to it.
J.T. That is the thought. I think Luke has, in the main, public conditions in view, conditions in keeping with heaven, because that is what was to mark the assembly.
A.H.R. Do you think the heavenly conditions mentioned were brought about in the house when Lazarus was raised? All were in their places then.
J. T. The Lord came in there and manifested His glory; the result in Bethany is seen in @John 12. But He wants to show from this occurrence here that the solution of this is by the Spirit.
{59}
Rem. What comes out of heaven goes back there.
J.T. Yes, the Spirit has come out of heaven; that is what you get in verse 13: "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven". It is not *in* heaven. It is not going to heaven, but bringing heavenly conditions down. "Who is of heaven, give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him". There it is the plural -- not 'him', but "them". I think it is collective.
Ques. So heavenly conditions furnish the house for the Lord's presence?
J.T. That is the thing. It is not that He will not come without them, because He came into Martha's house, and there was nothing much about her then that was heavenly; but you want Him to come and find conditions entirely congenial to Him. He may come, it may be in a judicial character, and then He has to rebuke us, taking a judge's character towards us.
J.C.S. I take it that what you have been drawing our attention to is in order that these conditions might be planted in the hearts of the brethren in the various localities, so that the Lord is really at home amongst them.
J.T. That is it. He is praying in the *place;* He gives the lead, as it were, and the disciples were glad to take advantage of it; so one said, "Teach us to pray". Then the Lord immediately says, "When ye pray, say, Father". It is not, 'our Father in heaven'; that is not Luke's line. He wants to set us up in liberty. When you pray say, "Father, thy name be hallowed". You want conditions suitable to *that* name: "thy name be hallowed". "Thy kingdom come". These are the features of prayer that He teaches us in this passage.
S.F. "Father" conveys what is general. As you have remarked, it is "Father". Sometimes it is "our Father".
{60}
J.T. In this passage I think it is the liberty we have with God. The Lord sets us up in liberty with God, so we can address Him as Father. It is very precious in our locality that we can address God as Father. Then we are concerned as we take that name on our lips. It should be as hallowed; there should be no uncleanness, or unholiness, or unrighteousness connected with it. Then, "thy kingdom come", meaning that we are not trusting in human power. At the Reformation they called in the civil powers to support them. Protestantism, as its name indicates, is really a protest against Romish encroachment, where the kingdom of God was set aside. Rome was guilty of that. This prayer brings in the power of God; you can rely on that. I mean that power is involved in the thought of God's kingdom.
E.B.McC. Is that connected with the mount where He was praying?
J.T. That was the kingdom in power.
J.C.S. So where the furnishings are right there would be no room made for any other kind of power in the assembly.
J.T. That is what the kingdom means: The kingdom is really the bulwark for us. You can count on God, and go on. You would not call in the powers that be. That is where I think the Reformation failed. There was an ignoring of the power of God in the kingdom, which would have supported them; and if that had been recognised I believe they would have gone on to the assembly. It brings about a sphere in which you are protected. Then it says further, "Give us our needed bread for each day;" In this -- that is godliness -- we bring God into our daily circumstances. This saves us from aspiring to be rich. Paul says, some, having the love of money, "pierced themselves through with many sorrows", @1 Timothy 6:10. This part of the prayer would save us from aspiring to be rich: "Give us this day our
{61}
needed bread;" Then it says, "Remit us our sins, for we also remit to everyone that is indebted to us".
There I think we come down to the brethren. In our relations with one another the attitude is remission; we are not seeking self-vindication or giving offence to the brethren, Your heart is forgiving. You expect divine forgiveness only in the measure in which you forgive; that is the way in which you have forgiveness. The next thing is, "Lead us not into temptation", a great word for the young people, because in every town and village, as well as in the cities, there are tempting things -- picture shows, theatres, dancing, and other things that are seductive. It is a very wholesome prayer, it seems to me, for the saints in every locality if we are to be preserved and furnished so that we are not led into temptation. I believe every one of us here, in reverting to his past experience, will remember how God graciously protected us from things that would have ruined us. I think the formula here is, in its elements, the groundwork of conditions that the Lord can approve of. He then proceeds to a parable; in which He opens up the great gain of prayer -- what you may get through it -- namely, the Holy Spirit.
J.C.S. The Holy Spirit, in this light, comes in answer to prayer. That is how Luke presents the Spirit. I was thinking how it further supports the thought that Luke seems to connect everything with prayer -- the great means whereby these things reach us.
R.McM. One who gets the Spirit in this way would use the Spirit; it is subject to desire.
J.T. I think this prayer makes room for the Spirit. If it is honestly uttered there is room for the Spirit to come in.
Ques. And would there be something for the Lord?
J.T. That is the thing. If you make room for the
{62}
Spirit He will make room for the Lord. He is here on account of the Lord, and if there is liberty He will make room for Him.
G.R.G. Is this the Spirit in the house -- a collective thought?
J.T. Yes, it is; it is to them that ask Him.
J.C.S. And the Father, who is of heaven, is He who gives the Spirit. Is that the connection in which the Spirit is given?
J.T. I think so. It is in order that there should be heavenly conditions on earth, that is the point: "The Father who is *of* heaven", @Luke 11:13. It is the character.
Ques. Would you say that the Spirit never forces Himself?
J.T. He does not; and you have the words, 'grieve' and 'quench'. Of course, wherever Christ is dishonoured He resists, for He cannot bear dishonour to Christ, or any unrighteousness.
J.C.S. Is this like the dove coming down?
J.T. That is it exactly. The dove is a very sensitive creature; I think she is a sample of that. She found no rest for the sole of her foot. She is not like the raven. The dove is discriminating, it seems.
J.C.S. I think that is very suggestive, and seems to give a beautiful climax to what we have been considering. Not only are there conditions now for the Lord Jesus to come to, but the Holy Spirit can come; there is nothing to disturb Him now.
R.J.W. The dove seems to suggest affections -- affections that belong to the assembly.
J.T. It says of the dove, she returned *to Noah* into the ark; meaning that, typically, there was a link of affection there.
R.T. What is your thought in connection with the Spirit being mentioned only once in @Colossians 1 Is it that the greatness and glories of Christ come before us?
{63}
J.T. I think it is rather that the Spirit's *work* is in evidence there. He is much in evidence in Romans, because Romans is the foundation; but I think Colossians contemplates His work. He says, "You ... hath he quickened". @Colossians 2:13. It is the work of the Spirit. The Spirit is mentioned in Colossians only in connection with *love*.
Ques. Are the parables spoken here to encourage persistency in prayer in the sense of need: "Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of"? @Matthew 6:8.
J.T. Yes; He gives the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.
Ques. Would it be right to pray for an increase of the Spirit in connection with our local assembly?
J.T. It would, indeed. How different things would be, under certain circumstances, if opportunity were afforded the Spirit of God. This passage is to encourage us to get on that line.
L.D.B. The sensitiveness which you mentioned is very suggestive. It says, "the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot", @Genesis 8:9. What sensitive discrimination!
J.T. The Spirit takes account of *life*. The dove came back the second time with an olive leaf plucked off. She did not pick up a dead leaf -- it was plucked off; as if to remind us that the Spirit takes account of the energy of life.
R.J.W. Can the Spirit work from that?
J.T. He can, even if there is only one living one in the company. If the conditions which the prayer indicates exist I believe the Holy Spirit has liberty.
S.F. Would true prayer to God open up the channel for this unspeakable blessing to be enjoyed down here?
J.T. That is right. What the Lord says here is to encourage us to persist, because that is the only solution for local discord. The thing is to bring in the Spirit.
{64}
H.L.D. Would it be right to pray for the Spirit now?
J.T. It would be right if you did not have Him. I should not pray for Him if I had Him.
A.H.R. Would you encourage us to pray that there might be conditions for Him to come in?
J.T. Quite. That He might act in power. I should not like to weaken the Scripture which says, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him", @Luke 11:13.
J.C.S. The Spirit has come in answer to desire. If there is no desire one cannot think of the Spirit coming in this connection.
Ques. What gives the desire?
J.T. The knowledge that conditions locally are not according to heaven, and that He is available to prayer.
R.J.W. Would it be a heart's desire? It says of David, in @Acts 13:22, "I have found David ... a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will". And then the apostle reminds them of God's promise, as it says, "I will give you the sure mercies of David", @Acts 13:34.
J.T. The Lord brings in the fathers after the flesh and compares them with the Father which is of heaven, and shows the greatness of *His* giving.
Ques. What do you say about Cornelius in that way-he prayed to God?
J.T. He prayed as one having light. One may pray without having the Spirit; he did not have the Spirit.
A.R.G. In what connection is the Spirit received here -- as indwelling?
J.T. I take the incident at Ephesus, in @Acts 19, as an example. "Have ye received the Holy Spirit since ye believed?" That is what they needed.
A.R.G. That is collective.
{65}
J.T. It is.
R.J.W. That is, there were twelve men there, and the prayer is all in the plural.
J.T. That is what was needed. Paul laid his hands on them and they received the Spirit. That was the foundation of the Ephesian assembly, wherein there were conditions that would agree with heaven.
A.R.G. Is the thought making room for Him amongst us?
J.T. That is the idea.
H.L.D. Would this refer to Pentecost? There they were praying.
J.T. No doubt. This was written long after Pentecost, and it is to encourage us to pray; because if you see brethren biting and devouring one another, how can you tell whether they have the Spirit or not? The question is whether they have.
J.C.S. The idea is that the furnishings would all be orderly, beautiful; all animated with divine love flowing from the Spirit. It is a place where the Lord can come and feel at home, and the Spirit can rest without being disturbed, and the brethren can rest.
J.T. You see it in Ephesus. Paul represented the Lord in visiting Ephesus after the assembly had been set up. He embraces them as he leaves them, and then, as he returns and calls for the elders, they embrace him. There is the evidence of spiritual affections. If the Lord Himself had come He would have been received just as Paul, because Paul was His representative. As he went to Tyre, as recorded in the next chapter (@Acts 21), the brethren, their wives and children came out to the seashore, and all kneeled down together and prayed. There you see heavenly conditions. What a spectacle for heaven as they were all there with the apostle! Then in Ptolemais he went up and saluted the brethren, and spent a day with them; @Acts 21:7. "The brethren" is a heavenly suggestion. He *saluted* them; he did
{66}
not rebuke them; there was evidently nothing to rebuke. Then he came to Caesarea and entered into the house of Philip the evangelist. That dignified name, which was undoubtedly fitting, is given to Philip. It says, he "had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy". @Acts 21:9. The Spirit of God is pleased to say they prophesied and they were virgins. These are heavenly suggestions. The Lord Himself would have been quite free had He come to this place with Paul. I think the apostle's last journey to Jerusalem is to bring these facts into evidence -- the great results of his ministry. There is nothing said about his ministry; the evident results were there, because it says they spoke to him by the Spirit.
L.D.B. To follow up the first scripture we looked at, the saints in this place were now different, and their garments were white and glistening.
J.T. That is the thought exactly.
J.C.S. So they learned to walk on high places.
J.T. Just so; and the fact that the Holy Spirit testified to him in every city shows He was free in the assemblies in these cities. He could speak through a brother, because, if He testified to Paul, it was through some brother or sister in the place.
J.C.S. They were well furnished there.
L.D.B. Do you think it is all possible still?
J.T. I do. It is what the Lord is aiming at now -- to have "gardens" into which He can come and feed among the lilies.
Rem. The brethren dwelt together in unity in the places mentioned.
{67}
THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE COLLECTIVELY
@Judges 14:5 - 9; @Colossians 2:6 - 9
J.T. I thought the Lord would be pleased to help us to see in these passages something of how life is developed, and how it appears collectively. It occurred to me that the passage in Judges affords the initial idea of collective life; that is, it is life out of death-not simply the light of life, but active life. Perhaps creation affords no better illustration of life in activity- than that of bees in the hive. The Spirit of God seems to employ these creatures to illustrate the energy of life in a company. We may see life illustrated otherwise, as it appears in an individual, but I think this type is life out of death seen properly in a company. It says, as "he returned to take her (his wife) he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion, and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion, and he took thereof in his hands and went ...". We see there, I think, a type of the Lord appropriating the result of His death as it appeared in life. It is not the abstract idea of life, but the concrete idea. Thus it is a type of those who have come out of His death, being active in producing that which is acceptable to Him.
E.B.McC. I think that is very helpful. It would set forth the activities of the assemblies in life.
J.T. The great point in reference to life is that it is out of death according to what it is for God, and we have in @Hosea 6 an example. Verse 2 says, "After two days will he revive us; in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight". @Hosea 6:2. The Lord, I believe, in showing Himself alive to His disciples after He rose, intended to set out before their eyes what life is as before God. "He showed
{68}
himself" to them "alive"; not 'risen'. Of course He was risen, but the point was "alive". Everyone who rested his eyes on the Lord during those forty days, especially when He intended to convey the idea of life as manifestation, would remember ever afterwards what the divine idea was, and would seek to be conformed to it. Colossians is intended to bring about in us conformity to Christ as alive; indeed, it is said, as we read in chapter 2, "He had quickened together with him". I understand the word 'together' has reference to the saints. So that, as quickened together with Him, the thought is we are to live with Him, as He is. Then again, in the prophet Isaiah, in the case of Hezekiah, we have a further thought of the living -- in life; his soul is delivered. Hezekiah was cut off figuratively in the meridian of his life, but he is made to live. He is brought up from the gates of the grave, and he says, "The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day", @Isaiah 38:19. So that we are to live in God's sight according to Christ, and then praise as in life.
E.B.McC. Hezekiah would set forth one who would arise from the dead, and as risen he says, "The living, he shall praise thee".
J.T. Yes, and it is in the house of the Lord; and so the Psalms end, as we have often remarked, with everything that has breath praising the Lord. The great thing is to see that it is all living -- everything that has breath. I think that our meetings for worship sometimes run short of breath. We do not run short of words, because they have been coined for us; others have used them; they are thus ready made. But it is not words only, it is breath expressed in words; and if we run short of breath, so to speak, it is wise to stop. We have to admit it. We are not equal to very much that is for God. We are equal for more that is from God.
{69}
E.B.McC. Breath means spiritual life.
J.T. Yes, that is the idea of breath.
R.J.W. Do you connect that with @John 20 in any way?
J.T. Well, the Lord breathed into them. That would be that they were to have His Spirit. Whilst we are down here we need the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
W.J.P. Do you connect @John 6 with support?
J.T. Yes, the "bread of God" is the support of life.
J.C.S. Do you think the Lord Jesus in @Acts 1 presented Himself "living" so that they might have some idea of life according to God?
J.T. Well, I thought that. You see, all that happened during the forty days was a pattern of what should come about later by the Spirit. Hence, among other things, He presents Himself alive, or living. They would see a living Man, and that would ever afterwards impress every one of them, and each one would say, 'That is what Christ was when I saw Him'. And Peter, in presenting Dorcas, presented her alive, or living. There would be a woman set down in the midst of the saints. They would have before them constantly a living woman. Lazarus was one of those that sat at table with the Lord -- a great testimony to life there.
Ques. Would Colossians answer to the forty days of our Lord?
J.T. That is what I thought. It is the working out of that in the Christian circle, or the assembly; we are to be brought into accord with Him. "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him". He is the test for all.
J.C.S. So that, to follow the figure, Colossians would show that the bees had been active?
J.T. I thought we might work it out that way. There were bees and honey, showing typically, that
{70}
the activity of life had yielded something the Lord would take up. He asks, "Have ye anything here to eat?" @Luke 24:41. They gave Him part of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb, and He took it and ate before them.
M.P.M. In that way He drinks of the brook by the way, and gets refreshment from His saints.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. What is the thought, He ate honey and went on?
J.T. It indicates, I think, what the Lord receives now from those who are alive from the dead, for the assembly is the product of His death. He looks for the sweetness of mutual relations among the brethren. It is delightful. The Lord's supper, for instance, rightly apprehended, is that we sit down together and feed on what is presented to us through the love of Christ seen in Him as dead; because it is a dead Christ that is before us immediately, not a living Christ. It is not that we remember Him as dead; we remember Him as alive -- as absent; but the memorial is, in the simplest sense, that He has been into death -- the blood separate from the body; that the Lord Jesus actually died, and that He died in love. Nothing can exceed the sweetness of that, as rightly apprehended. The saints sit down together and have communion in it, and love springs out of it. He gets His portion out of all that.
J.C.S. So that the love which is carried to us in the suggestion of a dead Christ is to be formative and productive. We have thus something in life answering spiritually to what was seen in Him during those forty days.
J.T. That, I think, is exactly what we come to. It is a question for us all, how much we are in that life as in the assembly; and we should not go beyond our measure in our activity there.
Ques. Would you say this evidence of life is to be seen here on earth?
{71}
J.T. That is really the Christian circle -- the green spot, anticipating the time when life shall be apparent everywhere. The Christian circle is the green spot now, and Colossians is to remove all that hinders; the thorns and weeds that grow naturally have to be kept out. That is what Colossians is mainly for, so that there should be full development of life in the assembly. There is thus the full result of "holding fast the head, from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God", @Colossians 2:19. The Lord gets His portion, and He gives it to the Father. There is an indication here (@Judges 14) that the Father gets His part.
W.J.P. Would that occur on Lord's day morning: he ate and went on, and gave to his father and mother?
J.T. Well, one would not strain the scripture or be fanciful, but there seems to be an indication there of what the Lord does. Samson "turned aside to see the carcase of the lion, and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion. And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat", @Judges 14:8,9.
G.R.G. Would that be an example of the Lord accepting the honeycomb from His disciples and appropriating to Himself the fruit of His own death?
J.T. Well, that is what I was thinking. In @Luke 24 He comes to them and says, "Have ye here any meat?" The bees had been working. The two had returned from Emmaus having had their share of the honey, because the Lord appeared to them in the breaking of bread, and they related that; but the others also had been working, because the Lord had appeared unto Simon, and they were all there together in the light of these things; thus the honeycomb was being formed. Hence when the
{72}
Lord comes, He says, "Have ye anything here to eat?" That put them to the test. He knew what was there, but He would bring it out.
W.J.P. How do you view the lion in death?
J.T. It is death, but now productive of life as Christ has been into it. It says, "it roared against him" (verse 5); but now the bees and honey are in the carcase.
E.B.McC. It sets forth the death of Christ, and the assembly coming out of His death.
J.T. Yes, it is a striking figure of that. The bees are in the carcase, and the honey was there; so that it is life out of death, or through death.
W.J.P. I suppose Samson's riddle would explain that.
J.T. Yes, quite.
J.C.S. If the Lord were to come and ask us whether we had anything to eat, it might be testing. Have we any honey, and are we in life?
J.T. It is not necessary that everyone should speak. It is a question of the power of life, as I remarked; because it may be that we need to hear something from Him that would be of more value than what we are endeavouring to say to Him. He would have something to say to us.
R.McM. Would we be conscious of what our measure is, and know when we are out of breath?
J.T. I think if we were with God we should know just when we had reached the limit of our worship. Of course the Lord helps us as we draw near to God, but there is much repetition of words, which should be avoided; and then a brother need not speak just because he is present.
Ques. Is the honey found in the assembly?
J.T. I think it is the product of mutual relations.
Ques. The result of the affections of the saints, would you say?
J.T. Just so, as set together in the assembly.
{73}
J.C.S. So that we should know when we are in assembly whether we are out of breath, so to speak; whether we are going beyond the power of life.
J.T. The Lord might have something to say. One idea in the assembly is that He speaks. He loves to hear our voices, but He speaks. The setting of 1 Corinthians is: in chapter 11 you have the Lord's supper; then in chapter 12 His operations; in chapter 13 it is love in the saints, which is the way of surpassing excellence; and in chapter 14 ministry.
J.C.S. So that when breath no longer remains, to keep up the figure, the Lord may address a word to us at that moment. It would be for us to listen then.
J.T. I think one feature of the assembly is for the very purpose that there might be divine speaking, which results in replenishment. There is always increase from the Head; increase, not through what we say, but rather in what *He* says. "Holding fast the head, from whom all the body", @Colossians 2:19 etc. The increase is in what comes *from* the Lord.
Ques. Are you limiting your remarks to when we are actually in assembly?
J.T. I am speaking for the moment of that, because as there you would look for the movement of life in what we are before God. The honeycomb represents more than one bee; it is the outcome of mutual relations, so there is something for the Lord.
J.C.S. I suppose there is no moment when the affections of the saints are so susceptible, or when they can be so readily impressed with what is spiritual. It seems really a unique moment for the Lord to address us at that time; He would say something to us.
Rem. The land beyond Jordan flowed with milk and honey.
J.T. Yes, just so; there is plenty there.
M.P.M. But we are not able to sustain our part very long; we have limitations.
{74}
J.T. Generally we cannot afford very much, and the Lord knows that we are very limited. It is wisdom to recognise our limitations.
M.P.M. The danger is of becoming artificial.
E.B.McC. Is there not a certain light governing us at that moment?
J.T. There is a certain light which governs us as we come together to break bread. Then there is the thought of what we are for God, and for that you need particularly to have power. Many break bread, and so far own they are helped and nourished, but do not go over Jordan; they are not disfellowshipped by that. They are in the assembly, but they lack the power to go over Jordan. It is as we recognise the Lord as Head that He would lead us to the Father. But then that is not all. 1 Corinthians shows there is more than that. As a matter of fact there is all that follows during the week as the extension of the saints having come together in assembly. This is one thing; but there is another, and according to @1 Corinthians 14 the assembly involves ministry, and prophecy edifies the assembly.
M.P.M. And would the light that governs us in coming together thus govern the Lord's ministry to us at that time?
J.T. I think so. A message from the Lord is opportune, and if we consult the saints we would find they enjoy it. We have to admit it, most of us need constantly to be ministered to.
H.L.D. Would there be a special character about that ministry?
J.T. No doubt there would. What we have just then been engaged with would lend a peculiar character to it. It would be a word from the Head.
S.F. Would you say that such a word would fit in well and come about when breath is exhausted?
J.T. Well, that is what I thought. The Lord might speak to us then.
{75}
Ques. Joseph said to his brethren, "come near to me". @Genesis 45:4 Would that involve the idea?
J.T. I think that leads on to the assembly -- to what we are before God. Then there were communications after that which Joseph made. That would fit in with what we were saying.
J.C.S. So you think a word at that moment would descend gracefully on the spirits of the saints.
J.T. It is the refreshment of the dew coming down mediatorially, I apprehend, because Hermon refers to Christ as the Mediator. I would like to leave with the sense that something came into my soul from the Lord; also that something had gone from me to Him.
Ques. Would you say that ministry from the Lord in the assembly would be productive of further breathing?
J.T. No doubt.
E.B.McC. It is the five words in the Spirit -- a word from the Lord.
J.T. Brevity is the thing, but each of the five words has its own weight and power.
Ques. It would be like a "word fitly spoken"? @Proverbs 25:11.
J.T. Well, just so; it is just a word, but it is fitly spoken, and becomes an ornament.
Ques. Would you mind saying a word about "in assembly"?
J.T. We come together in assembly to break bread; that is how we come together; and it is the beginning of the week. It would seem that @1 Corinthians 11, 12, 13 and 14 cover the whole week, because all the ministry that comes in is of a piece, but it begins with the breaking of bread.
Ques. Would you expect to find the savour of it at the prayer meeting?
J.T. Yes. The assembly's life is one of weeks, in a sense. We learn individually by the day; so you have the time between the resurrection of Christ and
{76}
the coming of the Spirit -- fifty days, or weeks (see @Leviticus 23); sometimes it is "weeks", sometimes "days". I think the weeks refer to assembly history, and the days to individual history.
Ques. The assembly would answer to the swarm of bees?
J.T. I thought that. @Judges 14 would give you the initial idea, not that one would be fanciful; but there is denoted in a Swarm of bees all the energy of life. They are all active, and there is the result. They are not working aimlessly. I think the bee represents life in its instincts. There are no creatures more marked by intelligent instincts than bees.
E.B.McC. The instincts of life were with Deborah -- the name meaning 'a bee'.
W.J.P. The bee always works toward the hive. It is not the individual idea.
J.T. It is collective. The bee works collectively.
Ques. Would you say that the honey given by, Samson to his father and mother would bring in the thought of the family?
J.T. No doubt. There is an indication there of what the Lord does.
J.C.S. The great thing to look for is the activity of life in the assembly. Colossians has been introduced as showing that certain things have to be guarded, or they will neutralise that.
J.T. Then another thing in regard to Samson. While there is much about his history that is very humiliating and extremely incongruous to us, to say the least, still, the life-line runs through his history, and this is developed in chapter 15. He finds a fresh jawbone of an ass, meaning that this life which has just begun must be sustained by being kept near death; death is ever there; and the Lord's supper, I think, maintains the death of the Lord in its freshness continually, so that we do not get far removed from it. If we do the life is not sustained, because
{77}
this life is out of death. It is a great principle of the life we have. He takes (as the better version reads) "a fresh jawbone". @Judges 15:15. Death had just happened. The Lord's supper should ever be as if it had happened just now; it should come to us as if we were present when it occurred. Thus the Lord's supper, rightly apprehended, maintains us in freshness -- it is a 'fresh' jawbone; so we are kept near the death of the Lord always. Then, later, he takes the gates, bar and all -- showing the energy of life in power -- and takes them up to the top of the hill before Hebron, which, I think, directs us to Colossians, which is our Hebron. It is before the world was. It is the purpose of God for us, outside the world. That is what you get in Samson, and I think it helps greatly as to the maintenance of life amongst us, because if I am to reach Colossians it is not enough that I have the Spirit of God; I must be formed. The Spirit is only mentioned once, and that is to say that they *loved* in the Spirit; that was the kind of love they had at Colosse. It was not a preferential love -- not of special friendships, but love like God's love. Love in the Spirit is general -- you love all the saints.
M.P.M. The word 'together' would come in there.
Rem. It is the privilege of all to contribute to the honey supply.
J.T. It is; every saint should have something. The Lord went after two on the way to Emmaus. I understand Emmaus means what is insignificant. The Lord, in going out after them and bringing them back, shows that He is concerned about the most insignificant believer. He appeared to these two; then they contributed. The most insignificant, as we speak, is intended to contribute.
M.P.M. It would be difficult to get a better illustration of the thought of mutuality than what is seen
{78}
in a hive of bees. They are all working together for the commonwealth.
Ques. Is there anything in the thought that it was a swarm -- not a hive? They had swarmed.
J.T. That word 'swarm' has been used a good deal lately. Where meetings are too large it is a wise thing to swarm, so that you may all yield something for the Lord.
E.B.McC. You were saying that bees have instinct.
J.T. I think they represent the intelligent instincts of life. We are brought into correspondence with Him in whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. In @Colossians 1 all the fulness dwelt in Him personally; but in the second chapter it dwells in Him bodily, so as to be within our reach, and we are "filled full" in Him. That I take to be objective truth; that is, we are circumcised in his circumcision, "in the putting off of the body of the flesh" @Colossians 2:11 -- the power of it; then we are baptised and risen with Him: "buried with him in baptism" @Colossians 2:12; buried and risen with Him through the faith of the working of God, who raised Him from among the dead. So that positionally we are set up in relation to Christ as risen, as He was during the forty days. Then we are quickened -- quickened together with Him. By the Spirit we are made to actually live with Christ, and this is the ground of the Christian circle. We are brought into correspondence with Christ, and made to live with Him in our affections.
J.C.S. That is the answer to Christ presented living -- I mean the answer to it in the saints.
J.T. Exactly. *We* are living now-we are living *with Him*.
R.J.W. It says in the Acts, "he presented himself living after he had suffered" @Acts 1:3; He assembled with them.
J.T. That is very good. The living One -- He assembled with them. In @Colossians 2 He has blotted
{79}
out the handwriting of ordinances that stood against us; He has taken them out of the way; and then He spoils principalities and powers, making a show of them openly. Everything is removed, so that we need not be hindered by legal requirements -- things belonging to a past dispensation but which have been set aside in His cross.
J.C.S. None of these things have any place in that sphere where there is life out of death.
J.T. He has taken the handwriting out of the way. Now there is room for the development of life; so the next thing is, we are to hold the Head. The whole body, as it says, is nourished from Him: "From whom all the body, by joints and bands, having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God". @Colossians 2:19. There is development of life from Christ.
H.L.D. Do you think the saints touch life in part here and there, but do not continue in it? The great objective seems to be life.
J.T. I think we are very spasmodic. We touch it occasionally, but it is the continuance of the thing we should be concerned about. The object of the chapter is to develop life.
J.C.S. The continuance of it depends on how near we keep to the death of Christ.
Ques. What is the increase of God?
J.T. It is increase according to Him. If you look at the creation you see what wonderful bounty God has -- how rich the supply is. No matter what part of the creation you look at, there is abundance. Take the heavens, see the immensity of things; or on the earth the same thing appears-the abundance of everything as God gives it. So, if you look at the Christian company, the increase is of that kind -- it is great; it is according to God.
Rem. If you take the figure of the bees in the activity of life you get increase.
{80}
J. T. The thing is to increase in love according to the pattern of Christ -- the increase of God.
J.C.S. How do we hold the Head?
J.T. In our minds and affections. You apprehend Christ as He is. In Colossians He is Head personally; in Romans morally. In Romans He comes into my soul on moral grounds, because He is my Saviour; He has done everything for me, and eclipses all else. He supersedes everybody on moral lines. But in Colossians He is Head on personal lines, being what He is, He is the beginning of the creation of God. He is the Head of the body, the assembly. He must have pre-eminence in all things, because of what He is personally. Then in the epistle to the Ephesians He is *made* Head. God has made Him Head of the body now. We have to apprehend Him in these three lights in order to rightly hold the Head.
R.J.W. In Romans there is the power to solve all questions of good and evil, and in Ephesians He is able to bring to pass all the purposes of God.
J.T. In Colossians you hold Him as He is presented there; then nourishment comes in from Him, and God gives the increase. There is the working of the joints and bands, and God gives the increase.
W.J.P. Would holding the Head safeguard us from turning to any other source?
J.T. I often picture Mary Magdalene in @John 20. Suppose you went to her with the latest book on philosophy and said, 'Mary, here is something that will help you'. What would she think? The Lord was there, and He was everything to her. She needed nothing outside of Him. She would say, 'I don't need it'. That is the point in Colossians; you do not need anything outside of Christ.
L.D.B. There is a book that sometimes troubles us a little -- the hymn book.
J.T. Sometimes, I think, our brethren come to the assembly with the hymn book and leave the Bible at
{81}
home, which, to my mind, is an indication of a want of understanding of the assembly. They do not expect God to speak to them. The principle of the Bible is that God speaks to us; the principle of the hymn book is that we speak or sing to God.
Ques. Do you think we arrive at the thought of His Headship in Colossians as we apprehend Him as the Son of His love?
J.T. That is it. We are translated by the Father out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of His love. So He should be before us.
W.J.P. You would encourage us to bring both Bible and hymn book?
J.T. Certainly. "The word of God and freely addressing him" is the principle of Christianity.
M.P.M. What you say brings in necessary adjustment for many of us.
E.B.McC. You were speaking elsewhere of the highest note. How would that come in with a word from the Lord on Lord's day morning?
J.T. It is like the angel going up in the flame in Judges; but that would not hinder Him speaking.
J.C.S. It is the climax on the upward line, the other is the downward line.
J.T. Exactly.
E.B.McC. Would you think giving out notices at the end a right thing?
J.T. That means that you are closing the meeting, and is not right. If anyone undertakes to do anything that he means to indicate is the closing of the meeting, then I think he is a little out of line, because the assembly is left open; it is a weekly thing. It is the Lord's matter, not mine; it is *His* assembly -- it is left open. I think all that follows in the week is a continuation of the assembly.
S.F. That is, our time expires, and it is necessary for us to go home, but as to the meeting, I like the idea that, it is left open.
{82}
G.R.G. "He ... went on eating". Does that indicate that the supply of honey was continuously available?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Would you say our meeting this afternoon is an outcome of this morning's meeting?
J.T. Yes, certainly.
Ques. Should we always be moving on that line, in connection with what you were saying about the meeting being left open?
J.T. Yes. It is available for the Lord when we come together; there is something for Him. @Numbers 28 prescribes the number and order of Jehovah's offerings, and we are to be there to offer them.
G.H.C. I think the end of Luke confirms what you have been saying. After the Lord partook of the fish and honeycomb He spoke to them and opened their understanding, so that they might understand the Scriptures, and then He led them out to Bethany.
{83}
POWER FOR WITNESS
@2 Kings 2:1 - 14; @2 Kings 5:1 - 14
J.T. There are some passages in 2 Kings that I believe the Lord would use to link on with what we have had in Luke. What we have had in the gospel of Luke in connection with prayer as seen in the Lord Jesus has in view that we should be witnesses. He said in the last chapter, "*Ye* are witnesses of these things", but they were to remain in the city. He said, "I send the promise of my Father upon you"; @Luke 24:48 - 49 but they were to remain in the city until they should be clothed with power from on high; that is, the witnesses are to be clothed in heavenly power. Prayer is the secret of power, and it occurred to me that this book of 2 Kings fits in with that teaching. We see how Elisha clings to Elijah, Elijah emphasising that the Lord had sent him to different points. It begins with the statement that Jehovah would take up Elijah into the heavens by a whirlwind, and then it says, "Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel". Elijah lays stress on the Lord having sent him to the places mentioned; he was under divine control -- an important point for all of us, especially in connection with witnessing. The Lord emphasised in the prayer that we read this morning that it was to be the Father's will -- "Not my will, but thine", @Luke 22:42 and Elijah here emphasises that point. He says, "Jehovah has sent me to Bethel", etc. But the exercise that comes out in Elisha is what underlies this dispensation: "As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee".
{84}
We have to understand that; and then finally, as he traverses the whole course involved in the testimony of God with Elijah, he now asks a double portion of his spirit. The dispensation of grace is set up in type in Elisha.
Then, subsequently, we have the development of a Christian in the light of all this; that we find in chapter 4 where the widow of the prophet comes in typically for the Spirit -- she receives the Spirit. She learns that there is an unlimited supply; the limit was in the vessels. Then she has to sell the oil, pay her debt and live of the rest. Following upon her we have the woman of Shunem, who is said to be a "great woman". She makes room for the man of God; she is concerned about the testimony; Then she receives her son back from the dead. Then the "great pot" is set on, and the poisonous weed is brought in, and death is in the pot; Elisha remedies it by "meal". The meal would point to the humanity of Christ. Then we have the "man from Baal-shalisha", pointing to the *heavenly* side of the truth. Following this we have the little maid, who represents, as I understand, the testimony that is rendered by the Christian in the light of all this. One's exercise is that we might see how we may be evangelical without presuming to be; without taking up any official place, because that is what she represents -- effective work, and yet no pretension to be anything officially. Hence it is within the range or every Christian, but it can only be effective in those who have developed on the lines indicated in this chapter.
J.C.S. So that the various points or suggestions that you have indicated thus lie within the range of all. There are possibilities for all the people of God, and these things must really be true of us before the testimony can flow out from us.
J.T. That is it. If you leap over chapter 4 you may have evangelical christendom, but there is no
{85}
power according to God, and there must be some claim to official position to make up for that.
J.C.S. So that your suggestion is that the thing can go on today without any pretension; it is carried on on moral grounds.
J.T. Yes; and what comes out in the ministry of the little maid, confirmed as it was by Elisha, is that it is a question, not of the person who preaches, or to whom the light comes, but of the *authority of the word*.
E.B.McC. So that is why you emphasised "Jehovah has sent me", and linked it up with the Lord, who says, "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you". @John 20:21.
J.T. Quite; then the word of the little maid had to be accepted by Naaman, and later, the word of Elisha, if Naaman would be cleansed, The basis of the dispensation in its bearing is in subjection. The first great lesson is subjection. The Lord Jesus taught that in His own path here, and what God found in Christ is the standard; He could not be satisfied with anything less than that; that is the principle.
E.B.McC. That is brought about, you say, by suffering. That is the only way. "To make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings", @Hebrews 2:10.
J.T. So I think, the Lord taking up Paul, who is a great exemplification of the dispensation in its heavenly character, says, "I will show him how great things he must suffer", @Acts 9:16. Suffering went with the ministry.
J.C.S. He was to be both a witness and a minister, and that is what you are leading on to, is it not -- that there might be witnesses here?
J.T. We cannot jump over chapter 4, and take up chapter 5 of 2 Kings. It is a well-known gospel chapter, but in order to preach from it one has to understand chapter 4; he has to understand chapter 2
{86}
also, but chapter 4 is of special importance. It shows us how we come in for the Spirit, and discover that the supply is unlimited; the limitations are only with us.
M.P.M. Is it similar to the thought of the Spirit in Romans: "the Spirit is life because of righteousness"? @Romans 8:10
J.T. Just so. The Spirit enables you to discharge every moral obligation, because no one can be a witness for Christ who has any undischarged obligations.
R.J.W. Is that why the woman is said to *live*? She is not a finger-post, but a living witness.
J.T. She has discharged all her obligations, paid all her debts, and lives.
J.C.S. So that according to this light there is no excuse for having obligations undischarged. All the possibilities lie in the Spirit, so that you have power to fulfil them.
J.T. I think that generally in Christendom chapter 4 is ignored, hence the world has to be appealed to for support. They resort to the world; subscriptions are taken up sometimes in large proportions. The work of God is carried on by the support of the world, whereas the support really is in the Spirit, and chapter 4 shows us the unlimitedness of the Spirit. The limitations were only with the woman; as there were no more vessels the oil stopped, but there was enough for her to pay her debts and live of the rest. Then what follows upon that is a great woman. Not great in the world's estimation, because she did not want worldly distinction; she said, "I dwell among mine own people", @2 Kings 4:13. She was a great woman because, typically, she had acquired the Spirit. She acquired the knowledge of the unlimitedness of the Spirit; hence she uses her means to provide a room or house for the prophet, the vessel of the testimony.
{87}
Then her son is given back to her from the dead, and the man from Baal-shalisha comes in, showing that there is a heavenly supply. Then we have the little maid. She is a type of the kind of witness that is rendered, for all this shows that there is no pretension at all; she is just a little maid serving, waiting on her mistress, having been taken captive by the Syrians.
M.P.M. So that the little maid is in accord with all we have seen in the earlier chapters?
J.T. Yes, quite; I believe her testimony embodies all this.
M.P.M. There is very little to take account of *outwardly*, but much to strengthen and build us up *inwardly*.
J.C.S. I suppose Christendom, in a way, has really ignored the Lord -- ignored the supply.
J.T. I think so; that is how the matter stands; whereas the Lord would call us back to the supply and enable us to witness without pretension -- without claiming to be officials.
M.P.M. Would you explain what it means to pay one's obligations; it may not be clear to all?
J.T. Well, @Romans 8 puts it concisely: the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in us "who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit". @Romans 8:4.
Ques. Would it be fulfilled in the maid waiting on Naaman's wife?
J.T. Well, she is content to do that; she accepted her circumstances without murmuring. The little maid is not marked by any national feeling; there is no resentment at all. Were she influenced by national feeling she might have said, "Let him die, the Syrians are our oppressors". That would be national feeling, but she has none of that; she wants him healed. He is a leper, and she knows who can cleanse him, and so directs him to Elisha.
I think this passage helps us to be content to
{88}
serve without any public recognition at all. Those who *really* serve Christ today have no public recognition, nor do they seek it. They may be "unknown, and yet well-known", because the world may pretend not to know you, even though it does know you.
A.H.R. Going back to chapter 2, is this what you would term the double portion of the Spirit?
J.T. I think the double portion is the portion of the firstborn, and it marks the whole dispensation. It is for every believer. The Spirit is here now in an unlimited way; we come into it. The double portion is what characterises the whole dispensation.
J.C.S. As you were saying, the little maid served in obscurity, but one would gather that in the exercise of her service she had discharged her obligations in such a way that her testimony was effective.
J.T. Apparently so; it weighed with them.
E.B.McC. She had light and faith. She had no doubts in her mind.
J.T. None whatever. She did nothing, but gave her word. Her word put the test for Naaman. It tested him and the flesh in him; and the kings of Syria and Israel were exposed by it; but the word of the little maid stood. Then Elisha did not come out to see him; he sent a messenger, saying, "Go and wash in Jordan". But Naaman was angry and went away. If you do not believe the little maid you are tested by the message of the prophet.
R.McM. It is not only a question of the forgiveness of sins. The testing of the little maid suggested something more than that.
J.T. It did: "Would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria!" It is not 'with', but "*before*". He is a suppliant; he must take a humble place before the prophet. She is guided aright in her words.
S.F. She had carried the light of the God of Israel into that locality.
{89}
J.T. That is what I thought. What we should note is the entire absence of national feeling.
E.B.McC. She had light away beyond the officials of Israel; the king did not know what to say to Naaman.
R.J.W. Is she serving in the dignity and liberty of sonship as suggested in Romans?
J.T. Yes, typically. She is outside national feeling, she is in liberty.
J.C.S. She has apprehended the character of God's house in its universal aspect; it was to be a house of prayer for *all nations*.
S.F. Is it not worthy of note that the Lord uses this very incident: "Many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed saying Naaman the Syrian", @Luke 4:27.
J.T. The Lord brings that in in Luke, so it bears out what we were saying. I think she would be fully in the light if we take it up anti-typically. We are really here in the presence of a believer in the light of Ephesians; he is obscure outwardly, but he knows what he is saying -- he is definite.
Ques. I thought of what we had before us this morning of the Lord typified by Elijah. Is it necessary to company with him to know how to move?
J.T. That is what I thought. Elisha had to travel with him from point to point, each point representing some feature of the testimony, and then they cross Jordan. There are the sons of the prophets looking on. These are persons who stand afar off; they have information, but the information is second-hand, and Elisha knows better than they do. There are many who have information about the ascension and second coming of the Lord, but they have it second-hand, and the persons from whom they have got it know much more about it than they do. They may talk more about it, but the second coming of the
{90}
Lord is known to those who get it first-hand better than to those who get it second-hand.
M.P.M. He was to see him taken up; that is not a second-hand thought.
J.T. The sons of the prophets did not go in for that. As a matter of fact, they would deny the ascension of Christ.
A.R.G. Is there a good deal in the fact that the little maid seemed to take the situation on her spirit?
J.T. She felt for Naaman. I think you will see there is emotion in her remark. She said to her mistress, "Oh, would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria!" It is an emotional remark; she is not merely interested in a passing way, she is moved in sympathy for her master.
A.R.G. That would be the fruit of the Spirit, and that is the spring of our testimony as believers.
J.T. I am sure if you *feel* things the Lord will help you to meet them.
Rem. So being set up in the Spirit we should be able to fill any position we are placed in.
J.T. And fill it in a comely way, without any pretension to being officials.
J.C.S. Would what this little maid said answer to "the compassions of God"? @Romans 12:1.
J.T. It is an emotional remark. It is a poor thing if we are not moved. The Lord was moved with compassion; He had compassion on the widow of Nain, and Romans impresses us with the compassions of God. We are besought by the compassions of God (@Romans 12), so that it is God's feelings working out in us.
L.D.B. Bondmen are addressed in Ephesians. There are some interesting remarks about them. "Bondmen, obey masters according to flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity of your heart as to the Christ; not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as bondmen of Christ, doing the will of God from the
{91}
soul, serving with good will as to the Lord, and not to men", @Ephesians 6:5.
J.T. That is very interesting, and would fit in here.
L.D.B. The apostle would promote the spirit of the little maid amongst the Ephesian saints.
J.T. There is no indication that her position or circumstances were irksome to her. She served her mistress, as it says, "She waited on Naaman's wife". According to Titus, a slave may adorn the doctrine -- make it attractive even to an unbelieving master; and that involves emancipation of soul, that one is above one's circumstances, in the dignity of his heavenly calling.
Rem. That is the way the testimony is carried on at the present moment by those who are sympathetic with God, and His character is made known.
L.D.B. You mentioned that 2 Kings 2 - 4 brought us out as Ephesian saints in testimony.
J.T. That is, I think, borne out fully by the facts in these chapters.
W.W. I suppose what the little maid said was a word fitly spoken; she was an ornament in the house of God.
S.F. Would @Ephesians 3 help too: "Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named"? @Ephesians 3:15. There seems a widening out there. It is not within the confines of Israel, but widening out. This little maid seems to show a sympathetic spirit with what God was prepared to do.
J.T. Quite so.
J.C.S. I think one can see the importance of what you are calling attention to -- that the house might not only be furnished, but all is in divine order; all is divinely arranged so that the testimony may flow out from suitable conditions.
R.T. Could it be said that Elisha was marked by divine intimacy by being in company with Elijah?
{92}
He knew what had become of his master, and the sons of the prophets did not.
J.T. I think that is emphasised in his cleaving to Elijah; and then it says that they crossed the Jordan. They *walked and talked* as if the communion was now uninterrupted. It is not so much what they were saying, but that they were talking together. It was, as you might say, a Colossian position, as we had it yesterday -- they are on resurrection ground.
R.T. I was thinking, too, of the Lord speaking of His disciples: "because ye are with me from the beginning" @John 15:17; they learnt of Him.
J.T. Thus the witnesses were to know Him as received up. So the end of Luke gives us the Lord carried up into heaven, and they "returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God". @Luke 24:52. They are competent witnesses now, as having joy in their souls -- "praising and blessing God", it says.
Ques. In connection with Elisha, is there a challenge to our hearts as to how far we will go?
J.T. No doubt. He would go the whole length, and he is prepared to part with his own garments; he rends them in two pieces, meaning that he prefers the garment of the ascending man. It is like being clothed with power from on high. The disciples were to be *clothed*, as the Lord says. It does not comport with the modern clerical habiliments that we see; it is a heavenly garment.
Ques. Is that the reason why he divides Jordan on his return, as his master had done?
J.T. Yes; not in his own power, but in the power of the God of Elijah.
E.B.McC. Would that be the result of their talking together on the other side of Jordan?
J.T. He was intelligent as to what he was doing.
E.B.McC. And the result of that would be that the heavenly garments would be worn.
{93}
J.T. Quite. So now as he comes back over Jordan we have the dispensation inaugurated; a double portion of Elijah's spirit is here, and chapter 4 shows you how the believer comes in for that. It is not Elisha now; it is a distressed widow, she being a type of souls who are in distress -- they are in debt; so that chapter 4 is to show how the believer comes into all this. The Spirit is here already before any of us receives Him, and chapter 4 shows how we are developed as coming into it. As receiving the Spirit we become heavenly; and it is the heavenly believer really who is effective in testimony.
E.B.McC. You were speaking yesterday about giving and then receiving; that is the Lord's day morning meeting. There was the receiving as well as the giving; there should be time for that. Is that in your mind here?
J.T. What I have in mind is that chapter 4 shows how a needy soul comes in for relief in the Spirit, and develops from that into a spiritually great person; outwardly insignificant, but spiritually great. The Shunammite is said to have been "a great woman"; from that she developed appreciation of Christ risen from the dead, typically; that is Colossians. The first part of chapter 4 is Romans; the son received back from the dead is Colossians, and the third part Ephesians; the man from Baal-shalisha points to the supply coming in from heaven. All that enters into the witness -- the service of the little maid, and I think she may be taken to represent what God looks for today in the service of the gospel. I think it brings it down to the range of every one of us -- brothers and sisters alike -- the witness of this little maid.
M.P.M. Would it be seen in Onesimus, the slave? He was unprofitable, but in coming under the ministry of Paul he becomes profitable.
J.T. Quite.
{94}
J.C.S. Such an one would be fully furnished in view of the testimony.
R.J.W. Would Paul's discoursing be like the opening up of the position; it goes on to say "he conversed"; there was mutual enjoyment in it?
J.T. Just so.
J.C.S. Going back to the beginning of chapter 4, is there such an idea as a person in distress and in debt -- a person with the Spirit, but as yet not having learnt to use the Spirit?
J.T. I think there is. Peter and John began by saying, "Look on us. And he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none", @Acts 3:4 - 6. That means they were relying on the Spirit, the Spirit of God here; and if believers in Christendom were to see what the meaning of this chapter 4 of 2 Kings is, it would deliver them from human organisation. Every religious organisation today is dependent on the world for support, whereas Christianity primarily was dependent wholly on the Spirit.
S.F. Would the woman's confession that, "The creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen" have an application today? Since Pentecost things have been broken up, but the Lord by the Spirit is engaging our hearts with Christ. He is recovering light, and there is great encouragement at the present moment.
J.T. He is. I am sure he would lay it upon us who have the light to look about and see whether we cannot meet the need that exists, as we see in the case of this little maid.
J.C.S. Luke gives Peter's and John's going to the temple as being "at the hour of prayer". @Acts 3:1. Prayer brings in the heavenly resources.
Rem. I suppose the great woman would show them she was independent of all outside resources.
J.T. Yes, even Elisha was not in the mind of the
{95}
Lord in asking would she be spoken of to the king. She says, "I dwell among mine own people". Most people, particularly today, would be very glad to be spoken of to the king or to the captain of the host. We know well enough how people run after these things. Alas! some of the Lord's people, too, quite pride themselves in them. This woman rebuked all this. She says, "I dwell among mine own people".
H.L.D. I suppose this great woman carries another lesson: there was a lack in her soul.
J. T. There was. Souls represented by her need to understand Colossians. As you apprehend Christ risen you see that you are risen with Him.
H.L.D. Would you say she lacked Christ as an object for her affections, and that this was supplied by her getting a son?
J.T. Yes. I think Colossians is the teaching that fits in there. You have in Colossians an object for your heart, no less than a divine Person, and that divine Person brought within your range. "In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" @Colossians 2:9; so that Christ is our life. In Colossians we have an abiding object for our affections -- Christ is our life. "Your life is hid with Christ in God".
R.T. The sons of the prophets said, "The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha"; has that an application at the present day?
J.T. It is the Spirit of Christ, I think, as seen in the early Christians. There was a divine testimony that they were Christ's. Elisha was a reflection of Elijah; so the early Christians reflected Christ. @2 Kings 4 enables us to understand this.
Ques. Is there a point of correspondence between the little maid and Gideon's three hundred men who lapped?
J.T. Well, there is.
Rem. What you have suggested seems to greatly
{96}
reduce the number, like Gideon's army, but it makes it effective. It is remarkable that the sons of the prophets should be passed by, and the testimony be found in the little maid.
J.T. God's intent is that recipients of the light are to be brought into accord with the vessel through whom the light has come. It is not the divine intent that men should be benefited by the gospel and retain their greatness in this world. They do, but it is not the divine intent. So Naaman has to come into correspondence with the little child; he had a great deal to go through before he came to it. Elisha was faithful, and he would insist on the word; he did not show himself to Naaman. The latter must go by the word, and the word says that he should wash in Jordan seven times. Christ has gone into death to glorify God in respect of sin, and I must go that way. God is not going to let me off. I am not to retain my worldly greatness; I have to go down with Him.
H.L.D. Does it suggest that Naaman had reached that in asking for the two mules burden of earth?
J.T. I think he had reached the thought of God. The altar of earth is the acknowledgement of *what we are*.
Rem. He is no longer great in his own estimation.
J.T. Every one of us has to come to that. Elisha corresponds with the little maid's word. Naaman thought he would come out and lay his hand on the spot and call on his God. He had his idea as to how God should operate, but God would teach him that He has His own way of operating, and it is for man to submit if he is to be blessed.
L.D.B. The little maid had arrived at that. She said, "Would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria!"
J.C.S. Would @Romans 6 correspond in measure to this, as the way out of that greatness in which he stood -- closing the door on the greatness of man here?
{97}
J.T. Quite; that is the teaching of it. When he came up out of the waters of Jordan with his flesh as a little child's he would be reminded of the little girl. He would forget all about the king and the things connected with him; he would forget all that greatness, and he would consider himself so as to be on a level with the vessel the light had come through -- the little maid. He would now be material for God to take up and use.
J.C.S. It is very interesting, because it maintains the link of likeness. What is shown forth in testimony is reproductive of that kind of thing.
J.T. Yes, that is the principle with God. The vessel through whom the light comes to me is before me, and I correspond with that. It is not God's intent to enlighten men in this world and benefit them and allow them to continue on in their worldly greatness; it is not God's intent at all. He can never make any material out of a man like that; he is not material for the house of God until he comes down to a little child; he must obey the word. So Elisha gives the word and Naaman must obey it.
S.F. I thought of verse 9 of chapter 5: "So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of Elisha"; but the prophet does not go out to meet him.
J.T. I think that is very often the case. Men who would receive benefit from the gospel retain their greatness, and expect the servants of God to recognise them in it. But we must learn that this is not in keeping with the dignity of the testimony of God. Naaman was now before the vessel of this testimony, and he is told to wash in Jordan.
Ques. Would the thought of the little maid be found in the new name given to Saul of Tarsus?
J.T. Paul -- that is what he was, meaning small; evidently insignificant outwardly. It is very remarkable about Paul that he was the last mentioned in
{98}
the list of those who were in the assembly at Antioch; @Acts 13:1. It shows he is not a brother who would set himself up in the presence of the king; he would be content to be in the lowest room, and wait till he is called up higher.
Ques. Would you say something about Elisha's message to Naaman to wash in Jordan: "Go and wash in Jordan seven times".
J.T. It is a question of the death of Christ; he has to go down and dip seven times; seven times is the spiritual perfection of it. There has to be a definite acceptance of the death of Christ; one has to go down into it. Baptism is this -- the end of any greatness I may have in this world. Then @Romans 7 is the process that goes on in our souls, by which we learn experimentally what the flesh is. Christ is then known as Deliverer. It is by the Spirit that you get free practically from your state as seen in @Romans 7.
J.C.S. So whatever a man might be socially, whatever status he has in this world, when he takes up baptism, all that is gone, is it not?
E.B.McC. It is "the obedience of faith". @Romans 16:26.
J.T. It comes out in @Romans 6. They had obeyed from the heart that form of teaching. It comes out in Naaman. You must obey the word. The servants were wise; they said, "If the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it?" The prophet was not going to change his mind. Our salvation lies in obeying the word.
Rem. God is very sympathetic and compassionate. There is a passage in Jeremiah which brings out very beautifully a man going down. It is chapter @Jeremiah 31:18: "I have indeed heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus: Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised as a bullock not trained: turn thou me and I shall be turned, for thou art Jehovah my God".
J.T. Quite. This very important principle of
{99}
going down into the water is greatly emphasised in Scripture. We had it yesterday: "Into which few, that is eight souls, were saved through water", @1 Peter 3:20. So in Jeremiah there is a remarkable passage in which the prophet is told to take his girdle and go to Euphrates and hide it in a hole in a rock; but it says, "Dip it not in water". @Jeremiah 13:1. Then he is directed to go again, and the girdle is marred -- good for nothing. However near we may be to God outwardly -- as the people of Israel were His girdle about His loins -- unless we are dipped in water we are good for nothing. Many are outwardly very near -- actively engaged in the Lord's service, and yet in not accepting death they are ultimately good for nothing. We have to accept death; that is what Elisha insists on here. There is no change in the mind of God; the greatest man has to come down. There is only one way; in going down we accept the thing definitely. Thus Naaman's flesh comes again as the flesh of a little child. It is a new start -- born again. It is a new start; but more than that, he is cleansed.
Ques. Would it suggest resurrection -- the flesh of a little child?
J.T. I think it is what one is as cleansed. It refers to what we are spiritually now as accepting the death of Christ. I do not think this teaching goes beyond Romans, which prepares us for the assembly; it brings in the material for the assembly.
Ques. How does @John 3 come in here?
J.T. It synchronises in the sense that it is a new start: "It is needful that ye should be born anew" @John 3:7 is the thought.
E.B.McC. You come thus into the organisation of David. There is a state in which David has his mighty men -- not as great in the world, but like the little maid.
W.W. Would you say we see the evidence of a new start in the sensibilities that Naaman expressed?
{100}
J.T. That is what our attention has been called to: "Two mules burden of earth". He has sensibilities now of what is due to God. So in @Exodus 20:22 - 24 God says, "Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven ... an altar of earth shalt thou make unto me". That would be the acknowledgement of what we are before Him.
J.C.S. It is still Romans.
J.T. Quite; it does not go beyond Romans. It is remarkable how this word of the little maid works out. It exposes the whole world. The king of Syria, the worldly thoughts of Naaman, and the king of Israel are all exposed.
J.C.S. You want the testimony to go forth like that in Wellington.
J.T. Well, it is within the range of every one of us to bear witness to Christ. The privilege of this is indeed great.
{101}
PRAYER: CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PERFECT MAN (4)
@Luke 22:39 - 46; @Luke 23:34,39 - 43
J.T. We considered previously the Lord praying on the mount and the transfiguration that followed, which, it was thought, suggested a change in the believer as to progress in his soul. He takes on the heavenly colour, and is thus different -- marked off from ordinary religionists in this world. Then the furnishings in the local companies are in keeping with such a change, these furnishings being dependent on the Holy Spirit as given of "the Father who is of heaven", @Luke 11:13 as it says.
This passage presents the Lord praying in relation to His *sufferings*. It is obvious that in our progress, as we are identified with Christ here, we come in for sufferings, so that we may learn from this passage how we are to go through and endure them. There is to be entire submission, as we see in the Lord, to the will of God. Peter, in his epistle, works out how believers come into suffering as under the government of God here. They are not accidental -- they are designed under the government of God; so that Jesus is said to be a model for us in that epistle, as we read: "Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously", @1 Peter 2:23.
J.C.S. So that you think, whilst the sufferings of the Lord Jesus here were unique, yet in them He affords a pattern for us in our sufferings of whatever nature they may be.
J.T. That is what I had in mind. This evangelist says, "He came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. And when he was at the place he said unto them, Pray
{102}
that ye enter not into temptation. And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down and prayed", etc. Matthew and Mark tell us that He went to "Gethsemane", and John that He entered into "a garden", but Luke says He went to the "mount of Olives". I think the allusion is to the Spirit, for the position of the saints here involves that they are anointed by the Spirit, by the holy oil with which the tabernacle was anointed, which is, as you may say, the spirit of a suffering Christ. Hence in @Acts 1 we are told that He showed Himself living *after He had suffered*. His sufferings open up to one's mind a good deal. As He showed Himself to them alive after having suffered they had before them a model of what should mark themselves. It is life out of death; but then it is life out of sufferings, and it is given unto us on behalf of Christ not only to believe but to suffer. So that the passage, I think, opens up to us much of what it is to suffer. The mount of Olives affords shelter at the outset, because it suggests the Spirit and immediate proximity to heaven.
R.J.W. Would you say that the believer, in taking character from the Lord Jesus, partakes of the nature of the acacia wood?
J.T. Yes, exactly; he has the power of endurance.
J.C.S. You mentioned the fact that we receive the spirit of a suffering Christ. Would the very fact that we receive the Spirit in that light involve suffering -- we must be prepared to suffer as having received that spirit?
J.T. Yes, I think so. The only compound with which the tabernacle was anointed was composed largely of myrrh; there were other ingredients, but myrrh is mentioned first.
Rem. Would you say -- having the end in view fortifies us for suffering? He showed Himself alive -- the suffering was passed.
{103}
J.T. Yes, it is One alive, as having suffered. The idea of suffering is different from the idea of dying, although He died; they go together. Still He showed Himself alive after He had suffered.
S.F. This would be a prominent feature in Christianity at the present time, would it not?
J.T. I think it is. From the very outset it was intended that the saints should suffer. Paul speaks of filling up "that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the assembly", @Colossians 1:24. It would indicate that sufferings were to mark the saints, and Paul was zealous in this in so far as it lay with him. The idea should be filled out. Indeed, the Lord, in taking him up, had said, "I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake", @Acts 9:16. It was a part of his testimony.
S.F. So that the Lord Jesus is the model, and Paul becomes a great example to us.
J.T. That is the thought. We have, in one of like passions as ourselves, the continuation of the spirit of the suffering Christ, and it is "for his body's sake", @Colossians 1:24 he says.
J.C.S. So that the sufferings the apostle endured in relation to what was of Christ here on earth are still continued, because the spirit of that suffering Man is still here.
G.H.C. In @Psalm 45 we get the myrrh, aloes and cassia, referring to the Lord Jesus here.
E.B.McC. "The fellowship of his sufferings", @Philippians 3:10. Paul says.
J.T. It is that we are privileged to come into these -- to have fellowship in His sufferings; and one would especially note the mount of Olives, because there is shelter there. I think the Spirit is in view, so that you are not at your own charges. In going through suffering you prove what the Spirit is -- you know what the Spirit is to you. It may be noted that
{104}
the altar was anointed seven times. It suggests intense suffering.
W.J.P. Would the oil suggest healing?
J.T. Well, I think there is superiority in the Spirit to the sufferings. You see how perfectly it appeared in Philippi. Paul and Silas were thrust into the inner prison. It seemed as if the jailor, in his zeal to inflict the severest punishment, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks; they were scourged -- the most excruciating physical suffering; and yet it says, at midnight they prayed, and in prayer they praised God. There you see the superiority to the sufferings, by the Spirit.
Ques. Would Stephen afford an illustration of that?
J.T. I believe he is the counterpart of Christ. The manner in which he went through shows a superiority in the sufferings in that he was able to act as priest -- to intercede for his murderers. It is affecting. Can we find anything more corresponding to the Lord on the cross than Stephen exhibits? He was able to do just what the Lord did. The Lord said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"; Stephen says, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge". @Acts 7:60. He did not ask the Lord not to lay other sins to their charge, but not to lay that one. He was not resentful. I do not suppose Stephen would think of asking the Lord to remit the guilt of His own murder, but he did ask the Lord not to lay *that* one to their charge.
A.H.R. I was thinking, with regard to suffering, gladness and rejoicing flow out of it. Would you say He endured the cross for the joy that was set before Him; and we should be encouraged not to resent suffering, because gladness and blessing will follow?
J.T. Yes, indeed. "The joy that was set before him". @Hebrews 12:2. We cannot go through sufferings without the
{105}
Spirit; we shall otherwise complain and resent them.
J.C.S. So that both in the case of Paul and Silas in the prison and in that of Stephen there was some correspondence with the anointed altar.
J.T. That is what I thought. You will remember the passage in the types, "Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. And he sprinkled thereof on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels", @Leviticus 8:10,11. I think that calls attention to the need of the Spirit if we are to suffer. We have already dwelt on the need of the Spirit as coming out of heaven, as given of the Father for local conditions; but we need the Spirit particularly if we are to suffer as Christ suffered.
Rem. It is remarkable that oil should be the symbol used, because it is procured by the crushing of the olive.
R.T. Peter says, "Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind". @1 Peter 4:1. How does that apply?
J.T. It refers back to the third chapter (1 Peter), in which he says that Christ suffered for us in the flesh. Now you take that on. One arms oneself with the light that one, as it were, suffered in Christ's sufferings. The sufferings were all there -- suffering in the flesh; it was for sins. He suffered for us, so that you have done with sin. The point there is that you do not have anything more to do with sin, because as suffering in the flesh you have done with that. It is a remarkable enforcement of the sufferings of Christ in their bearing on our everyday life. You are not to sin again -- that is the bearing of that.
W.J.P. What we have to do is to *arm* ourselves.
J.C.S. What you are speaking of now relates to the vicarious sufferings of Christ.
J.T. Yes. But that is not the point in Luke. We do not get the forsaking of God in Luke. It is
{106}
rather how He accepted suffering. Luke mentions that He went to the mount of Olives, because, I think, he alludes to the Spirit.
W.S. Do you think the mount of Olives would suggest the reserves we have in the Spirit for suffering?
J.T. I think it does.
J.C.S. Would you enlarge a little on the idea of the altar being anointed?
J.T. What has been called attention to is worthy of notice, because the pouring of the oil seven times on the altar is obviously to call attention to the spiritual power needed for the suffering that had to be endured; and so the Lord, in the endings of the gospels -- that is, in the corresponding passages of the three gospels -- is seen in suffering. He is seen in that way as the altar, and what impresses you is His wonderful endurance. Everything is accepted from the will of God. There is not the slightest evidence of any resentment -- all is accepted from God.
R.J.W. Would you enlarge a little on what you said, that Christ Himself is the altar? The scripture says that the altar is greater than that which is put on it.
J.T. Well, I think the dimensions of the altar show that it was a type of Christ as suffering. It was five cubits broad, with horns, and three cubits high, that is, there was weakness. Christ was crucified in weakness, but at the same time there was power. Three cubits high refers, I think, to the *inherent* power of life that was in Christ. The horns also denote power. The suffering thus was borne in perfect submission to the will of God, and yet in perfect dignity.
E.O. Peter says, in connection with reproach, "The spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you", @1 Peter 4:14.
J.T. That comes in. As you endure sufferings there is testimony. You can see how it shines out in
{107}
Christ on the cross. The glory is in the fact that He says, "Father, forgive them". It was in wonderful accord with the mind of God. So with Stephen, the glory shines in remarkable power in a man of like passions with ourselves. That he should go through all that suffering, and yet be like Christ was a great testimony. He says, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge". @Acts 7:60.
G.H.C. You were speaking about abundant reserves in the Spirit for suffering; would that be indicated by the Lord praying more earnestly as the pressure increased?
J.T. It would. Prayer is the attitude. We were remarking that Paul and Silas prayed, and in prayer they praised God, showing their superiority to what they were enduring. What wonderful support must have been poured into their souls from heaven at that hour! And that is what we may reckon on. So the Lord is setting us an example here in that He prayed three times.
J.C.S. Paul and Silas did that in the power of the Spirit who had come down from that One who had suffered, so He could identify Himself with their sufferings.
F.H. Could you help us as to the form the sufferings might take at the present time?
J.T. We have the statement: "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus" (i.e., the anointed Man) "shall suffer persecution", @2 Timothy 3:12. As He was anointed He came into suffering. He was carried into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. As though God would challenge all the devil's power; in the power of the anointing Jesus would go through for God's glory. When the Philistines heard that David was anointed, they sought him out; and again, in @Psalm 2:2, it says, "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed". Now if any
{108}
man will live godly in *Christ Jesus* he shall suffer persecution. You are coming in for persecution. Wherever it comes from, it will come, because Satan will not let us alone as having been anointed. Then there is the privilege: "Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake". @Philippians 1:29.
S.F. On that line there is heavenly support. An angel from heaven strengthened Him.
J.T. That was another point I had in my mind to call attention to, because the angel is distinct from the anointing. Angels represent what is providential -- what has reference rather to our bodies. The Spirit has reference to our souls -- to what we are inwardly. The angel mitigates. Hence the Lord says to Smyrna, "Ye shall have tribulation ten days". @Revelation 2:10. It is a *limited* period. That was providential. The angel has to do with all providential things, and ministers to our bodies so that we should not succumb through physical pressure.
S.F. That is a very helpful distinction.
Ques. Would that touch the line of priesthood?
J.T. Well, no doubt. He comes in accord with the sympathies of Christ to support. Of course we may reckon on angelic help as He did here. In Matthew the angel has to do with public government, but in Hebrews it says they are "Sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation", @Hebrews 1:14. So that we may always reckon on angelic help in suffering.
A.H.R. Are there not two kinds of suffering here, the inward and the outward -- the suffering in the garden and the suffering on the cross?
J.T. Yes. The physical suffering had not yet begun. In fact all this is anticipative of what was coming; but the services of the angel ought to be well noted, because we may reckon on that, so that we are not tempted above that we are able. The
{109}
angel comes in to limit the thing. The Spirit carries you through, and you are like Christ in going through it; but there are limitations. We cannot endure as He endured, or Stephen, or Paul, so the Lord limits the trial to our measure. And I think the service of the angel is in that connection, as I have remarked about Smyrna -- the persecution would be, as it were, for ten days. It should not go past ten. That would be some angelic intervention to check the power that persecuted, and so it comes down to everyone of us, in detail, that the affliction goes just so far; it does not go beyond your power. The point is to go through it, whether long or short, like Christ; that is what God has in His mind.
W.J.P. There is a verse in Peter's epistle: "Kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation". @1 Peter 1:5. Is that a reference to the body or the soul? Would that imply angelic power?
J.T. It is the power of God through faith unto salvation -- the soul's salvation -- that Peter is speaking of there. He says also, "Wherein ye exult, for a little while at present, if needed, put to grief by various trials, that the proving of your faith, ... be found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 1:6,7. At present, if needed "we are put to grief by various trials". They come in for good, but are limited. The angel, I think, comes in for limitation.
E.C. Do you think there might be a suggestion here that the suffering might pass the limit of human endurance, but the angel extends the limit?
J.T. Well, it says, He "will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able", @1 Corinthians 10:13 and I think that is where the ministration of angels comes in, to limit the sufferings.
C.H.H. What do we learn from the Lord Jesus in the way He went through suffering? Is it that He
{110}
accepted it from God? He preferred God's will to being delivered from the suffering.
J.T. That is what comes out, I think. We are given His actual words elsewhere in this gospel. We are not told what He said in prayer. We are in John's gospel; we have the full prayer there recorded, but not in Luke. This, I think, is the first time we have His actual words, and it is to recognise the Father's will -- the will of God.
A.H.R. Is the angel the answer to the mount of Olives?
J.T. I think it is a collateral ministration. In our case the Spirit is one thing and the angel is another. My thought is that we should reckon on the ministration of angels in our sufferings, but go through in the power of the Spirit.
Ques. Why do we get the angel in connection with the releasing of Peter, while in the case of Paul and Silas there was no angel?
J.T. I think the angel is in the earthquake. Any physical interference or movement, I think, comes under the ministration of angels. The earthquake shook the foundations of the prison. In Peter's case the doors of the prison were opened and he was let out. There was no shaking of the prison, nor did the prisoners get any gain from what happened; whereas, in the case of Paul and Silas you feel there is a full answer to what we have here. It is what Luke would present -- the *prisoners heard*.
Rem. Paul and Silas prayed. By the Spirit they were enabled to pray; He comes in in that way; whereas it was not that with Peter.
J.T. Of course, we cannot tell definitely as to Peter. No doubt he prayed. We do know the assembly prayed for him, but the account indicates a state of unbelief, because they did not expect their answers. It was a weak situation; they were not looking for an answer to their prayers. That is a
{111}
humbling thing, that we should have prayer meetings without any expectation of answer to our prayers; whereas God had answered their prayers, and it was by angelic intervention. In the case of Paul and Silas there is a beautiful touch, in that the prisoners heard: I am sure there never had been such a time as that in a prison.
R.J.W. The other translation says, "the prisoners *listened* to them", @Acts 16:25. They were attentive.
J.T. It was a marvellous turning into testimony of the power of the altar, the power of endurance in the service of Christ; the expression, as it were, of heaven in the interior of a dungeon; and when the jailor would have killed himself, a voice comes out of the prison -- Paul's voice -- "Do thyself no harm, for we are all here". @Acts 16:28. It was a marvellous turning of suffering into testimony.
J.C.S. That must have been a very agreeable scene for heaven to look down on, and see the reproduction of what Jesus was here as the suffering One.
J.T. It was indeed a counterpart of it.
R.T. Can we view Paul in @Philippians 4 as one who had been under the formation of the Spirit? The Spirit of Christ is seen in him; he can say, "To know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings". @Philippians 3:10.
J.T. Philippians, amongst other things, sets out the sufferings of Christ. It emphasises the sufferings of Christ as part of Christianity. Philippians is like the tabernacle -- the anointing is there. The assembly at Philippi began in sufferings at the outset; it had its origin in those sufferings we have just been speaking of. It was the gateway into Europe; and it was of God that the testimony should go into Europe in accord with the tabernacle, because it was to be in Europe that the great features of the testimony could be developed, and it was in keeping with the mind of God that the light should come in through
{112}
these wonderful vessels at Philippi. The saints there had fellowship with the apostle in the gospel from the beginning -- "from the first day until now", @Philippians 1:5.
Ques. Would you say that prayer gives us power, and fortifies us to endure?
J.T. It brings in the power of endurance -- the Spirit.
J.C.S. So that, while the support of the angel may come in an indirect way, it is the support of heaven for those who are prepared to suffer on the lines you have mentioned.
Rem. The stone's throw is always maintained -- "He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw", @Luke 22: 41. He must always be pre-eminent.
C.H.H. Do you think formation comes through suffering?
J.T. No doubt. Then the imperial colour accompanies suffering: "If we suffer, we shall also reign". @2 Timothy 2:12. Purple was one of the colours in the tabernacle, so that I think the suffering of the present time corresponds to the reigning of the future.
M.P.M. At the first meeting you said that these incidents in connection with the Lord were constructive.
J.T. I think it is very clear that they are. They correspond with our spiritual progress. If we are to be witnesses for Christ here we must be prepared for suffering, and then the question is, how am I going though, and this passage shows us how; first by prayer, and then as actually in it you reflect Christ. He prayed for His murderers; and we shall not be wanting in recompense as following in His steps, because I believe the repentant thief was the recompense the Lord got at that time.
S.F. Do you think sufferings would bring about moral state in us for the testimony, so that we should be able to hold our ground? It is the way the
{113}
Lord Jesus has gone, and the apostle is an example.
L.D.B. We do not want to miss that allusion to the thief; if you would mention it again.
J.T. It seems to me very beautiful, as fitting in here. The blessed Lord had just expressed the glory. The glory shines: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do". It was the glory of God that there was a Man capable of expressing that in the midst of the most terrible suffering. There was, I believe, a recompense; it is in the thief saying, "Lord, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom". What joy it must have been to the Lord that there should be one in the midst of that awful situation who discerned the light that shone in Him! The light of the glory shone there, and the thief came in for it.
W.J.P. Was that the gift of the Father?
J.T. Well, it seems as if it were -- a sort of recompense. It must have come about rapidly, for we are told in another gospel that both thieves reviled Him. The light of the glory must have shone into His soul as to the Royal Personage who hung by his side. He had light as to the Person of the Lord -- what He was as Man. "This man has done nothing amiss". How did he know that? He could not know it historically. He knew it by *light*. It is by light we know things divinely. We do not know divine things by history, but by light; the light comes into the soul, and that settles everything.
W.J.P. I thought that would be like the case of Peter -- the revelation of God.
J.T. The light shone. I have no doubt it was the light that shone in Christ at that moment; the glory shone there.
L.D.B. Alluding again to the recompense: the Lord, thinking of the Jews, says, "I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought", @Isaiah 49:4. But in the thief He gained something
{114}
that would meet His heart -- compensation when He lost so much in connection with Israel.
Ques. Would that scripture apply, "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies", @Psalm 23:51 Would it be the Father strengthening, as it were, the heart of His Beloved One in such circumstances?
J.T. It appears so. We can, I think, somewhat enter into the thought of the Lord -- what it must have been to Him to have the thief with Him -- "To-day", He says, "shalt thou be with me in Paradise". He would have a companion there.
J.C.S. It lit up the dark surroundings for the Lord in the midst of suffering. The light that shone into the heart of the thief was a very great circumstance for the Lord in the midst of the darkness.
Ques. Would you say that God does not allow one moment's suffering unnecessarily? I was thinking of Paul and Silas. They prayed and sang praises to God. There was no murmuring, there was rejoicing; and His discipline, or whatever His dealings were, resulted in their answering to them.
J.T. Yes. Then they come in for bodily relief; in due time their very stripes were washed by the jailor.
R.J.W. The jailor was affected by the spirit he saw in them. It says he "washed them from their stripes", @Acts 16:33.
J.C.S. Going back to your thought as to this being constructive in view of the assembly down here, would it be right to speak of the assembly being the anointed vessel, and that the divine thought is that the light should now shine out through that suffering vessel?
J.T. I think that is the divine thought; so that a martyr is a witness. The idea of martyrdom is witness. To be a witness one suffers: but then the
{115}
thing is to suffer *like Christ*, according to the anointing; the spirit of a suffering Christ.
L.D.B. In speaking of the angel, as you have mentioned it, would it be right to connect it with the passage, "Thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns", @Psalm 22:21? I wondered whether there was interposition at that point.
J.T. The interposition of God for Christ was in resurrection. Christ was heard from the extreme point of suffering, Resurrection was the answer; and the next thing is, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren". @Psalm 22:22. He was raised by the glory of the Father. The answer there was not angelic; it was the direct intervention of the Father Himself.
E.B.McC. I was thinking of the last chapter of John. Peter there refers to John, saying, "And what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me", @John 21:21,22. The work had been done with John. The Spirit had had His way with him.
J.T. I think the Lord intimates to Peter, 'You are to be like Me at the end'. He says, "When thou wast young thou girdedst thyself, ... but when thou shalt be old ... another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not", @John 21:18. That is resignation -- he would be in accord with Christ's death.
E.B.McC. He was perfectly prepared for it.
J.T. Peter really wished for martyrdom, and the Lord says, 'You are going to have it, and you are going to be like Me in it'.
D.B. As to the support of the Spirit and the way in which we take suffering, James says, "Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you. Be patient therefore, brethren". @James 5:6,7.
J.T. The apostle says, "For thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter". @Romans 8:26.
{116}
E.B.McC. The apostles desired it; they rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.
J.C.S. Paul actually rejoiced in it.
H.L.D. It is referred to in Hebrews: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword, they wandered about in sheep-skins and in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented (of whom the world was not worthy). They got the support of the Spirit, I think, but evidently the angel did not come in for them.
{117}
THE LIFE OF JESUS AND LIFE IN THE SON
@John 1:4; @Genesis 40:9 - 13; @Numbers 17:6 - 8; @2 Corinthians 1:18 - 22
I have it laid on me, I hope by the Lord, to speak a little word about life. I need not say it is a subject of wide bearing, whether we look at it in natural things, in the physical creation, or the spiritual realm. There is hardly a subject more extensive, so that one has only one or two features of it in one's mind to present, beginning with the passage in John, which gives us in a brief sentence the thought of all life. Life must have a source; it is not a development, as this passage shows. It came in perfect in Christ: "In him was life". It does not say here, 'In Him *is* life', although that of course is true; it is what *was* in Him, so that we have to trace backwards instead of forwards. If we are to understand life as presented here in perfection we are obliged to investigate backwards: "In him was life". We know that life is in Him. The life that we have by the Spirit on the principle of faith now and shall enjoy for ever is in Him, but we have the statement here, "In him *was* life". And so He has expressed it; and I had in mind to speak of the expression of it -- first, as He was here in the flesh, and then as He is, as risen from among the dead. No one can read the opening chapters of Genesis without being impressed with the thought of life, not only because it is essential to human existence here on earth, but because it brings in what pleases God.
Unless a thing pleases God it is of no moral value, and I have chosen this passage from @Genesis 40 believing that it foreshadowed the expression of life in a flesh-and-blood condition, which pleased God -- a life that was for God. The chief baker, of whom I
{118}
did not read, presents what was not for God. It was primarily intended for God. The white bread in the baskets and the baked meats or victuals were for Pharaoh -- for God typically, but the birds of the air got them.
Now, that may seem a peculiar reference, but one is reminded of young persons starting out in life, as we speak, and the inquiry that comes into one's mind with regard to them is whether their lives are to be for God or for men; whether those sweetmeats on the top (for the best is on the top) are for God, or whether the birds of the air are going to have them. They are about in great numbers -- vultures, ready to snap up everything that might be for God. The Lord met a young man, as you will remember, and in His conversation with him He looked on him and He loved him. I suppose that the young man, in the energy and freshness of life, reminded the Lord of the divine thought. He would have had that young man; He desired to have him for God, but He did not have him. What was lovable in that young man went to the birds, from what Scripture tells us, for he went away from Jesus. Satan got that young man, obviously; he went away from Jesus.
So, as I said, the birds got the fine food the baker had on his head in the three baskets. I have no doubt he illustrates man as set up here, furnished with much intended to be for God, but Satan got him, and so he was hanged upon a tree; whereas the butler is, I believe, set forth to represent the Lord Jesus -- the life that expressed itself in Him as a Man in this world.
The vine is there, and the bud, the blossom, the cluster, and the grapes, and then the pressing -- all for God.
It was a 'life divine below', (`6:2) but not exactly a miraculous life, although of course we know His conception was miraculous, but that is not for the public. He was born as a babe, everything in the
{119}
life of Jesus was normal, but of course of its own kind. There was the vine, there was the bud, the blossom, and there were the grapes; and then, beloved (and let this sink into our hearts) there was the pressing of the grapes.
Such was the life that came under God's eye in the precious life of Jesus. There was nothing to call attention to in a public way any more than a vine in a vineyard. It was normal, perfectly normal, divinely normal; but Jesus was cast upon God, as we are told, from the very outset of His being as incarnate. This could not have been said about any other babe, although marvellous things are said about babes in the Old; Testament, and I have no doubt these marvellous things all had reference in type to Jesus. Jacob took hold of his brother's heel as a babe -- a remarkable thing; he would supplant Esau. In Jesus we have, from the very outset, the expression of dependence; that was never said of a babe. It was for God, who alone understood it. The outward effects must have been there; Scripture is silent as to that. But God knew the movement of the heart of that babe, and it was delightful to Him.
Then, as we are told, He grew in wisdom and stature. Think of that being said of Jesus, the Son of God! He grew in these things -- in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. What should mark every child born into this world, but was never found before, was there. As He is in the temple with the doctors, you see the perfection of maturity; He was both *hearing*, you will notice, and *asking questions*. In the prophets He says, "The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned". @Isaiah 50:4. Marvellous words from Him! They are there to bring before us the perfection of His humanity. "He learned obedience", @@Hebrews 5:8 we are told. Let us understand it. He is a real Man, and yet "God over all, blessed for ever". As John says. "In the beginning was the
{120}
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". @John 1:1. Being that, it was His to command, never to obey; but now His condition is changed, and He learns, for He says, "Mine ears hast thou digged". @@@Psalm 40:6. He learned obedience.
Such was the perfection, the reality of the humanity of Christ. At the age of twelve He is in the midst of the doctors. He is not criticising; He is not asserting that He is God; He is not working miracles; He is simply "hearing them and asking them questions". @Luke 2:46. An excellent model for us -- for young people particularly -- hearing and asking questions. The doctors "were astonished at his understanding and answers". Doubtless they were proud of their learning. Had they learned "morning by morning" to hear from God? Were they wont "to speak a word in season to him that is weary"? @Isaiah 50:4. Here was One who was learning; He was hearing and asking questions, and His understanding and answers astonished those learned doctors. Think of what that must have been to God, as He looked down on these doctors, with this holy Boy of twelve in their midst! It was all humanly and yet divinely perfect. His parents thought He was in the company, but He was not; and they return to Jerusalem and find Him. There was a great difference between the mind of heaven and the mind of her who loved Him most on earth. "Thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing", Mary said, reproachfully. It was well they sorrowed, but He says, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" The light is beginning to shine. "Thy father", says Mary, "and I". He says, "my Father's business". @Luke 2:48 - 49. What a word for Joseph! Was He about Joseph's business? He was indeed about to take up the tools, the plane and the saw, for He was to be a carpenter. He was about to serve His reputed father in the workshop. Wonderful fact for us! But did He refer to Joseph's business in the temple? No, beloved, it was His Father's
{121}
business, *God's* business. It was something for Joseph to think over; it was an opportunity for him to learn; doubtless he did; doubtless Mary did. But then He went down and was subject after that. The light had shone in that word for Mary and Joseph, and now He goes down and is subject to them. I can understand Him saying to Joseph, 'I am going to do business for you', for Joseph was His reputed father, and He did. "Is not this the carpenter?" @Mark 6:3 it says. One is moved as one thinks of the Son of God, the Lord of Glory, the Creator and Upholder of everything in the universe, taking a plane, or a saw, or a chisel, and working. These are facts of Scripture, and they are to be taken into our hearts, that He was a real Man; and whilst here about His Father's business, yet He worked with His reputed father, Joseph, as a carpenter. Then the veil drops in His wonderful history for eighteen years. What happened in those eighteen years we might well think over. I mean we might read, as we are entitled to by the Spirit, between the lines. What a life it must have been as He toiled as a carpenter! He had grown up before God "as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground", @Isaiah 53:2 full of sap, more than in all the cedars. The cedars of Lebanon are full of sap. "In him was life"; life was there. In that outward lowliness and obscurity, life was there. And now as they were all baptised He was baptised, the last, and the heavens proclaimed Him. The heavens proclaimed their estimate of all that He is. He was the "Vine". There were the buds, the blossom, and the cluster, as I said, and the grapes; everything was normal; they were all there in the life of Jesus. Let us understand it. The butler pressed the grapes into "Pharaoh's cup". The Lord Jesus, in all this, thought of God, the cup was Pharaoh's cup. As I may say, He held the cup in
{122}
His hand, and all His precious life was, as it were, poured into it for God. It was for God, and in His death it was pressed -- that precious life was pressed out of Him, so to speak.
Those drops of sweat as of blood that flowed from Him in Gethsemane were precious to God. They were the expression of a Man's exercise as under the pressure of Satan -- Satan bringing death to bear upon Him. Satan had come back with all his power, and would have pressed upon Him the weight of death, which was in the cup the Father was giving to Him. He was going to drink that; but, as I might say, He had the cup in His hand, and that holy precious life of His was to be poured out into it; it was for God. I suppose Jesus was never more precious, if one may use comparisons; He was never more precious than when He said, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" It was infinite perfection in Man, and Man bearing the full weight of divine wrath. It was pressed out there for God. Who can speak adequately of it? But it is for us to feed upon.
Well now, I wanted to go on to the passage in Numbers, because it gives us another view of life. This time it is a question of combating man's will; that is not what the vine refers to. It is now a question of combating the will of man as risen up in opposition to God in the band of Korah. We are beset, dear brethren, all round with this will of man; men by training and education asserting a right to priesthood *because they are Levites*. There are thousands and thousands of men in the 'cloth' in Christendom who claim to be Levites, and claim priesthood because they are Levites, and they have to be tested; they have to be met. It is not so much what the life is for God, but what it is in *testimony against evil*. Hence there are twelve rods, representing all, we might say; and they are laid up before the
{123}
Lord. It says, "Aaron's rod was *among* them". It is a challenge, you see, that Aaron's rod has no advantage.
Now we have not what is normal, as I have been dwelling on, but what is, I might say, miraculous; a bare rod or staff bears fruit overnight. The wonderful fact is that the Son of God has lain in death, as it says, "three days and three nights in the heart of the earth". @@Matthew 12:40. Aaron's rod was among them -- among the others; the Son of God was among the dead. He actually died, and was buried. What a time of exercise Moses and Aaron must have had during the night! In the morning Aaron's rod had budded, bloomed blossoms, and ripened almonds. God had dealt effectively with the spirit of rebellion in the swallowing up of these wicked men who had rebelled against their leaders. Yet the flesh was there, and they would be concerned as awaiting the result of the test. The disciples of Jesus also had deep exercise as He lay in death. But the answer was to come, and the answer was in the Son of God declaring Himself. He is "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection". @Romans 1:4. He is known thus to faith.
I want you to particularly follow what I am saying in this, because it is the secret of withstanding the will of man in religious things. John's gospel comes in to establish our souls in the faith of the Son of God. It is a question of life, but it is life on the principle of faith. So John's gospel is that His *disciples* might believe on Him. They were disciples before, but they needed to be established in the light of the Son of God. Hence John says, "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed on him". Then at the end, after all the signs but one are recorded, he says, "Many other signs truly did Jesus *in the presence of his disciples*, which are not written in this book", @John 20:30.
{124}
There was abundance more of evidence if necessary, but there was nothing more needed for faith. All you want is a witness, and John's signs afforded adequate witness of the resurrection. So he says, "These are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name". @John 20:31.
What I am speaking about is the secret of contending with the will of the flesh in religious things. How can we withstand it? Only by the faith of the Son of God. "Who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God". @1 John 5:5. God would have that light in our souls. We hold life now in His name, but then we get the evidence of it while here. It was a dry stick laid among the others. It had "budded". I was speaking of this as miraculous -- it is miraculous. I suppose the Lord's resurrection and appearance to His disciples was the greatest sign. Peter, John and Mary had gone to the sepulchre and found it empty -- Peter went into the sepulchre, and he saw the linen clothes, "and the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself". @John 20:7. There was unquestionable evidence that the Son of God had risen. Everything was in order, there was not a struggle, for as the Son of God enters into the conflict with death there can be only one result. "What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? Thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?" @Psalm 114:5. Death was to be out of sight as the feet of the priests touched the waters, although Jordan overflowed its banks. So John says, "This is the disciple which testifieth of these things; ... and we know that his testimony is true". @John 21:24. We know his testimony is true. It was a miracle, it was the Son of God asserting His power. He is declared to be the Son of God with power by resurrection from among the dead. So that now we have life in another form: it is not
{125}
now a vine, it is now an almond. We know from the book of Jeremiah what the almond signifies. God says, "I am watchful over my word to perform it". @Jeremiah 1:12. It we want things finally effected it must be on this line, not on the life of Jesus on earth. It is the life of the Son of God now as He is risen from among the dead. So it says in verse 8, "It came to pass that on the morrow ... behold the rod of Aaron, for the house of Levi, was budded". Now it is a life established by a miracle, but it is a life perfect in its own order. Well, I dwell on this in both cases. In regard to the vine, we have the bud, we have the blossom, and the cluster, and the bunch of grapes. I mention in connection with this, with the start of budding, that young brethren and sisters must be on their guard against taking short cuts in the things of God. We must all be on our guard against it, things must be on the principle of the bud, the blossom and the fruit. They must be in that order. The idea of being ripe is a great thing for God. But I want now, in closing, to dwell on the almond, because it is in the life of Christ as He is now that you get finality. According to Jeremiah, the almond signifies that God is watchful over His word to perform it, and I give you the Scripture which I think confirms this in a remarkable way. It is where Paul says he was "an apostle according to the promise of life". @2 Timothy 1:1. This appears in 2 Timothy, which epistle contemplates the breakdown of the church. God had promised life, and had brought it into effect. Paul was apostle in this connection. So the almond is brought out; it budded, it blossomed, and the ripened almonds were there, for the rebels. You cannot answer these rebels with mere human ability or learning; you can only answer them effectively by life, the life that is in Christ. It is a life that is outside the range of man. Jannes and Jambres
{126}
in Egypt of old said, "This is the finger of God". @Exodus 8:19. Here is something they cannot touch, they cannot imitate it, it is beyond them; hence it is victory. So that God proceeds effectively to perform His word; He says, I am watchful over it to perform it. He has now, in a Man in resurrection, the life He has promised, and that Man has gone up into heaven, and given us the Spirit that we might "know".
John writes, "That ye may know that ye have eternal life". @1 John 5:13. The gospel of John is, "That ye might believe", @John 20:31 and as believing have it. But the epistle is, "that ye may know that ye have" @1 John 5:13 it; and knowing that we have it makes us victorious. No one can overcome us. The most learned, the most able, after the flesh, cannot stand before a man who knows that he has everlasting life. John says, "The Son of God has come"; @1 John 5:20 we know He has come, and it is "by water and blood". @1 John 5:6. It is not the incarnation in the epistle of John. When he says He has come, it is by death, the means of cleansing, so that we should have eternal life. He is now risen, and has given us an understanding.
God would have us here on the line of the almond. Whether it be what He will do for my own soul, or whether it be what He will do through me, I can rely on the faithfulness of God. He has the life now that is irresistible -- it is supreme. It is established in resurrection, it is life in the Son of God.
I read in the epistle to the Corinthians to see how God is now working out His purpose on this line. They insinuated that the great apostle was using lightness -- prevaricating. No, he says, "the Son of God, ... who was preached among you by us ... was not yea and nay". The Son of God is not yea and nay, "but yea is", he says, "in him". He is risen from the dead; it is the Son of God. Paul says, "we preached him", and it is "yea" that is "in him", "and Amen". The "yea" is the assertion of the will of God, and
{127}
the "Amen" is the complete answer to it subjectively, as I apprehend. So that He has watched over His word to perform it. The apostle says, "He that establishes us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God". God is doing that. "Who also hath sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts".
I only refer to that so that we might see in this life the almond, for the purpose of God is yea and amen in Christ. He is working it out in detail, and I want everyone, myself included, to lay hold of the thought of the almond. It is a life established on miracle, and it is supreme over every other power. God is watching over every one of us to perform His word in regard to us, and then to use us. There is not one of us that God would not use on the principle of this life, but not on any other. It is on the principle of the almond that God is working out His purpose in us and through us; so that, "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us".
{128}
RUN, SPEAK TO THIS YOUNG MAN
@Matthew 19:16 - 22; @1 Samuel 30:11 - 16; @Zechariah 2:1 - 5
In purposing to preach the gospel from these scriptures, I have in view, specially, young ones -- young men and young women. I have selected these scriptures because they refer to young people. In each of them a young man is mentioned. Young men are in great demand, and in no quarter are they in greater demand than in heaven. You will remember how the great vessel through whom the light of heaven came to us -- Paul -- is first introduced in the Scriptures as a young man. He is introduced as one who witnessed the death of the martyr Stephen. Not only was he a witness of that crime, but he was *consenting* to it. In @Acts 7 it is said, "the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul". @Acts 7:58. In the next chapter it is said that Saul was consenting to his death; and in speaking to King Agrippa later he admits fully that he held the clothes of those who killed the Lord's martyr Stephen. Then when any of the saints were arraigned for judgment he gave his "vote" against them.
Such is the early introduction of the great vessel through whom the light of God came into the Gentile world, and I have no doubt that these facts are recorded in order that throughout the gospel period any young ones who may be opposed to the Lord -- and, as opposed to the Lord, opposed to His people -- may see that even for them salvation is available. Saul says he was an insolent, overbearing man; so that if there are any here who have been hitherto in any way opposed to the Lord and to His people there is salvation even for you. The Lord would say to you, as He said to that young man as he was found in bitter hostility to Him and to His people,
{129}
"Why persecutest thou me?" @Acts 9:4. And not only would He raise that question, which is for you to answer in the secret of your soul, but He would say to you, "It is hard for thee", @Acts 9:5. You have a hard time of it.
It may be that your parents are Christians, and some of your brothers and sisters, and you have a hard time of it, for in the secret of your soul you know they are right. I know whereof I speak. In the secret of your soul you know well that your parents are right. They have accepted the gospel; they have profited by the gospel; they are enjoying it, and you know they are enjoying it; so that it is hard for you. Instead of resenting your attitude, or reproving you, we would, in the spirit of Christ, express our feelings, that yours is a hard way. Whatever your exterior, yours is a hard, difficult path, and the Lord would relieve you as He did Saul. But then it may be there are those here who are not outwardly opposed. This young man in @Matthew 19 comes to the Lord, and instead of using language of opposition, he says, "Good Master". You have nothing to say against the Lord; your thought is that you should maintain outward respectability in your religion. You do not wish to be regarded as an infidel. You speak of the Lord Jesus, in terms, it may be, of respect, and you would like to get some benefit from Him. You see that benefit from Him is available. Indeed, what we call the civilised world has become such through Christ. You may not think so. The knowledge of Christ, as men take it up, has a certain benefit in their account. Christianity, as it is outwardly regarded, is an asset in this world. No one can deny that the nations that have accepted Christ are far better off commercially and socially than those who have not. It is well worth their while to pretend to honour Christ.
So with this young man; and so, it may be, with
{130}
someone here. You are not opposed to Christ; you see He is a benefactor in this world. You are not thinking of your eternal welfare at all; you are thinking of enjoying what you have. It may be a good position, a loving wife and family, or possessions and friends. You wish to enjoy all these things, and you see that Christ can help you; that it is to your advantage to be on favourable terms, as one may say, with Him and with His people. But that is very nauseous to Christ. He has no interest in it. He did not come into this world to improve it. He did not come to make people more comfortable in their domestic affairs, although that flows from true Christianity. He came into this world, as Paul says, to save sinners -- to *save* them. So He has no interest at all in your proposal.
Hence He meets this young man on his own ground. The young man wishes to live -- to have eternal life. He says not a word about his sins; not a word about having to meet God after death. "Good Master", he says, "what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?" And the Lord meets him on his own ground, and gives him plenty to do; for if men in this world seek to benefit by Christ, He is not going to let them off. Christendom is not going to be let off easily. If they have undertaken to settle matters with God on the line of doing, then they have to reckon with God on the line of doing; and God keeps books, so that He may have written down accurately all their doings.
The Lord does not go into details with this young man. He could easily have pointed out that in no case had he kept all. When the time comes we shall see that God is not disposed to let Christendom off because Christ has been outwardly owned. In it despite has been done to the Spirit of grace, and the grace of God has been turned into lasciviousness. Men have placed themselves on the line of doing, and God will take them up on that line. They will have
{131}
to say to Him on that ground. The books were opened, and the dead were judged according to their works. This young man doubtless shall appear in that day, and then the Lord will go into details with him. He shall find that matters have been analysed in the books, and his assumption that everything in the law has been done and kept shall be tested.
In the meanwhile, as he pretends to have done everything, the Lord says, "Sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me". The Lord is not going to accommodate you if you are just seeking to enjoy what you have here. He says, If you are on that line, the end of it is, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and come follow Me, and you shall have treasure in heaven. Inside these gracious words of Christ one may find the gospel wrapped up, for if he were to find treasure in heaven, it could be only on the ground of the death and resurrection of Christ. But instead of this the young man, having great possessions, turned away sorrowfully. He turned away without eternal life -- without any hope of it, and without hope of treasure in heaven.
Now look, young man or young woman, tonight, are you prepared to take on this responsibility? This passage is not intended to put you on the line of doing. It is intended to put you entirely out of court, as you are quite unable to do anything. God, as it were, binds men's hands and shuts their mouths so that they might know that they can do nothing. This passage, therefore, was not intended to convey that the gospel in any sense is on the line of doing. The passage is intended to shut you out entirely as on that line. But the Lord is there with His treasure in heaven for you. The young man went away. What are you going to do about this matter? In a few moments we shall all be dispersed, and some of you here tonight will be placed under a new obligation,
{132}
for Christ is once more presented to you as the only Saviour. You will be put under a new obligation as to what you are going to do. Are you going to prefer your possessions to Christ and to eternal salvation?
Well now, from the chapter in 1 Samuel, I want to show you a young man of a very different type. He had no possessions. He is found in the field. It was well for him, as he confessed, that he had fallen sick. It may be that in this company there are those of this type. You have fallen sick; sick, it may be, of yourself, sick of this world. This young man confesses himself to be a young man *of Egypt*. In his day he would have been a young man of the world. He would go in for all the sports of his neighbourhood. He would be aspiring to excel in these matters. He would seek to shine in society in so far as he could. He was a young man of Egypt, and all these things go with such. Egyptian fathers and mothers train up their children for Egypt. They school them, and set before them the one object -- to become something in this world. He confesses this; he confesses that he was a young man of Egypt.
Be true to yourselves, young people here, and true to God, and admit that your lives have been spent in the world and for the world; that you have been neglectful of God, and of Christ, and of the gospel; that you have been regarding your eternal welfare as a matter of naught. You have been bartering your heritage, like Esau, for a mess of pottage. That is what you have been doing. It is an immense thing to learn to confess. The man I am speaking of confesses that he is a young man of Egypt, and that he was a servant of an Amalekite. An Amalekite is a man that deals in the flesh -- in what the flesh lives in, and Satan works through that; so that young men and young women are held in slavery. He admits it: but he is found in the field. He has turned sick.
{133}
Many of us know what this means. He has turned sick, and so he has been neglected; he has been cast off.
As soon as you become exercised and begin to get sick of things the world has no more use for you. Happy for you if it is so -- if your old friends and companions are beginning to cast you off. You begin to talk about God and Christ. You have misgivings about what you have been engaged in; you are coming to see there is nothing in it, and they quickly let you go. You are of no value now; for if you are not wholehearted in a thing what use are you? You just spoil it. The world is not interested in those who are concerned about eternal things. It is well when the light of God begins to agitate your mind and conscience so that it is so.
This young man was left in the field sick; but they *brought him to David*. That is what we are here for tonight. We are not here to preach a sermon simply. If this meeting has any end in view it is to bring souls to Christ. They brought this man to David. Our David is the theme of the gospel. We know what our David has done. He has slain His Goliath. He has entered into death, and has destroyed him that had the power of death. He has dealt effectively with all that was against us. Indeed, Christ has taken on all the liabilities of man, being a Man; and now in heaven He has bread and water -- what man needs. He has effected propitiation. He has propitiated God in regard to our guilt. He is our propitiation. As John says, "He is the propitiation for our sins, and ... also for the whole world". @1 John 2:2. He is the propitiation for the whole world, so that He has disposed of our guilt.
The wonderful declaration of the gospel is forgiveness for all. Repentance and remission of sins are preached in His name among all the nations. But He has more even than these things. This young man
{134}
needed food. He needed bread and he needed water; and they gave him bread and made him drink water. Christ is all this for you. This young man was left. What hope was there for him? None. But they brought him to David. Our desire tonight is to bring you to Christ. He has the bread. "The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world", @John 6:51. Think how far-reaching it is! "Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life", @John 6:54.
Then it says, "They gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins". There is a great deal more that Christians have than you have any idea of; for there is not only ordinary support proposed in the bread and the water, but there is the sweetness of the fig. There is that sweetness that comes in in the gift of the Spirit. What God proposes is to give you His Spirit; as it says in the Acts. All that obey Christ receive the Holy Spirit. He gives the Holy Spirit to those that obey Him. So that there is not only the water for refreshment, but there is the sweetness of the love of God brought into our hearts -- shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us. Then the raisins, I suppose, point to that which revives and refreshes us, so that the believer is set up in life. This is the proposal of the gospel. They brought him to David, and this is the result.
But is that all? He is now under David's command and direction; in David's service instead of that of the Amalekite. He has David for a master; and oh! what a master he was. I may say in passing that David has no idlers in his service. There are a great many idlers who profess to belong to David. David, I suppose, was the greatest organiser. I think he stands out as the greatest organiser, taking up the most varied and diverse materials, and organising them into the most extraordinary army that ever
{135}
fought. The idea of an idler is foreign to David and his regime; and I say to Christians that directly you are made to live you are enrolled.
This young man is useful immediately. He knows where his previous master is and his army. You can tell another your experience, and you can help him. It is not a question of gift. It is a question of conveying to others your own experience, and in that way you will be of great service to the Lord. You may be used in delivering others. David does not revive this young man and send him away. Did he do so he might fall away to the Amalekite again. There are those who speak about evangelising, who send their converts hither and thither, like the ostrich which lays its eggs in the sand and forgets that the foot may crush them, as Job says. That is not evangelising. Evangelising is to bring a soul under the direction of Christ so that he is in His service. Otherwise you are left to drift into the world, and some beast, so to speak, comes and crushes your life out. See @@Job 39:13 - 16. The ostrich has no regard for its offspring. This young man came into the service of David. I say that for every Christian here.
Now we come to the passage in Zechariah, where we see another young man. These young men, indeed, may be set out as a series. The first has gone off having no hope of anything -- no hope of life now or in the future. He has gone away sorrowful because he has possessions. He is not an opposer of Christ outwardly, but he has gone away from Christ. The second is taken up and brought to David and is made to live, and he is in David's service, under David's tuition. Jerusalem would come into his mind, for you remember that when David slew the giant he took his head to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is in his mind; it was the city of the great King. We cannot be under the influence and tuition of Christ without thinking of what is in His mind. The nearer you get
{136}
to the Lord -- the more you discover what is in His mind. Jerusalem was in David's mind. I need not go into details. Those of us who are Christians and read our Bibles know how important Jerusalem was in David's regime. It was his city, the city of the great King.
This young man, as he is called, is interested in Jerusalem. It suggests progress. As a young man is brought under the influence of Christ he begins to think of Christ, and of Christ's interests, and they are very wide. You find here in @Zechariah 2 a man with a measuring line, and a young man wants to know what he has that for. What is it for? It is to measure Jerusalem. Did you ever think of that? In order to pray aright you have to learn the extent of Jerusalem. It is the chief interest of God on the earth. I mean His saints today, the assembly; and the assembly is composed of all saints. Every truth sent of God belongs to the assembly, and the scripture says, "The Lord knoweth them that are his", @2 Timothy 2:19. He knows the length and breadth of Jerusalem, and He wants you to know it.
Think of the privilege, dear brethren, of being brought into accord with His mind! The man with the measuring line says, "To measure Jerusalem". "Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof". Are you interested? It may be that New Zealand is the extent of your Jerusalem. It is well if you love the saints in this Dominion, but there are many others. The more you love the Lord the more you appreciate the extent of His possessions on this earth. You think with Him. If you think with Him, you pray; and so this young man wants to know, and the answer is, "to measure Jerusalem". Then he says, "Behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him". It is as much
{137}
as to say, the first angel did not give him all the information that he could have given.
God is bent on instructing us in full measure, that we might know the length and breadth and the height and depth; and so as the one angel departs another comes and says, "Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein". It is as if the young man, being attentive to heaven, moves, so that he should at once receive full information. You see there is no lack with God. If you wish the information you will get it. If you are interested in the full extent of the purpose of God He will give you the light about it. There is no excuse at all for any of us being defective in divine intelligence, for God is ready to give it to us. "Run", He says, "and speak to this young man"; not now to tell him the length and breadth, but that it should be full of men; as it says, "Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein".
The light of the purpose of God keeps us from despondency. Many of us become despondent. We think things are so small. But we must be with God, as one has been seeing lately in regard to Noah. He had eight souls. "Wherein few", says Peter, "that is, eight souls were saved by water". @1 Peter 3:20. That is how salvation comes, and therefore there are not many. It is by water. That is to say, salvation is by death, and hence the few; but they are the few of privilege. Do not forget that. Think of the antediluvian world, and picture in your mind all the hills and mountains in the world in those days as the flood rises and rises, and of those poor people screaming for safety -- for salvation, and there is no salvation; and the ark rises on the breast of the flood with the eight souls in it who had the truth. It is the few of privilege; and so it is today. If you are a Christian in the ark you belong to the few of privilege.
{138}
Peter writes that to the Christians in his day, so that they might see the great advantage they had. It says, "Are there few that be saved?" Well, apparently there were few. If you think of the millions of inhabitants of this earth at the present time, Christians are in the minority, but it is the minority of privilege. But then, as I said, the purpose of God contemplates not few but many: "Ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands". @Revelation 5:5. That is the purpose of God. So that Jerusalem is to be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein. There is no need of walls in that city with multitudes of men and cattle.
Then follows, "I will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her". That, I apprehend, is a present word. What need we fear? "I will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her". This is a word for the young man who is interested, who is a believer in Christ, and has come under the influence and tuition of Christ. The whole purpose of God is opened up to him, so that he has victory every day. He is not concerned about the fewness. He has the mind of God as to the ultimate result, and then it shall not be few, but many.

THE SUFFERING ONE
@Psalm 105:7 - 23; @2 Corinthians 4:7 - 12
I had in mind to speak about the life of Jesus, how it constitutes a testimony to God, what it was as in Him, and how it works out in us. For it is a divine thought that His life, so precious under God's eye, should not cease with the Lord's death. It was laid down, but it is to be continued, and was continued, so to speak, in Peter and John, who "stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life", @Acts 5:20 that is, the life which was in Jesus. I selected this passage in the Psalms as presenting Joseph to us, who, as we all know, is one of the most striking types of the Lord Jesus that the Old Testament affords. As he first appears at his birth, Jacob, his father, evidently recognised the light involved in his advent, so he set to work to prepare to move out of the land of Mesopotamia, and return to the land of his fathers -- to Canaan. We have, therefore, a clear intimation that Joseph typifies the Lord, for His coming into the world involved light for others. Even at His birth the shepherds who fed their flocks by night could see light, and so, as Jacob returns to Canaan and meets his brother, Esau, his wives and children were called to pass before Esau, and Joseph is placed before his mother; @Genesis 33:7. He passes before Esau and before his mother, a clear intimation again of a type of Christ, for, in @Matthew 2:11, the little Child is placed before His mother, "That in all things he might have the pre-eminence", @Colossians 1:18 and even as to His mother, she has to take a second place to Christ. So, at the age of seventeen, Joseph is again before us as one who recoiled at the evil discourse of
{140}
his brethren. He was with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, as we are told, and brought unto his father their evil report. There, again, we have a type of Christ who is "holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners". @Hebrews 7:26. Then he is said to be loved by his father more than all his brethren. Again we have a type of Christ, and he is distinguished as Christ was at the outset of His path of ministry.
Joseph had a vest of many colours, reminding us of the variety of glory that shone, and shines, in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father loving to honour Him. And then we have the suffering Joseph; he is hated of his brethren, but in his sufferings -- and this is what I want to impress upon all -- he receives light, that is to say, it was a clear intimation of the end at the beginning. The end is glory, universal dominion, but in between there are the fetters for the feet and iron for the soul. It is said, "Until the time when what he said came about".
I wish particularly to dwell upon what he said. It was not his word exactly; it was what he saw in his dreams. He had two dreams, as you remember, and I dwell upon them so that we may be established in our souls, as in a corresponding position we have the light to begin with, which intimates the end -- the great terminus to which the path of faith leads -- and so "Until the time when what he said came about: the word of Jehovah tried him". And what did he say, beloved? "Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and also stood upright". @Genesis 37:7. What light there was in that! His sheaf stood up. The corn cut down and bound into a sheaf, and it stands up. No one of us is of any value in the testimony until we understand that dream, what it is to stand up. Until we arrive at a time in our souls when we know what it is to stand upright by power which we have received from God, by the Spirit -- the power by which He raised up
{141}
Christ from the dead -- we shall not be effective in the testimony, nor shall we be prepared to suffer.
And so the first light that Joseph has is, when he saw his sheaf stand up. It is a type of the resurrection of Christ.
We believe that in becoming a Man, the Lord intended to die. "For this cause", He says, "came I into the world". @John 18:37. For what cause -- to glorify the Father's name, and that involved death. "Now", He says, "is my soul troubled". @John 12:27. Death was before Him in its reality. He knew what it meant. He had just been to the grave of Lazarus, and He groaned at that grave, for He knew what power held the loved one there, but He had power, a greater power, and He raised him. And after that He says, "Now is my soul troubled". He had to face death in all its power. He knew what was in it, and so He looks up to heaven and He says, "Father, glorify thy name", and the answer comes immediately, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again". @John 12:28. Then He says, "Father, save me from this hour", and He adds, "but for this cause came I unto this hour". @John 12:27. It was the hour of death; He came to die. But then, in dying He had in His soul the perfect knowledge of resurrection. "Thou wilt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption", and again, "Thou wilt show me the path of life; in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore". @@Psalm 16:10,11. He saw right on to the end, nevertheless, He came to die. It was very real to Him, but then, as I said before, what Joseph saw at the beginning, was that the sheaf stood up. Remarkable testimony! He saw the single sheaf stand up, and then he says, "Behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf". @Genesis 37:7. It is the superiority of a Man risen. The risen Man is superior to all other men. Who can contend with a risen Man? No one! and the believer has to understand the significance of a sheaf standing up, and of
{142}
other sheaves making obeisance to that sheaf. It is Christ risen. He sees beyond the path of suffering, and before the iron entered into His soul, He saw the end and the power of resurrection.
Again, he dreams another dream. "Behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me". @Genesis 37:9. Now we are on heavenly ground; not only is He risen from the dead, but He sees the position in heaven, and all heavenly authorities and powers made subject unto Him.
This, which Joseph said, stands out at the outset of his pathway. Then he is sold as a bondman to the Egyptian, and it is said, His feet were fettered, and the iron entered into his soul, typical of the sufferings of Christ. Between what he said of his dreams and the time when what he said came about, they afflicted his feet with fetters, and the iron came into his soul, and the word of Jehovah tried him. How perfectly he answers to the test! The word of the Lord tried him, and in that trial the light of Jesus shines for heaven and for earth.
His life was a continual offering, it was the meat offering. The meat offering, beloved, was for others, and it was for God. The priests had their part in it; it was for others, and that is what I want to dwell upon; "That they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again". @2 Corinthians 5:15. As Paul says, "Death works in us, but life in you". Paul's life was a sacrifice. It was laid down for the brethren. It was for Christ. It was for God. He was "poured out" we are told.
So in the dungeon, the butler and the baker come to Joseph, and as the butler tells his vision, he says, "I saw a vine". @Genesis 40:9. It is a picture of Christ. The butler had no light, but the Spirit of God knew about it. The Spirit of God saw the life of Jesus, and the light of that life shone in the dark Egyptian dungeon in which Joseph was imprisoned. Think of the backward
{143}
throw of the light. Even as Peter says, "In which also going, he preached to the spirits which are in prison, heretofore disobedient, when the long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah"; @1 Peter 3:20 and so the Spirit of God throws back the light of the life of Jesus into that dark Egyptian dungeon into the soul of Joseph. Indeed, Joseph was himself working out that life. It was the Spirit of Christ in him, and, as holding his vessel for God, he was suffering. He was not only a type, but there was the substance there, for the Spirit of Christ was in him, the Spirit of a suffering Christ, and the life of Jesus *was* wrought out in that dungeon. He was prepared to serve others. Indeed, he was a man sent before his brethren to preserve them, a posterity upon the earth. And so the butler says, "In my dream behold a vine was before me; and in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes". @Genesis 40:9,10. We have portrayed before us the beautiful life of Jesus. First the bud -- for things were normal. It is not a question of miracle, but what is normal in manhood, what is divinely normal, what is perfect. There is the bud and the blossom, and the cluster, and the ripe grapes. All that was in the life of Jesus under the eye of God. Others may not have seen it, even His mother did not appreciate it, but God looked upon the bud, and it is said, "I was cast upon thee from the womb; thou art my God from my mother's belly", @@Psalm 22:10. It could not be said of any other babe that there was the principle of dependence upon God from the very outset of his being. How delightful that was to God; as the race of mankind were utterly indifferent to God's claims. *There* was a Babe, a Babe in dependence.
Think of the kind of life that came under the eye of God in that bud. And then the blossom -- how, at the age of twelve there was a blossom, and the cluster,
{144}
and finally, the fully developed One, the Man, Christ Jesus -- the Holy Spirit coming down, as Luke presents it, in bodily form, showing that the totality of the Spirit was here. It was the Holy Spirit in Person, in its entirety, which could never be said of any other man. But then these ripe grapes were taken and pressed into Pharaoh's cup. The precious results of the press, not, indeed, an ordinary wine press, but the fingers. It was the personal act of Christ. He says no one can take His life from Him -- "I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again". @John 10:18.
John's gospel presents to us that He had authority to do it, and He did it, for He poured out His life unto death. It was all for God, as it were. The grapes were pressed into Pharaoh's cup. The life of Jesus was the light that came into that dungeon, and it is the light that radiates today in the hearts of God's people, where there is subjection to Christ, and this is to be reproduced in the people of God at the present time. I may add that it is only as we know Him glorified in Heaven that we can have part in that life. What we are brought into is eternal life, as it is said, "This is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son". But the life that we have in the Son works out in us as we are here in the body. It is the life of Jesus manifested in our mortal flesh; that is to say, it has reference to us as we are now in the body of mortal flesh. What a triumph! That in mortal flesh there should be portrayed here that same life that shone on earth in the Person of Christ! It was poured out to God, and so it is for man, too, and so it says in the Psalm, "Until the time when what he said came about, the king sent, and loosed him". Yea, He came Himself. He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. Think of the Father in all His affection, as that blessed One lay three days and three nights in the
{145}
bowels of the earth. The King sent and loosed Him. He loosed the pangs of death. How real it was! for that has reference to His being in the grave -- the pangs of death. It was not possible that He should be holden of it, and so the King sent and loosed Him, and made him Lord of His house and Ruler of all His substance. That is the position Christ has now. He made Him Lord of His house and Ruler of all His substance. That is the time when His word came about. He is taken from the dungeon, "and made ruler of all his substance; to bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his senators wisdom". That is what He is doing now, but I am not dwelling upon that, precious as it is for our instruction. What I have before me is the life of Jesus, and so the apostle says, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels". What treasure? Well, he had been speaking about the covenant. If Christ is made Lord over the house, He will bring the love of God into that house, and in @2 Corinthians 3 it brings the love of God into our hearts, so that we are free. If we are in the house of God we are in liberty, not only as sons, but because we know the love of God. We cannot be free in the assembly, or the house, except as we know the love of God. Perfect love casts out fear, and the glory of the Lord is that He brings in that love. As Lord over the house He is an Official, and He brings in the love of God, and makes it effective in our hearts. That is what He is doing for us. The service that He is carrying on at the present time, as Lord over all the house, and in the house, is to bring in the love of God, and to make known that God loves us. He comes as a minister of love. He is the minister of the covenant, and as a mediator of it, makes it effective in our hearts by the Spirit. He has attested it in dying, and makes it effective in our hearts, so that we should be free and happy in the presence of God. We need light and love, and that is the glory
{146}
of the Lord, to bring in the love of God and make it effective in our hearts; for we are put in the house in the presence of God in liberty. It is the most precious ministry conceivable, to bring in the love of God. He has died to attest it, for the mediator dies; otherwise the covenant cannot be effective. But there is to be the opening of the will, and the making clear to the beneficiaries of the terms of the will, and these terms are that God loves us all alike. The mediator makes it effective. The reading of the will is of interest to every heir, and we are all heirs of God, and we desire to come into the benefits of the covenant, and the Lord has not only died to make them valuable, but He makes them effective, and brings them into our hearts. He is Lord over the house. The apostle said that he was a minister of the covenant. He was a competent new covenant minister. He was not the only one; he was one of them, and the greatest of them, and so he says, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels".
The Lord is administering the covenant, and He has engaged Paul and others, and so the latter, having this treasure, is prepared for the iron and the fetters, for the testimony is in reproach and under persecution, and, as Paul said, he was prepared to suffer along with the glad tidings -- "Take thy share of the sufferings". @2 Timothy 2:3. It is when under persecution we get the treasure, and we have the same precious light as Joseph had in the dungeon. Not in the way that he had it, but shining in the face of Jesus; and so the next thing is, am I prepared for the fetters and the iron? "Until the time when what he said came about"; it is only for a moment until the release comes. The apostle said, "The time of my release is come", @2 Timothy 4:6 "for our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory", and "the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal". @2 Corinthians 4:17,18.
{147}
And so he says, "If our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens". @2 Corinthians 5:1. The end is sure. In the meantime, it is a question of the life of Jesus and how it is to be expressed. So the apostle Paul gives us here a list of things that he went through. He says, "We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed". The power of resurrection is there, and there is no possibility of overcoming such a power. He goes on to say, "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus". Think what a believer's body is. Think of the value of it. It is that in which I may bear about the dying of the Lord Jesus. That is, how He died, how He poured out His life to God, as Joseph saw it when told of the butler's dream, the grapes pressed into Pharaoh's cup. And so the apostle goes on to say, "For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh". Note that the apostle refers to the body and then to mortal flesh. It seems to me that mortal flesh appeals to me if I have no faith, but if I have faith, the mortal flesh is fettered. I am supporting the life of Jesus, bearing it about. Think of the importance of mortal flesh, what a great moral victory. He has turned mortal flesh into a vessel for the bearing of His precious life, and, so the apostle goes on to say, we must live to present our bodies as he does, for he could say we are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus.
God sees that you want to use your body, that it may be like His precious Son in this world now, and God helps you to this end. It is a serious thing, for God took Paul at his word. He poured in death on him, that the life of Jesus should be made manifest in
{148}
his mortal flesh, and he says, "Death worketh in us, but life in you". In effect he says, "The more I die, the more you live". It is laying down one's life for the brethren, and doing it as under the eye of God, and for His pleasure.
{149}
DIVINE APPEARINGS (1)
@1 Corinthians 15:5 - 8; @Acts 26:12 - 16; @John 14:18 - 23
J.T. What has exercised one a good deal is that the dispensation is maintained in freshness by divine manifestations. Nothing is more essential than that we should be preserved in freshness, and one has had before him the appearings of the Lord. The divine intent obviously was that those active in the dispensation should know the Lord through personal contact. It was the divine intent that there should be personal representation here, for without personal representation of Christ -- that is, in those who know Him through intimacy -- we cannot have a general or corporate representation of Christ. So these appearings, as they are called, were intended to stamp the persons involved with the sense of who the Lord is, and what He is. This would work out in their ministry, in their influence, and in their example.
G.A. Would the representation of the dispensation that you were speaking of stand very definitely in contrast to what had gone before, and, if so, what would be the reason?
J.T. Of course there were wonderful foreshadowings of the present time. We see particularly from Abraham onwards that Jehovah maintained a personal contact with those who were to represent Him. We have the statement, "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham". @Acts 7:2. Well, He intended in that appearing to impress him, and no doubt did impress him, but I apprehend that these appearings in the Old Testament were through angelic means. Although Jehovah Himself is said to have been there, as in the case of the appearing to Abraham in @Genesis 18, yet the medium is, I judge, angelic. *Now* the appearings are in One who is Himself divine, so that in the period before He ascended, after He rose,
{150}
He made prominent the evidences of His personal love. He showed unto them His hands and His side. So that we have to do with One who, although He is the Mediator, is at the same time personally divine, and has rights over us. So that the appearings, I think, are more personal than mediatorial. They denote His personal interest in the saints, and that interest continues, and the personal service involved in it continues.
J.B.S. In @Acts 1 He presents Himself *living* to them. Does that indicate that it is to be a living dispensation, a dispensation of spiritual life, and He presents Himself, so that there might be correspondence with Himself?
J.T. That is right. In each of the gospels we have a different view presented, and the appearings are mentioned to support that view. In John, taking them backwards -- which, I think, is the right way now, seeing that we are in a day of failure -- He is said to have appeared three times, the end in the third manifestation being the recovery of leading ministers -- Peter himself, first of all. In Luke, it is to recover two apparently insignificant ones as far as gift or service may be considered. They are not distinguished ones. One of them is called Cleopas -- called, as if not well known amongst the saints. The name of the other is not given, possibly his wife. They were on their way to Emmaus, which means an obscure place. So Luke would remind us in this personal service of the Lord that every saint is in view -- the weakest and most obscure. Mark emphasises the unbelief of the brethren -- every one of them, women and all; because He would impress us with the need of faith in the ministry. Things are all available to those that believe. "These signs shall follow them that believe", @Mark 16:17 not necessarily apostles, but "them that believe". He emphasises the importance of faith, especially in those who preach -- that we should be concerned that
{151}
we believe what we preach. In Matthew it is to impress us with administrative ability as it shone in Christ, so they are to make disciples of all the nations. It is not "if they could", but it is imperative -- make disciples of all the nations. The power that is inherent in the One that reveals Himself to them is unlimited. It is *all power* in heaven and on earth. "I am with you alway", He says. "Make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". @Matthew 28:19. There is no power that can stand against that -- the power that is in the hands of the Lord. All power in heaven and on earth. When we come to @Acts 1, it is to impress us with a living person. He appeared unto them, living, or alive; and He charged them by the Spirit. We do not get anything like that in the gospel -- it is what He did personally. But now He is doing it by the Spirit, because He would prepare them for the dispensation of the Spirit, to make room for the Spirit. So that when we come to this chapter in Corinthians, I think we have six appearings recorded, and then in Paul's conversion we have further appearings announced -- "In the which I will appear unto thee", He says. We have a record of the details of one, and then there would be others, so that Paul's ministry, above all the others, I apprehend, was marked by personal contact with the Lord.
J.S. I suppose the point is, it depends upon our contact with the Lord?
J.T. That is what I thought. It maintains one in freshness and in variety in his service, because nothing impresses you more than the freshness and variety of the Lord's own personal ministry. And John, who has the estimate of one who is loved, says, "If they should be written ... the world itself could not contain the books". @John 21:25. So that there is abundance with the Lord, and He deals it out as we are prepared to receive it.
{152}
J.S. Would the exercise be on the lines of looking for His appearing? It says, "Unto them that look for him shall he appear". I thought, perhaps, we anticipated that in reality -- future actuality. But those who get these touches or these appearings are those who look for Him.
J.T. Just so. I was thinking of it in the Acts particularly -- "In the which I will appear to thee", There would be some feature of the truth in each appearing.
J.S. Do you mean he has communications?
J.T. Quite. I thought in Paul's ministry there would be not only the first appearing, of which he speaks here in @Acts 26, but a subsequent one, "In the which I will appear to thee". One can understand how the apostle would be looking for these appearings as he proceeded in his service.
J.S. It would not be that you disregarded or abandoned your calling in life, or anything of that kind. The Lord appeared to Gideon whilst he was threshing wheat. The looking is rather an attitude you would carry with you at all times.
J.T. Just so.
A.H. Does the effect of the appearings come out in the apostle's writings?
J.T. I think so. If you take up his epistles you see how he progressed, how new features were added, would you say?
A.H. I thought so, but I would like help. You quoted in @Acts 26 that He would appear to him; but I was wondering whether we get the effects of it in connection with his writings.
J.T. Well, I think you can discern development in Paul's epistles, even in his addresses in the Acts. If you take, for instance, his remarks to the Ephesian elders -- how, in chapter 20, he speaks about the whole counsel of God and how the affections of Christ work out in his lowly mind and house-to-house service.
{153}
and how he says to the elders: "Shepherd the assembly of God which he has purchased with the blood of his own". @Acts 20:28. What a high conception he has of the cost of the assembly as he speaks of it as that which has been purchased by the blood of God's own -- as if God had given all that He cherished for it!
G.E. That spiritual apprehension of things should mark us in our pathway.
J.T. I think there should be development with us, and freshness and variety. That is the divine intent in our being here. I think that these six appearings, as we have remarked elsewhere, are constructive; that is, they are not mere haphazard, because, doubtless, there were many other appearings. There are some that he does not mention, but which the gospels record. These are evidently mentioned with purpose, with spiritual intent, and, as I said, they are constructive, and from that point of view they tend to establish what we have been remarking, as much as any other appearings. We have first Cephas. Now, in Luke it is Simon. He "hath appeared unto Simon", @Luke 24:34 because Luke contemplates the man in responsibility -- the actual man who failed. He denied the Lord. It is grace. It was abounding grace on the part of the Lord to appear to him first. It is in keeping with Luke. But in this record it is Cephas, because it is not to call attention to His grace here, but that he had in mind the spiritual material that Cephas represents. The word denotes material -- a stone -- which renders the divine dispensation permanent and stable.
J.S. In regard to the variety, I thought of what it says in Mark. The Lord appeared in another form. I thought that each occasion left its own peculiar impression.
J.T. Yes. It occurred to me lately that these six appearings of Paul's that he records, viewed constructively, set out the whole dispensation. We
{154}
have, as one might say, almost every phase of the dispensation stamped by an appearing. First the spiritual element, taken account of in Peter (Cephas), and then the twelve, meaning that as the spiritual element is taken account of you have the administrative feature, and, as the administrative feature -- that is the twelve -- is taken account of, you have the affections of the saints stamped, and, as it were, co-ordinated in an appearing to five hundred brethren at one time. Think of the effect of the appearing of the Lord to five hundred brethren at once. What a unifying, stimulating, co-ordinating effect such an appearing would have on five hundred brethren, and some of them remained, as he says, until the time he wrote, so that the effects still continued, because an appearing to five hundred would certainly take on different characteristics to an appearing to the leading apostle, or an appearing to the twelve.
J.B.S. Does it indicate five hundred impressions?
J.T. I think it does. They would all have the same opportunity. Think of the influence that these five hundred brethren would exert as they went abroad to their households, and to their businesses.
A.H-e. Does that imply that the dispensation is marked by growth in these impressions of this divine Person, beginning with His appearing to Cephas, and then to the twelve, and then to the five hundred? Is that something that has been progressive?
J.T. Yes, I think so. I think that is how the Lord maintains the dispensation in freshness and under His own hand, and with His own impress upon it. Do not you think it is very nice to think of the five hundred impressed thus?
J.S. Yes. Suggestive of a great deal of wealth.
J.T. See the rank and file of the brethren are so disposed to leave matters with those who are leading, such as Cephas, and the twelve, but the Lord says everyone has his part to fulfil. So that, as a brother,
{155}
I apprehend Him in a different light, because nothing can be more delightful here than brethren with the impress of Christ on them.
A.H. Cephas and the twelve would be merged in the five hundred brethren.
J.T. They would all be brethren, because in @Acts 1 "the crowd of names" @Acts 1:15 was about one hundred and twenty. That would include all the apostles. The names would mean, I think, one hundred and twenty varieties of life. Then the twelve were taken out from those.
G.E. Would the dispensation that you are speaking of cover the present day, the Spirit's day?
J.T. That is what I was thinking of -- to bring it down to our own time, because the Lord would maintain a living link with us now, and it is on the principle of @John 14. It comes down to any individual that loves the Lord and keeps His commandments. That is how the link is maintained.
G.E. Is that why the Lord signalises that "if a man love me he will keep my words"?
J.T. That is it. It is available now to you or to me.
H.M. It speaks of being good stewards of the manifold grace of God. The all-varied graces that have come out in the Lord Jesus as a Man down here, God desires them continued, and if that is to be so there must be spiritual manifestations.
J.T. Quite. And then, again, the all-varied wisdom of God in the assembly -- all is dependent on these things. Well, then, you have after the brethren what I think fits in with our own times in a way -- that is James. I think it refers to the well-known James, one who exerted a great personal influence on moral grounds obviously.
G.A. And by that do you imply that each of the epistles is the fruit of an appearing?
J.T. Well, I Suppose in a way each would set out
{156}
some feature of the truth, as, for instance, Galatians sets out "Sonship". That would hinge on some appearing of the Lord in that light.
W.W. You would say that is rather borne out by the fact that in connection with Peter walking on the water, he would never lose the sense of that? I suppose it would be developed in his epistle?
J.T. That is so. But James reminds us of what one individual may do who knows the Lord -- one person. He says that Elias was a man of like passions as ourselves, and he prayed that the heavens should be shut up, and they were shut up for three years and six months. That is what one man may do who knows the Lord. One angel was enough to smite 185,000 men. Shamgar, we are told, slew six hundred Philistines with an ox goad. And so in a host of other illustrations we have in the Old Testament what one man can do who knows the Lord, and who has an appearing. And so he says Elias was a man of like passions as ourselves, and he prayed, and the heavens were shut up; and then he prayed again because it would not do for Christianity to remain at the judgment side, but would bring in the blessing. And the heavens gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit -- that is, you have a definite end for God as a result of one man. So that, however bad things are, we are never at a loss. One man who is with God can do a great deal. But, then, that one man is not to rule Christendom; so that the next appearing is to *all* the apostles. He cannot rule all the saints: -- you must have all the authority of the Lord -- all the apostles. Not the twelve now, but the apostles. The same persons, of course, but the number twelve means administration, and the word "apostles" signifies representation and authority. I often wondered why it should say the twelve, and then the apostles, but I can see now clearly enough. The danger for James after a great exploit would be
{157}
to acquire undue authority and influence, and hence the balance is maintained by an appearing to all the apostles. Some of them we never hear of again, after they are named. We only hear of two or three, but they all represented the authority of the Lord, and He appeared to them *all*. So that we have to pay respect to all the apostles. That would mean today that every man, a brother, who has spiritual power, moral weight, among the saints, has to be respected as well as the brother who does the exploits. It maintains a good balance.
J.S. I thought perhaps it might indicate the necessity of having what is of real value in the background. Many of the apostles did not come to the front like Peter. Evidently this would indicate they were available to the Lord as a kind of background.
J.T. So that every brother who has moral weight, I apprehend, is to be respected according to the moral weight and influence he exerts for God among the saints.
G.A. I think that is very practical and heart-searching. I would like to ask whether what you presented to us earlier today would stand related to what is before us this evening. Can we expect an appearing in a way that is available to us now apart from practical exercise? One would cherish the possibility of such a thing, but one would crave to know how it is to be gained.
J.T. Well, you can see in a case like Martha how she would miss the particular feature in which the Lord would shine in her house. He would shine in some way in order to impress her, but how essential it was that she should be restful and free from anxiety and care, so that the fleshy tables of the heart, which are impressionable, should be available to Christ, like writing paper to a writer. You must have the material, and Martha did not afford the material for
{158}
the Lord, whereas Mary did. Mary was impressionable.
G.A. Do you think that Mary would have spoken of that occasion that we were looking at today as an appearing?
J.T. Well, I think she would apprehend as she sat there, as the Lord was speaking. She was listening to what He was saying. He was not merely entertaining her with incidents of His life; He was speaking from the fulness of His heart, and He would always speak with design, that design being to impress the listener. She would never forget that opportunity.
A.H. Speaking of James -- I suppose you would suggest he did something outstanding, and, then, in the apostles there would be mutual support -- nothing outstanding, especially in that connection.
J.T. Each one represents an element of authority. We have to be on our guard, I think, against undue influence of those who do exploits. They are to be regarded according to what they do, but a complete representation of the Lord's authority must ever be before us, so that everyone has his own weight. It may be he has only power to rule five cities, and another has power to rule ten, but he *has* power to rule five; he has acquired that.
W.P. What do you mean by doing exploits?
J.T. Such as Elias did. There are others, as I said, many others, in the Old Testament recorded, such as Samson's great exploits, and the mighty men of David.
W.P. I was wondering how they came down today.
J.T. There are those who do exploits in our time. There have been men who have done exploits (and we have gained by them), who have stood up against the Philistines, and defended the plot -- that is, recovered truth.
{159}
W.P. Preserved a little food for the people of God.
J.T. Just so. But God never deviates from the truth of the dispensation; that is, there must be rule, and so after the appearing to James you have the appearing to *all* the apostles, and then to Paul himself, which, I think, is unique, because it is an appearing directly out of heaven. Possibly, the others were all before He went up, but this is directly out of heaven, and it is the most interesting of all.
G.A. Would you connect this at all with @1 Corinthians 11?
J.T. Well, I was thinking of that. The Lord's supper was delivered to Paul from heaven, you might say. How fresh it would be in his mind, as handed over to the Corinthians! The Lord must have appeared to him in some way in delivering him that. So that he had it, not second-hand, but first-hand.
G.E. Would it not be the Lord from heaven communicating His mind to the apostle regarding the Supper?
J.T. Well, I thought that, and He would appear in connection with that to the apostle.
G.A. Would He appear as One who desired to be remembered?
J.T. I thought that. So that it extends down in a peculiar way to us.
H.M. We would greatly desire these spiritual manifestations. Would you say a little more as to the conditions on our side?
J.T. Well, I think, when it comes down to us now, that @John 14 is the light that governs the position. "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him".
G.E. That stands good for the whole period.
J.T. Yes, it does.
H.M. I was thinking, too, of those who got a
{160}
special manifestation, a special glimpse of the Lord on the mount of Transfiguration, and Mary at the grave. There were those who were not there. The disciples had been attached to Him, had followed His lowly pathway here, and shared His rejection, and so He decides that, as their hearts are attached to Himself, He will give them a special glimpse of Himself. Mary missed Him, too, and He must manifest Himself to a heart that misses Him.
J.T. I think Mary Magdalene, in @John 20, is a model from John's point of view, because Peter and John went to their own homes -- that is, they are compared with her. They did not, come up to her. Mary remained at the sepulchre weeping, and as she wept she looked into the sepulchre and saw two angels sitting -- the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. She got that much to begin with for her affections. I think John singles her out as a model, and then she turns round and sees Jesus, and thinks He is the gardener, and says, "If thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away". @John 20:15. The Lord brings all that out; it is to bring out what is inside, so as to show us how an appearing takes place. And then He calls her by name. He says "Mary". How beautiful the link established between Him and her! And she says, "Rabboni" which is to say "Master!" She owns His authority and right over her, and then He says, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren". @John 20:17. There, I think, you have the effect of a manifestation. You go to the brethren with it. The result of that is for the brethren, and the brethren are maintained in freshness by individuals who are true. It is a great service.
G.A. Do you imply that the moral outcome of an appearing is that you go to the brethren?
J.T. That is the Lord's intent. I think it is for
{161}
the brethren -- it is, of course, for yourself, but they are to get the good of it.
G.A. You imply, if we have what in principle answers to an appearing we carry to the brethren some fresh impression of Christ, fresh to us, and possibly fresh to them.
W.W. Is @John 14 suggestive: "I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you"? Is that a little on the same line, perhaps, suggesting the company?
J.T. I think so. That contemplates the assembly in order, as we say; that was what marked them at the beginning. He says: "He that hath my commandments". Now you come down to a time when others had them, and did not keep them. So that it is from that passage you quote onwards to the present time. Some had the commandments and did not keep them; others that love Him keep them, and they get the manifestations. In a simple way, it is some impression the Lord gives you. He has His own way of making Himself known to your soul, as loving Him and keeping His commandments, and you want to impart the gain of that to the brethren. I think that is how the Lord supports us now.
H.M. So that if we have to do with Him individually in that way, and then come into the company, it prepares a way for Him to visit us collectively.
J.T. Yes. So that you have it as the one who keeps His word. "If a man love me, he will keep my words"; that goes further than the commandment. It means that you keep all He said; every word, of course, is precious to you, and you keep it.
L.G. Would you say the Lord's attitude is seen in what is written to Laodicea: "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking"? @Revelation 3:20. He was ready for those who would seek Him.
J.T. Quite. "If any man hear my voice and open the door". But in Philadelphia you have the
{162}
aggregate of those who love Him, and keep His commandments and His word. "Thou hast kept the word of my patience". @Revelation 3:10. There it is not an individual; it is an aggregate of individuals. The Lord clothes the whole assembly with what faithful ones are. So that He goes on to say, "I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie: behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee", @Revelation 3:9.
W.P. Have you anything more to say about the appearing to Paul?
J.T. Well, I only referred to it in chapter 26 to show that the appearings were to continue. There is a sort of indication of the whole dispensation in his case, "in the which", He says, "I will appear to thee". The Lord is intimating to him that this would not be the only appearing. "There is light in My present appearing to you. Why persecutest thou Me?" The truth of the assembly was in that, but it had to be developed, and the Lord would appear to him in other features, and he was to be a witness of what that was from time to time.
W.P. Is what we speak of as revelation included in that? Paul received revelation.
J.T. Quite.
A.H-e. Would you say the main opportunity for the Lord to grant us manifestations would be at the Supper?
J.T. I suppose that would be when we are most restful. I always like to hold myself available, sitting down on the first day of the week with the brethren in relation to the whole assembly, and you are for the Lord then. I think that *He* comes into evidence in one feature and another, so that we are maintained.
A H-e. The Lord manifested Himself on two
{163}
occasions. Would that suggest to our hearts that the Lord would continue that service?
J.T. Well, I think that is the though -- it is weekly. @John 20 gives the weekly manifestations, and I suppose there is a suggestion there of what the company might look for.
A.H. On one occasion, "The Lord stood with me, and strengthened me". @2 Timothy 4:17. Would that be an appearing to him?
J.T. It would, indeed.
J.B.S. Do you get the thought of confirmation in the appearings, too? I was thinking of Jacob -- it is recorded that He appeared to him in the way -- confirmation of his recovery back to that which God had given him the light of.
J.T. Quite. But then, when He appeared to him in Bethel, He came down and stood beside him. That was a new thing for Jacob. It was very different for him to look up and see Jehovah on the top of the ladder in heaven, from looking beside him and seeing Him there. I think he had made progress, and the second appearing in Bethel is really a new appearing, so that we have the additional thought of the drink offering there.
J.S. I thought, perhaps, the Lord sometimes draws near to His people, draws near to us. Peter needed John to say, "It is the Lord". @John 21:7. The Lord was there, but *Peter* did not perceive Him.
J.T. Quite.
J.S. There must be very many times when the Lord draws near to us and we do not know it, and in that sense do not get the good of it; but the Lord is ever active in that way. I suppose there are occasions when John is there and says, "It is the Lord". @John 21:7.
J.T. Yes, and they are all set in movement.
A.H-e. You spoke about the drink offering.
Would you say what you have in mind in regard to that?
{164}
J.T. Well, I think it means that Jacob is now conscious that he is for God's pleasure -- the drink offering is for God. It was a new feature in Bethel. In the first appearing at Bethel there was no drink offering -- it was a new feature. In chapter 35 you have the drink offering -- Jacob was consciously there for God's pleasure now.
{165}
DIVINE APPEARINGS (2)
@Revelation 1:9 - 20; @Revelation 2:1 - 6; @Revelation 3:7 - 13
J.T. Our subject is the Lord's appearings to His people since He rose from the dead, as indicating that He purposed to maintain direct personal communication with His people, with the assembly throughout her sojourn on earth. It may help to remark that the personal service of Christ to the assembly is typified in Jacob. Eve is a type of the assembly as the product of the Father's work, and Rebecca would represent her as the result of the Spirit's service, or activities, whereas Jacob is said to have gone into the country of Syria and served for a wife, and for a wife kept sheep -- meaning that the Lord undertook the thing Himself. We are occupied with His own service, which continues throughout the whole period, for Jacob served fourteen years, as he says, for his wives, and six years for his cattle. By night the frost consumed him, and the sun by day. That is, there was personal exposure -- the side of the truth that should appeal to us peculiarly. And alongside the manifestations of which we spoke yesterday evening, we have this extraordinary one to John, which covers, as we might say, the whole dispensation of the assembly's sojourn here, in that it contemplates the various stages -- first of departure, and then of recovery. Hence, the bearing of it extends down to our own times.
J.B.S. Do we get departure and recovery in Jacob, in his going down and his returning?
J.T. Well, if you look at him as a type of a Christian you do, but we are also entitled to look at him as a type of Christ. The patriarchs all represent Christ in some way, and they also *represent individuals*. But I was speaking of Jacob entirely from the standpoint
{166}
point of a type of Christ. You see, Jacob "fled into the country of Syria", as it reads in the better translation -- @Hosea 12:12 -- meaning that it was extended, not confined to a city or town. One would venture to suggest that Paul's ministry (he representing the Lord personally), in its wide extent, would answer to that. He preached, he says, in a circuit from Jerusalem round about to Illyricum. He fully preached the gospel of Christ. It was what Christ, he says, wrought in me. It was Christ that was doing it. We see how Jacob on his arrival in Syria is occupied at a well, removing the stone and feeding the flock; and as Rachel appears she is called a shepherdess. There is a correspondence between her and Jacob. That is, there is the contemplation in both of active service, active care for others. This extraordinary appearing to John has the whole history of the assembly in view, and it is a proper adjunct to what we had last evening, only it will lead us to look at the failure of the assembly, the public body, and then we can also, by the Lord's help, contemplate with satisfaction and joy the recovery in Philadelphia. I think we can see by what we had last evening, and what is contemplated in these chapters, that the Lord intended to maintain personal contact with His people throughout the whole period. He is seen here as walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.
W.P. Does that suggest continuance?
J.T. Yes. I gather from it that the Lord is moving about at the present time, not only in relation to His own who love Him -- He has His eye especially on those who love Him -- which Philadelphia represents, and, indeed, which the overcomer represents in every assembly, but walks about in regard of what is evil. He takes account of what is evil, and that makes it extremely serious for Christendom. We may in our smallness of vision limit ourselves to our
{167}
own localities in our exercises and prayers, and, of course, the Lord values that -- what there is locally -- but He is concerned about the whole of Christendom; that is, the whole of the professing body forms His circuit.
W.P. Does it not begin small with us? We start in our own, perhaps a narrow, local circle, and the Lord instructs us, and we extend out in our thoughts and affections.
J.T. That is the normal effect of our contact with the Lord. You are led into His thoughts. "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me". @John 13:8. You have part in all that He is going on with, but it may not have occurred to some of us that the Lord is moving about, according to these passages, in the whole domain of profession, and *all* comes under His immediate inspection. Hence the judicial habiliments that appear here, and the power that appears to enforce His rights and to deal with evil.
A.H. An opportunity for repentance is always kept open.
J.T. Yes, quite.
W.P. Should the exercise for us be to hear His voice in whatever way He speaks to us, whether it is in calling attention to what is evil or what He can commend?
J.T. That is the thing. "He that hath an ear, let him hear". There is that which the Lord says to each assembly, and which represents His authority; and then there is what the Spirit says, which everyone is to hear. I apprehend what the Lord says conveys His mind for any given period. The Spirit enlarges on that, breaks it up through ministry.
A.H. Does the Spirit make it applicable for the present moment?
J.T. Yes. It becomes the ministry for the moment. The Spirit would enlarge on it.
{168}
J.T. You see how John becomes in this book a personal representative of the Lord in regard to all this. He is taken into the Lord's confidence. He sent and signified it by His angel to His bondman John, who testified the word of God, all things that he saw. The Lord in an appearing conveys to the person His mind, and makes him personally His confidant. So that there is personal representation. But then you find in John a gracious or loving identification with those who love the Lord. "I, John, who also am your brother and companion in tribulation". He links himself with and places himself alongside us at once. Whilst he is the Lord's confidant, as we may say, and His personal representative in regard to what is conveyed, he is also our brother and companion in tribulation. So that a mutual link is established at once with us, and the sympathies of those that love the Lord are immediately called into action.
G.E. Did the Lord suggest this when He said to Peter, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?" @John 21:22.
J.T. I thought that He reserved John. John was a reserve man, kept under the Lord's hand for a work that He had in View of the breakdown of the assembly. As it says in John, "He himself knew what he would do". The Lord is not taken unawares. He knew what was coming, and He kept John in reserve.
H.M. Before there can be those confidential relations and intercourse with the Lord, and the unfolding of His mind, the face has to be in the direction of Himself, has it not? So that John is turned round to behold Him.
J.T. Yes. We have to change our position for a communication, or a manifestation. You find throughout this book constant change of position. He is delightfully in accord with the primary feature of the dispensation. "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day",
{169}
he says. We may be sure if we are there we shall come in for something of this kind.
A.H-e. Would you say a little more as to the primary feature of the dispensation?
J.T. I think it is indicated in that word, "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day", that is, a state of abstraction in which one is entirely for Christ. You are for Christ, as in the Spirit, and therefore John was not personally at all involved in the judicial attitude of Christ. He had nothing to fear, and, whilst he would feel the general departure of the assembly as a public body, he was personally immune. The Lord lays His right hand on him and He says, "Fear not". The Lord gave him to understand that he was personally immune, and that His power, all the power of the Lord, was available to him.
G.A. Like Daniel, a man greatly beloved.
J.T. Just so. Laying His right hand on him involved that He committed Himself to John; all His power is with what John represents, and that runs right through the whole period, so that Philadelphia is commended because she has a little power, and He further unfolds to her that He is the One that "openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth", and He had set before her an open door which no one could shut. So that, I think, we are coming in for the "right hand", the power of the Lord.
J.S. Is that for us individually or collectively?
J.T. I think both. I think that the Lord has greatly helped us. Some years back emphasis was laid on the individual side, which was most essential, but now I think the Lord has greatly helped the brethren on the collective side; that is, there is a sense in which we come in for collective privilege, in which there is a measure of collective testimony, in the sense in which the Lord Himself is represented.
{170}
G.E. It must necessarily commence with individuals, would you say?
J.T. Quite.
H.M. Is not the outcome of this condition, too, that we see in John that the Lord presents Himself to him in detail, so that he gets the sense of all His present activities -- His hands, His feet, His face? He can trace it all, cannot he?
J.T. You see how that is broken up in the various addresses; how the Lord refers back to these features in the various addresses.
G.A. What is the import of John's turning to see the voice?
J.T. He is a model there; a model for us. We want to be ready to move as the voice comes. The personal pronoun "I" in connection with John is to be noted. It is also found in connection with the Lord Jesus in this book. When John says, "I, John", your attention is called to him.
G.A. I was wondering would it imply that the voice and the Person were the same. John had heard that voice, and knew it only came from one Person. I wondered whether it stood out in contrast to what comes afterwards. It is a remarkable expression, "to see a voice".
J.T. Yes, and our attention is called, "I turned to see".
G.A. "Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned", @Lamentations 5:21.
J.T. That is it. It is well when the people of God are prepared to move with the light -- with the communications that the Lord makes.
J.B.S. Is it similar to Mary? She turned, and she received that wonderful message.
J.T. Yes. It is very similar. It was not accidental. It is what you might call spiritual instinct at the moment. Every move that is seen in Mary should be noted, and so every move in John should
{171}
be noted, because the Spirit of God in the use of the personal pronoun 'I' is calling special attention to him, as you will observe in verse 9, "I, John". It is well to take account of models. Men of like passions as ourselves. The truth is brought nearer to you. So that in John you have a Christian, as he says here, "your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience in Jesus". He was a Christian, just in this sense, and he turned to see the voice.
W.P. Does the fact that he speaks of himself in that way, "your brother and companion in tribulation", suggest that recovery is not on official lines, but in connection with brotherly love?
J.T. That comes out in our day -- the brother, the companion in tribulation. You are ready to listen to him now. He is by our side; he is one of ourselves.
W.P. Not only do we recognise him in that way, but he takes that place.
J.T. He does. And then I think he is also typical in the falling down, because the Lord's appearance to him meant the general breakdown of the public body, and he, of course, was in that. If he fell at His feet as one dead, the whole public body should take that place. The pope should take that place, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the leaders of the Methodist Conferences, and the Moderators of the Presbyterians, and the Patriarch of the Greek Church, and all the lesser dignitaries should fall at His feet as dead. You see what a clean sweep it would make. John is a leader here; he is a leader for us, because if he felt the need of falling down, we should all feel it, because we have all had part in the public scandal of the assembly.
W.P. That involves right condition, does it not?
J.T. Quite.
J.S. Would you make a little clearer what John was immune from, and what John was involved in?
{172}
J.T. That is a good point to raise. John personally was immune, because he loved the Lord, and had no personal part in the general failure, but, being in fellowship, being outwardly connected with the name of Christ by baptism, or, at least, by profession, for the apostles were not baptised as far as we know; but by profession, he was involved in the general catastrophe, and in no sense sought to evade it. It is incumbent on everyone in the profession to accept the consequences of the general breakdown. We are all in it, we cannot evade the obligation; but, then, there are the overcomers. I take it that Benjamin represents the overcomer among the sons of Jacob. He had no personal part in the selling of Joseph to the Midianites. He was not with the ten brothers when that happened -- possibly had no knowledge of it. He remained with his father. But, nevertheless, he had to suffer the famine. God called for a famine; it says in the Psalms, "He broke the whole staff of bread". @@Psalm 105:16. And Benjamin waited with his father, Jacob, who had no personal part in the crime; nevertheless, they had to suffer the consequences of it, and particularly Benjamin. He was obliged to go through all the sorrowful and painful exercises with his brethren. He was not, indeed, put into prison like Simeon. Indeed, they were all imprisoned at first, and rightly. But, on the second visit, when they brought down Benjamin, they had to go through a painful process, and Benjamin shared it. Nevertheless, Benjamin was under Joseph's eye from the very outset of his appearance in Egypt, and Joseph's house comes into evidence as soon as Benjamin is on the scene. Then he gets five times as much as any of his brethren, so that the overcomer is taken account of, and immune from the ultimate results of the breakdown. Nevertheless, he accepts the obligation of it, and, to some extent, at least, he suffers with the mass.
{173}
G.A. Would you say that Daniel is a confirmation of that principle? Like John, he sees a divine Person presented. He takes up the position practically as John did. He accepts the liability in a way that rests upon him, although not involved in the thing. Though separate from it, he accepts the situation. Would that be akin to the position of John?
J.T. I think it would. It shows how an individual who loves the Lord may clear himself morally, and that word is important there -- that whilst we are publicly involved in the scandal we are morally clear. In falling down before the Lord, we accept the fact that the judgment involved in His judicial habiliments is merited by us.
A.H. Such a position would save us from any presumption -- accepting the shame.
J.T. It would. You see it in Daniel confessing his sins, his father's sins, and you see it in Ezra in a beautiful way -- the full acknowledgement of the guilt of the nation. In that acknowledgement he is morally clear. That is how we get morally clear, whilst still identified publicly with the general scandal.
J.B.S. Benjamin came in publicly as the son of sorrow. You would say that is what characterised him in what you have been referring to?
J.T. Just so.
R.W. Would that define our attitude in relation to Christendom at the present moment?
J.T. I think it does. If we are with the Lord we accept the shame -- the whole ecclesiastical shame, from the setting up of popery right down to the present time, and all the subdivisions of evil that exist. We are implicated in them all because the public position is, we are all partakers. But how to get morally clear is the point for us, and I think the overcomer is always the link. The overcomer is the link in every assembly, because an overcomer is morally clear.
{174}
J.S. There seems to be a principle in the ways of God that you are involved in things that you had no part in, and really not to blame for.
J.T. Caleb and Joshua would be an illustration, too. They had no part; indeed, they oppose the unbelief of the others, and, yet, they shared the consequences of the unbelief of the ten spies and all the people for forty years. Then they come in, ultimately, for their portion, because God is infinitely just with us. We lose nothing.
J.S. I thought if we accepted it as we should we gain much.
J.T. Yes. What one had in mind was that perhaps a consideration of these chapters would lead us to see how we get morally clear, and, as such, the Lord can identify Himself with us.
H.M. Is it not encouraging, too, that, if we take our true position, as John did, the very hand that holds the seven stars is put upon us, and the very mouth, out of which went the two-edged sword, says: "Fear not", and which unfolds His love to us?
J.T. Beautiful. I think we might see in the addresses a breaking up into detail of the general appearings. In the address to Ephesus, He holds the seven stars; that is, He supports those who are responsible. The stars are the angels of the seven assemblies -- those responsible. The responsible element, as yet, was supported by the Lord. He held them. And, then, again, He says to Smyrna: "These things says the first and the last, who became dead and lived", @Revelation 2:8. It appears as if Smyrna was in accord with John. This was a special word to John: "I am he that liveth and was dead, and, behold, I am alive for evermore". Smyrna represents a state of suffering among the people of God. "Ye shall have tribulation ten days", @Revelation 2:10. He says. The Lord is known as the One who has the power -- all the keys of hades -- so that He can limit satanic influence.
{175}
He can limit it. He is the One who became dead and lived. Then in Pergamos, He says, "These things says he that has the sharp two-edged sword", because the evil was setting in and the word now is the thing -- the word of God. The evil that was creeping into the assembly at Pergamos was such as might have been undetected, because evil is very insidious. Satan works insidiously, but "the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do", @Hebrews 4:12,13. So that the word of God was an immense thing for the faithful in the days of Pergamos. I can understand that in those days the Spirit of God would enlarge on the question of life and of resurrection, as the saints were suffering martyrdom. The great truth of resurrection, that He became dead and lived, would be enlarged upon in the ministry of the Spirit. But in Pergamos the word of God would be enlarged on, and coupled to the sword of the Spirit.
E.M.W. Do you mean the letter of Scripture?
J.T. Oh, no. It is more the word of God as used by the Spirit. It is really God Himself, "all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him". It is not 'it', but "him". It is the living word of God. It is living. And it is brought to bear on a condition like Pergamos when evil was creeping in. It would expose that for the true believer.
E.M.W. It is in relation to Scripture, though?
J.T. Oh, surely. For us the Scriptures are the record of it, but then you see the Holy Spirit is here, and that is what one would call special attention to: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says". Whilst we have in the Bible a complete
{176}
record of every phase of the word of God, yet the Spirit of God enlarges on that. So that we have amplification and application of what the Lord said.
A.H. You would not go outside Scripture?
J.T. No. You have amplification and application, the Holy Spirit being here as a divine Person. He indeed has indited the Scriptures. It is what He "says", notice, not what He 'said' In every phase of the assembly there is a speaking. There is nothing new added to revelation, but an amplification and application, perhaps, such as were not apparent in the apostles days, because the conditions were not there. It is a great thing to make room for the Spirit in His present activities.
W.W.W. That emphasis the importance of the present day.
J.T. Exactly. The Holy Spirit is amplifying what the Lord said covering this present time.
W.W. Would you say as difficulties arise we get light to meet them?
J.T. We do. So that when you come to Thyatira He says, "These things says the Son of God, he that has his eyes as a flame of fire", @Revelation 2:18. Now you see you have a ministry of jealousy, a ministry that involves the house of God, for the Son is over that house. You would look, therefore, for the Spirit enlarging on the truth of the Son of God as He is over the house, and in His jealousy dealing with all that is contrary to Him -- "eyes as a flame of fire".
G.A. Would that imply that there had been in Thyatira a disregard of the principles of the house of God?
J.T. Obviously. The whole government of the house and principles of the house had been disregarded. You know Rome and all the other great bodies are travesties of the truth of the house of God. The Lord feels all that interferes with His rights as
{177}
over the house. It is most interesting -- nothing can be more interesting really than this, because it opens up the whole history of the assembly viewed as having failed, and how the Lord has met it in His own personal service; it is what He is doing.
L.G. Would you say this comes out in the Lord? He goes up to Jerusalem and clears the temple.
J.T. That corresponds exactly. That is His attitude here. The whip of small cords corresponds with these features.
L.G. After having cleared it, in Mark, "He taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer?" @Mark 11:17.
J.T. He first comes in and looks around on all things in that gospel -- He makes a survey of what is there, then He comes back the next morning with a whip of small cords, and, entering into the temple, He purges it, and answers questions. That is a great principle -- He is supreme in it.
H.M. As these details are taken up, does not the particular detail of each assembly show that He has a particular word, a particular presentation of Himself, for each period and each crisis?
J.T. That is right. And we desire to be in accord with that. We wish to know what the word is for us, and see that it is enlarged on.
J.S. Do you connect it with localities as well as with what is general?
J.T. Yes, quite. For instance, He says to Ephesus, "I am coming to thee, and I will remove thy lamp out of its place, except thou shalt repent", That has a local reference, has it not?
J.S. I think it must have.
J.T. "I am coming to thee". And then He says to Pergamos, "Repent, therefore, but if not, I come to thee quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of my mouth", @Revelation 2:16.
J.S. That raises a local exercise!
{178}
J.T. Indeed. What a serious time at Ephesus when the Lord came thus. How differently when Paul, who was His great representative, visited the Ephesians, as recorded in @Acts 20. He sent for the elders, who came to him, and there was a beautiful expression of affection between them. He warns them of it; as yet the evil had not come in, but now this coming meant that the evil had set in, and He was going to remove their candlestick. I have often thought of the difference between the visit of the Lord to persons and a visit to a locality. If He comes to a locality as such, He deals with all in it.
J.S. That is, to put it simply, not merely the meeting as we speak.
J.T. He would deal with every Christian in the locality, indeed every nominal Christian is under His eye if He comes to a locality.
J.S. Every professing Christian?
J.T. What would you say?
J.S. Well, I am deeply interested, but I had not thought much of the profession myself. It commends itself to me.
A.H. The Lord here is speaking to all, although there may only be those who are vitally interested to hear His voice. He is speaking to all in view of response by all.
J.T. That is it. Everyone is responsible, every nominal Christian in this town is responsible to the Lord Jesus, and He holds them to it.
A.H. There never is a time when anyone may go on with evil. There is always a way out.
J.T. There is always a way out, and we must not evade the obligation resting upon us in our localities. The whole profession is responsible, and we must not forget nor ignore it.
G.A. Does it imply that the various exercises raised With the assemblies may be gone through in a
{179}
locality -- that it may be a question of one exercise now and a further exercise later?
J.T. Yes.
A.H-e. Do you think we should not regard this as past history in relation to the assembly, but its present application to us in our day in all its phases?
J.T. All these letters were to be written in a book, in one book, and sent to the assemblies, so that each assembly had all that was written to the others. That maintains a general exercise as to obligation to the Lord as well as local exercise. You know His mind about the whole, but you know it particularly about your own locality.
C.A. How would we discover intelligently the exercise which the Lord would raise in our locality?
J.T. What He says to Ephesus or to Smyrna or to Pergamos was an authoritative pronouncement. Now to bring that down to detail in any locality the Lord has His own way of asserting His authority. Something comes in -- it may not be much -- but it has authority in your soul. It appeals to you as the Lord's commandment; it is an authoritative word for the time. Now, the Holy Spirit will take that up, and enlarge on it. That is what is meant by, "he that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". The Spirit enlarges on that. It is not for you only, but for the whole assembly -- it is not what the Spirit says to the assembly. What the Lord says to such and such an assembly is said; but it is what the Spirit says to the assemblies. That is, the ministry is for *all*.
H.M. Would it make for a good moral state?
J.T. Yes, it does. But it gives a wide scope. The Lord may have an authoritative word for any locality, but the amplification of that is for all.
H.M. So that there is a principle that may be dealt with that is world-wide in its bearing?
J.T. Yes. If anything occurs in Brisbane, if a
{180}
conflict arises so that evil has to be dealt with, there is spoil from that. So that the Holy Spirit amplifies that, and enlarges on it, and the whole assembly benefits from it.
G.A. So that local difficulties, of whatever character they may be, cease in the light of that to be of small moment.
J.T. They do. They have a general bearing, the Holy Spirit is here in the assembly, and He operates in relation to the whole.
W.P. Are there not questions that may be raised locally that have no need to be raised universally?
J.T. No doubt, but if there is any spoil it is for the whole assembly.
A.H-e. So that you have not defeat before you, but rather victory?
J.T. That is the thing. So that, before you have the failure of Peter and the brothers that were with him, you have the thought of a manifestation mentioned in @John 21, because the manifestation is the thing, you see; it means the accession of light. That is what is in the Lord's mind in allowing things to happen.
H.M. So that every heart that loves Him in that locality, and stands loyal to Him, gets a special presentation of Himself!
J.T. Quite. You get that as spoil, and the Holy Spirit, I believe, takes it up.
G.A. This would make us intensely sympathetic with saints in any locality who are going through a specific exercise.
J.T. Yes. Because it is yours, Hence the thought is that the faithful in Ephesus would be interested in what was going on at Smyrna, and all the other assemblies. They are getting the gain of what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
G.A. It would not be a matter of curiosity, but of spiritual exercise.
{181}
J.T. Quite.
J.S. I was thinking there might be concern, not only in regard to what happened, but in regard to what we may have missed of the spoil that was acquired.
J.T. Quite.
{182}
REPROACH REMOVED
@Isaiah 4:1 - 6
It will be observed that in this passage a man's name is regarded as sufficient to remove reproach -- it is so regarded by seven women, these seven women representing a spirit of self-judgment. The previous chapter shows that the women of Jerusalem had so garbed themselves, had so adorned themselves with worldly equipment, that they were evidently under no reproach in *this* world. In verses 18 to 24 of chapter 3 it says, "In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, the chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the head-bands, and the tablets and the earrings, the rings, and nose-jewels, the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, the glasses and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils". @Isaiah 3:18 - 24. The possession of all these worldly ornamental things by the daughters of Jerusalem rendered them without reproach in the eyes of the world. But *these* seven women are not deceived by such outward show. They are consciously under reproach, and they see that the removal of this reproach lay in the *name* of a man.
As I speak to those who are believers on the Lord Jesus, I need not enlarge on the suggestion that this one Man is no less than the Lord. For no one has a name in the whole universe of God sufficient to remove reproach from others save the Lord. He has a name -- God has given him one -- "A name which is above every name" -- which is given under heaven among men whereby they may be saved. @Philippians 2:9. Hence the discernment of these seven women, who saw that reproach could only be removed and dignity assured
{183}
as they took on the name of the One Man -- the Lord Jesus. They said, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel -- only let us be called by thy name". And then, as in a note of feeling or exclamation, they say, "Take away our reproach!" Now, beloved friends, how much sense of reproach is there with us? If I bear the name of Christ abroad in this world, I am under reproach on account of that, but if I look toward God and the system of things He has set up in Christ, I am under reproach *unless I have that name*. It matters little what men may think, or how much reproach may be attached to me on their account. What concerns me, if I am exercised before God, is how I stand in regard to Him -- whether I have a standing as before God, whether as regards Him I am under reproach. And I am under reproach as in the presence of God, of the angels, and of the people of God unless I bear that name.
And so I would dwell for a moment on the name of this Man. What I am speaking of is elementary, and I trust simple to all, but it is of all moment that we should understand that we are called by His name. "Let us be called", they say, "by thy name", and then the feeling expression, "Take away our reproach!"
Now Isaiah brings to our attention the thought of Christ as Man in a peculiar way, and what I wish to convey is that He is on our side. You see it is one thing to apprehend Him as a Man on our side, and it is another thing to apprehend Him as Son of God as on our side. As the Son of Man, He has taken up a position in relation to all, and He removes all that lay upon us, and besides that gives us a footing with God. Hence in this prophet we have, "Unto us a child is born; unto us a son is given". @Isaiah 9:6. You see we are thus enabled, having light from God, to appropriate the Lord viewed as a Man. He has come to our side, and, as come to our side, He disposes, to the
{184}
glory of God, of all that lay upon us, through redemption; and then He dignifies and beautifies the race. That is the effect of the Lord Jesus becoming Man -- He has come entirely to our side. You will recall how, in the gospel of Luke, all the people were baptised, and then it says Jesus was baptised. He comes in at the end in wondrous condescension, and as baptised He is praying. You see how He has established a footing on moral grounds before God. It adorns a man on moral grounds to pray, and so He is seen praying; it says that as He was baptised, and as He was praying, the heavens were opened. Heaven acclaims its appreciation of the Man, and then immediately the genealogy is traced back through all the generations to the head of the race, to Adam and from Adam to God. So that the race is, in wonderful grace, accredited with this wonderful Man. So in chapter 32 of this prophet we have the statement, "A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from the storm; as brooks of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land". @Isaiah 32:2. It is what Jesus is as having come to our side; and as He is appropriated our reproach is taken away, so that we lift up our heads in the presence of God, in the understanding of the dignity of Manhood as in Christ. I apprehend myself related to Christ. In baptism I have cut my connection with Adam. I have taken on a new Head. I recognise a new Head, and that He has the very name that involves the removal of the reproach that lay upon me, so that I am set up without reproach in the presence of God as having taken on that name.
What I am speaking of is simply the gospel, but I thought it well, dear brethren, to refer to this point, so that we might understand how we are set up in the in-coming of Christ as Man -- how we are set up before God on a new footing, and how all the reproach that attaches to us as in the flesh is cancelled. We
{185}
have a new Head of the race. I do not speak now of Head of the body -- the assembly -- I speak of the Head of the race -- a new Head has come in, and I claim Him. It is the privilege of every man and woman in the world to claim Him. He has come in on our side, and so the Spirit of God, as heaven opens and acclaims its pleasure in Him, links Him on with man right through to Adam. And so I claim Him, and everyone may claim Him, and in taking on His name the reproach is removed. I am set up in the presence of God without reproach. It is a wonderful thing, and so simple, that it is within the range of every man and every woman to claim Christ, to take on His name, and in His name to have the reproach that attached to us as born of the flesh removed. Circumcision is the subjective answer to this. As I take up a position in the presence of God, and enter on my privileges, there is the application of the circumcision of Christ, in the putting off of the body, or totality, of the flesh; as it says, "This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you", @Joshua 5:9. 'I have in circumcision rolled away in the power of the Spirit, the reproach of Egypt'.
Well now, what follows the taking on of the name is beautification. It is one thing to be clear of reproach; to be set up afresh before God, but it is another thing to be beautified for that position, for God looks for ornament and beauty before Him. We need only to look at the heavens, and to look abroad on the earth, to be reminded of the divine requirements in regard to ornamentation and beauty, and here again we come to Christ. It says "In that day there shall be a branch -- or a sprout -- of the Lord for beauty and holiness, for beauty and glory". Now we are presented with another view of the Lord. He is not only a new Head for the race with a name that fills the whole universe of God, but also the beautification needed and so it says. "In that day there shall be a sprout of Jehovah"
{186}
-- that is how it reads. This leads us to consider the Lord according to all the freshness and vigour of life that marked Him, as dependent on God, in this world. He was cast upon God from the very outset of His being. Of no other babe could it be said He was cast upon God from the very outset. There was in that holy Babe for the eye of God, the evidence of dependence -- the freshness and vigour of a dependent life -- from the very beginning. He was a Sprout -- the idea of a sprout is dependence. The Lord took the ground, as a Man, to draw from His Father. He was God over all, blessed for ever, of course, but as become Man He was true to the position of Manhood, and He drew from God. He was cast upon God from the very outset, and so under the eye of God, in that Babe; and in that Boy, and in that Man there was the evidence throughout of a dependent life. He was the Sprout, beloved; and then it says that Sprout is "for glory and beauty". Now I apprehend the Lord in another way. I think of Him according to the evidence of life that was there expressed in dependence on God; and all that is available now for us, for ornamentation and for beauty. We take on His character -- the beauty of the Lord is put upon us, so that, in a subjective way, we are in the presence of God according to the Sprout. That is the evidence of life in its freshness and in its vigour; for nothing delights the eye more than the early evidence of life, and there is to be the budding, and the blossoming, and the ripening of fruit for God's eye. So that the Sprout, as it says, is for beauty and for glory.
And so it goes on to say that "The fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped". You see how all is made to contribute to the remnant; in other words, to those of us now who come in through faith for what there is in Christ. The very fruit of the earth becomes contributory for
{187}
our adornment in the presence of God, and so it goes on, "It shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone that is written among the living". Among the living -- I wonder how we understand this -- what it is to be "written among the living". We are all taken account of as believers, as given eternal life. Eternal life is the gift of God. I have it by believing; I have title to it. But then there is such a thing as "the living", and "being written" among them. Being written among the living, I apprehend, means that I am bearing fruit. I am not in the least degree seeking to weaken my title to life, which is presented in the gospel, but to be "written among the living", I apprehend means there is the *evidence* of life. And so it says in @John 15, "Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit". @John 15:2. He purgeth it -- that is, the Father -- that it may bear more -- *more*. What God looks for in this world, at the present time, in His people, is fruit and those who are written among the living are fruit-bearers. It is an immense thing to be a fruit-bearer, for the Lord comes into His garden. The idea of a garden is that it is carefully cared for. It is cultured and watered, and the trees are pruned and the weeds removed; so the Lord comes into *His* garden. "Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits". @Song of Songs 4:16. Where are these fruits to be found, save in those who are written among the living? So it says all such are called holy; for without holiness no one shall see the Lord.
Then it proceeds to say, "When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning" -- When the Holy Spirit came down at Pentecost, He came in the character of cloven tongues as a fire, and, it says, "sat upon each of them". @Acts 2:3.
{188}
I apprehend that the fire was for subjective purification. There is nothing in the whole world so effective in the removal of impurity as fire, and the Holy Spirit in us effects that practical purgation, that practical purification of mind and spirit. We are to be cleansed from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit. I am under the impression, dear brethren, that perhaps more attention is given to the purification -- the cleansing, of the flesh than of the *spirit*. A man may pass as highly reputable in the community who judges his flesh, who restrains his flesh, and yet he may be absolutely filthy in his spirit. A man who is filthy in his spirit is a man who imbibes wrong thoughts of God, and of Christ. He disregards the atonement. He is wrong in that faculty in which he stands specially related to God -- that is, his spirit. If the Holy Spirit is in us as the spirit of burning, He will deal with all that; and let no one claim to have the Holy Spirit who is wrong in regard of God and of Christ, and of the atonement. He is filthy in his spirit; he has not the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will not dwell in one who is filthy in his spirit.
And so, as it says here, "When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning". I would seek to exhort a little as to this, because all these great things of which I have been speaking are contingent on this subjective work of God in removing the filth of the daughters of Jerusalem -- that is, all believers -- by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning. If we have come into relation to God, and to Christ, and claim to have the Spirit, we shall look for these things. The removal of our reproach, and our beautification in the presence of God, are made contingent on this process of purification.
{189}
Now, having said so much, I want to say a word about households of Zion, the dwelling-places of Zion, and the assemblies of Zion. You will not misunderstand what I mean in referring to the dwelling-places of Zion and the assemblies, or convocations, of Zion. Next to oneself God takes up one's house, and I wish to call attention to the households of Zion -- a thought that perhaps may not have suggested itself to you, for we regard our households, perhaps, as men do; whereas, as believers, we should regard our households as dwelling-places of Zion. That is, they are taken up in mercy, the mercy of God as it extends to me extends to my dwelling-place, to my household, and what God desires is that there should be a certain spiritual dignity attaching, not only to me, but attaching to my household. And so it says, "The Lord will create". Now notice that word 'create'. It is a word that is used carefully by the Spirit. It is not an adaptation, the word 'create' is *something wholly new*. "That God should create over every dwelling-place of Zion a cloud of smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night". I look at that household. I know the brother. I take chapter 16 of Acts as an example; it is a chapter of households. We have at the beginning of that chapter Timotheus, the product of a household of Zion, of a dwelling of Zion. His father was a Greek, but his mother was a Jewess, a believing woman. She was a *believing* woman, she was not simply a woman who believed, she was *characterised* by believing. She had come into the understanding of the mercy of God, and she knew that the mercy of God extended to her house, and her son Timotheus was the great product of that dwelling-place of Zion. We maybe assured that over that dwelling there was a cloud by day, there was that which pointed to the divine interest, the divine protection, the divine care, and, as it says, "a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night".
{190}
So that as one looks on a believer's house one sees the evidence of the divine care by day -- the smoke, and the burning fire by night. I am concerned about my offspring in the daytime -- his occupation. He is the subject of the mercy of God, as belonging to my house. I think of him by night, he goes out, perhaps, in self-will, and enters into the haunts of this world, whereas over the dwelling-place where he was born and nurtured there is the cloud, and the burning fire by night; the evidence of the light and protection of God is there. One can understand that, as he returns from the haunts of this world, he is reminded of the light and protection of God that is over the dwelling. He has been the subject doubtless of his father's and his mother's prayers, and God knows it, and so, by night, as it says, "the shining of a flaming fire".
What a witness over the dwellings of Zion are they of the power of God, in light and in judgment against all that is contrary to what becomes a Christian household; and so, take Lydia in that same chapter. Her household is a dwelling-place of Zion. The Lord opened her heart to attend to the things spoken by Paul. What things? The announcement of the mercy of God. "According to his mercy he saved us". @Titus 3:5. She says at once, "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house". @Acts 16:15. The apostle found a congenial spot in that dwelling. There was the cloud over it, the evidence of divine protection and care by day, and the burning fire by night. No one could interfere. Think of how believers who have households may nestle down under the sense of divine protection by day and by night -- dignified indeed by both the cloud and the burning fire. Where are there households to be compared with such? As we may further add, according to Exodus, the children of Israel had light in all their dwellings.
And then again the assembly -- it says. "upon her assemblies".
{191}
This raises the question as to the principles that govern our meetings, and the spirit in which we come together. The great tendency with us is to drop to the level of current religion; acquiring a method, a recognised method, a weekly series of meetings, forgetting that God intends that there should be the covering by day. Do we not realise it as we are here together? We do. There is a covering by day, that is to say, there is protection, and not only protection, but distinction. You look for distinction in the assemblies of Zion. They are not like the assemblies of this world. The sanhedrim in Jerusalem before which Stephen stood had no such distinction. It was marked by man and human power and pride, whereas in another place, it may be a few paces off, a few of God's people meet together in some obscure house, and over that house there is a covering by day, and a burning fire by night. Such is the distinction, beloved, that God accords to us, as we meet together as those who form the assemblies of Zion. We are not marked by the principles of this world, or their ways. The principles of Zion mark us, and God Himself distinguishes us by day and by night.
Now I do earnestly seek that we may look into these things, especially the distinction that God places upon the dwelling-places of Zion, and the assemblies of Zion.
{192}
THE INDIVIDUAL AS AN OVERCOMER
@Judges 4:1 - 9; @Judges 5:1 - 11
J.T. I was thinking specially of the examples that this book furnishes of individual prowess, what *one person* may accomplish as devoted to the Lord.
A.H. Does the state of things in Judges correspond with our day?
J.T. I think so. What you observe is that they began happily, the history is presented first from the standpoint of the exercises of the people, up to the fifth verse of chapter 2. The book begins with the exercises of the people. "The children of Israel", it says, asked Jehovah, "which of us shall go up against the Canaanites first", @Judges 1:1 and then Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Come up with me". There is the recognition of the Lord in His sovereign rights, and then there is brotherly confidence -- "Judah said to Simeon his brother", @Judges 1:1. Simeon had got his territory inside Judah's territory, and Judah was not at all resentful of the intrusion, but regarded Simeon as *his brother;* of course much less influential, but nevertheless he is Judah's brother and he invites him to go with him to the conflict. I mention this as showing the setting of the book. It says later, "Judah went with Simeon his brother". @Judges 1:17. There is a brotherly reciprocity.
G.E. They were together in their exercises.
J.T. Yes; Simeon goes with Judah, and then Judah goes with Simeon. They act together. That is a point worthy of note in this book. But then the exercise that is thus noted declines, and we have such statements as in chapter 1:21, "The children of Benjamin did *not* dispossess the Jebusites", @Judges 1:21 and then again, in verse 27, "Manasseh did not dispossess Beth-shean", @Judges 1:27 and in verse 29, "Ephraim did not dispossess the Canaanites". @Judges 1:29.
{193}
Zebulun "did not dispossess the inhabitants of Kitron". @Judges 1:30. "Asher did not dispossess the inhabitants of Accho". @Judges 1:31. "Naphtali did not dispossess the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh", @Judges 1:33 and so on. And then it says in chapter 2, "The angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim". @Judges 2:1. The angel comes in to express the mind of heaven about the position. He says, "I have brought you to the land which I swore unto your fathers, and I said I will never break my covenant with you; and as for you, ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars; but ye have not hearkened unto my voice". And then it says, "The people lifted up their voice and wept". @Judges 2:1 - 4. There was a certain amount of repentance. That is how the matter ends. And then you have a new history taken up from the divine side. In verse 6, "Joshua dismissed the people"; @Judges 2:6 and so right down to the end of chapter 2 you have the history from the divine side. God raises up judges, and was with the judge. So that it is now a question of the judge, whoever he may be. It says in chapter 2:18, "When Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge". @Judges 2:18. Hence the judge becomes of immense importance from this point onwards, whoever he or she may be.
W.P. Does what we get here answer in some way to @Revelation 2 and 3?
J.T. Yes, quite.
Ques. Would the judges answer to the overcomer in a measure?
J.T. In a certain way. The overcomer is the link with God, the influential link, and he becomes, I think, the Lord's representative.
A.H. Would it answer to the angel in that way?
J.T. Well, the angel is more the *responsible* element in the assembly, and therefore would include
{194}
everybody; it places an obligation on you. Of course, the overcomer would take it up more definitely; he would take up the message with more heart and definiteness than anyone would.
W.P. And I suppose it would be the overcomer that the Lord could use in deliverance.
J.T. Just so.
W.J.W. Is it the breakdown of the public position that brings the angel into view?
J.T. Yes. It suggests distance. It is the Lord's angel in Revelation, His own angel, and then the angel of the assembly. The angel of the assembly is the representative of the assembly, but that works out in the way that every individual in it is brought in, because everyone is responsible. No one can disclaim responsibility. It is well to notice the two angels, or rather the Lord's, and then the seven angels of the assemblies. The one is the direct representative of the Lord, and the others are representative of the assemblies. But I suggested these passages because they bring out what, in a way, corresponds with what we have been saying. Deborah dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah. That refers to what she was personally, I apprehend. It denoted, I think, personal victory. She was an overcomer herself.
J.S. I wondered what you had in your mind as to the judges today. Who would answer to the judges today?
J.T. Oh, well, it is a question of overcomers, I believe, and then the sovereignty of the Lord allied to that; whom He may be pleased to support specially. What strikes you in the book is the variety of the selection.
J.S. I thought you were using the scripture to indicate what an individual might do.
J.T. I hope we may see that, because these passages strikingly illustrate what an individual, even a woman, may do as an overcomer. The variety of the
{195}
selection strikes you. It is to be noted, "Jehovah raised up judges". @Judges 2:16. He raised them up, but I think anyone raised up, would be raised up on the ground of moral qualifications. Samson may stand out as an exception, because he was indicated before his birth. Other features of the truth enter into his history. But, generally, I think, It will be found that the judges are raised up on the ground of moral qualification. The sovereignty of God is seen in the raising up of any judge, but nevertheless, as in the case of Deborah, there were moral qualifications.
H.M. Were there not with every one of them elements of sympathy with the condition of the people?
J.T. Yes, I think so. In the first one, Othniel, his wife represents the underlying subjective state of the whole book. She saw, as it were prophetically, the need of *springs*, because without the springs the very best instruction that we can have, the best order, will soon drop to the level of current religion.
G.E. There must be power behind it.
J.T. Yes, and freshness. She had the southern land, which is the very best. She had a south land, which I suppose would represent, in Christianity, the full outline of the truth, including Ephesians. We are favourably set up; we are in favour with God; everything is in our favour objectively. But then that is not enough. We may have all the 'collected writings' and the ministry indicating the mind of God, but we need the Spirit as the spring within. Achsah saw the need of that. That is what underlies the position -- it is seeing that the springs are needed, so she says, "Give me also springs of water". @Judges 1:15.
W.P. That is what helps us on the subjective line.
J.T. A spring is essentially subjective. It is from beneath, it springs up. And he gives her the upper springs and the nether springs; the upper first, because I think it has reference to the maintenance
{196}
of the heavenly side of the truth in a practical way in our souls, and then the result of that flowing out in the way of righteousness. Nether springs would be, I suppose, the epistle to the Romans; that is to say, the Spirit is apprehended, as in the epistles to the Romans and to the Ephesians.
F.C. So that, whilst her exercise desires springs, she does not specify what the nether springs are.
J.T. She left that with her father. "Give me *springs*", she says. Ephesians says that He gives "exceeding abundantly above all that we ask". @Ephesians 3:20. Caleb would represent God, I think, in this instance.
G.E. Would that be suggested in the Lord's word, "Ask and ye shall receive"? @Matthew 7:7.
J.T. I think so. These two features, at the outset, greatly help in the understanding of the book -- the brotherly spirit, and the understanding of the need of springs. If these two things are kept in view we shall proceed on mutual lines, otherwise God will need to raise up judges.
W.P. Having the springs, would that help us in regard to the enemy?
J.T. It would. What you see about Othniel is that he prevailed; he took Kirjath-sepher, and then he prevails as a judge, too. We are not told much of the details of his triumph, but it says in chapter 3:9, "The children of Israel cried to Jehovah; and Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. And the Spirit of Jehovah was upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah gave Chushan-rishathaim, king of Syria, into his hand". @Judges 3:9,10. What you notice is that he judged Israel before he triumphed against this great power. Usually the triumph brings you into prominence, but he had moral weight among the brethren. He belonged to a spiritual family, for he was nephew to Caleb.
{197}
G.E. It reminds one of Timothy coming in under Paul in that way.
J.T. Just so. It reminds us, I think, of the importance of "dwellings of Zion". Caleb's family is a spiritual family. He chose for his wife a *sister*.
W.P. One who had right desires.
J.T. Yes. It does not say in the Scriptures, "have we not power to lead about" a 'woman' but a "sister", meaning that there is a spiritual link already in a sister. So that there was a remarkable dwelling-place there in that family -- which thought enters greatly into our position in the assembly.
W.J.W. Would you say in connection with Caleb that he had thirty-eight years of appreciation of the land before he entered it, and so he would value the inheritance he gave his daughter?
J.T. Yes.
W.J.W. He could not give his daughter a better thing than the south land.
W.P. Do we get what answers to the judge today?
J.T. I think we do. But we should note these family connections. You see if we do not maintain the family connections and mutual feeling, then God, in order to preserve the testimony, is obliged to raise up a judge. He will do that in His mercy. But the conditions that prevailed at the outset did not require a judge. Judah went up, Simeon went -- that is, the idea of brethren was evident. This was holding things. But God is faithful, and if these mutual conditions are not prevailing, then He is obliged to raise up a judge. Such a one stands out prominently; he saves the people; the testimony is preserved. Gideon, I suppose, is the typical man in this position.
W.P. I suppose he would have recovery on that line, to get back what belongs to the brethren?
J.T. That is what a true 'judge' is; he would
{198}
rather have a mutual state among the brethren, than that *he* should have the prominence.
J.B.S. Would you say there was a mutual state in early Acts; they were together in brotherly relations, and then the Holy Spirit comes down? Judges are raised up to call attention to the departure from that which is of God.
J.T. Quite. You see that in Peter and John; the Spirit of God calls attention to them in @Acts 3, but after He calls attention to them, and the result of their labours -- the man that was healed -- they return to their own company, and they merge in that company, and so the mutual conditions are preserved. They are not outstanding in that company. They merge in it. It saves us from clerisy, which corresponds possibly with the Nicolaitanes. One specially prominent can retire and be one of the brethren. John says, "I, John, your brother and companion in tribulation". @Revelation 1:9. See how he merges with the brethren.
C.S. The family idea is what is normal -- that is the divine thought -- and the judge comes in as a result of failure.
J.T. Exactly.
A.H. I suppose you would say that God would always save the situation. He is never taken at a disadvantage. If a crisis arises someone comes to the front. Does not the crisis prove that there is a man of God? The crisis does not make the man of God.
J.T. No. God has His eye on him. He has been with God, and the crisis brings him out.
G.E. These principles have been maintained to the present day.
J.T. They are written for us, you know. So that the first thing to notice here, and in every instance, is that the people cried to the Lord. It is to their credit that they did so. They cried out of their distresses, but He hears them even then. And what
{199}
comes out is that she "dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah". I apprehend she was an overcomer.
A.H. What is the significance of a woman being a judge?
J.T. To bring out the maternal side. Chapter 5 brings out the maternal state of things that was there -- "a mother in Israel".
J.S. Is there some help for us in connection with dwelling between Ramah and Bethel? It says, "She dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel, in mount Ephraim". I thought the three things went to indicate where she dwelt. She had a connection with Ramah, a connection with Bethel, and a connection with her own palm tree. Bethel must be connected with God's house because it means that; but Ramah was where Samuel had his altar, I believe. Samuel's domestic connections were at Ramah.
J.T. Yes. Samuel dwelt there and judged Israel there.
H.M. Do you mean that she was right domestically, and she was right with regard to the assembly -- the house of God?
J.S. There was dignity about her domestic position, and her position relative to God's house, and the position relative to the palm tree.
J.T. The palm would represent, no doubt, her own personal victory -- the palm tree of Deborah.
A.H. She was a prophetess too, she had the mind of God.
J.T. Her husband, I think, represents light. Lapidoth is torch. So that in all her circumstances she was a very remarkable person.
R.W. Would there be a sphere of influence connected with such an one?
J.T. I think so. The Spirit of God gives us the
{200}
whole setting of the woman. She was the wife of Lapidoth. It was not simply that he was her husband; she was the *wife* of Lapidoth.
R.W. The mother in Israel and the wife -- does that suggest moral stability in connection with the sphere in which she lived?
J.T. I think so. It says "she judged Israel. And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment". There was a definiteness about her. "They *came up to her* for judgment". She had that place with them. It is one thing to be in the position, and it is another thing to have the saints recognise it. Well, then, what you see in her overture to Barak is her recognition of divine authority -- 'Has not the Lord commanded?' It is not a question of any specific command, but there was such a thing as that. It is calling attention to the assertion of divine authority. "Has not Jehovah commanded?" That is to say, it is a time in which God is asserting His supreme authority, and it is for Barak to see that, and come under it. So that it was not a question of her announcement to him. She was putting it on other grounds. It is not what I say, it is what God says. If you can make that clear, then everybody is exposed. He has to submit. If he does not submit we know where he is.
W.P. Lawless.
J.T. Yes. I do think it is very fine how a woman with this great influence and authority is not putting it forward to influence Barak. It is, "Has not the Lord commanded?" "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me". @John 14:21. We know He has commanded, and it is a question of making that clear to everybody. Unless there is a recognition of that a man is disqualified; he has no part or lot in the matter, unless submitting to the authority of the Lord.
{201}
A.H. The apostle could speak of his writings as being the commandments of the Lord.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. These are principles, thoughts that enter into every local company of God's people, and also in a general way. It is always a question of the authority of the Lord. You take account, of course, of a brother's word -- he is godly, and has influence and support from God -- but you want to be sure that the Lord has commanded.
E.M.W. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Lord would raise up a standard against it.
J.T. Yes, and you will always find that it calls attention to the Lord's commandment.
G.E. They had not obeyed the commandment of the Lord, so they were in this position.
J.T. Just so, and now the Lord had commanded, and the commandment had reference to Barak, and he was to move with the understanding that it was not Deborah -- it *was the Lord*. The position we occupy is of no moral worth unless it is based on this -- adherence to the authority of the Lord.
H.M. Is not the raising up of the standard a question of what Christ is as the gathering centre? The standard is raised; they gather round the standard.
J.T. 'Standard' is a military reference. It is found in the book of Numbers, which book contemplates all believers as mustered, first in regard of their localities, and then in regard of the whole position -- surrounding the tabernacle. Well, the standard would have some reference to Christ.
W.P. For any man, however great, to draw around himself would be only attracting from that.
G.E. That is what Christendom is occupied with today -- setting up different standards.
J.T. Like Absalom, who drew away from David.
Ques. Would that be lawlessness?
J.T. Yes, Quite.
{202}
W.P. The line that Deborah was on would preserve us in that way, because she brings the commandment of the Lord before us.
J.T. I was thinking that. I hope we shall get the thought into our souls that she is asserting the authority of the Lord. And Barak submits, he comes into it. It says, "Go and draw towards mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali", and so forth. "And Barak called together Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and there went up at his feet ten thousand", you see how the people offered themselves willingly. What is needed is a leader. So the celebration in the next chapter, verse 2, "For that leaders led in Israel, for that the people willingly offered themselves". You have a leader now under the commandment of Jehovah, and then we have the ten thousand men. It shows how leading under God is effective.
W.P. So that a lead is good, as long as it is according to the commandment of the Lord.
J.T. Indeed, it is a divine way of ordering and governing His people.
W.J.W. A ministry like that would keep the highways clear, and would keep the saints from the byways.
J.T. That is what comes out. "Until I Deborah arose ... a mother in Israel". Barak is brought into line, that is the thing. You recognise the commandment of the Lord, and then the people willingly offer themselves.
Ques. Is that the beginning of the victory? The people gave heed to the commandment of the Lord.
J.T. I think they followed a good lead. It is a great thing in a crisis if there is a leader who takes his pattern from Christ. That is the way to lead. Barak put his life in his hands, because he was contending against a tremendous enemy -- nine hundred chariots of iron, with a corresponding army. It was
{203}
very unequal conflict. Outwardly, he put his life in his hands. That is the idea in leading -- you have to sacrifice your life.
G.E. The Lord's words, "He that is greatest among you shall be your servant". @Matthew 23:11.
W.P. It is like the Lord who laid down His life for the sheep.
J.T. That is it.
J.C. Was Deborah in her right place when she called attention to the commandment of the Lord?
J.T. I think so. She is "a mother in Israel".
J.C. I suppose the judges were raised up for that purpose.
J.T. Quite. In the New Testament the faith is attributed to Barak, and she is not mentioned. The exploit is attributed to him -- the faith. But she shines here.
J.B.S. Would you say she acted at the right time? She said, "Up, for this is the day that the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand". She was in accord with the times.
J.T. Quite. Now when you come to chapter 5 you have a song of celebration, and it is Deborah and Barak -- they sing together. And what is celebrated at the outset is "For that leaders *led*". A leader is one who *leads*. And then the people willingly offered themselves. As it says elsewhere, "Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power". So that what we have to be concerned about in a crisis is the will of the Lord, the authority of the Lord. The people will come into line if you go right, if you lead.
Ques. Is that the thought of ten thousand men at his feet? The subjective truth would be typified in the woman, to be brought out in the people.
J.T. I think that is right. "The people willingly offered themselves", it says; and then she says, "Bless Jehovah", and she calls attention to what
{204}
Jehovah did earlier, and says, "In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the roads were unused and the travellers on highways went by crooked paths. The villages ceased in Israel, ceased until that I, Deborah, arose, that I arose a mother in Israel". The villages ceased and the highways were unoccupied -- meaning that the people of God did not act on divine principles, because I think divine principles are the highways for us, and then the villages, or the inhabitants of the villages ceased; meaning, I suppose, that there were no communities of fellowship, no interchange of neighbourly thought.
W.J.W. Would you say the village suggests prosperity, a spreading out of the town?
J.T. I suppose they would be places in which people lived, and communed with one another happily. Known places, with highways leading from one to another.
W.P. Should it exercise us if there was no meeting in a place where there once was a meeting; would it suggest that the highways have been neglected?
J.T. One, for instance, is isolated as some of us are; and there is no meeting, and the next thing is the highway. Occupation of the highway leads to a meeting; that is, divine principles would lead me to visit around in the neighbourhood, and look up would-be travellers.
G.E. God delights where there are proper conditions to open up new territory.
J.T. Yes. It is surprising how many of the Lord's people you find, if you look for them.
Rem. Get them on to the divine principles and you will have a village, so to speak, and it works the other way, I suppose, if there is neglect of the highways, villages cease.
J.T. In @Psalm 84:5 you have, "in whose heart are the highways". That is, the principles of God that are to govern His people in this world, leading them
{205}
into the purpose of God, are in your heart; and, therefore, if one is in isolation, the thing is to look about, and see if you cannot get these principles and highways into *another* heart.
E.A.M. Not come down to their level?
J.T. Not turn to the byways. Oft-times isolated Christians are minded to turn into some system. They say, "There is no fellowship here", and they turn into some denomination, and the brother is turned into byways, instead of looking around for some other traveller, and getting him into the highways.
H.M. Do not the highways suggest, too, that communications are maintained, and trade relations, with the places of administration?
J.T. So that it says in @Psalm 84:7, "They go from strength to strength, each one will appear before God in Zion". Every one of them appears before God; that is the ultimate end of the highway; all the highways lead to Zion.
J.C. Does that suggest the house of God?
J.T. Yes, the apprehension of the purpose of God for us.
H.M. Was not the reason why all this had come about the fact that the mother spirit had gone? -- had to be raised up, and is not that open for all of us? The apostle Paul said he was among the saints as a nurse who cared for her children.
J.T. Just so. So that Gideon, the next great judge, refers to his mother. He says, "What manner of men were they that ye slew at Tabor?" And they answered, "As thou art, so were they, each one resembled children of a king". @Judges 8:18. He says, "They were the sons of my mother". He does not refer to his father, because it is a question of the motherly influence; that is what gives character to the children.
W.P. So that if there are right conditions in a
{206}
meeting there will be healthy strong children -- sons.
J.T. Yes. There is a similarity to Christ in them.
There are many recorded as sons of the father -- the paternal side brought out, but they have not got the maternal characteristics; they have not the mother's stamp on them. Wherever you go you meet saints in the light of the assembly; they are all of the same hue and character. You recognise them readily.
J.S. Yes. You are struck with that. You are speaking about the isolated saints -- it is a very interesting point. We would be slow to encourage them to migrate to the cities.
J.T. I am sure the Lord's thought today is increase of meetings -- not the increase of their size, although that is, of course, to be looked for, but the increase of their number.
J.S. You would have a very definite exercise as to whether things could not spread where people are, if they came to light.
J.T. The Lord would appeal to all in any locality, and, if I am in it, the word comes to me -- why should I be alone?
R.W. Do you not think there is a very great need of travellers?
J.T. That is what you want to get -- all the saints of God moving.
R.W. To be moving with God in connection with the interests of Christ.
J.T. That is right. I think that is the idea of the highways. You are going somewhere. It is not a blind alley. If, I turn to the Methodist Church, what is the end of that? It leads nowhere, except, perhaps, more and more into the world.
R.W. Is not there the danger of settling down and making communities?
J.T. We want to see that there are communications. Highways, or communications, leading to one end. Now you see the chapter proceeds to speak
{207}
about "the voice of those who divide the spoil in the midst of the places of drawing water", chapter 5:11. This fifth chapter is really God's spoil, it is a triumph, a celebration to God. "Bless Jehovah". It is the outgoing of their hearts, showing what a conflict really issues in. As it says, "The voice of those who divide the spoil in the midst of the places of drawing water". The spoil is there, you see, and we divide it in the midst of the places of drawing water; that is, at our readings and places of ministry, we divide the spoil.
J.C.. That would bring in the brotherly spirit.
J.T. Yes, you divide.
F.C. That is in contrast to what is suggested in @1 Samuel 30. Those who went forward with God, they only should have the spoil.
J.T. David refused that. Here the spoil is divided. The authorised version does not give the sense, it is misleading. It is a question of dividing the spoil. "Because of the voice of those who divide the spoil. ... There they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah; his righteous acts toward his villages in Israel". That is the theme of the brethren as they come together at the places of drawing water; all these meetings are intended to be places of drawing water.
H.M. They go over and over again God's activities until they have them well known.
J.T. Yes, they rehearse them. They are places of drawing water, there is refreshment there.
A.H. There is nothing stale in Christianity.
W.P. It is Jehovah's triumph, not Barak's.
J.T. "His righteous acts toward his villages", the assemblies. We learn how to be righteous towards one another as we rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah.
E.W. Then they are able to go down to the gate.
J.T. "Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates". They are ready again to face the enemy.
{208}
The gates, too, have reference to administration -- dealing out things to others.
W.J.W. I was wondering whether it would be the administration of the spoil.
J.T. It would, very likely. In the Psalms it says, they shall not be afraid to meet the enemy in the gate; but generally I think gates are where administration is carried on. The house of God is the gate of heaven.
W.P. To go back a moment to the thought of judgment -- Deborah judged Israel; they came to her for judgment. How does it apply today?
J.T. Oh, I think in the sense of expressing the mind of God about matters. God has "appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead". @Acts 17:31. That means that there shall be a perfect discrimination of everything in Christ in the future. Judgment shall have returned to righteousness. God raises up men of moral weight and intelligence, through whom He conveys His mind and influences His people in what is right.
W.P. So that every question and every difficulty might find an answer today. We should have the Lord's mind in that regard.
J.T. It is wonderful how the Lord does give judgment amongst His people, as we submit to Him, and are simple about it -- His mind is made known about everything. They came up to her for judgment. It shows that they recognised that it was there.
R.W. There is no company, however weak, that it is not available to.
J.T. Just so.
W.P. It involves opening up the highways. We cannot get it unless we are acting upon divine principles.
{209}
Ques. Why is *Barak's* name given in the New Testament?
J.T. I think it is to maintain divine order. The order of God is maintained, I think, in Barak, because really it was he who led in the conflict. Deborah was with him. I do not suppose she would have any question about it. She would very heartily take a place behind Barak, and let him have the position of faith in the records.
{210}
HOLD THAT FAST WHICH THOU HAST
@Revelation 3
J.T. It may be well that we should be reminded  that what engaged us yesterday evening -- following upon the previous reading -- was that there was this extraordinary appearing to John, and that it contemplates the great departure and failure of the professing body, and covers the whole history of that failure to the end. It also indicates recovery, so that the assembly is seen, in Philadelphia, as loved of the Lord; the end thus corresponding with the beginning. And then it was remarked that the epistle represented the mind of the Lord, as covering the successive stages of failure or recovery, and that the voice of the Spirit, what the Spirit 'says', would be the amplification of *that* in ministry. Hence everyone who has an ear to hear is called upon to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. The appeal to those who have ears to hear, as has often been noted, comes in in the first three assemblies before the word to the overcomer; in the last four it comes in after the word to the overcomer, meaning that, from Thyatira onwards, an ear to hear is contingent on the overcomer. The public body is no longer appealed to in this day; the appeal comes in after the promises made to the overcomer.
W.P. Do you mean that it is only the overcomer who hears?
J.T. I think it is contingent on the presence of an overcomer. That is, a remnant is formally taken account of. Thyatira is the first assembly in which a remnant is formally taken account of, and that is the key, I think, to the position. After Thyatira we are in remnant days, and it is in the remnant that the 'ear' will be found, and the presence of a remnant
{211}
will be contingent upon the overcomer. It is well to see the position after Thyatira is noted, because it is based on the existence of a remnant, and the Lord's coming is the one thing now imminently before us. There is no thought of a continuance of public testimony; what would take the place of that would be the Lord Himself, as here He takes the place of the public witness.
A.H. When you speak of the remnant, do you mean the real part of the whole profession?
J.T. Yes, just so. As it says, after chapter 2:24, the "rest", or remnant, who are in Thyatira, "as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden, but what ye have hold fast till I shall come". @Revelation 2:24,25. You see, the "rest" and the "you", and the "ye", refer, not to the public body, but to the remnant. So that He lightens the burden. He does not place assembly obligations on the remnant, He does not place on the remnant the obligation that rested on the assembly primarily; that is, of being a public witness, or candlestick; "I do not cast upon you any other burden, but what ye have hold fast till I shall come". That is another feature, I think, of our position, that the Lord is not putting anything upon us, but to hold fast what we have. He does not say to the remnant in Thyatira, "I have set before thee an opened door", because this remnant is not regarded as in assembly state. They simply are said not to have the doctrine of Jezebel, and not to have known the depths of Satan. They were clean to that extent.
W.P. Can that position be taken up today?
J.T. Well, the position of a remnant, I think, is the one which we should take up. That is the basis of our position. The address to Thyatira contemplates the rights of the Son of God. The Babylonish system contemplated in that address -- Jezebel -- interferes
{212}
with the rights of the Son of God in the house, because another has taken His place as over the house. That is the position the Pope assumes; he is over the house, he is over the assembly, and it is a direct denial of the place of the Son of God. The Son of God is over the house of God, and no one else can have that place, so that His eyes are as a flame of fire, and He speaks of doing certain things, acting directly against Jezebel; "behold I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation". @Revelation 2:22. That, I think, is done now; He has done that, so that there is something definitely fixed in regard of her -- judicially fixed -- "She will not repent", He says, so that there is no hope at all of any recovery there; we have the Lord's definite word that she will not repent.
H.M. Then the godly remnant in that condition comprises those who have Christ as the object of their hearts; they do not let another get His place personally.
J.T. Yes, and they will rule, as He says, "to him will I give authority over the nations". @Revelation 2:26. This was the very thing that Rome claimed -- authority over the nations. Now the overcomer gets that from Christ, and it is much better to wait for it, because we shall have it permanently. He who takes it in violence, or in corruption, shall be ousted, and the overcomer shall have it permanently. "I will give him authority over the nations, and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of a potter are they broken in pieces, as I have received from my Father, and I will give him the morning star", @Revelation 2:26 - 28 which, I suppose, is the truth of the coming of the Lord. These are what the overcomer in Thyatira receives; and an ear opened to hear "what the Spirit says", would mean that the Spirit would amplify all that, and make it attractive spiritually to the faithful, making room for and leading them on to something else. That is what I think
{213}
ministry is; what the Spirit says is the breaking up and amplifying and application of what the Lord says authoritatively. The Spirit brings it in through ministry.
H.M. So that when we come to Sardis there is not only the hearing; but "remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and keep it" comes in, does it not? If we once delighted to hear it we shall remember how we heard it and always keep that sort of ear for the truth.
J.T. So that now the overcomer is placed before the hearing ear; and the truth of the Holy Spirit, I think, is introduced in the next passage, where the Lord says -- that is to Sardis -- "these things saith he that has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars". That is, He holds perfection of spiritual power, and He holds the responsible elements, too. He has got both. The seven stars are the angels, we are told elsewhere, of the seven assemblies. The Lord has the perfection of spiritual power, and He has also the responsible element in Sardis. Now, this is where I think great failure took place at the Reformation. Instead of taking advantage of the ministry which was there, and to which the truth of the Holy Spirit called attention, the Quaker, George Fox, as some may know -- pardon my reference to history, but it is needful to point out the bearing of this -- endeavoured to make room for the Spirit in those days, but went too far. He left out the 'understanding'. "I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding". @1 Corinthians 14:15. To sit down as a meeting and spend an hour or two together *without saying anything* does not represent the mind of God. It may pretend to recognise the Spirit and make room for the Spirit, but there must be the understanding. The Spirit works in connection with spiritual understanding. It may seem to be making room for the Spirit, but it is not doing so according to chapter 14
{214}
of 1 Corinthians, which governs activity in the assembly. There it is contemplated that I speak with intelligence, as well as with spiritual power. But, as I said, attention was called to the Spirit, and instead of recognising Him as here and sufficient for everything, the leaders of Protestantism turned to the civil powers and asked for accommodation. They got accommodation from the temporal powers.
G.E. That was a 'by-path' that you were referring to this afternoon?
J.T. Exactly; they were turned aside, because in the recognition of the perfection of spiritual power, which is referred to here, there was no need to turn to the civil powers for accommodation. The Holy Spirit is enough for us. Well, these are all features in this wonderful appearing of John that led up to what we get in the end -- that is, Philadelphia -- the assembly which comes in for the Lord's approval. He complains of nothing.
A.H. Sardis was not complete, that is where the failure came in. "I have not found thy works complete before my God".
J.T. No, nor are they. No works are complete which do not go on to the assembly. That is the great terminus. No ministry is complete that does not lead up to Christ and the assembly, and Protestantism does not lead up to Christ and the assembly. There is certain light in it; Sardis had received much -- for light was given at the Reformation, remarkable light -- but there was no moving forward. Take the Anglican ritual, not to go beyond that. It is like the pool of Bethesda; it is only as an angel comes in and stirs things up that there is any life, any movement. The part of the ritual that was said three hundred years ago at Easter is the same as is said today. That is not going on to spiritual perfection.
J.S. I have had an exercise of a kind. I do not
{215}
think we have very much understanding of the position of the remnant just now. We seem to be very vague as to how that applies to us.
J.T. Well, if we are anything at all now, we are not exactly a remnant of Thyatira; we are a remnant of something less pretentious, really a remnant of the movement of last century. But I think it is of great moment to see that this appearing of the Lord to John, in its bearing on Sardis calls attention to the Spirit in its sevenfold perfection.
W.P. Does recovery in that connection consist in getting back to that thought -- to the acknowledgment and recognition of the Spirit?
J.T. I think that is the ministry that Protestantism has failed to recognise. The Lord called attention to the Spirit; the overcomer takes that up, as having an ear to hear, but the mass fail in it. So that, "I have not found thy works complete before my God". The Spirit was not recognised.
W.W. In @Luke 2, when the Lord was born, the official side had broken down completely, had it not? But there were conditions there to receive the Lord, and I think that answers to the present time.
J.T. Simeon went into the Temple *by the Spirit*.
W.W. Yes, but he was not one of the officials, was he?
J.T. No, that is right. Of all the high priestly family in Jerusalem, there was not one qualified to receive the Child into the temple; it was Simeon, who was not an official priest at all.
W.P. Do those who thus received the Lord represent the remnant of the remnant in Ezra and Nehemiah's day?
J.T. Just so. What Luke calls attention to is the quality, not the quantity, of what was there. It is a very delightful picture, the group of persons that is presented to us there. When the Lord comes again shall He find a company like that? It is
{216}
not a question of the number, but the quality.
G.E. There were those that were found in Malachi, who had the secret of the Lord, merged into Luke.
J.T. Luke is the continuation of that remnant, who feared the Lord, and spoke of Him to one another.
W.P. Is that what you meant when you said that if we were a remnant of anything, we are a remnant of the movement within the last hundred years?
J.T. That is what I understand. I think that this word to Sardis is of immense importance, because Protestantism still remains. The Lord is bearing testimony to the presence of the Spirit constantly through one and another, and there is enough in the Spirit to support the people of God without worldly accommodation.
G.E. That is what marks the present dispensation, would you say?
J.T. Yes, exactly, and we may be sure that, as in the light of Christ and the assembly, our salvation depends on the recognition of the Spirit. He is sufficient to support us right to the end.
W.P. It will lead us on to completeness.
J.T. Exactly. The completeness is seen in the last chapter of this book, when the Spirit and the bride say, "Come". He has led her on to completeness; she is prepared to meet the Lord; she wishes the Lord to come into His rights; that is true assembly state, whether it be seen in few or many. The point is not the number, but the state. It is the Spirit that maintains that.
J.S. Would you give us a little connection between the move of last century and the move in connection with Luther?
J.T. I think that Luther's ministry fits in with the remnant of Thyatira, but then that culminates in Sardis. Sardis is the direct outcome, historically, of that movement, and it is to Sardis that the Lord
{217}
speaks about His having the seven Spirits of God, not to Thyatira. Attention was called to the Spirit, which was neglected, and the result was that the works were not complete. Protestantism never went on to the assembly; it could not from the very nature of things. The very term itself is a denial of the truth of the assembly, because it is a negative thing -- a protest in which the civil powers were involved and in which they were reckoned upon.
G.E. That shut the Spirit out.
J.T. It automatically shut the Spirit of God out.
J.S. Was there not as much exercise in regard to the headship of Christ as the gift of the Spirit?
J.T. Oh, there was, but the Lord has called attention to the means of support, I think, here, so that the people of God in those days did not need to ask accommodation from the civil powers. They did not need to do it; it was tantamount to saying that the Lord had not furnished them with enough means; they were short, and they asked accommodation, and they got it, and it meant their bondage, their thraldom. Well, now, I think there was a continual ministry. The address to Sardis was amplified and applied throughout the whole period until the revival in which Christ as Head in heaven was brought into evidence, and the assembly as the vessel of the Spirit. That, I think, is where Philadelphia comes in, because the Lord says, "Thou hast a little power" -- not the perfection of power, but a *little*, because He is taking account, not of the Holy Spirit personally, but of what they had come into subjectively. I have power only in the measure in which I have come into the thing subjectively.
W.P. Would a little power be in contrast to the beginning we see in Acts?
J.T. Yes, that was *great* power. "With great power did the apostles give witness". @Acts 4:33. Now, it is "little"!
{218}
H.M. There are those appearings which delight our hearts, but in connection with Sardis, the Lord says He will come as a thief, so that Protestantism is losing what it did have, is it not?
J.T. She is treated as the world. He comes to her as He comes to the world; but there were a few names, and it is beautiful to see how the Lord, as He surveys the whole field, claims His own. "Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy".
J.S. They represent the remnant, then?
J.T. I think so. Take a man like John Bunyan, well known to us; he is a representative of many in those days. A great deal of work went on that we have no record of. Many hymns that are extant bear witness to the spiritual exercises there were.
J.S. The Lord will give credit for every bit of fidelity there was.
J.T. He does. That is a feature in John's ministry, that every little bit of the work of God is taken account of. Nicodemus, for instance.
J.S. It seems to me that the further we go, the more every exercised soul is apart from all that represents Protestantism. In that way he has left the line of protest. Luther was very much connected with it.
J.T. The Lord would bring us into accord with the dispensation, and that is not marked by protest. Luke represents the dispensation of God, and instead of protesting he carefully avoids anything that would arouse resentment, or prejudice, in his ministry. I believe true recovery means that we have come back to the idea of the dispensation, and that is that you are full of grace and truth -- grace first, and grace is not protest. Grace is that where there should have been protest -- that is, Jerusalem after the death of Christ -- there is no protest; it is beginning at
{219}
Jerusalem; repentance and remission of sins are preached to all nations. So that the idea of protest does not fit.
J.S. I think that is important, because now and again you find persons who have been walking with us step out on the line of protest.
J.T. Yes. The principle of the dispensation really is overcoming evil with good; and you *must* have the good to overcome, and that can only be in the recognition of the Spirit; so that Philadelphia is said to have a little power.
W.W. The overcoming evil with good is bringing in the positive instead of the negative. To protest is a negative line of things.
J.T. It is.
Ques. Was there something in your mind with regard to power?
J.T. Well, I think that that makes a test as to what Philadelphia is; you find the power. There is a mark, you see. He says, "Behold, I have set before thee an opened door which no one can shut, because thou hast a little power". It is because there is a little power, for what would be the use of opening the door unless there was power to go through it?
Ques. Is it power in defending, more than aggression?
J.T. I think it is more in setting out the dispensation. You see, the man at the pool of Bethesda -- you might open the door for him, but he could not step into the pool. He had no power. Well, Philadelphia *has* the power, and hence the Lord says, "I have set before thee an opened door". It is an opened door, meaning that it had been shut. His hand has done it.
W.P. Is it in view of going out to declare grace and truth?
J.T. I think so. I think it is to come on to the purpose of God; no doubt it is also to preach, to testify to the character of the dispensation.
{220}
E.M.W. How had the door become shut?
J.T. The history shows that in Pergamos and Thyatira certain influences got control, and they shut the door against the further ministry of the Spirit. You cannot have an open door where clericalism is dominant. To be simple and practical and open, the very idea of clericalism shuts the door to free spiritual ministry.
Rem. "Ye have taken away the key of knowledge", it says.
J.T. Just so. You cannot have free ministry of the Spirit where clericalism is recognised as the ruling principle, so that the Lord has come in and opened the door. He had every key, and He set before her an opened door. There has now been liberty for spiritual ministry for one hundred years.
H.M. When the Lord presents Himself to us as having the key of David, what are we to understand?
J.T. I think the word 'key' in Scripture denotes administrative authority. Peter had the keys of the kingdom; that is, he had authority to open and to administer it, and he did. Now David stands in Scripture for administration. You will observe in the gospel of Matthew that David is placed before Abraham. "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ". @Matthew 1:1. In the chronology we would ordinarily say, "Son of Abraham", and then "Son of David", but instead of that it is "Son of David" first, because the point of view is administration. David was the great administrator in Israel. And so in the genealogy as you come to David it says, "David the king". We all know he is the king, but the Spirit of God wishes to call our attention to the fact that that is the point. You see, he is the king.
W.P. Reminding us that the Spirit of God had the great Administrator before Him.
J.T. That is it -- that is what Matthew had in view, and so here the principle of administration is
{221}
noticed at once. "He that has the key of David". "I open and no one can shut". He has also the keys of hades. "I have the keys of death and of hades". @Revelation 1:18. Now, if we really understand these keys, we shall be able to meet in our souls the current wickedness of spiritism. It is making far more headway than many Christians are aware of. But the Lord here notifies us, and all in the profession, that He has the keys of death and hades. And yet man pretends that he can dip down into hades and communicate with departed ones there, as if the Lord were to open the door for him to do it. I do not know of anything that refutes spiritism more effectively than the fact that the Lord has the keys of death and hades. What can they do if He has the key? Can they open without His key? Well, then, when you come to the key of David you come to what is blessedly possible. He has the administration of all the wealth of heaven, and that is what He is bringing in at the present time.
G.E. Would that be what would mark those of the synagogue of Satan?
J.T. I think so; all that is taken into account. The Lord says, "Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee". What an encouragement to every lover of Christ, to every member of the assembly!
G.E. You say they were Jews. Would they be keeping up a Jewish form?
J.T. Oh, no; it is more that they claimed to be the historical people of God, those who claim to be the normal successors of the early assembly. They are the historical church -- Jews. But the synagogue of Satan was there.
Ques. Is it in a religious way?
J.T. Yes; it is satanic power, and the Lord is
{222}
dealing with it. The overcomer in this assembly is contemplated as appreciative of the things that Christ appreciates. It is very beautiful to see how the overcomer in Philadelphia is regarded as valuing what belongs to Christ. He says to the overcomer, "I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more at all out, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my new name". To my mind it is extremely precious that the Lord takes account of you as valuing what belongs to Him. It is true assembly state. You value what belongs to Christ. It is the temple of *His* God, the city of *His* God, the name of *His* God, and *His* own Name.
G.E. So that there never was a day like the present. There is an opportunity for the faithful to stand true to Christ.
J.T. I am sure that is right; the promise to the overcomer in Philadelphia is an immense encouragement for every lover of Christ. He is telling us how much He values our love and faithfulness, and we are to have things that are in relation to Him.
G.E. And for that cause, before the great tribulation sets in, He will come in and save them from that.
J.T. Quite. We have indicated the features of the wife, the confidante. She thinks only of what concerns Him, she values what He values. So that I think the overcomer in Philadelphia culminates in the wife. "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready". @Revelation 19:7. She knows what suits Him now, and she has made herself ready.
G.E. Like the wise woman in Proverbs.
J.T. Just so.
E.A.M. What is it to keep "the word of my patience"?
J.T. The Lord is patiently waiting for the full
{223}
results of His death, but He is subject as regards it, and He is patient in it. That is all expressed in the word of His patience, and we are in accord with that. We do not wish the dispensation to close, we wish the Lord to come -- He says here, "I come quickly" -- nevertheless we are in the mind of God about it, and we do not wish anything altered.
A.H. It says "the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ". @Revelation 1:19.
J.T. Just so, John was in that.
A.H. Is that what it means, "direct your hearts into the love of God and the patience of Christ"? @2 Thessalonians 3:5.
J.T. That is just what it means, "the patience of Christ".
H.M. Then as to the pillar, is it not one who is made like Christ? He was the support of everything for God, was He not? And we see the overcomers standing up as pillars in the temple, so that all the beautiful things seen in the temple are supported by the overcomer?
J.T. Very beautiful. Certain ones were seen to be pillars, the apostle says. The overcomer comes in for that.
W.P. It makes it so exceedingly precious, because it is "the temple of my God".
J.T. Well, it just means practically now that you are Supporting the features of the temple.
J.S. As far as quality is concerned, would you look for something greater at the end than at the beginning?
J.T. Well, I do not know that I should. I have an immense admiration, and I am sure you have, for the early chapters of the Acts. It is difficult to think of anything greater than the devotedness and unity and energy and love seen there. Added to that, you have the Ephesian state. It seems as if the idea of the remnant is that it is part, as has often been remarked, of the original; it is like the original.
{224}
J.S. I thought in Ezra and Nehemiah you seem to take up divine principles in a way that they had not been taken up before in Israel's history.
J.T. Well, that may be, and certain things are said to go back to the book of Joshua, rather than to David's time, but still there *was* the book of Joshua. Another thing is that in the past dispensation, as it drew near to the present, there was a backward reflection, so that you have Anna definitely said to be speaking of Christ to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem. You hardly get anything like that in the Old Testament, although the prophets all testified to that.
J.S. That is more what I meant. It seems to me that Simeon and Anna had greater light than anyone who went before.
J.T. Well, I think they did as they drew nearer to Christ. You see, the assembly is set up in the full light of Christ. "I have not shrunk from announcing to you all the counsel of God". @Acts 20:27. And she was set up in affection in that relation, so that it is difficult to conceive of anything greater than that.
Rem. The Lord can specially illuminate the hearts of His people now.
J.T. Well, I think He does. But there could be nothing greater than what Paul refers to when he shows unto them the whole counsel of God.
J.S. I do not think it would be greater. I think the Lord credits the whole, with the faithful ones, at the end.
A.H. So that the Spirit and the bride say, "Come".
J.T. That is right; there will be full correspondence, I think, in state with the beginning. The bride will be there, but, then, she was there at the beginning.
G.E. Then as to the present condition of things
{225}
in connection with Laodicea, would you say that the darker the day the brighter the light?
J.T. Yes, it is the time of the "good figs". The good figs are very good, and the bad ones very bad. The *whole* state of the professing church is round about us. You have to contend with the whole state of the professing body.
A.H. That is, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea go on to the end.
J.T. So the word is, "Hold fast what thou hast that no man take thy crown". In the Ephesian state the downward drift began. Even in the millennium, there is a drift down from the thirteen bullocks to the seven. So that the overcomer now would maintain the full number of bullocks, so to speak; he would have *that standard* before him.
G.E. Then we must always recognise that we are a part of the breakdown.
J.T. We are, quite. What one might remark about Laodicea is that it brings out the unchanging grace of Christ; in spite of all that He must say about her, He *counsels* her to buy of Him gold tried in the fire. He says, in effect, 'I have it, and am willing to sell it to you'. He does not say that to Thyatira. And then, "As many as I love I rebuke and chasten"; that is, in His love. Then, "I stand at the door and am knocking; if anyone hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me". He is the faithful and true witness here.
G.E. In the last phase He is outside.
J.T. Yes, and He is witnessing to the character of the dispensation. He is maintaining grace; He is overcoming evil with good.
H.M. Where the conditions are the worst, He presents Himself in the most gracious way.
J.T. He does, indeed, and your exercise and mine
{226}
is to be in accord with His attitude, because He does this through those who are faithful.
A.H. Is He doing it through His people?
J.T. I think so.
H.M. So that all the presentations are meant to be formative. They characterise those who get them. I was thinking of the Song of Solomon. The result of all the presentations is that her heart is captivated more and more, and the end is seen. They say, "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved?" @Song of Songs 8:5. It is a sight for heaven to see the people of God, as the results of His presentation, moving heavenward in connection with Himself, accompanying Him, is it not?
J.T. Quite. So that John is the characteristic overcomer. The Lord says "Fear not". He laid His right hand on him, meaning that the overcomer right through would have His support, and if you have part with Him, as He proposed, you would be in accord with all these features that He presents.
{227}
THIS DO FOR A REMEMBRANCE OF ME
@1 Corinthians 11:23 - 25; @Matthew 26:13; @Genesis 40:14; @Exodus 3:15; @Exodus 20:24
The passage I read from in 1 Corinthians shows that the idea of a memorial was to occupy the central place in Christianity. I begin with that verse, therefore, so that you may have in your minds clearly what is in my mind. And one would appeal at the outset to those who have not as yet had any part in this memorial, who have not as yet responded to the Lord's request in regard to it, because, as believers and lovers of Christ, they are labouring under a very great disadvantage.
God, Himself, gives us a lead as to the idea of a memorial as early as in chapter 9 of the book of Genesis. He set in the cloud His bow, that which was to be visible in every clime. It was intended to be a memorial. So that God thus gives us a lead, which should be observable by all in the matter of this memorial. He said that when He looked at the bow He would remember His covenant. How many times He has looked at it, who can say? But the continuance of the seasons, the stability of the order of things which He inaugurated after the deluge, is a constant reminder to us that He has never forgotten to look at that bow. If men's hearts, as the apostle said at Lystra, are filled "with food and gladness", @Acts 14:17 it is but a testimony to God's constant recognition of what that bow signifies -- that there should be the continuance of the seasons, summer and winter, cold and heat, seed time and harvest. The continuance of the race on the earth was dependent on God's recognition of that memorial, and at the present time we have a tangible evidence in our very bodies sustained by the fruit of the earth, that God has never forgotten
{228}
that bow; in observing it He has never forgotten His covenant with man, and with beast, and with the earth itself. So that, physically, we are living in a stable order of things founded on the faithfulness of God, of which the bow in the clouds is a constant witness. And so I would say to young people here as you look at that bow, and see how God has given you a lead, and how your very existence physically hinges on His covenant with creation, does it not occur to you that you have something to do with *this* memorial? The Lord handed it down from heaven to him whom He had commissioned to bring the gospel to us Gentiles, so that we might have, with the gospel, this precious memorial of Christ fresh from heaven. It did not come to the Gentiles second-hand -- it came, beloved, first-hand. It came directly from the Lord in heaven to Paul, and he delivered it, as I said, to us Gentiles.
Well now, I want to go to Matthew just for a moment, because you have in Matthew and in Mark another memorial besides the one of which I have read in 1 Corinthians. In Matthew you have the Lord enjoining that, wherever the glad tidings should be preached, what the woman had done who had anointed His head for His burial should be spoken of for a memorial of her. Mark also relates the same incident, saying that the Lord said of her, "She hath done what she could". @Mark 14:8. She had anointed His body, and wherever the gospel was preached what she did would be spoken of for a memorial of her. I want to dwell on these two gospels in this respect for a moment, so that young ones here particularly -- and all of us -- may understand how this memorial, of which Matthew and Mark speak, bears on the memorial of which the apostle speaks in 1 Corinthians and of which Luke, confirming Paul, speaks in his gospel narrative. For Luke only of all the evangelists speaks of this memorial of Christ. Matthew does not say
{229}
that the Lord requested that He should be remembered, nor does Mark, but both record that the Lord said that the act of the woman should be spoken of as a memorial of her. Luke, on the other hand, as I said, does not refer to the act of this woman, but he does quote the Lord as saying, "This do in remembrance of me". @Luke 22:19.
I wish to speak of Matthew and Mark so that all of us, particularly young ones, here, may understand the bearing of this woman's act on the Lord's supper. I was saying the apostle had the memorial from heaven, so that as he went out into the Gentile world, and preached Christ, and men and women were converted and drawn together, as at Corinth, into an assembly, he would mention what this woman did for a memorial of her. I can understand some young one inquiring why she should be remembered. Why should it not have been Mary of Bethany as *John* represents her? Why should it not have been John the evangelist, who was specially loved of Christ? Why should it not have been Mary Magdalene, who was at the grave? Well, the answer to me is simple -- that what this woman did, as recorded in Matthew and Mark, involves the principles that are to govern us, as we sit down and partake of the Lord's supper. The anointing in Matthew signifies that the anointer appreciated the One whom she anointed as presented in that gospel. In anointing Him she spoke loudly. If you were to introduce to her the most revered dignitary in Christendom today she would give no ear to him; she would have no place in her mind for what he would have to say; she would say, 'I learn everything from Christ'. If I am to be governed, if I am to have part in the assembly, I am to be governed only by the principles that *He* laid down, and I have no ear whatever for any other principles, however plausible they may seem to be -- however necessary it may appear that there should
{230}
be a change because of modern conditions. She would say definitely, I have no ear for any such proposals.
I recognise that Christ has foreseen the whole history of the assembly, and He has provided for its government under all conditions and circumstances. And then, again, if I look at her in Mark, and someone comes to her of high repute, as a minister of religion in the world, and says to her, "Ministry should be under authority, it should be regulated by responsible persons; a minister should have the education of a university or a seminary; he should be a theological student" -- what would this woman say to him, or anyone, like her, who has come to recognise the Lord Jesus as set out in the gospel of Mark? She would turn a deaf ear to him; she would say, "My Lord and Master has laid down principles in that book for every Levite, and unless you are governed by those principles I have no ear for you". You see what a revolution this woman would make in modern Christendom were she heard -- were her example followed -- and how she would keep out from the circle of the saints all human principles and innovations by adhering to the principles laid down by the Lord Jesus Christ. Hence, as Paul preached at Corinth, he would mention, according to the Lord's injunction, what this woman had done for a memorial of her. Indeed, he was himself, in his ways and actions and words at Corinth, the embodiment of this woman. His epistles show that he refuses at every point human innovations in the government of the assembly, and in the levitical service.
And so Matthew and Mark have to be taken into account by young Christians, as well as by all of us, if we are to have intelligent part in this memorial of which Luke speaks in his gospel, and of which the apostle Paul speaks in the passage I read. We have to see what this woman did, and we have to emulate
{231}
her and imitate her, and if we do, we shall be preserved from the leaven of human principles in the assembly. We shall say, "Christ for me" -- not only for my salvation, but for my government, for the government of the assembly, and Christ for me, if I am to minister as a Levite. I have to learn everything from Christ. I virtually anoint His head. You may ask, "Why the head?" Because these gospels present what is official -- the government of God in Matthew, and the Levitical service in Mark, and hence He is anointed by one who valued Him in those two aspects.
Having said that much, I may proceed to say a word as to this memorial, and I wanted to show how it had been anticipated in the Old Testament, and incidentally to call attention to the importance of Christians reading the Old Testament, because you find in the Old Testament amplifications and details of great truths, which the New Testament does not contain. I may further add the great importance of becoming familiar with Scripture; for as, in this instance, and in all others, in order to be intelligent, we have to understand Scripture. Every scripture, as we are told, is inspired of God, and is profitable for doctrine and for reproof, and for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good work. Hence the importance of the Scriptures, and so the Lord in @Luke 24, when He came into the gathered company, as you will recall, says, "It is I myself". @Luke 24:39. He is never represented *in* the assembly by an angel. The angel represents distance in that sense, -- He comes into the assembly Himself.
So, as in the assembly, He opens the Scriptures, and from the law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms, on the road to Emmaus, He expounds to them, in all the Scriptures, the things concerning Himself. How that should appeal to our hearts!
{232}
How differently Scripture is read as we see it "concerning himself". It is concerning Christ. And so if I come into the assembly -- you will understand my use of the expression 'assembly'. I am speaking as if I were at the beginning of Christianity -- I expect to meet Christ. He says, "It is I myself", @Luke 24:39 and if I meet the Lord in the assembly, I look for something to correspond with what *Luke* records of His actions after He rose from the dead. I look for something to correspond with what *John* records of Him after He rose from the dead, and so with the other evangelists. But if I think of Luke I must come to the assembly with my Bible, unless I have it by heart, and I doubt if any of us have it by heart. You see the Bible is the accredited Word; it has authority, and if I expect the Lord to open up to me, and speak to me, and explain to me in the Scriptures, things concerning Himself, it is of all moment that I should have them with me. I cannot understand going to the assembly without the Scriptures, unless I have them by heart, and even then the Lord Himself used the actual written Word in the synagogue -- "He found the place where it was written". @Luke 4:17. It seems to me as if in Luke He set an example for ministry. The actual written page was used by Him, and so "He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself". @Luke 24:27. Is He not going to speak to me in the assembly? Is He going to leave all the speaking to me? No; if it is God's assembly over which Christ presides, surely He is to take the initiative. I must at least leave room for Christ in the assembly. He may open up something to me; am I going to miss it? What He says to me may give tone to my worship -- to what I say to Him, to what I say to God.
And so, now to revert to these scriptures. I can understand the Lord referring to @Genesis 40. Is it a mere incident that Joseph said to the cup-bearer of
{233}
Pharaoh, "Think on me"? Is it a mere incident confining itself to Joseph? No, it refers to Christ, and has a solemn, and an appealing, voice to every Christian here. He says to the cup-bearer, after he had opened up his dream -- full of precious light about Christ, and the vine budding and blossoming, and about the fruit, though I cannot dwell on all that, "When it is well with thee think on me, bear a remembrance of me with thee". I would speak to the young ones here as to what you think of that. If you had been in that gathering -- recorded by Luke -- in Jerusalem when the Lord Himself referred to the fortieth chapter of Genesis -- as He may have -- and made reference to what Joseph said, would it not have a voice for you as the Lord would go over these words, "Bear a remembrance of me with thee when it is well with you"? Does it not make your heart burn now? It is the living voice of Scripture. As in @Hebrews 3:7, where the writer quotes the Old Testament he does not say, 'as the Holy Spirit *said*', he says, "as the Holy Spirit *says*". It is present tense. It is what He says to me *now*. "Bear a remembrance of me with thee when it is well with you". It is a present voice. It is Christ speaking to us. How indebted that cup-bearer was to Joseph! At that moment Joseph had enlightened him as to his dream. The light involved complete deliverance from the prison and reinstatement with Pharaoh. But it says, he forgot Joseph. Who is there here like him who has forgotten Christ, the Christ that has enlightened you and relieved you?
Now I come to Exodus; I can understand the Lord referring to @Exodus 3 on the occasion recorded in @Luke 24. He would call attention to Moses at the bush. It says that when the Lord saw that Moses turned He called to him. As Moses is interested, God speaks to him. He says, "Moses, Moses". @Exodus 3:4. And so I would say to anyone who may be arrested by
{234}
what I am saying this afternoon for the first time God is looking into your heart, and He would call you by your name twice. Joseph gives us light as to repetitions. He said to Pharaoh that the dream being doubled, it was sure, and so, as God would call you by your name twice, He would give you to understand that His thoughts for you are established. His thoughts in regard of Moses were established. Moses was to be the leader of His people. He says, "Moses, Moses"; @Exodus 3:4 so "Samuel, Samuel"; and "Saul, Saul". @Acts 9:4. And now Moses turns to see, and we get all this unfolding, and God says to him, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob". @Exodus 3:6. That means that He is the God of the living -- compare @Luke 20:37,38. You see we are advancing now. And then He says, "This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations". You have the *name* now. Joseph says nothing about his name, but when we come to Exodus we have Christ coming in for redemption, and hence the name. He has acquired a name in redemption and that name is precious to your heart if you are one of the redeemed; it is a memorial. It enters into the Lord's supper. As I look at the bread and take part in it, I think of the Lord; I think of the renown that He has acquired in laying down His life. Death and destruction have heard that fame, and that fame is recognised in my ears -- it is the fame of Christ. For He went down; you say, how far? To the "heart of the earth". It is a dead Christ that is before us. The blood is separate from the body. Nothing can be more appealing to a lover of Christ than that. He was three days and three nights in the heart of the earth -- scientists may call it a geological impossibility, but it is a spiritual possibility. He went to the very lowest point -- the heart of the earth. Is it nothing to you? It is something to every lover of Christ. His name enters into that. The precious
{235}
body of Christ in death, the blood separate from it, is before us. So that He says, "This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations". How vividly that would stand out, as the Lord expounded unto them in all the Scriptures "the things concerning himself". @Luke 24:27.
And so we turn to @Exodus 20, which comes in typically after redemption takes place, and after the covenant. Typically the death of Christ has taken place, and the love of God is known; and now He says, "In all places where I cause my name to be remembered, there I will come to you, and there I will bless you". Now we are advancing again. You have not only the name now, but *Himself:* "There I will come to you, and there I will bless you". I believe many of us are not making headway in our souls because we do not enter into the Lord's supper; we do not enter into His memorial. And so I would appeal to all young people here as to it, "Where I cause my name to be remembered, there I will come to you, and there I will bless you". See what you are missing! "Why should you be the last", as David says, "to bring the king back to his house?" @2 Samuel 19:12. His house in a way is your heart. Why should you deny Him His right in your heart? The Lord opened the heart of Lydia, and she attended to the things spoken by Paul, and she opened her house to Paul. Paul was representative of Christ. She really opened her heart to the Lord. She was not the last in Philippi to bring the king back. You want to have respect for the king. The king is supreme, and as some of us were noticing this morning, "the king is held by thy ringlets", @Song of Songs 7:5. It says in @Psalm 45, "Forsake thine own people and thy father's house, and so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty". @Psalm 45:10,11 you say, "my own people and my father's house?" Yes, you have to make a clean breast of it; everything natural has to be surrendered for Christ. You can
{236}
take up your relations with your own people in a higher and better way, as you give Christ His place, the first place. "For he is *thy Lord*". You cannot escape the consequences if you continue to disregard the rights of Christ. "He is thy Lord, worship thou him". But here in this passage, it is "*I will come to you and I will bless you*". Can you afford to miss that, young believer? Can any of us afford to miss it? To miss it means non-progress, and exposure to the world and to the devil.
In this passage that I read, the apostle says, "I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you". We have it, you see, untrammelled by any human addition or innovation. We have the Lord's supper as He delivered it to the twelve and as He delivered it to Paul; "That the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread, gave thanks, brake it, and said, Do this for a remembrance of me". How precious it is! "And in like manner also the cup, saying, Do this for a remembrance of me". There it is, you see, fresh from heaven. I connect this passage with @Judges 15, in which Samson faces the Philistines, and he finds a *fresh* jawbone of an ass. It is the freshness of the thing. Although years have elapsed since the apostle delivered it to the Gentiles, it is as fresh as if it had occurred today. It is in the freshness of the thing that the power lies, and so Samson says, "Heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men". @Judges 15:16.
You see, dear brethren, how great a place the idea of memorial has in the assembly. It is the very centre, as one might say, to maintain constant activity of affection and mind, and constant freshness amongst us.
{237}
THE MAN CHRIST JESUS
@1 Timothy 2:5; @Psalm 105:17; @Numbers 12:3
The testimony of Christ as Man has a great place in Scripture. Indeed, we are told that the "testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy", @Revelation 19:10 meaning that the prophets, in the spirit of them, called attention to Jesus, and in the last great prophecy of Scripture, the book of Revelation, the Lord speaks to those who love Him as "I, Jesus". That book unfolds to us the appearance in Europe of His terrible rival, the man of sin, for Satan, taking account of the man Christ Jesus, the Man of the prophets, the Man of the gospels, the Man of the apostolic epistles, seeks to rival Him, and his workings to that end have continued almost from the earliest days of Christianity. For, as we are told, "The mystery of iniquity doth already work"; @2 Thessalonians 2:7 even in the days of Paul it had begun, and it has worked ever since. God has graciously held in check the result of that working, but, in due course, He will remove the check, and then shall appear he whose coming, as we are told, is after the working of Satan -- the man of sin shall be revealed. A most appalling prospect, but, as God is pleased to remove the barrier, he shall appear, he shall be revealed. These elements have long existed, and, as God removes His hand, they will all take form in one man, and he shall appear whose coming is after the working of Satan in all deceivableness.
Now, in view of this terrible fact, which none of us should ignore, the importance of the testimony of Jesus is evident; that we should have in our souls, dear brethren, a right conception of the Man -- as it is said here -- the Man Christ Jesus. As He was about to die, you will recall, Pilate brought Him forth, and called attention to Him, as if, under God, the Man
{238}
should be presented to Israel, to His murderers, ere they committed that foul deed -- His crucifixion. He brought forth Christ from the judgment hall, and he says, "Behold the man". @John 19:5. It is as if God would call attention to Him in that hour, as if there were no other, for really, measured up in accordance with divine requirements, there was no other. God had found in Him His delight; He had come under God's eye in His life here from the outset; the divine idea of manhood had developed and matured, and now it was about to be tested to the utmost, and before the test, under God, Pilate brings Him forth and presents Him, saying, "Behold the man". @John 19:5. It is, indeed, a voice that, as it were, sounds throughout Scripture. Pilate little understood the full import of the Man to whom he called attention, but for the moment he was acting under God, just as earlier the High Priest had said that one man should die for the people -- should die for the nation. God thus ordered it, that those who had little interest in Christ -- His enemies, indeed -- should call attention to Him.
So the testimony of Scripture is before one this afternoon as regards the Man. It is laid upon my heart, because of the importance of having clearly in our souls a conception of Him, in view of the awful revelation that is about to be made of the man of sin, so that we may not be deceived in any sense, for we are told that the second beast had two horns, as a lamb. That is, there shall be an imitation of Christ; Satan's great weapon to oppose the truth *is imitation*. As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so today Satan is withstanding the truth of the Person of Jesus by imitation. It is seen everywhere at the present time, and it is about to culminate in the second beast, who is said to have two horns, as a lamb. Think for a moment of the audacity of the enemy in imitating the Man of @Isaiah 53, "He was led as a lamb to the slaughter", @Isaiah 53:7.
{239}
we are told, "and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment, and who shall declare his generation, for his life was taken from the earth". @Isaiah 53:7,8.
Such is the testimony of prophecy, beloved friends, in regard to this Man, and I dwell for a moment on the preaching of Him as we get it in Philip. You will remember that Philip in Samaria preached "the Christ" @Acts 8:5 -- one who does everything for God and for man; but then he is directed to go into the desert, and in the desert he meets the Ethiopian -- he is definitely called an Ethiopian -- who was returning from Jerusalem, and who was reading, we are told, from the prophet Esaias. He was reading the testimony of Jesus. And it says Philip began at the same scripture, that is @Isaiah 53, and announced unto him Jesus. The Man Christ Jesus, you see, has reference to the Ethiopian as He has to the European or the Asiatic. Under divine direction, undoubtedly, this Ethiopian was reading the prophet Isaiah -- and that remarkable chapter, which is above all others the testimony of Jesus. The Man whom God approves of, the Man whom God has set over all, the Head of every man now, is the One of whom that chapter speaks. "Philip", it says, "preached unto him Jesus". @Acts 8:35. The Ethiopian believed the testimony of Jesus. I wonder if we have all believed that testimony? The eunuch believed, and Jesus became the object of his affections. That is what I want to get before us, beloved friends, that we may so apprehend the Man that He shall control our affections and our lives; otherwise we are sure to come under the influence, in one way or another, of the man that is about to be revealed, the features of whom, as I said, already exist. So the eunuch says, "Here is water". @Acts 8:36. You see where Christ has entrance into the heart there is no deferring of identification with Him.
{240}
Let us not defer for a moment complete identification with this Man; as was said to Rebecca, "Wilt thou go with this man?" The eunuch had no hesitation; he says, "Here is water" @Acts 8:36 -- a most remarkable thing in the desert, but you may be sure that where God is working there will be all the requisites of complete identification with Christ. The water was there. "Here is water", he says; "what doth hinder me to be baptised?" @Acts 8:36. And they went down -- Philip and the eunuch -- into the water together. That is, there was in Philip the spirit of the Man Christ Jesus. He would not stand on the dry land, and see his brother go into the water. He would go into the water with him. What a spectacle for heaven to see those two dear men, one a black man and the other an Asiatic, standing together in the water! And Philip baptised him, and we are told the eunuch went on his way rejoicing, and Philip was caught away by the Spirit of God, and was found at Azotus. You may say, "Why did not Philip stay with him and teach him; or why did he not direct him back to Jerusalem, so that he might be instructed by the apostles?" No, the Man Christ Jesus has universal power. He can direct, and teach, and preserve a man in Ethiopia, as if that man were in Jerusalem. I speak thus for the encouragement of individuals here who may have anxiety as to the future. If you commit yourself to Christ, you need have no anxiety, even though the will of God takes you into the centre of this continent. You may be assured that the Lord Jesus can take care of you. You see He has universal dominion and power, and it matters nothing where you are, or what race you belong to, so as you commit yourself definitely to Jesus He will take care of you. The eunuch had the knowledge of Jesus in his soul, and he had committed himself definitely to Him in baptism -- so he could go on his way rejoicing.
Now I want just to dwell on the two passages in
{241}
the Old Testament. You see in @Psalm 105 that God called for a famine and broke the whole staff of bread. Why did God do that? To bring out His resources in a Man. Everything converges on Christ. You see, whatever happens in the history of the race is to bring out what the Man is. God has His Man, and He loves to bring out the perfections and the power and the resources that are in that Man. So it says, "He sent a man before them". I wanted just to dwell for a moment on the feature of the Man Christ Jesus that is presented in Joseph. He appears at the very outset as a type of Christ. When he was born Jacob spoke of leaving Syria -- a very remarkable suggestion, for, as the light of Jesus comes into your soul, the next thing is, are you prepared to move with Him? He is not dwelling in this world. His life is taken from the earth. The man of sin will be set up in this world. It is his sphere. He comes in his own name, and he intends to set himself up here, whereas the life of Jesus was taken from this world, and as He comes into your soul you move. That is the suggestion -- you move. Jacob spoke of leaving Syria as Joseph was born; @Genesis 30:25. So, also, as he meets with his brother Esau, and causes his family to pass before him, Joseph goes before Rachel. I have spoken of this frequently, because I enjoy it so much. I enjoy the thought of the pre-eminence of Christ even in His infancy, and, unless you learn to acknowledge the pre-eminence of Jesus in your soul, you will not be formed after Him. So, as Jacob met with Esau, and as they all passed before Esau and did obeisance, Joseph passed on before his mother. He had the pre-eminence. Then, at the age of seventeen, we are told, he is definitely loved of his father. How beautifully Joseph stands out there, at the immature age of seventeen, as the object of his father's affection! And he brought back to his father the report of the evil discourse of his brethren.
{242}
How beautifully the traits of Jesus shine in Joseph. You see, God intends that these traits should appear even in the youngest believer. As a young man, or a young woman, the light of Christ comes into your soul, and you hear filthy conversation, and you abhor it. The theatres and the picture shows all suggest what is filthy. If I come, at the age of seventeen, into those traits, so beautifully expressed in Joseph, I shall not be found in association with those who use filthy language -- "their evil discourse".
Then, again, we find that he had the light of God in his soul. I think of Jesus here in this world -- the Man, all the light of God was there. He says, "I am the light of the world", @John 8:12 and so Joseph says to his brethren, "I have dreamed: for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and also stood upright". @Genesis 37:7. Can the man of sin raise the dead? No, beloved. He may imitate, and bring fire down from heaven, as the magicians of Egypt did. But can he raise the dead? No. When Moses brought forth the lice, we are told the magicians said, "This is the finger of God". @Exodus 8:19. It was the power of God in a man. Jesus is declared to be Son of God with power, by resurrection. In the type His sheaf stood upright. It was impossible that He should be holden of death. What a fact to get into our souls as to Jesus!
Then, again, Joseph had another dream, and he says, "Behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me". @Genesis 37:9. It is Christ *in heaven* -- the glad tidings that Jesus is the Christ. That is really what is bound up in this dream, Principalities and powers and authorities are subject to Him. You see what strength of soul we acquire as we pursue Scripture, and get into our souls the testimony of it about Jesus.
But Joseph is spoken of as in prison. You see how the man whom God sent before them portrays
{243}
the life of Jesus. His soul came into irons, we are told. His feet were hurt by fetters, until the time came when what he saw came about. That is, what he saw in his two dreams -- His power in resurrection and His position in heaven. All that has come about now; the iron has entered His soul, beloved; and His feet were made fast in the fetters; but God has taken Him out of it, the pains of death have been loosed. He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. So that we see how *the Man* shines out in Joseph. And in that prison he speaks of the life of Jesus in a most wonderful way. The cupbearer of Pharaoh told his dream, and it was darkness to him, but to Joseph it was light, and it was light about the life of Jesus. He says, "A vine was before me, and in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded; its blossoms shot forth; its clusters ripened into grapes". @Genesis 40:9,10. What a perfect presentation, as one might say, of the life of Jesus! So that the man whom God sent before them portrays in a wonderful way the life of Jesus.
Having said so much about Joseph, I want to say a word about Moses, the next great vessel used in the testimony. You see the Spirit of God at this particular juncture in Moses life calls attention to the fact that he was *the meekest man in all the earth*. I ask you to dwell on that. It is not a mere incidental statement; it is said expressly to call attention to the man; none had a better opportunity of proving the manhood of Moses than Miriam, and yet you find her at this time opposing Moses. It is a very searching matter. She was his sister after the flesh, and was considerably older than Moses. She watched him, in his infancy, as he was in the ark. She knew him as a baby; she knew his history, and so did Aaron, for Aaron was two years older than Moses. How much they owed to Moses! They owed all their dignity, under God, to Moses, and yet they were
{244}
arrayed in a combination against him. How aptly this describes the conditions which exist at the present time! You take Christendom.
What has given it its distinction in this world? Why, it is the light of Jesus. The introduction of the testimony of Jesus into Europe is most striking. It is said that "the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them" @Acts 16:7 to go into Bithynia. Why? He wanted the testimony of Jesus in Europe; and so Europe has been enlightened. It has been lifted above the rest of the world through that testimony, and yet the greatest combination against Christ is there. It is at this point that the Spirit of God calls attention to the meekness of Moses. There is an awful combination against Jesus at the present time, but the believer knows that He is the meekest of men. "He was led as a lamb" -- that is the type of meekness -- "to the slaughter, and, as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth". @Isaiah 53:7. That is the testimony of Jesus. Miriam and Aaron combined against such a man. How awful is the guilt of Christendom, the guilt of Europe, I may say, for there it is that the combination has been formed against Jesus. And why did Aaron and Miriam oppose Moses here? Because he had married an Ethiopian. I beg of you to note the connection between that passage and @Acts 8. An Ethiopian is brought. Japheth looks down on the African, but what about Jesus? Does He look down on the African? No. As you see the three races standing over against each other in @Acts 8,9, and 10 -- the African, the Ethiopian, is enlightened first. The testimony of Jesus takes account of *men*. There is no 'favoured nation clause' in the gospel. The Man Christ Jesus is the Mediator between God and men, and the Ethiopian was as much a man as Philip or Paul. Paul had left Jerusalem, we might say, almost at the same time to go to Damascus as the Ethiopian had left to go south. The Ethiopian is
{245}
converted first, and it is by the Spirit of Jesus. And so away in the north, at Damascus, the same Jesus is talking to the Asiatic. He says, "I am Jesus". @Acts 9:5. The same Jesus. He has the same rights over Saul as he had over the Ethiopian, and the Ethiopian was saved before Saul, and before Cornelius, the representative of Japheth. So Moses takes an Ethiopian wife, and Miriam and Aaron object. It was a family matter to them; family pride, you see, interfered, and they opposed the meekest man. How terrible that we should be found opposing Jesus. What is there in Him to oppose? What was Moses to Miriam and Aaron? Their best friend; under God they owed everything to Moses, and I say to everyone of us that we owe everything to Jesus.
Let us not be found arrayed, either by association, or by the adoption of principles, against Him. It is easy for even Christians to slip into opposition to Jesus. Satan darkens our minds, and we are found, perhaps quite unintentionally arrayed against Him. It is a serious matter that God should have to say to you, 'Why should you oppose Him; He is the meekest Man in all the earth?' The Lord says to Saul, "Why persecutest thou me?" Why should he persecute Jesus? "Who art thou, Lord?" He says, "I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest". Let us see to it, dear brethren; let us look into our hearts and see if we are in any way persecuting Jesus. If I am not following His principles, and am not identified with Him and His people, I am very likely to be arrayed against Him, for He says, "He that is not with me is against me" -- a very solemn word.
Well, now, the time is gone. I said all this to amplify the verses in Timothy. He says, "There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus". The Man who gave Himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be rendered in its own time. I wish every believer, as the result of
{246}
this meeting, would take afresh into his soul the thought of the Man Christ Jesus. He gave Himself, it says, a ransom for all. Mark you, "for all". Every man of this world was in His mind. "He sent a man before them". That means that Jesus, sent before, had every one of us in His mind. Paul says He "loved me" -- not 'He loves me', although that is absolutely true -- but He "loved me, and gave himself for me". I love to think of that. He was sent before me, and He loved me *then*. He loves me now, but He loved me then, and "gave himself for me".
Let us take it to ourselves individually, as Paul did. He "gave himself", he says, "for me". The Lord bless the word to us.
{247}
SPIRITUAL WEALTH
@Genesis 14:18; @2 Kings 4:1 - 13; @Proverbs 31:10
It is in my mind to speak from these scriptures of spiritual wealth, and consequent independency of this world, and of men in it. It is a divine thought that we should be individually, as well as collectively, wealthy. The idea of wealth -- divine wealth -- is prominent throughout Scripture, and in that epistle which may be said to be peculiarly *our* 'light' -- that is, the epistle to the Ephesians -- we read of the "unsearchable riches of Christ". @Ephesians 3:8. The glad tidings announce these riches, as it is said, "the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of Christ". @Ephesians 3:8. And so I wish to show how the believer comes into this divine wealth, and how he is thereby set up in independency of the world, and then, how the assembly is seen in the chapter in Proverbs as also possessed of this wealth, so that she needs not to ask accommodation from the world. Indeed, what has marked the history of the assembly, the public body in the world, is that it fell to the level of the world in first seeking accommodation from it, and then allying itself with it, so that it is now indistinguishable from the world. And, as the Lord has come in for us, dear brethren, in recovering us from all this, my exercise is that we may be preserved; that we may not rely on light only; that we may understand the income that there is whereby we are to be maintained at the full height of the position in which the light sets us.
So I wish first to speak of administration, and I take Abraham in the chapter in Genesis to represent a believer coming in for the gain of this; that is, for the ministrations of Christ, in order that he should not be dependent on the patronage of the world. Even although he may seem to have served as
{248}
Abraham did, the believer is not to come under the patronage of the world. As a matter of fact, Abraham did not ally himself with the king of Sodom and his confederates to help *them;* his part in the war had Lot in view. He undertook to take part in the conflict in order to deliver Lot -- a worthy object, surely -- and if one looks into the map of the territory traversed by Abraham in this war, one will be impressed with his brotherly interest; that, indeed, he laid down his life for his brother. He took his life in his hands in order to rescue his brother, and so, having succeeded, the King of Sodom would fain patronise him.
How often young people are exposed, as they come into the light of the gospel, to this snare of the devil! I wish particularly to dwell on this passage, because to young ones setting out in the path of faith it is of all importance that you should understand that the Lord is in heaven, and is thinking of you, and that He foresees what you are exposed to, and provides against it, so that the temptation may not be greater than you can bear. Hence what you find is that at this juncture in Abraham's history the king, Melchisedec, appears. I want young ones here to understand that this is not a mere historical incident in the life of Abraham. The Old Testament ever helps us as speaking of Christ, and this chapter is intended to instruct us as to the administrative service of the Lord Jesus, and that His administration has every individual believer in view.
Now, in @Acts 2, as you will remember, Peter announces the gospel, and the burden of it was to explain what had taken place in Jerusalem on that day, the day of Pentecost. It was a wonderful day; the Holy Spirit had just come down from Christ. Think of the import of that day! We are told that they were all with one accord in one place -- it is a collective scene -- and there came from heaven a
{249}
sound as of a rushing, mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. Heaven made itself heard in that house, and not only made itself heard, but filled the house. If the house was filled with that sound there was no room for any other sound. It is a notification, at the outset, that God intends to have control of His house; that He intends that His voice, and His voice alone, is to be heard there. It is not as yet a question of what was said, but the sound; it filled the house, and, as filling it, it excluded every other sound. That was a collective scene, as I said; but then it says the Holy Spirit "sat upon each of them". @Acts 2:3. In the character of cloven tongues as of fire, He sat upon each. That is, the Holy Spirit came down from heaven, the evidence of the administrative power of Christ. He not only was there for the company; He was there for every individual in it, so that the Lord takes account of the youngest believer here; He is more concerned about a young believer than He is about the affairs of this world. The international affairs of the world occupy the minds of men, but there is no joy in heaven in regard to any of them. There is joy in heaven as a believer opens his heart to Christ and repents. Heaven sees in that heart an acknowledgement of the rights of God so far, though that heart has to be dealt with in a positive way, for repentance is not enough. You cannot *live* on repentance. It is negative. It affords joy in the hearts of the saints who know you, but it is not joy in *your* heart; it is sorrow. I have no confidence in a conversion in which there is no sorrow, in which there are no tears. Repentance is bitter, but heaven intends that that heart should be filled, that the sorrow should be turned into joy, and so the administration of Christ is to the end that your heart should be filled. Hence we read that Melchisedec met Abraham with bread and wine. Who was there to compare in that day
{250}
with Melchisedec? Who is there to compare now with Christ? No one, and yet Christ, who is peerless, both in heaven and upon earth, is interested in your soul, and the wealth of heaven is available to your soul. The Lord is concerned at this moment that in your soul there should be enough, and to spare.
And so Melchisedec, as I said, appears. Who is he? He is King of Righteousness. Do you wish to have anything to do with any other king? You will understand I am not referring to 'the powers that be' -- one has respect for the king. We are enjoined to "honour the king", @1 Peter 4:17 and to pray for kings, but, spiritually, what king do you wish to be in contact with save the King of Righteousness? It is not only a *man who practises righteousness*, but the *king* of it. One has satisfaction in that Man appearing when the world had got adrift. Was God without resources? Men had elected to reject God, as it says, from their knowledge. Was He without resources in those days? He had a King of Righteousness. Think of what God had in those days, and think of what He has today for Melchisedec is none other than Christ. "Now consider", says the writer of the Hebrews, "how great this personage was". @Hebrews 7:4. He was without father, without mother, without beginning of days or end of life, assimilated to the Son of God -- it was Christ. And it was written down there for the youngest believer here, as well as every one of us, to enlighten us as to the interest of God and of Christ in our souls. The King of Righteousness appears, and He blesses Abraham.
And He is not only King of Righteousness. He is King of Peace. How the thought of Melchisedec towers up in that world above the puny thoughts of men! There was Nimrod, the beginning of whose kingdom was Babel. Then there were these kings who had just been at war; it was what we might call a 'world war'. But here is a king who has had
{251}
no part in it. He was outside of it. His concern is *to sustain the believer in the midst of it*. Think of that Personage being interested in your soul! He is concerned tonight that, as you leave this room and face the world, you should be fortified by His ministration, so that you should not come under the influence of it. That is what you get here. I speak at length on this point, because of the young people, that they should be set up in their souls in the knowledge of Christ in heaven administering to them the wealth of heaven, so as to fortify them, and set them up in independency of this world. Wrapped up in this Man is the millennium -- the world that God has in His mind. For the moment He is supporting a *solitary believer*, so that he should not fall under the influence of the world. He brought forth bread and wine. I need not enlarge on these two things; bread strengthens man's heart, as we read in @Psalm 104, and wine makes his heart glad. The heart strengthened with the knowledge of Christ, and gladdened by the holy joy of the Spirit, is sufficient to enable you to stand up against this world. He blessed Abraham. He says, "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heavens and earth". You see how He brings in God and Abraham -- God and you in other words -- and me. Hence, when the King of Sodom comes to Abraham and proposes to repay him, he says, No, "I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latchet, lest thou shouldest say I have made Abram rich". @Genesis 14:23. How dignified that was!
Now I want to go on to chapter 4 in 2 Kings, so that you may see how what Christ ministers is *worked out* in the soul after the Holy Spirit is received from Christ -- and I may remark that there is a difference between the gift of the Spirit and the reception of the Spirit -- the gift of the Spirit is in @John 4; it is from the divine side. The reception is
{252}
in @John 7; it is from our side -- but after the Spirit is received, from want of knowing how to draw upon Him -- how to use the Spirit -- the soul gets into bondage. That is, I link Abraham on with the woman in this chapter. He received the ministration from Melchisedec, it supported him at the moment, but what he received -- and what we receive from Christ -- has to be utilised, beloved, and that is where many young ones miss it and come into bondage in their souls. This woman, you see, was the wife of one of the sons of the prophets. She represents a believer who has light, but light will not pay your debts -- you cannot pay your debts with light -- and so this woman was in debt, and her two sons were in bondage. Taken together, they represent a soul who, although he has the Spirit, is not using the Spirit, and hence the light that is needed by such a soul is not the light *about* Christ, precious as that is -- he has that, he knows the gospel, and he has believed it -- what he *now* needs is *light about the Spirit*.
I hope you will all follow what I am saying. The gospel involves the Spirit, it includes light about the Spirit, and if we do not understand, if we have not got light covering the Spirit, we shall, like this woman, be in spiritual poverty. We shall have creditors, we shall be in bondage, we shall not be men and women of spiritual wealth. So she comes to the prophet, and he says, What have you got in the house? You say, "Do not throw me in on myself". No, beloved, I do not want to throw you in on yourself. I want to throw you in on the Spirit. The Spirit is *in you*. There is a very great difference between throwing you in on yourself and throwing you in on the Spirit. "What hast thou in the house?" he says. You have to be introspective if you want to discover what is in the house. You have got to look back on your spiritual history, that is; on your history since you were converted, and see whether
{253}
there are evidences that you have the Spirit "in the house". And if there are unmistakable evidences that you have the Spirit, then this passage is light for you.
The next thing is, "Get vessels". You will say, "What does that mean?" Well, that reminds me of how typical Scripture is. The meaning of typical Scripture is not on the surface, although it employs the most ordinary circumstances. The unspiritual eye runs over this passage, and sees nothing in it but the most ordinary circumstance -- a pot of oil, a woman in debt, and two sons in bondage. So that typical Scripture has to be read with spiritual eyes. As it is said, "Understandest thou what thou readest?" @Acts 8:30. Hence, if I inquire what it is to get vessels, what is it but that I make all the room possible for the Spirit? My spiritual poverty implies that I have not been unloading, that whilst I have received the Spirit I have been retaining myself -- I have been retaining the flesh -- I have been ministering to the flesh -- I have not made room for the Spirit. Borrowing vessels means that you are making room in your soul for the Spirit, and that means unloading.
Look about in the house and see how much rubbish is in it! Do you think this wise woman that we read of in Proverbs would have the rubbish in her house that many of us retain? She would not. She surveyed the ways of her house, and it is for the believer to look in his house, his own inward being, his spirit, his soul, his heart, his mind. You say, how are we to do it? Well, take the word of God; it is available to you, it is like a searchlight that one takes in his hand, and goes into the dark and investigates, and sees what is in the room that should not be there, and ejects it. It is a sharp two-edged sword, we are told, dividing asunder between soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. That is what the word of God
{254}
is. And so I would say, take that searchlight, and turn it in -- make an introspective examination, and see how much rubbish you have been keeping in the house. Your pitiable condition is because you have not been doing this. Let it be done at once. Well, the woman accepts the word of the prophet. She was to get vessels not a few, and fill them. She and her sons were to shut themselves in. This is a private matter. You know many of us have very little experience with God in the *secret* of our souls; many of us live on the meetings; many wives live on the spirituality of their husbands. Many children are content with the family readings and what they get at the meetings. What this passage means is that I shut myself in. It is a matter between myself and God. It is a matter of self-examination and self-judgment and self-unloading. So she has plenty of oil. There is not a vessel left, every crevice of the moral being is filled with the Spirit.
And now another word comes, "sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live on the rest". Again we have the most simple circumstances, but what are they spiritually? I have now, in making room for the Spirit, a means of discharging every moral obligation that rests upon me. I love God, I love Christ, I love the people of God, and I minister to their needs. And then I live. I have never lived before. I have been forgiven, I have repented, but I have not learned to live. Now I have. So that "the Spirit is life", as it says in @Romans 8, "because of righteousness". @Romans 8:10. Does it not appeal to you that God would set us up down here with the means of livelihood? The inheritance of fathers, we are told, are riches and a house. Is God behind? Not at all. He has given us the riches and the house to live in; let us live, then, by the riches He gives, and the house He provides. "Live of the rest", said the prophet.
Well, now I want to show that the Shunammite
{255}
woman is the counterpart of this woman, and she is living by the Spirit. She is called a "wealthy woman". It is the same woman really. Now she is wealthy. What is the evidence of wealth? She could provide for the prophet. She is able to open her house and entertain the prophet of God. She *perceives that he is a holy man of God*. I doubt whether we are able to discriminate between the holy and the unholy, until we have the Spirit practically living in us and operating in us. He is said to be the *Holy* Spirit, who sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts, and so by the power of the Holy Spirit I am able to discern between what is holy and what is unholy. There are thousands of Christians in this world who cannot discern between the holy and the unholy, and they are very often, alas, found in unholy associations, and yet their consciences are good. It is a most sorrowful thing to think of a Christian being in unholy associations, and yet having a good conscience. What is the explanation of it? The Holy Spirit is not recognised. He *is* the Holy Spirit, and so this "great woman" perceives that Elisha was a holy man of God -- not simply that he was a great preacher or a great teacher. It is one thing to recognise a great gift, and it is another thing to recognise a *holy* man of God. If you recognise him, you want to make room for him. You do not want simply to come and hear him; you want to make room for him. It is a question of Christ. Lydia says, "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord *come into my house"*. She would have Paul in her house. How she would regard the apostle as he entered her house! She did not think she was patronising him. She had received the light of God into her soul through him, and she opened her house to him. She perceived, like this great Shunammite woman, that he was a holy man of God. Well, the furniture was all in keeping, nothing
{256}
luxurious -- a bed, a table, a stool, and a candlestick. She discerned that the man of God needed nothing more, and she provided what he needed. But now he tests her. What shall be done for you? Will you be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host? What a test that was! If she had not unloaded the flesh already, she would have been tempted to have the king asked for something. How we do crave naturally for recognition by the great of this world! As royal personages pass around, how people run after them and seek recognition; but not this woman. Although it was the prophet himself who proposed it, she said, "I dwell among mine own people". What a word that is for young people -- *mine own people*. Have you found your own people? They have the Spirit, they are dignified, they are wealthy. No royalty in this world can compare with them, either in dignity or in wealth. "I dwell", she says, "among mine own people".
Well now, I want to go on to Proverbs, because the "virtuous woman" is really composed of individuals such as I have been speaking of. I want to show you from this passage, by the Lord's help, how the assembly is self-sustaining; how that through her own industry and skill she is entirely independent of this world. She has no fear even for the future. You may say to me in using the word 'independency' you may be shutting out God. No, beloved friends; the divine intent is that the assembly should be here free from human influence, without any need of man attaching to her; without any need of philosophy, vain deceit, or ceremonialism. It was the divine thought that she should, as having Christ in heaven as her Head, hold Him, and from Him receive such nourishment, such wealth, ministered through the joints and bands; that she should make increase according to the increase of God. I want every Christian here to understand that he is connected
{257}
with that; that it is a living *organism*. The assembly is an organism. As it says again in Ephesians, "from whom the whole body, ... according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love". That was the divine intent, and it shuts out -- as I may say, automatically -- every human intrusion. It is here in divine wealth and sustenance, so as to be entirely independent of man or the world.
So I turn to this woman for a moment. "Who can find a woman of worth?" says the writer of the Proverbs. In the book of Ecclesiastes, Solomon said that he had not found one woman among a thousand. He had found a man. Ecclesiastes is the preacher, and we only need a man for the preaching, for Christ is preached. But in this book the writer contemplates a woman of worth. The Spirit of God has the assembly in His mind, This book is the Kingdom of the Son of the Father's love. Believers are said to be delivered from the authority of darkness and transferred into the Kingdom of the Son of the Father's love. These are a selection from three thousand proverbs spoken by Solomon, and they convey to us the wisdom of love. That is what the book is. He says, "I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother". @Proverbs 4:3. There was never a babe like Solomon. He was brought up in affection, and so is qualified, as divinely imbued with wisdom, to represent Christ as the Son of the Father's love. Then he takes -- every believer and tutors him in the instruction of a father, so that in the aggregate there should be "a woman of worth". Hence he says, "Who can find a woman of worth? for her price is far above rubies", and then he proceeds to outline the traits of this woman of worth.
He says, "The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her". @Proverbs 30:11. Think of what it is to Christ to have a confidante in this world, one in whom His heart can safely trust! How does that appeal to you?
{258}
Can He trust us? If He cannot, we do not measure up with these virtuous traits of the woman of worth. And so he goes on, "She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life". @Proverbs 30:12. How these words come home to one's heart! Have I done Him good and not evil all the days of my life? Have you? These traits are given so that we may have a standard to measure ourselves by.
Then it says, "She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. She is like the merchants ships; she bringeth her food from afar". @Proverbs 30:13,14 you see the industry and the selection in her purchases. She buys wool and flax and she works willingly. It refers to the collective industry of the assembly of the saints. One can trace it out in the Acts of the Apostles, but I can only run over it here. The wool affords comfort for the winter, and flax affords comfort for the summer. Linen garments fit the summer; they are cooling. Wool is heating. She selects both. And she is like merchants ships, "she bringeth her food from afar". @Proverbs 30:14. Who but the assembly can act at such a distance? She brings it from heaven. By the presence of the Holy Spirit here, there are direct communications with heaven. There are direct communications between Christ in heaven and the assembly, and she trades upon those resources like the merchants ships; she brings her food from afar.
"She riseth also, while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens". @Proverbs 30:15. Rising early is a divine trait. God rose early to send the prophets to Israel; "He that keepeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep" @@Psalm 121:4 -- and so "her candle goeth not out by night". @Proverbs 30:18. The precious light of the Spirit shines throughout the night in the assembly; there is no darkness there, and there is no laziness. There is agreement with heaven. So it goes on. "She considereth a field and buyeth it; with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard". @Proverbs 30:16.
{259}
This is not adding field to field, like the 'corporations' of the world at the present time, spoken of, indeed, in the book of Isaiah. She considers a field and buyeth it. She acquires it in righteousness. That is to say, the assembly is ever bent on extending her borders. Normally, as we see in the Acts of the apostles, there was continual increase of the assembly's influence. She acquired the field, and she planted a vineyard. The field was not to be idle. Nothing goes to waste, or is idle in the assembly. The field is acquired, and it is employed to plant a vineyard. I need not enlarge on what that is, beloved brethren. The vine provides what makes glad the heart of God and man, so that every extension of the assembly's influence involved joy for God and joy for man.
"She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms". @Proverbs 30:17. The apostle says, "Be strong in the Lord, and in the might of his strength". @Ephesians 6:10. She makes strong her arms to support others.
"She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy". @Proverbs 30:19,20. You see these wonderful traits of the assembly as set up here in the power of the Spirit. The needy are helped. You see how the needy come into view. There are maidens provided for, and the needy; and it says, "She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet". @Proverbs 30:21. There is plenty of warmth. Many of us know what the bitter north wind is -- I am speaking of the northern latitudes -- signifying winter. It refers to the believer exposed to the adverse influences of the world, and I Wish you, dear young people, to take into your minds the thought that the assembly is not afraid of the snow, for all her household is clothed with scarlet. Then keep close to the saints; attend the meetings. I am speaking of individual
{260}
exercises now. Keep with the people of God. The Spirit of God is with them. There is warmth with them; you need not be afraid of the snow, as you know the circle of life. She is not afraid. So it says, "She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land", @Proverbs 30:22,23. The Lord Jesus should be known through the assembly, but through her as seen in this wonderful type; when He sits among the elders of the land, He shall be known. "She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness". @Proverbs 30:24 - 26. You hear her speaking, that is in her members, if the law of kindness is in what she says.
And then it finally says, "She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her". @Proverbs 30:27,28. "She looketh well to the ways of her household". How that comes down to the local companies of the people of God! In the care meetings every detail concerning the interests of Christ is carefully looked into and watched over. "Her children arise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all". @Proverbs 30:28,29. The Spirit of God here has His eye upon the assembly. "Thou excellest them all". The assembly stands out in the eye of the Spirit as excelling all the families. She is first. The Father names every family, and she comes in as excelling them all. And so it says, "to him (God) be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages". @Ephesians 3:21. In the Ephesians she is seen as the vessel of the glory of God throughout all generations of the age of ages.

*Pages 261 - 385 -- "Divine Administration". Sydney, 1925 (Volume 74)*.
ADMINISTRATION (1)
@Acts 2:1 - 4, 14 - 17
J.T. I have been thinking of that feature of the dispensation which we speak of as administrative -- administration. It occurred to me that a consideration of the administrative feature of this dispensation would help to clear the position at the outset. Some of us, elsewhere, were looking at the Lord's services, as risen, before He ascended, having in view that they indicate His present personal activity for the assembly during its sojourn on earth. We were enabled, by the Lord's help, to see that each evangelist presents some feature of this service. We began with John and worked backwards to Matthew, on the principle that John is intended for our own times, especially -- that is for recovery. And, working backwards, we arrived at Matthew, who is evidently the administrative evangelist. Then we touched on the first chapter of Acts, because it gives us a further feature of the Lord's activities before He ascended, after He rose. It tells us the number of days (namely) forty. The feature of the first chapter of Acts is that the Lord "assembled with them". @Acts 1:4. It says, first of all "having, by the Holy Spirit, charged the apostles, whom he had chosen, he was taken up: to whom, also, he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs, being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God; and, being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye have heard of me. For John, indeed, baptised with water, but ye shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days", @Acts 1:2 - 5.
{262}
So that Luke, in this further narrative regarding the Lord's activities and service during the period of His sojourn here after He rose, emphasises the fact that He employed the Spirit, It says, He charged the apostles "by the Holy Spirit", @Acts 1:2 which indicates that the book of the Acts is on the line of the activities, or services, of the Spirit, and the use, so to speak, that may be made of the Spirit during the present time. So that they were to learn, from the Lord's manner of workmanship, how the dispensation was to be maintained, and the place that the Spirit was to have in it. So, it says, "He was taken up" @Acts 1:11 from them. Then it says what the qualifications were to be, of the one who should take the place of Judas -- that he should be one who had assembled with them during all the time the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst them, from the baptism of John, until He was received up. That is to say, from the time when the Spirit descended and abode on Christ until He was received up. And he was to have been familiar with the Lord's manner of coming in and going out amongst them, and to know how to assemble. The apostle Peter stands up amongst the brethren, after the Lord had ascended, and calls attention to what the Holy Spirit says, by the mouth of David, about Judas. You will observe the emphasis laid on the "Holy Spirit". In the second chapter he stands up with the eleven, but here he stood up in the midst of the brethren, and during the ten days that elapsed between the Lord's going up, and the Spirit coming down, Peter stands up amongst the brethren, calling attention to what the Holy Spirit had said about Judas, and proceeding, after having called attention to the qualifications that were necessary for the apostle who was to take Judas place, to the necessity for the completion of the number *twelve*. I mention the number twelve because I think
{263}
It is one of the keys to the position. It says, "He was numbered with the eleven", @Acts 1:26 making twelve, which is the great administrative number in Scripture. One calls attention to that particularly, because of the place the number has in the gospels, and in Acts, and again, in @1 Corinthians 15, which gives us a list of the Lord's appearings after He rose. It says, "He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve" @1 Corinthians 15:5. The appearings there are constructive -- that is, they lead on in a constructive way, first with Cephas, and then the twelve, indicating, I think, that the Lord, in appearing to the twelve, would impress them with the idea of what was becoming to their administrative position during His absence. The apostle there also says that, "He appeared to all the apostles" @1 Corinthians 15:7. That is another thought. But before that, we have the statement that He appeared to the twelve. So that Peter, in standing up with the eleven, is obviously on an administrative platform in @Acts 2, but his great theme is to call attention to the Lord on high, and to the presence of the Holy Spirit, who had come down in consequence of that. It was an administrative action.
W.J.H. The administration was commenced by the presence of Christ on earth, and continued afterwards, in the power of the Holy Spirit, in God's people.
J.T. And the presence of the Spirit was a wonderful evidence of the nature of that administration: that is to say, it is an administration of heaven's bounty. What we are speaking about here, is not the administration of rule only, which may be punitive in its results -- the primary thought in administration here is that it is the bounty of God that is administered. It is an administration of positive blessing for man. I think the first great idea of it in Scripture is Melchisedec. God in Melchisedec, of whose history we know nothing, asserted His sovereign right to
{264}
bless administratively. That is, the blessing comes in by way of an appointed administrator. That is what one would like to get hold of -- how God meets conditions here by, so to speak, a system or an organisation. It says that "Melchisedec, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine; and he was the priest of the most high God", @Genesis 14:18.
G.A.v.S. Would you say that administration is necessarily beneficial, that it confers benefits which are being dispensed abroad by the activity of the Spirit?
J.T. That is right. I cannot conceive of God coming out administratively, except in a positively beneficial way. Merely to deal with *evil*, governmentally, would not at all convey the idea. The primary thought is positive blessing.
E.E.L. Then, would the position be that man, having demonstrated his utter incapacity by crucifying the Lord, and God having exalted that same Lord to His own right hand in glory, the Holy Spirit is shed forth abundantly on men -- that Spirit, in whose power alone, men can really live for God?
J.T. That is the thought I had. That is, God comes out at the outset with the very best. It says, "Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this", @Acts 2:33. It is wonderful how God meets man's murderous attitude in the death of Christ -- it is a wonderful thing to get hold of this. It is very elementary in a way, but nevertheless, there is nothing greater, administratively, than the thought of God's act in the gift of the Spirit.
E.E.L. It may take many years to arrive in one's own experience at the position, that it is only in the Spirit that one can live to God.
J.T. I think the first chapter of Acts is our side, it is educational. We have to learn Christ in resurrection,
{265}
and to learn how He uses the Spirit, and how He assembles. So that we may see, now that we are in the position of administration, how to serve, and how to exercise our great function. In that way the Lord's instruction comes first -- how He acted. Then we see what they did -- what the brethren did, not the apostles, although Peter is the leader. We see how the brethren acted, how they were influenced, and what their thoughts were during those ten days. The *ten days* form the test. We are, so to speak, after the education, left to ourselves. And what they did shows how they were in accord with the education. And what strikes one is that they were concerned that the (for want of a better word) administrative organisation should be complete. According to the record, the Lord says nothing at all about the vacant apostleship -- that was left to them.
T.H.G. How would you say that Melchisedec came in in regard to @Acts 2?
J.T. The Lord being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He hath shed forth this. That is, I apprehend, administration. That is what is seen in Melchisedec, and it marks the present time.
G.A.v.S. And for that reason it would be redolent of grace.
J.T. Exactly. Can anything exceed the grace that shines in this chapter? "God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ", @Acts 2:36. Then it says, He "received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit". @Acts 2:33. And in Jerusalem, mark that, it is shed forth -- in the very place where the foulest crime had been committed against God. But I would particularly emphasise the ten days, so that we might see that we are brought into this administration. We are the beneficiaries of it, of course, as well as the apostles -- that is, we also have part in it. Therefore, the question is, are we equal
{266}
to taking our part in that wonderful position -- to taking our part in the administration of the bounty of heaven? The brethren were concerned about the vacant apostleship. There is no such position today, of course, because we are not in apostolic times. But the lesson for me now is this -- the inquiry as to how things are at the present time, how much is there available that is suitable for this administration.
G.A.v.S. When you speak of the test of those ten days, as applicable to us, have you the exercise before you as to how far we are tested in regard to the concern on the part of the people of God as a whole, as to the familiarity with the course of things since the baptism of John, as expressing what came out in the descent of the Holy Spirit, until the Lord was risen up into heaven? Is there, necessarily, among the people of God now such a concern that there should be an appreciation of the whole pathway of the Lord Jesus?
J.T. Exactly. You see Melchisedec was available. We do not know anything about his personal history. We know whom He typified -- but there was one in availability to God at that time. Well now, what is there available today? That is the question that comes up in one's own mind, and which, I think, should arise in every local company, and, in a more extended way, in each of us in relation to the whole assembly on earth. What is there available today that God can use in connection with this great administration? One thinks of the formative work -- the ten days of the first chapter amplify what we are, as educated, so that we might be available -- if there is anything lacking. There was a vacant apostleship in this case. Of course, it is not that now. But what is there lacking? The thing is, to supply what is lacking. The ten days bring that out, and the exercise runs in scriptural channels. Peter stands up in the midst of the brethren, and he refers to what
{267}
David said in the Scriptures by the Holy Spirit. All that is brought in, and also, what are the qualifications required of the nominee for the apostleship? All this shuts out human contrivance, or innovation. We know how modernly people have resorted to human methods, because they say it is impossible now to have things as they were. But you have no such sentiment indicated in these ten days.
W.J.H. Those who take part in this administration have a personal appreciation of the ways of the Spirit of Christ. They have learned to amplify them from the Spirit. For ten days they continued in prayer, and waited till they were endued with power from on high, realising that they could do nothing, except in the power of the Spirit.
J.T. That is it.
E.E.L. Would the familiarity with the Lord Jesus, from the baptism of John until the day in which He was received up, remove from our minds the wrong thought as to manhood that we have drawn from our intercourse with fallen man?
J.T. That is very good. One feels, in order to have part in this, we have to study the gospels. The epistles are intended to lead us up to the gospels, and, in order to have part in this, we must follow that path from John's baptism until He was received up. I believe we must look at it in its fourfold presentation in the gospels. In John, of course, we have the Person, as we have often said. We have got to keep that in our minds to start with, and who the Person is. So that John the baptist says, "I saw and bare record that this is the Son of God". @John 1:34. It is the Son of God right through -- He is in supreme control, even on the cross, and He is not carried up in John -- He *ascends*. Luke is the Man, and hence, John's baptism begins with Him in *prayer*. You have Him in varied connections in prayer in Luke; the gospel emphasises that. One can understand how
{268}
important it is to follow that path from John's baptism until He was received up if one is to know how to pray. It is one of the greatest features of the time of this dispensation that we can pray. The Lord Himself said, "... how much rather shall the Father, who is of heaven, give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him", @Luke 11:13. It is as if to impress upon us the maximum result -- the great result of prayer. Well, then, in Mark He is the Servant. There it sets forth how things were done. Mark says, "He has done all things well". @Mark 7:37. Then, in Matthew, it is the King. So that we learn from Matthew how government and rule are carried on at the present time. And, in order to be available to God effectively in this wonderful administration, we must learn from the gospels how the Lord Jesus came in and went out from John's baptism until the time He was received up. That is the way things stand in the first chapter of Acts.
G.C.McK. In connection with administration, what is the point of mentioning in Luke that the Lord is seen so often in prayer? Is it to show that if the spirit of dependence is maintained the saints will be in a suitable condition for administration?
J.T. It is the avowal of one's own impotency. It is beautiful to see in the third chapter of Luke, when you start with the first prayer, how the Lord Jesus is the last to be baptised. There was no effort put forth to be the first. You see Him praying, and He is acceptable to heaven. The point there is to see the Lord identifying Himself with the people of God, and, in doing that, He was acceptable to heaven. If I am acceptable to heaven I shall be acceptable to the people of God. The next thing is, you may need to exercise power in this world. Is there need? The need in @Luke 5 comes in from all sides, and the Lord retires from the need into the wilderness, and He is found there in prayer. The presence of the
{269}
need does not give you the power. To have people coming to you from all parts, large congregations to hear you, is apt to elate one. Hence, the Lord retires, and He is in the wilderness praying; and then it says, "The power of the Lord was there to heal". @Luke 5:17. So you see, if you are to be helped in healing in this way it is by prayer, and it is in the wilderness. You retire, from the presence of the crowd, with the need into the wilderness. Then you find that you cannot do it all, the need is too great -- of course, I am referring to the saints. So the Lord, in chapter 6, appoints His twelve apostles, and the work is to be extended, so that the praying for the whole field would lead us so into the presence of God that one is not at all envious if others are being used. It is a great thing to make room for others, because if another brother comes forward and God is using him, all is well. It is a community idea, and one's wealth is added to on the principle of community. So the Lord appoints twelve and descends, and stands with them in the plain. Then, in chapter 9, He is praying alone, and He raises the question of His Person. He says, "Who do ye say that I am?" @Luke 9:20. That is another great feature that comes out in prayer. You learn who the Lord is. You are not carried away by the wicked teachings current today about the Person of Christ. Prayer saves you from that. Then, again, in the same chapter, He is transfigured in prayer. That is another effect, you are *changed*. The next thing is, He is praying in a certain place. Now He has come to the question of local fittings or furnishings, and one of the disciples says "Teach us to pray", @Luke 11:1 and He teaches them to pray. That means that you get all the local furnishings by asking for them. So He goes on to show that the Father, who is of heaven, gives the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him. You get the Spirit brought in, in your locality, instead of the flesh, by asking God. And so, in
{270}
@Luke 22, He is praying in Gethsemane. Wonderful spectacle! That is to say, you learn how to *suffer* by taking account of the Lord, how He prayed and how He acted in Gethsemane, and how angels came and ministered to Him. One desires to raise the question, because it fits in, that prayer is essential to our efficiency in this administration. Then the knowledge of Him, from John's baptism till He was received up, includes the first chapter of the Acts, because here we have the forty days. John gives an account of three distinct manifestations of the Lord in chapters 20 and 21. Paul mentions six distinct manifestations or appearings. But Luke, in @Acts 1, mentions forty days. And so he says, "... having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up; to whom also he presented himself living". @Acts 1:2,3. So that all this education is necessary for us before we can enter into @Acts 2.
J.B.S. In @John 20 the Lord breathed into them, and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit". @John 20:22. The charge of the Holy Spirit would shut out what is of man.
J.T. Quite. He breathed into them, so that His own Spirit should mark them.
E.E.L. There are two things spoken of. They were all filled with the Spirit, and they spoke with other tongues as the Spirit gave utterance; @Acts 2:4. Would you say that the former is normal in Christianity, whilst the latter indicates the resourcefulness available at the special time in which it is needed, when men of every tongue and nation are gathered together?
J.T. Yes. The sound from heaven filled the house. In @John 12 it speaks of the odour of the ointment with which Mary anointed the Lord's feet filling the house. This is a sound from heaven filling the house. It is an announcement from the outset that heaven asserts itself in the sound in the house. There is then to be a hush of every other sound. It is
{271}
a voice. And then it says, "And there appeared to them parted tongues as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them". Observe that -- each one of them. There is the collective idea; but, at the same time, each one of them has his own distinct individuality in this position. So that you wonder sometimes why is it people are so silent in the house, in the assembly? There are ten thousand words, which, of course, are altogether out of proportion to what is becoming to the house of God. But there are the five words; and one often wonders why it is that brethren are silent, why there cannot even be five words. The Spirit comes here in the character of "cloven tongues as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them". It is one Spirit, but "each" of them. "Unto everyone of us is given grace". Well, the Spirit sat on each of them here. That does not mean simply the apostles -- it means all that were there.
G.A.v.S. Were the one hundred and twenty a representative company?
J.T. Yes. They were the representatives of the Lord's handiwork. It says, "... the crowd of names". @Acts 1:15. The name of each of them meant what the Lord had effected. The name indicated what was there for the Lord. There were one hundred and twenty varieties of the handiwork of Christ, and the Holy Spirit takes them up. So that we have a variety of at least one hundred and twenty under the control of the Spirit. I believe that is what God is aiming at -- a variety in life and unity. If there is a difference, it is a difference in glory.
W.J.H. It is a difference of administration, but the same Lord.
J.T. Yes. It is nice to look into the countenances of the saints, however numerous. You may number them. As you look into their countenances, each one reflects something distinctive of Christ. "The crowd of names" @Acts 1:15 would mean the distinctions.
{272}
G.A.v.S. Then you would infer that we take account of one another in the value of the Spirit's work that is reached in each other?
J.T. Yes. That is how you take account of the saints. And so I apprehend that "the crowd of names" @Acts 1:15 would indicate that we take account of what each one is distinctively, because a name is a distinction.
G.A.v.S. In that sense, would we have a very wide aspect of what distinguishes them spiritually?
J.T. I think so. For instance, I know you. I may not know you very well, but when I do know you, your name in my mind will be what you are, and my name in your mind will be what I am. The name that you bear, humanly speaking, is arbitrary, but I clothe your name with what *you are*.
W.D.R. Why does it say "tongues as of fire"?
J.T. I think because of the flesh. In principle it is God's announcement, "Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation". @Exodus 17:16. I think the fire is to deal with flesh, whether in me or in others. But the result here is that they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them to speak forth. You see they are educated. It was a time for speaking now, but speaking by the Spirit; and hence, as I was remarking, why are some of us so dumb?
T.H.G. In that way would the brethren be continuing the sound which at the commencement filled the house?
J.T. I think so. You look for it in our meetings -- you look for the sound of heaven.
T.H.G. You remarked the other day that all that had breath shall praise the Lord -- would what you say be linked up with that?
J.T. Yes. In attending a meeting, what is there should be in correspondence with the house of God.
{273}
In leaving it, there should be a sense of the heavenly influence, that heaven was asserting itself.
T.H.G. I suppose that really happens in connection with the two on their way to Emmaus. The Lord had been with them, and, when He had left, a divine impression remained.
J.T. It is a great thing in our meetings to maintain touch with heaven. The house of God is the gate of heaven. That was the first impression formed of it in a man's mind. It was in Jacob's mind. I am sure it is God's intention it should be maintained, heaven asserting itself.
Ques. What is the difference between the gift of the Holy Spirit and God sending forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba, Father", @Galatians 4:6?
J.T. There it is the Spirit of adoption; God has actually given you the Spirit of His own Son. Here it is the Holy Spirit *upon us*. The *public* effect is in view here.
H.W.B. Would you say a word about the "rushing mighty wind"?
J.T. It is to call attention to the fact that the presence of the Spirit here is irresistible. There is nothing on earth to compete with it. "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world". @1 John 4:4. We are impregnable, we cannot be overcome as the people of God, as in faith we recognise the Holy Spirit.
T.H.G. Would that sound be continued in @Colossians 3:16, "... singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord"?
J.T. Just so. Now you see men from the provinces of the empire present, and they all hear. It is one thing to speak, but it is another thing to hear. It says, "We do hear them speak". They spoke so as to be heard. "We hear them speaking in our tongues, the great things of God". There was a man mentioned in Proverbs who spoke *froward* things.
{274}
The newspapers, magazines and novels are the froward things. The young are exposed to them and damaged thereby. What we have here are one hundred and twenty persons speaking, as the Spirit gave them to speak, the wonderful or great things of God, and they were heard.
E.E.L. I was wondering whether you were intending to convey that our voices should be heard administratively, that we should be found proclaimers of this wonderful gift of the Spirit, received of Christ in an orderly way, by baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the remission of sins.
J.T. What one feels for oneself is, one is so little impressed with the greatness of the position -- the great things of God. Some of us were speaking about the little maid in Naaman's house. She is impressed, she speaks with emphasis -- Oh, that my lord was in Samaria with the prophet; for he would heal him of his leprosy. She is impressed. In the better translation it is an ejaculation.
H.W.B. Would your thought be carried out in @Romans 10:18, "Have they not heard? Yes, verily, their sound went into all the earth and their words into the ends of the world"?
J.T. Their sound -- that is right. Well, now, in referring to Peter's address, the earlier part has to do with the company -- those that were in the house, and the effect of the coming in of the Spirit. Peter's address has to be regarded in the light of the twelve. It says he stood up with the eleven. Now we come to what we may call commission, testimony -- the testimony of gift. Speaking the great things of God is one thing which any Christian can do, because he is impressed like the little maid. It is quite another thing to *preach*. The preaching has a great part in the administration. A preacher can say things in a way that an ordinary Christian cannot say. According to Mark, the Lord had gone up into the mountain,
{275}
and He had called those to Himself whom He desired, so that He might send them to *preach*. So that we must have great regard for those who are fitted to preach, and we should see that the ox is not muzzled who treads out the corn, because everyone cannot preach. The fact that you can speak is no proof that you can preach. They speak here. It does not tell us it was "the twelve". I apprehend it was all of them. But when you come to preaching, then it is a question of gift.
G.A.v.S. What you mean is that no one should undertake to preach who has not gift.
J.T. No one should preach without gift. Of course, one has to discover that one has got gift. But how can one preach except he is sent? Peter stands up with the eleven here. Those were the ones that the Lord had called to Him, according to Mark, that they might be with Him -- that He might send them to preach.
G.A.v.S. Do you mean that these twelve, going out in this way, as having had that distinct impression wrought upon them of Christ, in consequence of their familiarity with His pathway, had produced in them that which spiritually made them competent for preaching?
J.T. That is right. We should look out for those who can preach, and see to it that they are allowed to preach.
W.D.R. How are we to know them?
J.T. Gift makes room for itself. It brings you before great men. You cannot deny its power. It is effective in the souls of men.
W.J.H. You would distinguish between speaking and preaching?
J.T. Any Christian can speak. The "little maid" spoke. Then, again, you get the four lepers in the second book of Kings, whose exercise was that it was a day of good tidings, and that they should
{276}
speak. They recognised the character of the time. But there is nothing in either case about being *sent*, showing that any Christian can speak about the Lord, can witness; but when it comes to preaching, then you must look for ability, divinely-given ability, and make room for that. That is special.
G.A.v.S. Is that what you had in view when you spoke of not muzzling the ox?
J.T. Yes. You must see that a preacher is not hampered, for instance, by want of means; that he is not hindered by another being put in his place who has no ability.
T.H.G. The ox who is treading the corn puts his head down and feeds at the same time.
J.T. Yes. So that here we have not only the one hundred and twenty able to speak of the wonderful things of God, but, in Peter's address, you see one of twelve divinely qualified to preach these wonderful things. He could speak of those things with more effectiveness than one of the sisters who were present, because he was a preacher. The administration was enhanced and adorned and enforced morally by the ability of the preachers. It is all on the line of administration. A preacher makes the thing so plain and powerful that it affects men. So that one is impressed even in the preacher with the bounty of God -- that God has gone to the trouble of qualifying a man, of preparing him, so that you might have the thing enforced in your soul.
H.W.B. Paul speaks of it, "... that by me the preaching might be fully known". @2 Timothy 4:17.
J.T. He does, and it would be made known, he says, by him. So that the preaching has a great place in the administration. And the more you look into it the more you see that a qualified preacher is a gift from God. Gift is not merely that he has power. He is from God. Christ gave "some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers". @Ephesians 4:11.
{277}
It is the love of God that has done it, and hence we must make the most of those gifts, because they are the provisions of divine love to enhance and enforce the administration of the bounty of heaven.
E.E.L. What about doing the work of an evangelist when one is not available?
J.T. I think that that stops one from dubbing oneself an evangelist. We used to have brethren who called themselves evangelists. We do not hear of that now; not that there are no evangelists, but that there are those who are like John, and it is a question of "the disciple whom Jesus loved". @John 21:20. If you love Jesus, you will do the work that comes to your hand. If it is the work of an evangelist, and you have got ability for it, you will do with your might what your hands find to do.
W.D.R. What about the broken condition of things we are in now? When one looks around, one does not see many that could be called preachers; but we know of some who love Jesus, and who love to tell out the gospel of the grace of God. Would such necessarily have to be qualified preachers for that?
J.T. They would come under the fourth verse (@Acts 2), where there is ample room for everybody, brother and sister, to speak. Verse 14 is restricted to preachers.
G.A.v.S. By preachers, do you cover more than the proclamation of the glad tidings?
J.T. All ministry is on the line of preaching.
J.H. In @Acts 8 it speaks of the persecution of the church that arose at Jerusalem, and it says that those who were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching Christ.
J.T. That is right. There Philip is the model. It goes on to say that Philip went down to Samaria. He was a preacher. He was the only one in Scripture
{278}
formally called an evangelist. There you see the gift developed.
Ques. From whom did he receive the gift?
J.T. From God. It says, He received them as man for men and for the rebellious also, that God might dwell among them.
H.W.B. That is another reason for saying that by the foolishness of preaching He might save those who believe.
J.T. It was not in words of man's wisdom, it was in the demonstration of the Spirit and in power. It was not a question of human eloquence. The Greek scholar, I suppose, would ridicule Paul's manner and speech. To him it was foolishness. But the foolishness of the preaching saved those who believed.
Ques. Would the characteristic of the preacher be he would stand up in the good and gain of the complete thought of the twelve?
J.T. That is right, and he knows how to use the Scripture. Peter proceeds to quote Joel. He is speaking to a Jewish audience who would listen to the prophet, Joel. Peter knew that. Paul did not quote Joel on Mars hill -- he quoted their own poets. So that the preacher knows what to do. Peter quotes Joel, and it fitted the position exactly. Then he refers to David. He calls attention to the fact that David had not ascended into the heavens. The more you look into his address here the more you see its masterfulness, and, therefore, it is a model for us if we are to preach, and one knows what scriptures to quote, and is acquainted with the armoury of Scripture, and the material there is for ministry. If one refers to any in the Old Testament one refers to him intelligently. Peter points out that David was a patriarch and a prophet. He does not say David was a king. He points out that David did not ascend into the heavens, although he quotes David as showing that the Lord should not see corruption.
{279}
Then he goes on to show that everything depends on Christ; thus he makes everything bear on the present position. He uses the Old Testament scriptures and preaches Christ. Some people object to go into the Old Testament, but here is the model. He brings in the Old Testament, but he brings it in to preach Christ, for the Old Testament testifies of Christ. So that he brings everything to bear on the present position, and Christ at the right hand of God, to show that whatever there was available of the bounty of heaven, it was all the result of the position of Christ at the right hand of God.
{280}
THE DYING OF JESUS
@Acts 9:16; @Acts 16:16 - 34
I had in mind to speak tonight about *suffering*, taking up my thought from the types referred to in the book of Exodus, in which we are told that as the tabernacle was reared up it was to be anointed, in all its details, with the holy oil. The prominent component part of this oil is stated to be myrrh -- the first ingredient, indeed -- which, throughout Scripture, represents suffering love. The way of that suffering love, of which the type speaks, has to be learnt through Christ. He leads the way in sufferings, as in all else, for us. So, as this book of the Acts records the anti-typical setting up of the tabernacle, it abounds with references to sufferings. Indeed, in recording the activities of our Lord Jesus during the forty days of His sojourn on earth after He rose, it says that He appeared unto His disciples *after He suffered*. The Spirit of God begins the great theme of the book by introducing this feature, viz., that in charging His apostles by the Spirit, and in His other ministry during the forty days, it was *after* He had *suffered*. That is to say, they were familiarised with Christ as risen during those forty days as the One who had suffered.
Peter, the leading apostle in the opening chapters, tells us that he was the witness of the sufferings of Christ. He very modestly and wisely refrains from saying that he was a partaker of those sufferings, for the obvious reason that, at the very height of them, he was out of communion with the Lord. Although he had undertaken to follow Him into those sufferings, he had, as we all know, failed, and, instead of sharing in those sufferings at their very height, he had denied his Lord. And so the Lord speaks to him during the
{281}
forty days to which I have referred, and He says, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest". @John 21:18. That is a word that comes very closely to the young ones here, as it does, indeed, to every one of us. In our youthful days, the tendency is to gird ourselves and to go where we wish; but, under the discipline of the Lord and the wisdom which comes of advancing years under the government of God, we learn to submit ourselves. So the Lord says to Peter, "When thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not", @John 21:18. We may be assured, dear brethren, that that "other" will not be wanting as we are true followers and witnesses of Christ -- that "other", namely, the agent of the enemy, will not be wanting as we prove true to Christ. Peter, therefore, was to be honoured, according to his wish, as he grew old. To "another" he resigned -- he stretched forth his hands; instead of cowering in the presence of opposition and persecution, he stretched forth his hands and another girded him and carried him to his martyrdom. It was the intent of the Lord that all those who should be partakers in the tabernacle should have also a part in the oil. Hence, at the very outset of this book, you have the Lord Jesus presented as the One who suffered. Indeed, He it is who affords, thus, the anointing oil of the tabernacle.
And so I would refer for a moment, dear brethren, to the synoptic gospels, to call attention to the Lord as He is about to face the suffering into which His love was bringing Him. Let us look at Matthew and Mark. We find Him, in the one instance, *on His face*. Think of the Lord of glory -- He from whose face now radiates the glory of God -- think of Him, I say, *on His face*! It was in the presence of suffering. And, again, in Mark, He falls to the ground. The sufferings
{282}
that were before Him were infinitely real. He was facing them, according to His divine knowledge of their extent and bearing; He was amazed and distressed, we are told. How real was the humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and how blessedly He affords to us the ingredients of this wonderful compound by which the tabernacle -- or by which the saints -- are to be and were anointed!
But, when we come to Luke, we find that He *knelt down*. He is seen in Luke's gospel, as many of us know, in the attitude of prayer in many connections; but in the last and final instance, we find Him at Olivet -- we find the Lord of glory, whose right it was to command, and who did command -- we find Him, of whom it is written, "Without him was not anything made that was made" @John 1:3 -- in the presence of those awful sufferings into which His love was leading Him, deliberately kneeling down before God and praying. Luke, being ever concerned about what is comely as before God and before men, presents to us a model in the Lord as He faced those sufferings, telling us that He knelt down. The heart is drawn to Him as one observes, in His blessed posture before God, what is comely at that moment. Then, again, we are told by Luke, "Being in conflict, he prayed more intently". @Luke 22:44.
I mention all these things, beloved, because they indicate the holy ingredients of this compound by which the tabernacle was anointed; that is to say, we gather up from these facts the spirit of a suffering Christ. I commend to you the *suffering* Christ. We are too prone to forget that the things which we enjoy, the wonderful things that are being administered to us by an exalted Christ, are entirely due to a suffering Christ. Therefore, in Luke, we get that Christ, "being in conflict, he prayed more intently". @Luke 22:44.
But there was entire submission to the will of God.
{283}
That is the secret of coming into the sufferings of Christ. We may evade them, as Peter did. The secret of coming under the sufferings of Christ lies in unqualified submission to the will of God. The will of God in this world involves a path of suffering, and suffering experienced in the path of the will of God lends lustre and character to our testimony, marking it off as of a piece with the testimony of Him who, before Pontius Pilate, "witnessed a good confession". @1 Timothy 6:13. Timothy is enjoined to take his share in it, and I would say to everyone here, old and young, that *your share* is there, whether you take it or not. It is your privilege to take it. There is a share for every one of us of that holy compound; composed of the ingredients that appear in the path of Jesus suffering. So Timothy is enjoined to take his share. In these days of commercial prosperity -- when there is no opposition outwardly; when, under the government of God, we can meet, as we are met here tonight, no man forbidding us, when we can pursue our way without fear of molestation from the authorities or the powers that be -- we are in great danger of overlooking the fact that there is a share of suffering for every one of us, and we are enjoined to take it. To miss it is an irrevocable loss -- it can never be made up. Every part of the tabernacle was to be anointed with it, particularly the brazen altar. You may remember that Moses, in @Leviticus 8, was enjoined to anoint the tabernacle, and that he sprinkled the oil on the brazen altar seven times.
Now, I wish to show that Luke, in his gospel, as well as introducing to us a suffering Christ, also in this book of the Acts opens with the same thought -- that the One who was appearing during forty days amongst His people was the One who had suffered. And so, as He sits at the right hand of God, it is as the One who has suffered. Let us never forget that the hands that have poured forth the Spirit are the
{284}
same hands which were pierced with the nails at the Cross. It was after He suffered. Thank God for that!
I would like to dwell on the passages read, because they present to us the great vessel of the sufferings of Christ. Paul tells us later that he filled up that which was behind of the tribulations of Christ in his flesh, for His body's sake. It is not that there were any left; it is not that the Lord Jesus left any tribulations that He did not go through, for in all the afflictions of His people He was afflicted. The apostle Paul is speaking, as I apprehend, of the holy anointing oil; he is contemplating the body of Christ, that it should be characterised by those same sufferings, and if some members were behind he would make up the lack. Wonderful man! He would not have the body of Christ come short in any sense -- he was the minister of it. The Lord tells Ananias about him. He says, "I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake". @Acts 9:16. It was one of the first features of this great vessel that he should be a sufferer. He is our apostle, and he has carried the light of the gospel to us Gentiles -- he has brought near to us thus the holy compound of which I have spoken. A man of like passions as ourselves exhibits before our eyes the manner of that holy oil as it shone in Christ. "I fill up", he says, "that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the assembly". @Colossians 1:24 you see, he is pretty close to our eyes. "Before your very eyes", he says to the Galatians, "Jesus Christ has been portrayed, crucified among you". @Galatians 3:1. How vividly He was brought to them! The Lord had this design in taking up this great vessel; He foresaw that there would be a falling short of that which would suggest the ointment. And we may well inquire, beloved brethren, as to what share of it we are taking, whether we are honoured externally by
{285}
the marks of the sufferings of Christ. "For the rest" says Paul, "let no one trouble me; for I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus". @Galatians 6:17. I do not know what his physical appearance may have been, but I am perfectly certain that were you and I to examine the body of that dear man, we would find throughout it the marks of those sufferings. "Of the Jews", he says, "five times received I forty stripes save one". @2 Corinthians 11:24. Think of the lacerations of a human body after all those stripes! Again he says, "In prisons more frequent, in deaths oft". @2 Corinthians 11:23. And yet again he says, "Once was I stoned". @2 Corinthians 11:25. One would refer to these things with the greatest diffidence, as knowing them but little, but there they are, beloved, brought close to us in a man of like passions with ourselves. The Lord takes him up, foreknowing what he was capable of, so that He might set out in such a man this wonderful oil of suffering, and that He might set out in him His own tribulations, in order to show how they can be borne, and yet how a man in bearing them might maintain the spirit of heavenly administration.
Now I want to work that out a little in chapter 16, to show you the wonderful combination in that chapter of the brazen altar, the altar of incense, and the table of shewbread. All these features of the tabernacle were to be anointed with the oil, but particularly the altar of burnt offering, the brazen altar. Now the Lord, as I said, announces to Ananias that this great vessel had been chosen deliberately, one of the purposes and objects being that the Lord might show him what he should suffer for His name. So I selected the passage in chapter 16, because it links up vividly the prayerful attitude of the apostle in those sufferings with the altar of incense, which was also anointed, and, finally, with the table of shewbread.
You will recall that, in speaking to Ananias, the
{286}
Lord said, speaking of Paul, "Behold, he prayeth". @Acts 9:11. And I would urge, beloved brethren, the great importance of prayer in view of suffering. There is no possibility of our going through as Paul did, aside from prayer; and so in this chapter we are told, "as we went to prayer". It is one of the most interesting chapters in the book of the Acts, particularly to us Gentiles of Western Europe, because it is the chapter that records the entrance of the gospel into that continent. The apostle, in arriving at Philippi, allied himself with some women who were wont to meet in a certain place for prayer. In other words, the gospel was to be inaugurated in Europe through prayer. This, the enemy quickly discerned, and so it says in this chapter, verse 16, "as we went to prayer". I do not suppose there is anything that arouses the antagonism of the adversary more than that attitude of prayer. Prayer is the admission, on the one hand, of our utter impotency in the testimony as left to ourselves; and, on the other hand, it is the recognition of the power of God as available through Christ for the testimony. So it says, "As we were going to prayer, a certain female slave, having a spirit of python, met us", @Acts 16:16. The enemy is determined to challenge every inch of the way of those men as they go to prayer. Instead of meeting for prayer with those devoted women, in the place where prayer was wont to be made, they united, *in the prison* of Philippi, in that holy, priestly service. It is interesting to note how the Spirit of God stresses the peculiar character of the sufferings in this instance -- the stripes, the inner prison, and the feet fast in the stocks. The Spirit of God, through Luke, draws a picture for us of the intensity of the sufferings of those two devoted servants of Christ. The Lord is now showing Paul what he must suffer for His name, and Paul, through grace, is equal to it -- he is, as it were, anointed with the oil, for he expresses, in a
{287}
most beautiful manner, the spirit of his Master in His sufferings. He, himself, indeed, had had the opportunity, earlier, of witnessing the spirit of that Master in another, namely, Stephen. He says to the Lord in Jerusalem, as he was praying in the temple in an ecstasy -- after the Lord had told him to depart from Jerusalem, as they would not receive his testimony -- he says, "They know that I imprisoned ... . and when the blood of thy martyr, Stephen, was shed, I also was standing by". @Acts 22:20. One of the most wonderful spectacles that ever was witnessed, was witnessed by Saul of Tarsus, and he says it was "martyrdom". Martyrdom is witness -- it is a witness for Christ. That means suffering. If our testimony, beloved, does not bring us into suffering, it is wanting -- it is not in consonance with the tabernacle. And so Saul says to the Lord, "I ... kept the raiment of them that slew him". @Acts 22:20. And, oh! what a spirit he saw in that martyr as the stones fell upon him, and he knelt down, like his Master! Luke delights in recording these comely actions. You see the perfect suitability of Stephen's request, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge". @Acts 7:60. His Master had said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do". @Luke 23:24. The Lord Jesus did not limit forgiveness in His request, but Stephen did. Stephen could not ask for forgiveness generally; he could ask, and did ask, for the forgiveness of the sin against himself, which was right -- he remitted, as far as his attitude was concerned, the sin of his murderers, and he asked the Lord to do the same. He was a priest unto God in that. "Lord", he says, "lay not this sin to their charge". @Acts 7:60. That is *one* sin. And so he delivered up his spirit, saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit". @Acts 7:59. One lingers over that spectacle of the first martyr for Jesus; one loves to see how the holy oil, the anointing, shone out there! How the glory shone! The Spirit of the suffering Christ shone resplendently in that hour.
{288}
And Saul was a Witness -- he saw it, and now his turn has come. It had, indeed, come already, but it has come now in peculiar force as he is in the inner prison, and you see how he prayed With Silas. Instead of joining with the dear women by the river side, he is in company with his brother, Silas, in the prison, and he prays. We are not told what he asked for. Can we hide from ourselves that he prayed for the gaoler? You see horns on the brazen altar, symbols of moral power, and that moral power shone in all its perfectness in Gethsemane. It shone before the high priests, and before Pilate. It shone on the cross. It is wholesome, beloved, to have our minds directed to a suffering Christ. The heart lingers on that scene, because every word and look and action are perfect -- all is divinely perfect. The horns of the altar, so to speak, are seen in moral power. He rises above all persecution. And, in the height of His sufferings, He prays for His murderers: the glory shone in the darkness. And by His side He has a trophy, as if God were to recompense Him as He stood the test so perfectly. So infinitely perfect was He there, that God gave Him, in the thief, a recompense -- a companion, and in His blessed exit into paradise He had a companion. And so, in Paul, and in Silas, too, we see the reflex of the sufferings of Jesus, in so far as it can be seen in men of like passions as ourselves. We see the horns, as it were, of the altar, the moral power that appeared in those holy men.
But there was not only the brazen altar, there was the altar of incense. That also is anointed, and it had horns. Both altars were for God -- they refer to God. The holy incense arose in that prison at midnight into heaven, as those holy priests prayed and sang praises to God. Wonderful reflex of the scene at Calvary! "Father, forgive them", @Luke 23:24 was the incense that arose from the golden altar at Calvary.
{289}
And in the prison at Philippi you have the prayers and the praises ascending. The gaol, dark and dismal as it doubtless was, becomes a temple to God! Such is the power, beloved, of the Spirit of God, as having free course in a believer, such is the corresponding effect of sufferings, that the holy incense ascends from the golden altar before God. No doubt, in principle, we all benefit from the prayers of those holy men on that night. Europe lay to the west -- what light has shone there, yea, what suffering! What sufferings have marked that continent -- what sufferings for Christ! The Book of Martyrs recounts those holy men and those sufferings. Brethren, are we to be behind them? It is not the divine way that the dispensation should end up differently from its beginning; and so it is for us to take our share in suffering.
As the earthquake occurs, and the prison doors are opened, we have, as I may say, the table of shewbread. These things are all linked together, all anointed with the holy oil, for now, when the gaoler is suing for peace and mercy, the apostle is ready to minister to him. The features of the brazen altar have shone there, and those of the golden altar now both lead up to the features of the table of shewbread; that is to say, the apostle is now in a position to administer the bounty of God. Such, beloved, is the way in which the Spirit of God links up those features in this great vessel of suffering. So he says to the gaoler, "Do thyself no harm, for we are all here". @Acts 16:28. What a voice that must have been to the gaoler! Really, it was a voice from heaven. You say, "No, it was from the prison". It *was* from the prison, but it was a voice from heaven. It sounded out in clear and distinct accents the attitude of heaven towards that poor penitent. The gaoler says, "What must I do to be saved?" @Acts 16:30 Again, heaven announces itself in this wonderful vessel. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy house". @Acts 16:31.
{290}
Salvation is being administered, the suffering vessel is equal to its administration. He rises to it. "Believe", he says, "on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy house". @Acts 16:31.
How full is the answer! How comprehensive! For God would not only have that gaoler, but also his house -- not only should the gaoler have salvation, but his house should have it, too. Such is the liberality of heaven.
The apostle is equal to it; he is now an administrator. I refer to the table of shewbread, because it represents administration. It had a crown, you remember, round about it, meaning, I suppose, that it was dignified. How dignified these men were. The gaoler observed their dignity. He says, "Sirs". Can you imagine him, as he thrust them into that inner prison, saying, "Sirs"? Never. They were scoundrels when he put them in there, in his mind. Now, they are gentlemen! I use that word to make it simple. He discerns, as I understand, the *crown* that was round about the table of administration, for God would have His bounty administered here in suitable dignity. And these holy men, as they prayed and sang praises to God in the prison, were now morally equal to represent such holy administrations. The crown was there -- moral dignity shone in those men. And so the gaoler says, "Sirs". There were no more noble men in Philippi that night than those two persons. The Emperor, himself, were he there, would not be as noble in the eyes of the repentant Philippian gaoler as were these holy men. Think of the dignity that God has put upon us as identified with His administration. We are outside of the world and all its dignities -- we are in the light of our heavenly calling -- we are in the enjoyment of the bounty of heaven itself. The dignity of what we have got is worth something to us. It cost Jesus everything --
{291}
it cost God the life of Christ -- it cost God His beloved Son. The Holy Spirit is here to minister to us all these wonderful things. I think the gaoler recognised, however dimly, the border or the crown of the holy table of administration when he said, "Sirs". It had come right down to him -- it was there, and he was realising it with penitence. You will recall that the table of shewbread was a cubit and a half high. The altar of incense was two cubits high. It was Godward. A cubit and a half, as I apprehend it, brings it within man's range. A half is always, I apprehend, in the measurements, a hiding of glory. It shone throughout the Lord's pathway on earth. It is seen three times in the ark of the covenant. There was concealed in that lowly Man of Nazareth the glory of the Godhead -- nothing less. All the fulness, we are told, dwelt there. Nevertheless, He sat on the well of Sychar, a weary Man. And so, beloved, if we are to be of service to men in administration, we must learn that in our dignity we are to be within their reach. We are not clothed in "cloth", we are not clothed in official dignity, we are not above the people -- we are by them, we are available to them. These holy men in the prison were available to the gaoler, and they announce to him that he should be saved, and his house. They spoke unto him "the word of the Lord". @Acts 16:32. They brought to him, by the Spirit, the mind of God for him. What an opening up for that man that night from these blessed men, as they spoke unto him "the word of the Lord"! @Acts 16:32. It is interesting to see how the gaoler is learning to administer what he had. It says, "He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes". And it says, "And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them". @Acts 16:33,34.
He was the administrator in his house, and he is now acting like those holy men in expending all upon them. Well, I
{292}
have no more to add, dear brethren. I am dealing tonight with a holy subject, a subject which one would recoil from, because one feels one knows so little of the sufferings of Christ. But there they are -- they are not only in the gospels, they are in the book of the Acts in men of like passions as ourselves, and they are in the epistles, and we are enjoined to take our share in them. May God bless the word to us!
{293}
ADMINISTRATION (2)
@Acts 3:1 - 11; @Acts 4:23 - 37
J.T. The object in reading these scriptures is to continue the subject of administration that came before us on Wednesday evening last. We were dwelling, at the close of that meeting, on the subject of gift, specific gift, which is represented in the twelve. "Peter standing up with the eleven", @Acts 2:14 it says. It was thought that the twelve represented the gifts which the Lord, as having ascended on high, received and gave. They were given from heaven. It says, "He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers", @Ephesians 4:11. So that Peter, standing up with the eleven, recognises that ministry is dependent on gift, whereas all the saints may *speak*. It says that, as the Spirit gave them to speak forth, they spoke the wonderful things of God. It does not say that those who heard were convicted by their speaking, but it does say that, when they heard Peter's address, they were convicted -- "they were pricked in their heart". @Acts 2:37. So that the twelve represent, on the one hand, administration on earth, corresponding with Christ's place on high, and on the other hand, ability, the gifts which are given for preaching. This special ability which God has given to men to call attention to His bounty is a further evidence of His grace, for He would, through the gifts, enhance that which is administered, and make it more acceptable to men. It says in @Psalm 68:18, that the gifts are, "For the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them". Hence, towards the end of chapter 2, it is said of those that believed that "they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship". @Acts 2:42. They not only came into the divine bounty, but they
{294}
recognised *divine authority;* that is to say, the vessels of administration are also the vessels of authority. The bounty of heaven is administered, that is, blessing; but then the same ones represent the authority of heaven, because we cannot enjoy the bounty of heaven except as we are subject. As Peter says later on, He gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him. And those who believed Peter's testimony showed that they were subject, in that they continued steadfastly in the *apostles* teaching or doctrine. It is not so much what the doctrine was in detail, as it was *their* doctrine -- not Moses law, but the apostles doctrine. Believers are now subject to Christ, in that they continue steadfastly "in the apostles doctrine and fellowship". Mark you, the apostles doctrine. It goes on, "and in breaking of bread and in prayers". @Acts 2:42. So that the second chapter stands by itself. An order of things is set up in which the bounty of heaven is enjoyed, heaven being submitted to, and then the Lord adds to them. There is that on earth to which the Lord can add, so that we have great principles set out in this chapter. It stands by itself as setting up a system of things which is in accord with heaven, and to which the Lord can add. He will not add to anything that is not in keeping with this chapter.
E.E.L. Would these early chapters give us the powers of the world to come?
J.T. I think that is right, but there is as well, one may say, a perfect organisation. You see things are set up definitely for the dispensation in this chapter. It is so in accord with heaven that *the Lord can add*. We have "added" mentioned twice here -- first, there were three thousand, meaning that that number was linked up with the one hundred and twenty; but in the end of the chapter the Lord added certain ones; that is, such ones as were being saved, or were to be saved. That is, it is the side of sovereignty. There
{295}
is now an order of things set up which is in accord with heaven, and to which can be added those that were to be saved -- a spared remnant; and that is what He can recognise on earth now -- what is indicated in the second chapter.
C.A. So that the thought of bounty is not so much connected with the world to come as with the present moment.
J.T. The Spirit of God is emphasising the elements of this wonderful system. It is the assembly. It is that to which the Lord *adds*.
S.E.E. You spoke of distinctions. You referred to @1 Corinthians 15, the Lord's appearing to Cephas and to the twelve, and to the apostles. Is your thought that the spiritual import of the twelve abides?
J.T. I think both abide. You see, He appeared to the twelve after He appeared to Cephas. I apprehend, in appearing to the twelve, He intended to convey to them His own feelings. He had taught them how to administer, when amongst them on earth in the days of His flesh; but, as risen, He appears to them -- He would convey to them His own feelings as to administration, because the twelve means, I think, the administrative company, or number. But then it goes on to say that He appeared to five hundred brethren at once, as if the twelve were to be reinforced by the *brethren*. I do not think the idea of administration is connected with the brethren, although those that administer are brethren; but they are, as it were, supported by the brethren. And that is what is in view in the fourth chapter, because there we have the *company to which Peter and John went*. But He appeared to the twelve, and then to the five hundred brethren, and then to James, and then to all the apostles. Notice the difference -- "all" the apostles. I apprehend that embraces every item of delegated authority, which was to be recognised. His appearing to them, I apprehend, would be to
{296}
impress them with His own authority, and how it ought to be enforced.
E.E.L. Would the recital of all those different appearings indicate that God was not going to leave the question of His beloved Son to what was merely adequate testimony of two or three, but that He gave a superabundant testimony to the resurrection?
J.T. I am sure that is so. Paul cites the different appearings to enforce the truth of the resurrection. But then, if you look into them as they stand, I think you will be *impressed* with a certain constructive feature in them. The first is Cephas. In the gospel of Luke the Lord appeared to *Simon*. Simon is the responsible man. But Paul says, "He appeared to *Cephas*", @1 Corinthians 15:5 which is a spiritual designation, and has reference to what the Lord intended Peter to be in the economy He was setting up. Then the twelve follow on immediately, as bringing in the administrative idea. It is constructive. Then, if you have administration, the thing is to have the brethren with you in it; as Paul said, in writing to the Galatians, "and all the brethren which are with me", @Galatians 1:2. If the Lord is leading on these lines, you may have one brother, like Cephas, with the mind of the Lord. Then you have the twelve, an administrative company, but you need more than that -- you need "all the brethren". The Lord, I think, in His appearings, intended that all should move together as stamped with impressions from Himself, so that there is perfect unity in the movement. Then, I think, James would be a representation of *what one man can do*. His epistle, if it be the same James, and I doubt not it is, emphasises what individuals may do -- what a man like Elijah, for instance, may do by prayer, or a man who converts a sinner from the error of his way. There you have an individual with an impression from Christ. How valuable he is! He is by himself. It says, "He appeared to all the apostles", @1 Corinthians 15:7.
{297}
meaning that in all those that preceded there must be the insistence of divine authority, the women and all: so that, "all the apostles" are there, impressed with the appearing, as *apostles*. The apostle says, "And last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to me also", @1 Corinthians 15:8. It seems to me that Paul, from the reference the Lord makes in speaking to him and of him, would indicate that he was to be a personal representative of Christ here, which, to my mind, is one of the most interesting things to notice -- one so entirely with Christ as to represent His feelings and sympathies here in regard to the assembly. So that, it seems to me, the appearings, in their order in @1 Corinthians 15, are constructive; that is to say, they represent a constructive development in the divine economy.
W.J.H. Would you say that these various appearings, in effect, secured the building together of that which would grow unto a holy temple in the Lord; @Ephesians 2:22? The building was "fitly framed" by these various appearings.
J.T. That is good. You recognise the importance of all those features as constructive.
W.J.H. Cephas would fit into the structure more effectively after he had been the subject of this appearing.
J.T. He would, indeed.
E.E. What would you say the Lord would convey by each of His appearings to one's mind?
J.T. What would it convey to you, supposing the Lord appeared to you personally? Would it not affect you all the rest of your life?
E.E. Indeed, it would!
J.T. That is the thing. It would stamp you for the whole of your life, in all your ministry.
Ques. Are these different appearings to be experienced today?
J.T. Yes, in a spiritual way. The appearings
{298}
during the forty days are intended to represent the Lord's personal service during the whole period of the dispensation, not in a literal way, of course, as in these instances, but in a spiritual way. He is not here now, corporally, as He was then; but He, nevertheless, can manifest Himself according to @John 14.
A.H. It says that the greater part remain until this present -- would that be continuous?
J.T. Yes, think of how these five hundred brethren would talk about it, and the impression they would convey to any of the others who were not there.
W.J.H. Would you say that the appearing of Cephas had an effect on him ever afterwards, in regard to his part in the administration, in its shepherd character? He says, "For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls", @1 Peter 2:25.
J.T. That is good. Peter writes to the elders and says, "I am their fellow elder", @1 Peter 5:1. There is not the slightest germ of popery in his remark. He was a *fellow* elder amongst the others -- he was not above them. And so he goes on to say, "And a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed". @1 Peter 5:1.
W.D.R. Does that mean he was literally a witness of the sufferings of Christ?
J.T. Yes. In chapter 2 you have a perfect organisation, or economy, established, which runs on with what follows. The others take up other lines. The next chapter takes up another line, but this one stands. When it says that the Lord added to the assembly that indicated what went on over an indefinite period at Jerusalem. Those elements being there, *He could add*. Now the Spirit takes us to Peter and John. That is, the Spirit occupies us now with two of the number, meaning that, although there were twelve, there were two distinguished ones,
{299}
which is always in keeping with the divine ways. Variety is a great feature in the divine ways, so that, whilst there were twelve, there are two distinguished ones. They are distinguished by heaven, and they represent what one may call the best of what there was, because there are degrees of comparison in divine things. In fact, in the millennium there will be decline, alas! It begins at the top with thirteen bullocks, and comes down to seven. We have to expect that. So that the Spirit of God, it seems to me, in the third chapter, occupies us with the *very best* that there was in Peter and John.
W.J.H. You see that idea in creation, one star differing from another in glory, and so on; @1 Corinthians 15: 41. It is a divine idea.
J.T. Yes. It is well we should be notified of this, because it dissipates all socialistic feeling and sentiment amongst the people of God. Whilst there are twelve equally called apostles, yet there are two distinct ones, and that gives character to chapters 3 and 4. The result of their work stands. The man who gets blessing does not go away from them, he stands by them. What is emphasised is the perfection of the work of these great servants.
E.E.L. Would the hour of prayer represent the expression of human need in view of divine power?
J.T. Yes. It is fitting, in the presentation in this chapter, that they should be going up at *that* hour. It is the *ninth* hour -- possibly it refers to the hour in which the Lord died. It was an hour that Peter and John would take note of. It is quite in keeping that attention should be called to the best.
G.A.v.S. Would the calling of our attention to the best serve to stimulate our hearts, so that we should never be content with anything less than that; that is to say, that there should be the continual exercise that the best should be found amongst the people of God?
{300}
J.T. One looks around and sees how God is working; one sees the young men in our meetings, and the great possibilities before them, and there is encouragement. But how do we compare with these two men? I say that to myself, and one feels the littleness there is, the spiritual poverty, amongst the people of God at the present time. The Spirit of God calls attention to these two men, Peter and John, going up to the temple at the hour of prayer. How do we compare with these two men?
G.A.v.S. Would you say that the best must necessarily be productive of results, such as we get here in this man taking *his* place by their side?
J.T. Yes, the fruit of their work stands by them. This man goes right through with them, and he stands by them in their sorrows and persecutions.
Ques. Would you say we gain by having John in his gospel, and Peter in his epistle?
J.T. I am sure of it.
H.W.B. Would you gather anything from them going up together?
J.T. It was a beautiful spectacle, spiritually, when one remembers what these two men were. According to John's record the Lord looked at Peter, and said, "Thou ... shalt be called Cephas", @John 1:42. The Lord looked at Peter. He saw divinely the potentiality of that man. Matthew records that after Peter's confession of the Lord, the Lord said to him, "Thou art Peter". That is to say, he was Peter as *material*, and he was Peter by *appearance*. Think of what Peter was here -- he was in the full height of his power. He says, "Look on us", @Acts 3:4. Then there is that beautiful disciple who styles himself, "The disciple whom Jesus loved". Why did Jesus love him specially? Because he was lovable. So that you have a man in John competent to stand by Peter -- you have stability, material, the stone, whilst in John you have beauty and lovableness
{301}
-- a family man, a man with family affections. You have both of these men, at that moment, at the very height of their power.
Rem. Answering to the costly stones, and the precious stones of the temple.
J.T. Just so. They appear in the foundations of the city, "the twelve apostles of the Lamb". @Revelation 21:14.
E.E. Is there any kindred thought in the fact that the Lord chose these two disciples to prepare the passover?
J.T. Yes. One is administrative, and the other representative of the family. They represent the features which must always accompany the celebration of the Lord's supper.
W.D.R. You said John was a lovable man. Would that be in any degree natural, or because of his knowledge of God, and God's ways, and being acceptable to the Lord Jesus Christ?
J.T. Entirely the latter. It was because of what he was spiritually.
C.A. Would you say that the position is characterised by bounty, when Peter said, "... such as I have give I thee"?
J.T. They were in all the good of the bounty of heaven. They were competent to administer it.
C.A. Those two thoughts are inseparable.
J.T. Yes. You see how that man stands by Peter and John. There are many today who are serving in the gospel, who are like the ostrich. I was noticing it in Job. The Lord says to Job, "The ostrich ... leaveth her eggs in the earth and warmeth them in dust, and forgetteth that the foot may crush them", @@Job 39:13,14. That is to say, there is no paternal instinct there to follow up, or care for the offspring. Now the work of these two men stood by them -- the man *held* Peter and John.
{302}
G.A.v.S. Do you mean by that, that he was attracted to that which was manifested in those two distinct lines you speak of?
J.T. Exactly. He was attracted to them -- he stood by them right through in their sufferings. So that we have now added to these two wonderful servants the product of their work, and what comes out is that the man *corresponds with them*. Not only does he hold on, but he walks and leaps, and praises God. That is what they began with, and when the Lord ascended up into heaven according to Luke, the disciples went back to Jerusalem, and went into the temple, and were daily praising and blessing God. That is, I think the principle comes out here that a believer, one who receives light, is intended to correspond with the vessel through whom the light comes. So that, if we work back to Christ, the result of the preaching is correspondence to Christ. This man corresponded to them, and he was in the temple with them praising God -- a further witness of the bounty of heaven. What super-abounding grace of God that He should have such a witness as that in the temple!
E.E.L. Did this man, as he sat at the beautiful gate of the temple, constitute a challenge as to the capacity of the divine administration to meet his need?
J.T. I am sure that is right.
E.E.L. And did what was done indicate not merely capacity to meet the man's need, but that there was the superabundance we were speaking of earlier, because he does not only get alms, but the reason for his need is met as well? He is not only made able to walk, which he was not able to do before, but he is made able to leap and praise God.
J.T. Quite. Well, now, to proceed, what one wishes to call attention to is, what is said of these three -- Peter and John and this man? It says,
{303}
"And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them". One would call attention to the company as a new feature in the development.
W.J.H. I suppose it would indicate the tabernacle, which we were speaking of yesterday, was complete in that way. The whole of the divine idea was there.
J.T. Quite. And what comes out in the company is what you might call consolidation. That is a word that has become current in recent years. The position is taken and consolidated. It is a military term. You will always find where there is divine movement the results are intended to be incorporated in what already existed. There is, therefore, an accession of light and grace and power, all going to add to what existed: and then there follows formation or consolidation. In these circumstances, as Peter and John related what had happened, a sense of need is created. You see how perfect the conditions were. There was a sense of need, so they pray. It says, "And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together: and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness".
C.A. So that in the same way the company could confirm all that Peter had related to them in connection with Cornelius?
J.T. Just so. So that, however much attention may be called to any ministering brother, however much excess in ministry there might be, or however much suffering, all is intended to merge in the company. The company conveys the idea of mutuality. I merge in the company. We hear nothing of Peter and John working specially together after all this happens -- they merge in the company. It is a very salutary experience that, however prominent one may be in service, he merges in the company.
G.A.v.S. I suppose merging in the company
{304}
would lead on to the position of consolidation, to which you referred. If there were not the merging in the company, however useful a brother might be, there will be brought in some interest other than that which is proper to the company.
J.T. Merging into the company saves us from officialism or clericalism. The greatest apostles become merged into the company. Their report is given, and that leads to prayer on the part of all, and they are *all* filled with the Spirit. That is a point of great importance for those who are active in the Lord's service, that anything that accrues, any profit, belongs, and is added to, the company. It is not for me only. In this way the whole company becomes greatly enriched.
W.J.H. The apostle Paul was heartily in sympathy with it when he said, "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake", @2 Corinthians 4:5.
J.T. Quite, and so he says, "For all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas", @1 Corinthians 3:21,22.
G.A.v.S. I suppose it comes out in chapter 4:32, they "were of one heart and one soul"; and also, "neither said anyone of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own".
J.T. Quite. Well, now, things are moving on according to the original design of heaven. These men were the very best, and they are merged into the company. Then you find that the apostles come out again, because, you see, we cannot afford to lose any one of them. If one brother seems to be obscure, and not used, this merging principle of the activity of the Spirit brings out heaven's original design; "and with great power", it says in verse 32, "gave the *apostles* witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus". You have them *all* now -- you do not lose one of them. It is not the design of God that one or
{305}
two should overshadow all the others, because everyone has his place and service. Then it goes on to say, "Neither was there any among them that lacked; for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles feet, and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need". Now, you see, the administrative spirit lays hold of all. Things are moving according to the original appointment of heaven. Those that had benefited by the administrations of heaven are now themselves administering what they have of material things. I doubt if anyone will be employed in administering spiritual things, unless he first learns to administer his material things. You begin there.
J.W. Would it be on the line of mutuality? There would be no selfishness displayed if mutual lines are observed?
J.T. Quite. It says, "The place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit". I am sure Peter and John would rejoice in that as much as any of the apostles or persons that were present, because they did not wish to arrogate all the Spirit's power to themselves.
Ques. Would you say this is an order and state of things the Lord would stand by?
J.T. I am sure He would, to bring us to these principles. Well, then, Barnabas appears. It does not say Barnabas was surnamed by Peter and John. It says he was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles. So that we now return to the original thought -- the apostles are emphasised, because the Lord will never give up what He institutes. However much variety of power there may be, the Lord never surrenders His primary thought. If He takes up Paul to preach, the preaching must be through Paul, "That by me, the preaching",
{306}
says Paul, "might be fully known", etc. And so the Lord takes up the twelve, and He will stand by the twelve and see to it that they are recognised. Barnabas is a new link. We have a man now who is going to link on with the others, coming later into an extended field of activities, and this we may, perhaps, consider another time. This man comes in at this juncture as a veritable gift from Christ, and he links on with the new lines of ministry that the Lord is about to introduce.
W.J.H. What is the thought of his being called the son of consolation?
J.T. I think he must have been a great accession to the company. The company must have greatly valued this Levite, as he came in amongst them. If the apostles called him that, you may be sure he was that.
W.J.H. I was thinking, perhaps, it would suggest another element of the holy ointment. There is a fragrance about it. It says of Noah's burnt offering, that God smelt a savour of rest.
J.T. Quite. He gives a fine lead as it were. We shall see the effect of this in Antioch later on. It speaks of those that were "well off". In some meetings they are well off. Thank God for it! You have the expression, "well off", in chapter 11. It says, "and they determined according as anyone of the disciples was well off, each of them to send to the brethren dwelling in Judaea, to minister to them, which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul". @Acts 11:29. So that Barnabas is an excellent leader -- he is on the line of *giving*.
{307}
REPRESENTATION
@Revelation 1:4 - 6, @Revelation 1:9 - 11; @John 21:15 - 17; @Acts 26:13 - 16; @Acts 9:7,20; @2 Corinthians 11:2
In what I have in mind to say on these scriptures, my object is that in the people of God at the present time, and until the end of the assembly's sojourn on earth, there is to be a representation of Christ; that is, a representation of His personal feelings, affections, and sympathies. I have selected passages covering the three great servants who, in the beginning of the divine economy on earth, were personal representatives of the Lord. They, of course, were employed in the establishment and maintenance of the whole economy of God, for they had to do with the public administration of the kingdom. But I hope we shall see that, whilst this is so, they, in a peculiar way, represented Christ in a personal sense, for we have to distinguish what refers to the Lord, personally, from what is general. The revelation of God in Christ involves the whole truth as to God; but, then, there is bound up in that what is special to Christ.
I take up John first, because he, in a peculiar way, represents what is special to Christ. So, also, do Peter and Paul -- the last in a more extended way than any. But I take up John first, because it is through his ministry that the great recovery, the benefits of which we all enjoy at the present time, came about. He was, as you know, "the disciple whom Jesus loved". It will be observed that he says, "that disciple whom Jesus *loved*" -- not the disciple whom Jesus loves. I do not apprehend that John intended to convey that he, of all others throughout the dispensation, had that special place. He had it at one time. I do not say that he lost it; but he would make room for those who followed, for
{308}
love always makes room for possibilities; and when we think of lovableness, the possibilities are very great. He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. He received no special commission, as Peter did, and as Paul did; but, being in the secret of love, he afforded the Lord a ready vessel of reserve -- one that is content to wait, one who is content to be out of view, if need be, if the requirements of love necessitated it. Love never fails; and as John was the loved one, he was the ready vessel of reserve. He it is who tells us that, when the multitude had to be fed, the Lord knew, Himself, what He would do. And so, in the exigencies of the great departure which the Lord well foreknew -- He knew, Himself, what He would do; and He had in John a ready vessel, one who styles himself in the book of Revelation a bondman of Christ. So that John represents the Lord in the new sorrowful circumstances of the great departure and apostasy that ensued. The Lord had in John one in whom He could confide; he was His confidant, as we may say. It is an immense thing, dear brethren, to be in the confidence of the Lord at the present time in regard of what exists, and in the whole sphere to which His name is publicly attached. He is concerned about it, His name is involved in it. And so it is an immense thing to be in the secret, and to know what He Himself is doing. He knew what He would do; and He would let those whom He loves into the secret of what He is doing; so that there should be in the midst of it here, those who are personally representative of His feelings, of His resentment of the insults offered to Him, of His appreciation of any little bit of regard there may be for Him in the midst of these things. And so, in John, there is one to whom He can open up, as it were, His mind. And John, in beautiful correspondence with his Master, addresses the assemblies. You will observe the personal character of the
{309}
addresses -- John to the seven assemblies. In addressing them, he has nothing personally to say against them. All that was embodied in the letters. The Lord's resentment and announcements of judgment, and at the same time expressions of sympathy and interest and affection, were all involved and bound up in the Revelation -- the letters or addresses to the seven assemblies -- but John addresses the assemblies in a personal way. "John, to the seven assemblies". There could be nothing finer, dear brethren, than the manner in which he rises above the sorrowful situation that was beginning to take place, in addressing himself to the assemblies. He is in keeping, as I said, with Christ -- he represents Him personally.
And then, having addressed them in terms of grace, he further says, "I, John, your brother, and companion in tribulation". We thus learn from this great servant how to face those conditions. We are to be affected, as the Lord is, by them, but we are to address ourselves to them according to His way. So that John places himself in the midst; for we are all, outwardly, in the same position -- we are all in the sphere of profession; and we can address ourselves, singling out those who are genuine, wherever they may be, and convey to them our relationship with them. They are our relations, they are our brethren; and if we are to represent the feelings and sympathies and affections of Christ for them, it is incumbent upon us to place ourselves alongside of them, as "our brothers", or brethren, and "companions in tribulation".
And so, you find in these addresses most remarkable evidences of personal interest. It says, "I, John", and in the end of the book, "I, Jesus". I would say to every believer here, whatever your associations are, the Lord Jesus has a personal interest in you. He would place Himself outside your door, even if it has been closed against Him for years.
{310}
Hence, it says in the last address -- that to Laodicea -- "Behold, I stand at the door, and am knocking". @Revelation 3:20. What interest there is in the heart of Jesus for you. It may be you have never opened the door to Him, or it may be that, having opened it once, you have closed it. Nevertheless, His personal interest in you is undimmed; He stands, Himself, at your door. He says, "If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him and will sup with him". @Revelation 3:20. How personal He is! He would come into your circumstances and sup with you; but it is to the end that you might sup with Him. This subject of Revelation is very great, and I can only touch on it in this way.
I now turn to Peter. I take these scriptures up in this order, because the order that I indicate is the way in which the Lord reaches us, the order in which He sustains us by food, the order in which He leads us on and introduces us into the great truth of the mystery. So, in turning to Peter, I need not enlarge on the scriptures that call attention to the Lord's personal dealings with him. He stands out, indeed, as a model for us, one who was taken up and dealt with by the Lord in the most personal way, to the end that he, in his turn, might know how to deal with others as representative of the Lord's personal interest in them. If there is anything that one covets it is to be able to convey to souls the Lord's personal interest in them. So Peter is, himself, the subject of the Lord's personal dealings. How personal the Lord was with Peter in connection with his conversion! He got into Peter's boat; He would get as near as possible to him. And then, again, He addresses Himself personally to Simon in regard to the foundation of the assembly. He says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven", @Matthew 16:17. The Father had made it a special personal matter to reveal to Peter who Jesus
{311}
was. And Jesus says, "And I say also unto thee, That *thou* art Peter", @Matthew 16:18. You see how personal He was with him. It was not only that Peter should know how the Lord loved and cared for him, but that he should become a qualified vessel on earth to convey his own personal feelings -- feelings of grace -- to others. And so the Lord says to him, "Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not", @Luke 22:31,32. How much hung on that one man! What a conflict there was between Christ and the devil for that one man! Satan would have him, but Jesus was victorious, and Jesus has him. And so here He looks on Peter, as we have often remarked. In the midst of His unspeakable sufferings, the Lord has time and thought for His erring one, as He has for you tonight, if there be an erring one here. He looked upon Peter as the cock crew. That look was enough, for Peter went out and wept bitterly. Think of the wonderful place Peter had in the mind and heart of Christ, as He had gone through the unspeakable sufferings of Calvary! And when the Lord was risen, the young man says to the women, "Tell his disciples and Peter", @Mark 16:7. And, again, after the Lord had risen, He "appeared to Simon", @Luke 24:34. You see how personal all that was. And so, now, as they dine, the Lord speaks to him personally; He sets him up here in confidence; He says, "Feed my Iambs", "Shepherd my sheep", "Feed my sheep". You see how the order follows, as I remarked.
If the personal interest has a successful result in one opening the door to Christ, the next great thing is that you should sup with Him. He sups with you, but He would have you to feed at His table; and there is abundance there. Peter, being the Lord's confidant, as I may say, is qualified through personal acquaintance with Christ, to convey His personal
{312}
feelings, hospitality, and bounty, so that you should be nourished. Food is not only for those who are walking in the truth -- food is for every one of the people of God, His lambs, His sheep. We have to consider the poor of Zion -- they have all to be fed. "I will satisfy her poor", @@Psalm 132:15. How many there are! But the disposition of the Lord is to satisfy the poor with bread; and so He would have us as so many Peters, confidants, knowing Him in such a way as to be able to convey to souls the Lord's bounty and hospitality, for there is abundance with Him. Hence, I say, Peter represents that side of personal representation that ministers to and cares for the needs and the food the people of God require.
When one comes to Paul, one has to move and speak slowly. Paul is the great pattern vessel. Those other two great servants have their relative positions, as I have said; but Paul's position is unique. Nevertheless, Paul is set before us as a pattern, that we should be here as representative of the feelings and affections of Christ for the assembly. It is a wonderful thing, dear brethren, that the truth of Christ and the assembly has been recovered; and, as recovered, it is essential that there should be those here in the light of Christ's feelings and sympathies and affections in regard of the assembly. And so, at this juncture, in the Acts, Paul is dealt with in the most personal way by the Lord. Paul says, "A light from heaven". Everything is in the light. "At midday", he says, "O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me". Just think of it, the light was brighter than the sun; wonderful things were in the heart and mind of Christ to be disclosed; and the light must be great, so that these things should be seen in all their proper proportions. The Lord says to Paul, in the Hebrew language -- and here, again, consider how personal the
{313}
Lord was with Paul, how sympathetic He was with Paul's feelings as a Hebrew -- "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" The Lord says, "I am Jesus". Think of Jesus in heaven, beloved, introducing Himself to such a man as Saul upon earth. The Lord says to him -- you are persecuting Me. In that *Me*, as we have often remarked, was wrapped up the great truth of the assembly, and, doubtless, Paul felt the point of it, for his hands were reeking with the blood of Jesus martyrs. How differently the saints would be viewed in his eyes henceforth! He was not meet to be called an apostle, he says, because he persecuted the assembly. Such was his sense of the value of the assembly in the mind of the Lord, that he felt he was utterly unworthy even to be called an apostle, because, in past days, he had persecuted it. But, nevertheless, the Lord knew His man, and He will have this vessel, and so He speaks to him in the Hebrew language, and says, "It is hard for thee". How His sympathies poured into the lacerated soul of that penitent as he fell to the earth; what an introduction to him of Jesus! So that now the Lord has got him securely forever, as the sequel shows.
In chapter 9:20, it says of Saul, that he preached in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. Now I wanted, my dear brethren, to dwell for a moment on this remarkable fact, that it was the idea of the Son of God that came into his soul, for no position can be greater than that one should be here representing the thoughts and feelings of the Son of God. Think of that! And so, Paul says later: God, who revealed His Son in me. God revealed His Son in Paul. It is not a question now of Paul standing for the great truth of the Son, of the Person of Jesus -- that is John's service in the main. What was revealed in Paul was that Jesus was God's Son in relation to men. Would that we understood that, that the Son of God is in relation to men! So that Paul says,
{314}
"God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I might announce him as glad tidings amongst the nations". @Galatians 1:16. It is the Son of God in relation to men. Think of the Son of God, dear brethren, in relation to our race; think of how dignified the race has become, since the Son has become a Man; the Son of God in relation to men, is what was revealed in Paul's heart, that he might announce Him as glad tidings amongst the nations. It is not, as I remarked, a question of His deity, although all that is wrapped up in it. The idea in the gospel is that the Son of God is in relation to men.
And what works out in the development of the truth is that the Son takes account of men severally. So he announces Him as glad tidings among the nations. The Son of God is watching for isolated ones. He has a new system altogether. He does not take men up *en masse*, He takes us up as isolated ones. And so, the great example of the truth of the Son of God is set out in @John 9. The principle of the Son of God in relation to men is, *"Me and thee"*. @Matthew 17:27 can anything be greater in the way of glad tidings than that the Son of God is interested in you and me? He would attach you and me firmly to Himself for ever. He is looking for you in isolation. He comes down, in @Luke 9, to the plain; that is, to the level of where men are. In @John 9 He came down to where the blind man was, and He opened his eyes, but he did not stay by Him. But when Jesus heard that they had cast him out, He finds him. The principle underlying the assembly is that the Son finds every one of us severally, and attaches us firmly to Himself for ever. It is only in the apprehension of the Son that I am in the assembly according to God. So it says, "Jesus heard that they had cast him out". @John 9:35. The blind man was isolated, you see. His confession of Jesus had isolated him religiously. I wonder if there is one here tonight who is isolated
{315}
religiously. You find your former associations stifling. All human organisations *are* stifling; there is no breath there for a Christian to breathe. The spirit of the world is there, and if you confess Christ faithfully, you will soon be isolated, and you may thank God for it, because the Son of God finds you. He is looking for you. The Lord Jesus says to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" That is the great question. You see, it is the Son of God, and one man. It is the Lord again saying, "Me and thee". @Matthew 17:27. How lovely to be taken into such companionship! It is no less than that, beloved. If there is an isolated soul here tonight, I say to you, it is nothing less than that. The Son of God is seeking your company. The man replies, "Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?" @John 9:36. He is ready for it -- I wonder if you are. The Lord's answer comes immediately, "Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee", @John 9:37. What can be greater gospel, beloved, than that, as Paul says, "I might announce him as glad tidings"? @Galatians 1:16. The Son of God seeks out a solitary one, and offers him His company.
And what follows? Ah, Paul says, "The Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me". That underlies the great truth of the assembly. Think of the Son of God having you in His heart *when He died*! Can anything transcend that in the way of love and personal interest? He might have said, He loves me. But he did not. He said, "He *loved* me". It is past history. It is present history, of course, but he is emphasising past history, that, when the Son of God died, He loved him. Well might he, indeed, announce such a One as glad tidings. What can transcend such glad tidings as that, that the Son of God loves one person, and dies for him? And now He offers him His company. He says: 'I want your company, I offer you Mine'. So that we have,
{316}
thus, in Paul, one who can personally represent the feelings and sympathies and power of the Son of God.
But then, not only that, Christ *loved the assembly*. Paul knew that, and he would subserve that. He was Christ's bondman for them. I liken these great servants to the three mighty men of David, who heard him say, "Oh, that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem which is in the gate!" @2 Samuel 23:15. They got near enough to the Lord to know the breathings of His heart. They could, therefore, be personally representative of His affections and feelings. And so the apostle Paul got the light of the assembly, according to what it is to Christ. In that one man the Lord expressed what was wrapped up in the assembly, and Paul always had it before him.
Now, dear brethren, this subject is great, but I believe you will follow me in what I am saying about Paul. The Lord looks for correspondence with the service -- with the example of those great servants at the present time. He looks for sympathy with Himself in His affections, and sympathies for the assembly. The assembly has taken form, as I may say, before His eyes, in a very meagre and weak way in our day; but, nevertheless, He sees it, and He values those who are in sympathy with Him in it. In @Revelation 3, the Lord says to the assembly in Philadelphia, "I also will keep thee", @Revelation 3:10 and He had said, "I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee". @Revelation 3:9. He speaks there of the assembly. And the apostle Paul knew what was in the Lord's heart; he knew what He sought, and, from the outset, he was the Lord's personal representative, in this world, in regard of the assembly. And so, in the passage I read in @2 Corinthians 11:2, he says, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ". You see how entirely sympathetic he was with the Lord in regard to the Corinthians. He found them
{317}
in their nakedness. The Lord had told him He had much people in that city, and Paul found them in their unloveliness. But he would clothe them and espouse them to Christ as a chaste virgin, and he did. How he laboured in his letters and prayers, that they should be maintained according to that.
That is the service, dear brethren, that is so important at the present time. In John you have the delivering ministry; in Peter you have the feeding ministry; in Paul the ministry of the assembly -- the formation and purification and sanctification of the assembly, in order that it should be presented to Christ suitably. The result, indeed, is seen at the end of Revelation, where it says, The Lamb's "wife has made herself ready". @Revelation 19:7. How could she be ready for Him, were it not that, by ministry through devoted servants, the requirements of Christ were brought to her attention? Therefore, she learns what is suitable, and she has "made herself ready".
{318}
MEMORIALS
@Matthew 26:6 - 13; @Mark 14:3 - 9; @Luke 22:14 - 20
J.T. I wanted to call attention to the fact that in Matthew and Mark the Lord does not regard His supper as a memorial. In these gospels, what has to be remembered was the act of the woman in anointing the Lord's head in the house of Simon, the leper. Luke records what He said: "This do for a remembrance of me". It occurred to me it would be profitable for us to consider the memorial spoken of in the respective gospels. In both Matthew and Mark the Lord says, that wherever this gospel is preached, what this woman has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. It may be that sufficient attention has not been given to the Lord's directions as to this woman's act. It was intended to be ever fresh in the minds of the saints, and I believe, where it is spoken of and the memorial kept, the conditions suitable for the Lord's supper will be found. Matthew presents to us the truth of government in relation to the assembly, so that the anointing of the Lord's head by this woman indicated her appreciation of Him from that point of view. She would not admit of any principles governing saints other than those divinely enunciated; she would save the saints from introducing innovations and human principles in connection with the Lord's supper or the assembly. The anointing, in Mark's gospel, would have in view the woman's appreciation of the Lord's skill and manner as a Servant, so that she would not admit of any other methods or principles governing the service of God than those which the Lord had introduced and expressed. If these two anointings are remembered according to the Lord's appointment, the saints will
{319}
be free, in their fellowship, from human principles in the government of the house of God. Matthew and Mark enlarge on fellowship; with them it is a question of eating. With Luke, it is not so much a question of eating as of the memorial. So that our fellowship, in that point of view, is preserved, and the act of this woman is commemorated.
W.J.H. Do you think that the anointing indicates this woman's approval of the Lord in the two ways in which the gospels set Him forth -- first, as king or as authority, and second, in connection with His service? She approved of the character of authority and service which He had brought in. The anointing would seem to indicate that, just as when God said to Samuel, referring to David, "Arise, anoint him, for this is he", @1 Samuel 16:12. That would indicate that God approved of him. It symbolises the idea of approval.
J.T. Quite.
E.E.L. She acted entirely without any precedent. She had no model.
J.T. No. It represents an intelligent state in the saints.
E.E. What do you think is the instruction for us that the Spirit of God should move the heart of a woman, and not a man, to do it?
J. T. I think to call attention to the initial idea of the assembly. The assembly was taking form. The elements of it were coming into view, as the Lord's death drew nigh. Some of us were noticing this morning, in the case of Mary Magdalene as recorded in John, she was detained at the sepulchre, and, looking into it, she saw two angels sitting, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. She had got light in her soul as to the dignity of Christ, from the position of the angels. And then she turns round, as if she is governed by
{320}
intelligent instinct, and she speaks to One whom she thought was the gardener, for she was still hazy, not being in the light of the resurrection of Christ. The Lord addresses Mary first. He says, "Woman, why weepest thou?" @John 20:15. The Lord was taking account of her. She represented a certain element that would enter into the dispensation later. She addresses the Lord, supposing Him to be the gardener. Then the Lord says, "Mary". There He re-establishes the link with her. She had come under His eye in those circumstances -- suggestive of elements that were coming into evidence in view of the dispensation. Next He adjusts her mind by saying, "Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father", @John 20:17. Then He says, "Go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". Finally, it says she went and told these things to the disciples. Now, the disciples would have an accession of light by her going to them. The effect of the light that had come into her soul and the influence she had come under in her intercourse with the Lord would also be there -- an addition to the company. So we see how the feminine side is emphasised at the Lord's death, and at His resurrection, as bearing on the dispensation. The dispensation should be marked by the feminine side; and so, this woman, mentioned in Matthew and Mark, has a collateral bearing -- her act indicates that she had an appreciation, first, of the One who had brought in rule and government, and, second, of the One who introduced the true idea of levitical service. And those elements are to enter into our desires, and hence the continuance of Matthew and Mark as a protection, and preventive of human principles and methods being introduced. If we have a memorial of this woman, in these two aspects, we are preserved from any principles other than those which the Lord introduced because we have a memorial of what she
{321}
did. "This that this woman has done shall be spoken of as a memorial of her". She is, as it were, brought to us, because a memorial is to bring a person vividly before one. Her name is not given, for it is not the person so much as the thing that she did; and it would be observed that it was in the house of Simon the leper. That is, this act is within the bounds of the house of Simon the leper. Such a house is not one that would attract; nor would such a one be popular, and he certainly would not be one with any special distinction in the world -- a leper, indeed; so that we are under reproach, so to speak, in such a house, according to Matthew and Mark. It is very different from an imposing structure, with stained-glass windows, and a choir, and an organ, and all else that goes with it -- what is called today the house of God. There is certainly a great difference between such a building as that and the house of Simon, *the leper*.
W.J.H. Does it not also show the greatness of the rule that had come in, and the greatness of the service, that in such a house there is subjection -- a condition that appreciates Christ?
J.T. Yes, and the Lord Himself was in that house. It is one of the things we have to accept in our fellowship, that, publicly, our position of reproach stands; and we do not seek to evade or conceal that. We are not together as persons of *repute* in the district, socially or otherwise.
E.E.L. Would the linking of this memorial with the preaching of the gospel suggest to us that the object of preaching the gospel is produced in those to whom it is preached -- the condition which was seen in this woman?
J.T. Exactly. Hence, if you, as an evangelist, go to a town or a district and preach the glad tidings, and souls are converted, you tell them about this woman: and that would save them from the influence
{322}
of current religion around them, because the obvious result would be that a saint would say, "Well, I have henceforth to be governed by the principles that governed this woman, and if I am going to serve the Lord, I must serve according to the manner of the Man whom this woman anointed". Your converts in that way would be saved from human principles. I suppose it is the neglect of the memorial of this woman's act that largely accounts for the present condition in Christendom. The people of God, instead of regarding the Man whom this woman anointed, in these two connections, have turned to human methods, borrowing Philistine ones.
G.A.v.S. Is that why it is all connected with the Lord's burying, because human methods and devices are all to be set aside, in view of what the death and burial of the Lord Jesus Christ has accomplished in the putting away of the man that is characterised by those things?
J.T. Yes; she saw that this Man was going to die. So, we may be assured the world is not going to accept these principles. We may as well accept that once for all.
E.E. Would you suggest that what we are considering here in Matthew and Mark, which really relates to the end of the Lord's pathway here, and His blessed ministry, marks the present position of those who love Him?
J.T. That is right. So that the memorial here, in these two passages, is of great importance to us; and it may be that we have not regarded it sufficiently.
G.A.v.S. Would you say in that case, if we neglect to follow up what is suggested in these two things, there would be a danger of the people of God drifting into a position regulated by human principles?
J.T. Quite. Unless we keep in view this memorial.
E.E.L. The influence of the memorial upon the people of God would be to induce them to give to
{323}
the Lord that which is most precious, instead of contributing it to the poverty of the world. The Spirit would teach us that the people of God are, as it were, a chaste virgin to Christ, whose wealth of affection is not to be lavished on the world and its institutions, but upon the Lord Himself.
J.T. Quite.
Ques. Do we not consider the gospels by Matthew and Mark more in connection with the passover aspect of the death of Christ?
J.T. That is right, and that is why you have so much about the eating. It says in both gospels, "as they were eating". The Lord's supper is introduced, "as they were eating"; meaning that the position has to be occupied, if the Lord's supper is to have its place, whereas Luke carefully separates the Lord's supper from the passover. Matthew and Mark connect it with the passover in that it was instituted "as they were eating". So that anyone seeking eligibility for the Lord's supper should be marked by eating -- that is, keeping the passover. One would challenge one's own soul as to whether one is eating. It says, "Let us keep the feast ... with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth", @1 Corinthians 5:8. That was for seven days. The passover is not a memorial; it is a question of our state, or fitness, for the Lord's supper.
H.W.B. So it would be the bond of our fellowship?
J.T. Yes. You are endeavouring to raise the question with any applicant for fellowship, as to whether one is eating. You would say, "What are you eating?" These people were eating the passover. There is a great deal made, in the types, of clean food and unclean food. These people were eating unleavened bread, which is intended to reduce us. It is not intended to inflate. It was as they
{324}
were eating that the Lord, according to Matthew and Mark, challenged them as to who should betray Him; and it was as they were eating that the Lord instituted His supper.
G.A.v.S. Does it resolve itself into a question of discernment as to whether a soul, seeking to break bread, is eating? How are we to discern?
J.T. I think you can tell the effect of the food. Daniel is an expression of that. His appearance indicated the food he was eating. If we seek the Lord about these things, we shall be able to tell by the appearance and the spirit of the person as to whether he is eating unleavened bread; that is to say, eating the feast.
W.J.H. One great effect of keeping the passover is that there is energy to leave Egypt, and one goes out "in haste".
J.T. Yes. If there be evil in a person's former associations it is obvious that such a one will be keeping the passover by abandoning and judging them, because @1 Corinthians 5 insists on dealing with evil. @2 Timothy 2 corresponds with that in our own time. It says, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". @2 Timothy 2:19. If one is keeping the passover, one will be marked by this.
S.E.E. You might say a little more as to how the memorial of this woman's act is continued.
J.T. It is in connection with the disallowance of human principles in the government of the house of God. The ministry of this memorial would sweep away at a stroke the whole fabric of Christendom as we know it -- the whole hierarchical system and the whole governmental system that is recognised abroad in Christendom.
S.E.E. That would be the attitude of the saints, in relation to Christ, in responding to this woman's act.
J.T. Quite. Thus the Lord's supper is preserved.
{325}
That is, we have fellowship in connection with the memorial in these two gospels, because the emphasis is on *eating*. So the Lord says, "Take, eat, this is my body". It is a question of fellowship. But in Luke it is a memorial.
G.H.C. Is the gospel intended to bring souls into personal touch with the Lord in this way?
J.T. That is the object in preaching the gospel. Paul and Barnabas so spoke that they believed. The effect of the gospel is to bring souls into touch with the Lord -- into relation with Him. But how are they to be governed, and how is ministry to be carried on? Those are two questions that necessarily arise as a company is formed by the gospel. Take Corinth, for instance. The Lord said He had much people in that city, and Paul was to stay there and reach them all. Well, the assembly is formed at Corinth. How is it to be governed, and how is ministry to be carried on? These two questions are worked out in Paul's letters to the Corinthians. There is the law of the house and the law governing ministry -- or governing the Levites. Every company of Christians is to be intelligent as to these two principles. And I think the memorial of this woman's act would keep these principles ever before them. The Lord's supper in Luke is more than that, it is to keep Himself before them.
Ques. Would we not understand that Luke leaves the door open for the Gentiles to come in?
J.T. Yes. He follows the line of Paul in connection with the Lord's supper, because, in the Acts, the Lord's supper was not in the early part formally separated from the passover. But, in 1 Corinthians it is separated from the houses and set in the assembly. And so Luke says, "When the hour was come". Now, Matthew and Mark would connect it with the *evening*, whereas, I think, Luke contemplates what ensued after Paul's ministry was effective. The
{326}
Lord's supper may be celebrated at any time of the day. It is a question of the *hour*.
Ques. Would you say that this woman in her act in regard to the ointment proved she was in effect eating the passover; so that, when the hour came, she was able to pour it upon His head?
J.T. I am sure that is right. It is interesting to see how Luke provides for our present custom. It is a question now of whatever the hour is. He calls attention to that; and, further, he says that the Lord placed Himself at table. These may seem trivial things, but they have their place, such as the hour and the position, because Luke is concerned with what is comely on earth, that is to say, order. So that He placed Himself, it says, at table; as if we should be in our places, so to speak, when the hour comes, that there should be no confusion. There is observance of detail with Luke, and then the twelve apostles were with him -- not the twelve, simply, but the apostles. In Matthew and Mark, it is just the twelve, meaning the administrative number; but with Luke you have authority; and, indeed, Luke says that the Lord sent Peter and John to prepare; that is, He made selection of these two apostles to prepare the place where the passover was to be kept.
G.A.v.S. When you speak of the Lord placing Himself at table, you would not exclude the thought that in so doing He was assuming a relation to the company that was peculiar to Himself?
J.T. I think the Lord placing Himself at table is a model for us; hence, in Luke you have the word "manner". It says, "in like manner". The Lord conveyed this to Luke, intending that there should be external rectitude and comeliness which is in keeping with heaven, where all is in perfect order; as David said, "When I consider thy heavens", and so on. If anyone wishes to look at order and exactness, look at the heavens. The least divergence would
{327}
mean disaster. And I think Luke has in mind that there should be in the assembly on earth, that which corresponds to all that comely and external rectitude, so that, before we reach the principle of the Lord's supper in 1 Corinthians, which, as I said, corresponds with Luke, you have attention called to the order. The apostle says he could not praise them on account of it. He says, "Be my imitators, even as I also am of Christ", @1 Corinthians 11:1. So the thing is worked out from Christ; and what Christ was, was expressed among the Corinthians. There was a personal representation in the apostle amongst them. Then he goes on to say, "Now I praise you, that in all things ye are mindful of me; and that, as I have directed you, ye keep the directions". He praises them in that; and then, lower down, he says he cannot praise them, because there was disorder in their assembly, and they did not know how to assemble, nor how to behave themselves when assembled. I was going to remark that the apostle calls attention, before proceeding to the assembly, to the order of God in creation, and he remarks, "Does not even nature itself teach you?" @1 Corinthians 11:14 meaning that we are not to despise any teaching element, wherever it may be. Any element from God that teaches has to be respected. So the apostle calls attention to the Head of every man, which is Christ. He says, "The head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God", @1 Corinthians 11:3. There is perfect order from God, down to the woman. Now all this is in view of order and comeliness. And so the Spirit of God does not mention for nothing that it was when the hour was come that the Lord placed Himself at table, and that the twelve apostles were with Him, as Paul says in @1 Corinthians 11:16, "If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom". That is what I understand to be the significance of the presence of the apostles -- there is
{328}
authority. Paul points out that there was a catholicity in the assemblies, and the custom of contention was not admitted.
Ques. Would you say that, in the gospels of Matthew and Mark, they are exercised as to the passover, whereas when you come to Luke's gospel it all derives from Christ Himself?
J.T. That is right. He takes the initiative, and He sends Peter and John, because He will have order, and will not brook disorder.
H.W.B. So that what is looked at is what is really under the eye of man, as in Corinthians. Would what is in John be another and a spiritual order?
J.T. Yes; John does not enlarge on these features at all -- he deals with what is inward, or spiritual. But then, there is not only what is under the eye of man, which is important, but what is under the eye of heaven, because it says, "because of the angels". Heaven is looking down on the assembly, and is reading in it the all-various wisdom of God. The angel, Michael, might say, looking down on Christendom now, "Where is there any counterpart of heaven in this?" It is the very principle of subjection, which marks heaven -- the essence of angelic life is subjection. You may say, it is absent. Well, we must not be behind the angels, because they are all learning in the assembly the all-various wisdom of God.
S.E.E. The Lord, placing Himself at table, is that as the Head?
J.T. That would enter into it. He would be in the position of the house-father, as has often been remarked. He takes the bread, and gives thanks for it.
S.E.E. Would taking our place involve our coming under His Headship?
J.T. I think that is right. You are reminded of authority. The assembly is begun in the sense of the
{329}
recognition of the authority of the Lord, and you go straight before you, as it says in Ezekiel. You go in at one door and come out at the opposite door. You go straight ahead.
H.W.B. Would placing Himself at table bring in the family element?
J.T. I think so, because the passover was a family matter. It was to be kept in the household, a lamb for a house.
Ques. Would you say that the twelve were initiated in the passover, but that, in connection with the apostle Paul, he was brought into the full significance of the Supper?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. In connection with the passover, Paul refers to it; but, in regard to the Supper, Paul says he "received" it.
J.T. Quite.
E.E. Referring to the angelic life, do you think they are going to have a complete conception as to the assembly?
J.T. Surely. You see, the Lord becoming Man, brought into view subjection in a way that even the angels had not known. The Lord was made a little lower than they were. What must they have seen in that wonderful pathway of Jesus?
G.A.v.S. So the Lord, placing Himself as He did, was really a spectacle to the angels?
J.T. Yes.
G.A.v.S. And they would look for a continuation of that in the way the saints placed themselves?
J.T. Yes, according to public order.
W.J.H. What is in your mind in relation to public order in regard to the saints now?
J.T. That we keep in mind what is presented in 1 Corinthians. We are to respect the order of God
{330}
in creation first of all. Order, also, enters into our houses. The first part of @1 Corinthians 11 has reference largely to our houses. It says, "The head of the woman is the man". @1 Corinthians 11:3 It does not say, there, that the head of the wife is the husband, although that is true. In "the head of the woman is the man", you get the principle of authority. Headship in the man is recognised everywhere by the sisters, or the women; that is the order of God. That precedes our actually coming together, but it necessarily enters into our coming together if we are assembled rightly, because at Corinth there were social cliques and distinctions, which, I think, should not exist if the order of God in the households had its place, because it is a question of women and men -- the place that women and men have in the creation of God. What value in the eyes of God is mere human lineage or distinction? It is nothing to God.
W.J.H. And unless that is maintained in reality, we are not ready for the spiritual. It is, first of all, that which is natural; and then, that which is spiritual.
J.T. We are apt to think we are more than men and women; whereas the order of God places us, as men and women, in regard to our spiritual position. Bearing that in mind, we are not likely to admit of social parties. That was the trouble at Corinth, and so the apostle says, "I do not praise, ... when ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you, and I partly give credit to it". @1 Corinthians 11:17,18. The apostle proceeds to show that, under those circumstances, what they were doing was not in accord with the Lord's supper.
W.J.H. I was anxious we should be quite clear that the external order you have in mind is not mere external detail in a literal sense, but what is moral.
J.T. Quite; because if we are not spiritual in all this there is no value in it at all.
{331}
E.E.L. I suppose what is external shows really what is within?
J.T. Yes. The hands of the clock indicate the power of the works inside. But the *hands* may become irregular, and it is important that the inside should be freed from all hindrances; otherwise the clock is useless. The public externals indicate what is inside, but nevertheless we have to see to it that they are there.
G.A.v.S. You mean the externals?
J.T. Yes. The apostle immediately proceeds to call attention to the externals when he says, "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it". Then it goes on, "After the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped, saying, This do ye ... in remembrance of me", @1 Corinthians 11:23 - 25. He brings in a model for them.
Ques. What is the teaching in the Lord giving thanks for the bread and breaking it?
J.T. Well, it was right. It was due to God that He should give thanks for it. This is the order that is proper to the assembly.
Ques. Would you say that the Lord gave the apostle Paul the real thought as to what He had in view when He instituted the Supper?
J.T. Yes. Paul received it of the Lord. So that it is in those circumstances, I apprehend, we have the memorial. What must it be for the Lord to look on a company regulated by His own example! Then the Lord reveals Himself to that company, because suitable conditions are there.
E.E. What influenced the woman to anoint the Lord, and what is the present-day outcome of the anointing against His burial?
{332}
J.T. I think what influenced her was that she had followed the Lord, and appreciated what she saw in Him. And so, correspondingly, as the Lord is brought to you in the gospel, you want to know what principles He introduced, whether in regard to the government of the assembly, or levitical service. You want to abide by these, and if you know the world you know that these will not be acceptable *there*, and it is no use endeavouring to enforce them. He was going to die, and she anointed Him for His burial.
Ques. What is the teaching of the head being anointed? In Luke and John it is the feet.
J.T. Because, I think, the official side is prominent in both Matthew and Mark.
Ques. Would you tell us what the Lord gave thanks for when He took the bread?
J.T. It is comely for a house-father to give thanks for food in the family circle.
S.E.E. The first thing mentioned is that the Lord took bread. Does he connect it with the order of the Supper?
J.T. I think He meant the bread had been in relation to the passover, and He took it out of that setting. It is, therefore, now in a new setting. The bread on the table, I think, would answer to that.
W.J.H. In that way it indicates *what* He took. There were other things there, but He took the bread.
J.T. Yes.
Ques. It was unleavened bread at that moment?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Would you say something about the publicity of the act in anointing the Lord? Is it necessarily done in public?
J.T. That is where the gospel is preached. That
{333}
is usually in public. The preaching of the gospel is a public thing.
Ques. Is it in view of the assembly?
J.T. Quite. That is what we have been saying. It is in view of the principles which govern the assembly, but, in saying it was unleavened bread, that is an inference. It does not say He took unleavened bread. It says, "He took bread", and so on -- "the *bread* which we break".
{334}
ADMINISTRATION (3)
@Acts 4:36, 37; @Acts 5:1 - 10; @Acts 6:1 - 15
J.T. In our last consideration of this subject, it was pointed out that however distinguished any of the Lord's people may be in this administrative service, he merges in the company. Chapters 3 and 4 emphasise the ministry of Peter and John, and the result of it. "And being let go, they went to their own company". @Acts 4:23. They become merged in the company, contributing, indeed, to it, so that all joined in prayer to God, with the result that the place where they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spake the word of God with boldness. The position thus far was consolidated by heaven's recognition, and the fresh impulse of the Spirit, in which all participated. It occurred to me that from this great vantage point we have a new start. Instead of Peter and John being specially prominent, we have, first of all, the apostles as a whole, for, in every fresh impulse of the Spirit and consequent administrative service, it appears that God ever asserts His authority. However successful a movement may be -- or appear to be -- unless there be the full recognition of divine authority behind it, it cannot command the respect and confidence of the people of God. Those who love God will always look for the evidence of the recognition of the will of God -- of the authority of God -- and if any movement fails of that, it cannot command the respect and confidence of God's people. For, "to obey is better than sacrifice", @1 Samuel 15:22 and God insists on His rights, so that, as the Lord says, "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me". @John 14:21. It is more important that a movement be stamped by divine authority and approval, than that it should be apparently successful. So that, as
{335}
the two great ministers return, they merge in the company, and then the apostles come into evidence again. Another thought that appears here is that whilst there are those that do exploits (as there were in the Old Testament times, in the days of the Judges, in the days of David, each exploit resulting in gain for the testimony), it is not the divine thought that any such person should be in control of His people. God ever reverts to His own interests, and if He had twelve apostles, these must be recognised. So that you find in chapter @Acts 4:33 that "with great power gave the *apostles* witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all". And, again, it says, "As many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold and laid it at the feet of the *apostles*". @Acts 4:34,35. And then, again, Joses, that is, Barnabas, being named by the *apostles* "son of consolation", sold his possession and brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the *apostles*. One would call attention to this, because it is not the divine thought that anyone specially prominent should necessarily rule, or influence, the saints beyond his spiritual stature. We have no appointees now, no apostles or elders by appointment, but there must be rule and administration, and this must be based on moral stature -- on spiritual stature -- and, however gifted the brother may be, or noted for spiritual exploits, he cannot undertake to rule beyond his spiritual stature. God reverts to His own thought, and so every element of power to rule must be noted and recognised in the company. I specially emphasise this because it maintains a right balance among the people of God, and saves them from clericalism.
G.A.v.S. Then would you suggest to us that spiritual weight and spiritual values are alone the standard which God is taking account of in the midst of the assembly?
{336}
J.T. That is what I thought.
G.A.v.S. That, in the absence of spiritual values of such a character being given evidence to, there is nothing that God can take account of; but when you speak of gift in that connection, could we take account of gift apart from the Spirit?
J.T. Not apart from the Spirit, but it may be taken account of apart from the spiritual state. @1 Corinthians 13 says that a gift may be exercised without the corresponding spiritual state, but even if it be exercised in correspondence with a suitable spiritual state, it is not, in itself, a warrant for the exercise of domination among the saints. Every bit of the work of God in the company has to be recognised, and I think that is what comes out here. The greatest servants -- Peter and John -- merge in the company, and the Spirit then calls attention to all the elements of authority there. Not only theirs, but *all* the elements of authority.
G.A.v.S. Then would you say that the action of Barnabas in this case was a divine recognition of that spiritual state that was to be taken account of among God's people?
J.T. I think that not only he, but all those, as it says in verse 34, "as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold, and laid it at the feet of the apostles". @Acts 4:34,35. They recognised *all* the apostles. Peter and John did not require any distinction in this respect; they recognised that the twelve were the representatives of Christ in the way of authority and rule, and they brought the money and laid it at their feet. Unless there be this state in the company, there will always be a tendency to recognise unduly a distinguished brother or brothers. It is always a spirit of mischief, and leads to an unbalanced condition among the saints, if those who do exploits are unduly recognised. There must be a balance. As the whole physical
{337}
universe is preserved by balance, so must the moral system be preserved by balance, and hence everyone who has moral weight must be recognised.
G.A.v.S. I suppose when we take account of spiritual values in that way, each has that which is peculiar to the work of God in his soul, so that we cannot set one against another, can we?
J.T. No, we cannot. And hence you have in the assembly an organism where every part has its functions -- every divinely-ordered band has its function to perform, and it must be given *scope* to perform it. I dwell upon this because of the word 'company' here -- a word that must be well noted in chapter 4. The assembly (having the Spirit as it is presented in this book) was intended to be self-contained and self-supporting, above seeking accommodation from the world and the powers that be. It has everything within itself to maintain it for God, and the wisdom that goes with that provides for the working of each one part, as it says elsewhere, "its self-building up in love". @Ephesians 4:16. The gifts are all intended to produce that state.
E.E.L. I was wondering if the reabsorption of these valued servants in the company was essentially to maintain the divine thought of unity.
J.T. You can understand what a great effect their return to the company would have, because it says, "Being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them". @Acts 4:23. This report would be a testimony to the victory that God had given them, a great support, and would immensely consolidate the company and establish it in confidence in God, as the following verses show, so that a great spirit of unity, as you said, prevailed. It says in verse 32 the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one. The apostles, in going to their own company, would enter it in the sense that it was a community,
{338}
and they were not to rule it; they were just integral parts of it, and all the victory they gained from the grace and power of God belonged to the company, and added to it, so that it had a great unifying and establishing effect.
E.E. So you would say that even with the apostles as they returned to the company, they were in it just according to their measure -- that is, the work of God in them? You are drawing a distinction between gifts and what was in them.
J.T. Yes. I would like to make it clear. No doubt the saints would respect them for what they had gone through, but, after all, they were only a part of the company, and that, I think, is what is emphasised in the chapter.
G.A.v.S. I was wondering whether the fact of their selling everything that distinguished them showed how thoroughly the whole company had entered into the thought of being merged into one.
J.T. That is the thing to get hold of. You subserve the company, you do not dominate it, you never regard it as something to be lorded over.
G.H.C. So that what one has in a material or spiritual way should be made available to the company.
J.T. That is what comes out after. We see the place that the authority of God requires in the (as you might say) readjustment. Thus, we shall see how even material things were introduced, and how, being introduced, they fully recognised the authority of the apostles. Today it would mean the moral weight of all. What is given, what is devoted, is to be administered according to the wisdom and moral weight of the whole.
J.S. Corinthians speaks of members in particular. Would they suggest distinctions?
J.T. I think Romans is the most elementary presentation of the truth of the body. "We are one body *in* Christ", @Romans 12:5.
{339}
it says in Romans, not the body of Christ. So that the point would be to recognise one another in Romans. The saints are coming into view as one body in Christ, not a human secret society or organisation, but one body in Christ -- that shuts out the flesh in man. In Corinthians it is the Spirit that is emphasised, so that we are Christ's body, and members in particular. Whilst we are one body by the Spirit, yet every member has his own individuality, his own mind, and his own affections, and he is to be governed accordingly. I think that 1 Corinthians in that way is an advance on Romans. Romans is, I think, the boards of the tabernacle. It is said of the boards that they were made "standing up", meaning that the Christian is taken account of "standing up", like this man here, see chapter 4:14. Romans takes account of the boards as they are, but Corinthians takes account of them as in their place. In other words, the golden bar binding the boards is contemplated in Corinthians.
J.B.S. The lifting up of one voice -- does that indicate they are together in an administration under the God of heaven and earth?
J.T. I think that very good. What is to be noted is that it is a collective thing now, and the apostles are there to serve *that*. You see every element of the divine authority is there to subserve the *company*. Directly you have the company found, everything must minister to it. And one wants to bring, by the Lord's help, those material things, as it says here, "Owners of lands or houses". These may be employed to further the interests of God, They are not to be despised, they have a great place in the divine economy, because of the need that necessarily exists among the saints, and the need, too, of supporting those who minister. I desire, by the Lord's help, to bring that out, and to show that even the administration of that affords opportunity
{340}
for the development of gift, and faithfulness in it leads to the very greatest service -- that one may, in such service, purchase to himself a good degree. It is one thing to see the Lord in His sovereignty, appointing the twelve, or imparting gifts, but it is another thing to see a faithful man occupied in a small matter -- what may appear to be small -- purchasing to himself a good degree and great boldness in the faith.
Rem. Does that refer to the present time -- purchasing to himself a good degree?
J.T. Certainly. It is set down to encourage us -- even what may appear to be a most menial service amongst the saints -- so that we may purchase to ourselves a good degree. That is to say, it is within my reach, not now as a matter of gift, but of purchase.
G.C.McK. Does that mean it is going to cost something?
J.T. That is exactly what it does mean. You cannot purchase anything without the means to do it.
Ques. Is that the distinction Joses purchased here, being called "son of consolation"?
J.T. Yes, I think that Joses stands out here as a model. We are beginning another chapter in the history of the testimony. After you have the company, you have a basis for a new chapter of operations, and Joses comes in here as a model. He is named at the beginning the son of consolation by the apostles. That means, he is an acquisition to them. Later history shows what a man he was. I think he represents the golden links of the tabernacle, because, as the sequel shows, he became the sympathetic link between this great work, which we have here, and the work that God undertook in Paul. He brought Paul to the apostles, and he brought Paul to Antioch, but he begins by just selling his lands, and taking the money and laying it down at the feet of the apostles. It was as if he said, "This is what I have.
{341}
and it is all there for you". He was prepared to subserve the company by what he had.
E.E.L. What would answer to that in the present day?
J.T. I think the same thing. Sacrificing material things, having the good of all before you, having the furtherance of the company -- you are sure to be recognised by heaven, you are sure to get a place, because it is a question of sympathy now. A son of consolation is a man who is sympathetic with what is on hand. For nothing is more consoling in an arduous service or undertaking than practical sympathy. Doing what you can to further the thing is within the range of every Christian. Every Christian may come forward as Barnabas did.
Rem. To do good and communicate?
J.T. Exactly. "Forget not, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased". @Hebrews 13:16. A recompense is sure to follow, for God recompenses in spiritual things.
T.H.G. Is there any thought in his being a Levite?
J.T. There is no doubt, he should not have had land, but the Spirit of God gives him credit for selling it. What we have here is a community in which everything requisite for the maintenance of it is present. But in *that* you have the authority of the apostles. God always calls attention to that -- and then to the sympathetic link in the son of consolation. I do not know anything more encouraging for young believers, who desire to be of service, than this lead that Barnabas gives. What may accrue to one who begins thus -- as a son of consolation!
G.A.v.S. You mean, then, that that spiritual sympathy is available to the youngest of us, so that none should feel that they have nothing that they can offer, because that has always been open to the very least?
{342}
J.T. Even if one has not got material things, if he has not got lands or houses to sell, he has his body. There is nothing in the material line more valuable than one's body. Romans leads up to that -- we can present our bodies, a living sacrifice laid down on the altar, and it is available to the company. One is never independent, one is merged in the company, and all that he has is laid on the altar, so to speak. It is remarkable how Luke, from the time the prodigal is brought in and set up in the house in chapter 15, touches on the value of material things. In chapter 16 he shows what man may buy with the mammon of unrighteousness. God is not going to let us off -- it is only an exchange for the moment. He can buy accommodation in the future with it; when this fails, he says, 'I may be received into everlasting habitation'. You get in the case of Zacchaeus, how he gave half of his goods to the poor, and the Lord regards him as the son of Abraham; and then, again, the woman who cast in her two mites, the Lord says she cast in all her living. It calls attention, I think, to how we all may come in to what is spiritual. We begin with what we have. You say, I have not gifts or land, but you have your body, which is of more value than anything, because the Spirit can use your body.
Rem. Present your bodies a living sacrifice, is that it?
J.T. That is right. Holy and acceptable which is your reasonable service; it is put in that way. In order to make the position clear, it is well to call attention to this case of Ananias and Sapphira, because they warn us that in our giving we may have success in view, because a man who has means is not always spiritual. In fact, means in themselves hardly tend to spirituality, but the opposite. It is a solemn thing. It is not that a man of means may not be spiritual, but the great tendency in a man of
{343}
means is to be unspiritual, and think himself important because of his means, or even acquire a place among the people of God through his means, which will never do. You see, Ananias thought he could give all -- or what would appear to be all -- to the assembly, whereas he did not; he wanted to keep enough to maintain his status.
G.C.McK. "How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God", @Luke 18:25 but I suppose the Lord looks at what we hold back rather than what we give?
J.T. And the motive one has in giving. The apostle Peter shows in what he says that there is no moral obligation in it at all. This is a matter of sacrifice, and whilst it remained, he says, it was in your own power. So that he had a sinister object in view, he wanted to be something.
G.A.v.S. I suppose apart from the spirit of sacrifice as right in the divine power, there really is nothing in the use of one's riches?
J.T. Nothing at all, because, unquestionably, God can get along without them. He says, "The cattle on a thousand hills are Mine". @@Psalm 50:10. The point is that He wants to see the outcome of love, and if it is not that, it is of no value at all.
J.S. He wants us to feel it is more blessed to give than to receive.
G.C.McK. Following your thought, the apostle says, "Though I give my body to be burned and have not love, it profiteth me nothing". @1 Corinthians 13:3.
J.T. That is very good.
G.A.v.S. I suppose that when the children of Israel in the wilderness showed what wise and willing hearts they had, it was because they brought all they had to the service of the tabernacle. Would that be the same thing in principle?
J.T. I think it is -- just the same.
{344}
A.H. Barnabas, being the son of consolation -- would he represent the normal product of the assembly?
J.T. I think that is the thing to get hold of. He is the model for us in giving. It refers to the state of his soul; he was the son of consolation, meaning that he was developed in that feature.
G.A.v.S. In bringing in Ananias and Sapphira in this way had you the thought of how administration, when exercised in power, discerns always such methods as are in operation in these two?
J.T. I think so. You see, it is Peter again, because although Peter had merged more in the company, he was, nevertheless, the leading apostle spiritually. See the immense gain to the company that there was such a one as Peter at this time. So that, while the most spiritual merges, yet when the need exists he comes forward. Really, love serves. Whilst he is willing to be one of them, to take his place with the brethren as one of them, yet when the need exists, he comes forward, because love serves. Love *will* serve, and we can easily see what an immense service this was -- that he was able at this juncture to discern that there was a lie in this man's breast -- that Satan indeed was behind the thing; it was a lie against the Spirit. What a terrible result! Had Ananias and Sapphira succeeded in foisting this on the company, it would have been leavened and the Holy Spirit would have been dishonoured. That would be the public effect, so that Peter now comes forward, according to the discernment he had, and exposes the movement.
J.S.D. Why does it specially mention the Spirit *of the Lord*?
J.T. I think that was the point. The point in these two chapters is the presence of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit had come in, and Satan would endeavour to upset that, and make it appear that
{345}
the Holy Spirit was not there, or if He were there He could not discern the lie. The Spirit of the Lord is a question of authority -- we are dealing with an authoritative position. The Spirit would be there to maintain the Lord's authority. I suppose the death of these two sinners would be the Lord's act -- the Lord did it.
Rem. I suppose the Spirit would discern they were actuated by self instead of love.
J.T. But how solemn a thing it is to have to do with the Spirit of God and with the Lord in the Christian company! This is set down to remind us that there is the power of discernment in the midst of it, the Spirit of God being there, and that the man that can discern *serves in love* in doing it.
G.A.v.S. Then would you encourage us in a day such as this to count upon the spirit of love coming in in that way, and asserting the rights of the Lord in connection with the company here?
J.T. Quite so. I can understand that this would bring Peter into reproach in the minds of unspiritual people. As to that, it is said that Moses and Aaron had killed the people of the Lord. So where the Spirit is active today, it is sure to bring reproach in the minds of unspiritual people, because the imputation would be that a terrible thing had happened. A man and his wife stricken dead! One can understand how much could be said on these lines, and how much is said today, because it is incumbent on those in the house of God to maintain it, and to have to refuse to go on with wicked people, with liars, with sinners in other connections.
G.A.v.S. The really "terrible thing" was what Ananias and Sapphira did, not what Peter did.
E.E. What happened to Ananias and Sapphira here is an example of what lies in front of those who ignore the presence of the Spirit among the saints.
J.T. That is exactly what it is put down here for.
{346}
There is no repetition of this, but it is as if the Lord put it down at the very outset to show the power there is for the discernment of sinners in the sphere of the Spirit.
J.J.J. Why are "young men" mentioned here in both instances, as carrying the bodies out? What answers to it today?
J.T. I think "young men" are mentioned here quite in a comely way. It seems to me to be a comely thing that they should do this, because Ananias was one of the company, publicly, and his wife, and that they should be carried out and swathed and buried was right. That is, if judgment is to be executed, there is what is comely and right in the treatment of those who are under discipline. We do not treat them as enemies. They were not buried like Stephen, however; "devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him". @Acts 8:2. There is nothing of that here.
G.A.v.S. I suppose the act of the young men here involved sympathy with the activities of the Spirit?
J.T. Quite; though the thing was settled and done with, the bodies were buried suitably. But how much complaint there is because of disciplinary action in the house of God! "Ye have killed the people of the Lord". It is incumbent upon us to do it if the house of God is to be preserved in holiness. It is incumbent upon us to deal with sinners. We cannot go on with such. I wanted to go on to chapter 6 for a moment to show what we have already remarked on -- how administrative service in the smallest matters may develop into the very greatest service, and even martyrdom, as in Stephen. Now we have the word 'twelve' in chapter 6, which, I think, usually refers to the administration of what is God's bounty. The word 'apostles', I think, usually refers to authority. As we have remarked already -- the Lord appeared to the twelve, it says,
{347}
and then later, it says, He appeared to *all* the apostles. Now you have the twelve in chapter 6, and they formally separate the administration of material things from the administration of spiritual things. However, they prescribed that men who were selected for the former should be full of the Holy Spirit, and they are provided and appointed by the twelve, and they take up their service, and immediately the Spirit of God goes on to Stephen; not to enlarge on his effectiveness in the administration of material bounty, but to say that, being full of the Spirit, he performed works of power, etc. It seems to me that Stephen is set out here as a model for the young men -- for all of us to take up any service that comes to hand, however small, and then we will be led on to something greater.
G.H.C. There was no reserve with Stephen. He was "*full* of faith and the Holy Spirit" -- "*full* of grace and power".
J.T. It says that in the midst of the council his face shone as the face of an angel. He is a reflector of what is in heaven. He is a direct representative. What a vessel God had in this man!
G.A.v.S. Is your point, then, that, however small the service in which anyone of us may be engaged, the Spirit would take it up in all earnestness as what has been rendered to the Lord, and bring advancement of a spiritual character which will lead to moral development?
J.T. That is the thing. So that you may see how God is preparing us for what He is about to introduce, namely, a heavenly system, first in Barnabas, who was a son of consolation, and then in Stephen, a *heavenly* witness. It is here more what the man was -- he purchased to himself a good degree and great boldness in the faith.

DIGNITY AND BEAUTY
@Genesis 14:21; @Genesis 22:20 - 23; @Genesis 24:4; @Galatians 1:15,16; @Galatians 3:26; @Galatians 4:6
I have before me to speak about the dignity and distinction with which each believer is regarded in the mind of God, and in the mind of Christ, and that this dignity and distinction underlie the principle of the assembly. The Canticles serve to show how the assembly regards Christ in His dignity and distinction. In her description of Him, which that book affords, He is regarded by the bride as the outcome of acquaintance, as "white and ruddy", and the "chiefest among ten thousand". @Song of Songs 5:10. And then she is regarded by Him, in the same book, as the only one -- "the only one", He says, "of her mother". @Song of Songs 6:9. I mention these facts at the outset so that you may see how the thought I have suggested works out. Further, the marital relation between Christ and the assembly is contingent on a previous family relationship. She is spoken of as His sister: "My sister", and then, "My spouse". @Song of Songs 4:10. So that the family link existed first, and I wish to show in what I am saying that this must be so.
Hence I take up the passages in Genesis, especially, because they speak of Abraham, who represents the family idea. He is, indeed, the great progenitor of the faithful -- of *all* the faithful. They are all accredited, in Romans, to Abraham. He is, it is said, "the father of us all". @Romans 4:16. And so I apprehend in view of this God appeared to him. He is the first, indeed, as far as I am aware, to whom God is said to have appeared. The divine appearance is in view, and no thought has come out in revelation more precious and more far-reaching than the family idea. It is a primary thought, and primary thoughts with God are those that abide. They descend to the plane on which He develops His testimony in order to set
{349}
aside the power of evil in this world. They run on collaterally with mediatorial thoughts, such as the kingdom. And, indeed, in the believer now, they rise up according to the level of his spiritual power to their own proper level.
So that in referring to Abraham and the appearance to him of "the God of glory", @Acts 7:2 as Stephen tells us, we are on a high altitude. We descend from it later in Jacob, in connection with whom these other details work out. Here we are on a very great altitude. One dwells with peculiar pleasure on that far distant occurrence in which the "God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia". @Acts 7:2. God intended, in that occurrence, to convey to Abraham some feature of Himself, and subsequent appearings would show that the family, which was God's primary thought, entered into that appearing.
But immediately Abraham -- being in the mind of God -- joins in the war, not for gain, nor for reputation, but in order to recover his brother, he is confronted in the recovery with the distinction between persons and property. We may be assured that the appearing of the God of glory involved *persons* and not property; not that God is not infinitely rich in property, not that He told Abraham he was not to have the inheritance, for he was -- he was to be heir of the world. Think of the extent of the property of the patriarch. He had, as it were, the title deeds of the world, but what would all that be without the people! And so he is confronted here with the distinction between persons and property -- I apprehend, a very real test to Abraham. He had just undertaken an important military enterprise, staking his all, as one might say, the result, doubtless of long training, viz., three hundred and eighteen souls born in his house. He staked his own life, and the lives of these men, in order to secure *one* brother. If there is an
{350}
erring brother here tonight, the spirit of Abraham, possessing every true follower of Christ ( of whom Abraham is but a type), says, 'We want *you*'. As the apostle Paul, who is the great example of this, says, "I seek not yours, but you". @2 Corinthians 12:14. In the spirit of Christ, the saints who love Him, seek an erring brother. And so Abraham staked his life and the lives of his three hundred and eighteen servants, not to aid the king of Sodom, not to join in the world alliance, but simply and only to secure his brother. He sought not property or the spoil of goods, but he sought his brother. He secured Lot, and not only Lot, but others, and he is challenged with this by the king of Sodom, "You take the property, give me the persons". Alas! there is no evidence that the persons were really available to Abraham. I have no doubt that they all went to Sodom, for poor Lot is later found in the gate of the city. But I speak of what confronted the patriarch at this moment, the idea of recovering persons. If there is one here tonight who has erred, has turned aside, being captivated in any way by this world, the spiritual desire of the saints is for your disposal for God, and not for the king of Sodom; for the Lord Jesus came for persons. He had *you* in His mind when He died, as Abraham had Lot in *his* mind as he set out with his trained servants, and pursued the foe well nigh the whole length of Palestine, and secured his brother near Damascus. He had *me* in His mind, as the apostle (one of the persons) says, He "loved me". I never tire quoting that, He "loved me, and gave himself for me". And so the Lord seeks you. At times one becomes oppressed with the thought of the many Lots, valuable persons with souls, for whom Christ died, but who are not available. The Lord has wonderful thoughts concerning you. Did He put it into the heart of Abraham to pursue the foe and rescue Lot; so that he should sit in the gate of Sodom?
{351}
No, beloved, He did not. What an opportunity there was for that erring brother to right himself with Abraham! Why, he was indebted to Abraham for his life, for all his property, for all that he was. What an opportunity for him to adjust himself with Abraham! Whatever his doubts might have been about Abraham, surely they must all be dissipated now, for there was evidence that he had practically laid down his life for him. There is, however, not a word of Lot being available as a brother. And so I would again repeat, if there are any erring ones here, the Lord would impress upon you what you cost Him. He did not die for you that you might be a prosperous man in this world, that you might have a reputation, that you might sit in the gate of this world. No, He had other thoughts. He had infinitely more precious thoughts for you.
I proceed for a moment to Galatians, and then come back again to Genesis. I see another man pursuing his way through Palestine. *He* is not seeking to rescue his brother, but has murder in his heart, and is commissioned by the high priests in Jerusalem to bind the members of Christ. *He* is "smitten" outside the city of Damascus, and inside the city he preaches in the synagogues that "Jesus is the Son of God". @Acts 9:20. What has he in his mind? He says "God was pleased to reveal his Son in me". I do not apprehend that it is a question exactly of the deity of Christ (that is preserved by the evangelist John, and Paul, indeed, is true to it), but the revelation of God's Son in his soul had reference to men. What, therefore, did the apostle have in his mind? That the Son of God should take up the *people*, the *persons*! I know of nothing more to be commended, beloved, to our souls, than this preaching of the Son of God, "that I may announce him", he says, "as glad tidings among the nations". The Son of God claims the persons; *Abraham* did not contend for
{352}
the persons, but the Son of God enters His claim, the persons are His. He would say, 'I died for you'. It is not as the mediator who gave Himself a ransom *for all*; it is more personal than that. The Son of God impresses you that He knows you individually, has given Himself for you, and claims you. He will not admit of the claim of the king of Sodom. He is announced as the glad tidings among the nations, and He claims the persons.
We will now proceed further in Galatians, to show how the apostle Paul's ministry sets forth the rights of the Son of God. I do not know of any theme more precious than the theme of the Son of God. It is His personal claim for you. It is His own language in @Matthew 17:27, "Me and thee". Think of all that enters into that word 'Me'. "Take that", He says, "and give it to them for me and thee". Can anything be more precious to a lover of Christ than that thought? He wishes to link you up with Himself in a personal way, and to dignify, distinguish and beautify you, so that you might be a suitable companion for Him -- a suitable member in the family of God.
So we find in the gospel of John, in a very striking way, what supports this line. The blind man in chapter 9 is outside. What I am saying appeals to those in solitariness, and I do not believe anyone is of any account in a moral way unless he experiences solitariness. That is, outside of the society of this world; we are cast out, or we have left it deliberately. When Jesus heard that they had cast him out, He said, "Dost *thou* believe on the Son of God?" @John 9:35. You see how personal it is. I ask myself the question over and over again -- do I believe on the Son of God? This is not historical. It is a personal matter for every soul to face. The man in chapter 9 of John is one of the persons. He is now outside of the range of the king of Sodom, so to speak. They cast him out,
{353}
and Jesus the Son of God is going to take him up, and he says, "Lord, I believe", @John 9:38 and he worships Him. That is *John's* point of view. Paul would say, "Ye are all sons of God by faith". You see how the ministry of the Son of God by Paul establishes the great principle of Sonship. "Ye are all sons of God by faith". It is a matter of light in one's soul, and that for the youngest believer in this company, as for the oldest. It is the mind of God for you. The Son of God claims you in that light. I am dwelling on this side in order to reach the passages in chapters 22 and 24 of Genesis.
We shall never understand the assembly as suited to Christ unless we understand the personal dignity and distinction in which we are held in the mind of God, and of Christ. It is a matter of light, I insist, for every one of us, and the light entering into the soul, lifts it from its poverty and degradation into the height of divine love, for light in itself will not suffice us. We need more than light if we are to reach the character of Rebekah. If we are to put on the grace and dignity of Rebekah, we must understand the spirit of adoption. The apostle says in Galatians, "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother". @Galatians 4:26. I connect that with the verse read in chapter 3 -- it is an abstract idea, and refers, I apprehend, to the light in which I am held as belonging to the sons. The mind of God about me from the very outset, from the moment that He took me up as a believer in His Son, is that *I* am a son.
But that is not enough. We need the Spirit. I apprehend the idea of "the mother" lies in the Spirit. You cannot have the influence -- that feminine influence, that maternal influence -- aside from the Spirit, so He says, "Because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying Abba, Father". It is in the apprehension of the spirit of adoption, beloved, that you come into the
{354}
gain of "the mother", and I understand that is of all moment for the development, in a practical way, of the dignity and distinction which are essential to us as forming part of the assembly. Gideon is told, as he inquires what manner of men they were that were slain at Tabor, "They are like you". Now, in that answer I believe we have reference to Christ, who is the model for the sons. Everyone, it says -- mark the individual distinction -- is as the children of a king. Gideon says, "They were ... the sons of my mother". @Judges 8:18,19. We do not take on the character of Christ merely by the acceptance of the light. The character is contingent on the reception of the spirit of adoption, so that you are brought to say, "Abba, Father". Now you are registered in heaven. As that precious cry of relationship with God reaches heaven, as I may say, one is registered there as among the firstborn ones. The Lord says, "in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven". @Luke 10:20. One has to be known personally in heaven in order to form part of the assembly of the first-born ones. We are the bride of Christ, who is to be brought to Him. She is composed of those who have the known status in heaven, not simply as a matter of light, but as a matter of formation in Sonship. Your voice has reached heaven, "Abba, Father". It can only be by the Spirit. So that you have the known status of personal dignity and distinction there. The assembly of the first-born ones, registered in heaven.
Now I come back for a moment to the passage in Genesis, and what we discern is that, whilst Abraham evidently did not have Lot, his brother, he *has* the tidings of the birth of Rebekah. I wish you to note, dear brethren, that it is a matter of light to Abraham. As Isaac, figurative of Christ risen, appears in chapter 22, the light of Rebekah comes to Abraham. She *existed*. I understand it refers to the fruit of the
{355}
ministry of Paul, which produces such a personage as Rebekah. The Spirit of God gives a picture of her in the chapter, and then, again, we have by the servant of Abraham a repetition, as if she should be practically brought close to our eyes, according to what she was. What for? In order that we might measure and see how far we have progressed in the feminine thought. How far have we understood and assumed the personal dignity that belongs to each of us as a son? It is in the apprehension of sons, and in the possession of the spirit of Sonship, that the graces of Rebekah appear. Abraham knew now that she existed; it was told him, so that he was not acting in the dark; he knew what he was saying. He took a note that it must be one of his kindred. He had not any doubt about it in his mind, for she was there. She had been there, and the servant discerns her, knowing what her traits would be. He had her clearly in his mind, and directly he meets her he recognises her. So that now, in the sons developed, as I apprehend by Paul's ministry, you have the assembly. How beautiful the picture! One dwells on it because of the meagre thoughts, dear brethren, that we have of what is suitable to God. In prayers, in praises, and in demeanour, it oft appears as if we assume that *anything* will do for God. Let our minds be disabused -- anything *will not do* for God.
In the Canticles, we have at least three descriptions of the bride by the bridegroom. Why these descriptions? Why these detailed delineations of her, first from the head down, and then from the feet up? What do they convey to us, His delights in all these details? If there were a spot, He could not say, "There is no spot". He says, "There is no spot in thee". @Song of Songs 4:7. He has His ideal, and is not going to give it up. He has the means of bringing about His ideal. I return to the thought of persons -- personal dignity and distinction as underlying the truth of the
{356}
assembly, so that while the bride speaks to Him in His personal dignity and distinction, He can reciprocate and speak similarly to her, "My sister, my spouse". @Song of Songs 4:9. As the days draw to an end, the truth is coming out that the Lord intends to have the assembly. He is not going to be defeated. It is no question of quantity, but of persons. "The crowd of names", it is said, "was about a hundred and twenty". @Acts 1:15. He knows my name. He looks for that dignity which He clothes with a name. I apprehend one hundred and twenty names signify one hundred and twenty varieties of life, and all the fruit of His grace. Then these names are to be dignified further, and beautified, and I would urge that no one here should be outside of what is going on, of what the Lord is doing. He is operating on the lines of life. He is white and ruddy, according to the bride's estimate of him. There is purity there, and the evidence of life. He is "the holy, the true", and He looks for correspondence. He looks for holiness and for evidence of life, and thus there is material that He can form, dignify, beautify, and set up organically, so that He has an assembly. He is working to that end. It is not a question of quantity, although one loves to think of the many, but of the quality. You see how much the Spirit of God stresses the characteristics of Rebekah. She is in every way in correspondence with Isaac. And so, as we read, "the marriage of the Lamb is come". @Revelation 19:7. Revelation contemplates it prophetically. "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready". @Revelation 19:7. She has become like the virtuous woman, who is industrious; she has everything that is requisite for readiness.
May God help us to understand the dignity that belongs to us individually, so that we may function in the energy of love, and in wisdom in that in which, as we are told, the all-various wisdom of God is displayed.
{357}
DECLARED TO BE SON OF GOD
@Romans 1:1 - 4; @2 Corinthians 1:19 - 22; @Genesis 22:9 - 23; @Genesis 46:1 - 8
I have in mind to speak tonight about spiritual establishment, believing that many of the Lord's people are unestablished, and my thought is to show that establishment in a spiritual way lies in our apprehension of the Son of God. Not exactly in our acceptance of the fact that the Son is God -- that is a matter of doctrine. We know as a matter of doctrine that the Second Person of the Deity became a Man, and that He was proclaimed from heaven as God's Son, but what I want to dwell on tonight is the fact that He is to be apprehended as the Son of God, as announced in the gospel, and, as so announced, He is "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead". That is, I want to dwell on the subject of the gospel, and the subject of the gospel as announced among the nations was the Son of God, known in a man's soul. As each of us here, doubtless, *professes* to believe the gospel, it becomes a challenge as to what we have believed. If we look into our spiritual history we shall be surprised -- I speak from experience -- at the amount of unbelief that exists. We shall be surprised to find how much of what we regard as our faith is an acceptance of historical facts. But we need more than historical facts. We need to apprehend these historical facts in their *moral bearing*, if they are to become light and power in our souls, and hence the declaration (not from heaven, nor even what was said to Mary, "That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God", @Luke 1:35 blessed though that statement is) needs to be apprehended in its spiritual force.
{358}
The declaration is not an announcement from heaven. It is the *bearing* of the resurrection apprehended in a moral way in our souls. It is this which is announced in the gospel. Paul was separated to the gospel concerning God's Son, "Made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead".
I wish to dwell, beloved brethren, on this great fact, in order that we may be established -- in order that, like Abraham of old, we may dwell "by the oaks of Mamre", @Genesis 18:1. It is a great thing for young believers to begin by dwelling in relation to things that are stable. Many remain, even as believers, in their early history, in relation to things that are very unstable, and hence the disappointment and uncertainty that mark the histories of believers. We need to learn, from the very outset, like Abraham, to dwell in relation to things that are stable. Even before we come to a full, clear apprehension of Christ in resurrection, we must begin by apprehending things that are stable. These may appear in an experienced spiritual brother or be seen in a company of saints walking in the Spirit, but it is a matter of immense moment at the outset of our spiritual history to learn to live in relation to things that are stable -- persons that stand up in relation to God and to Christ, just as Abraham dwelt by the oaks of Mamre.
I want to show you just for a moment how *unstable* things stand in relation to the power of the Son of God. As we look upon the history of the world, how many institutions have stood the test of time? Not one institution of man has stood the test of time -- not one. The most stable institution that you may look upon today is about to be removed -- it is shakeable. We, in our short histories, have seen powerful empires and powerful institutions fall, while those that seem to stand are only for a moment.
{359}
The great commercial system of the world is about to be shattered. Let no one think, if he lives in relation to it, that he is secure. I want to show you just for a moment, from typical reference, how these things stand in the presence of the power of the Son of God, because, whilst governmental dealings bring down many institutions, the final disposal of all the institutions of this world is in the hands of the Son of God. He has "spoiled principalities and powers". He "made a show of them openly", @Colossians 2:15 and has led them in triumph by His cross, and so, in the typical books, you have reference to *the power of the Son of God* as it applies to the most stable things of this world. Samson, for example, is surrounded in the city of Gaza by the Philistines, who had decided, according to the best of their wisdom, to slay him at daybreak -- an illustration of the folly of the enemy. They thought they had him in their power, and their counsel related to daybreak, but Samson lay till midnight, the moment when man is weakest, and took the doors of the gate of Gaza, bars and all, upon his shoulders, carrying them up to the hill that was before Hebron -- a picture of the power of the Son of God as encircled by His enemies. Satan with all his force surrounded the Son of God, as He entered Gethsemane. One can understand the councils -- victorious, as they thought -- of the hosts of evil, as the Son of God entered into Gethsemane. The Lord was not indifferent to the powers He had to cope with; He knew well the extent of that power, and hence His agony in the garden. Behind it lay the cross, of which I am not now speaking, and the forsaking, but He well knew the force of that power that encircled Him in Gethsemane, yet He lay until midnight, the hour of human weakness. Christ was crucified *in weakness*, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. The cross presents a most remarkable picture of the power of the Son of God
{360}
as encircled by His enemies! I see Him there, as He hung upon the cross and "*cried with a loud voice*" -- it was the voice of the Son of God -- and delivered up His spirit. Ere He rose there was a witness in that voice to the power of the Son of God. The dead shall hear that voice; all that are in the grave shall hear it, and shall come forth. And as Samson not only took the doors and the bars, but carried them up to Hebron, so there is in the resurrection of Christ, not only the overthrow of the enemy's power, but the leading of His adversaries in triumph.
Hebron stands in Scripture for that of which I am speaking. It was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt, and represents what God had in His mind before the world was. So Samson in type sets before us the power of the Son of God through resurrection. What could the Philistines do? What can Satan do with Christ in resurrection, or against those that apprehend that Christ is risen? He can do nothing! And hence it is in the apprehension of Christ risen from the dead, "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead", that one moves on. There is a great deal of instability among the people of God, and so I dwell on the power of the Son of God in dealing with things upon which men rely, and which they regard as stable -- how easily they are shattered and brought to nothing!
Now, you see, if Paul preached the Son of God he would bring in these features. In preaching the gospel Paul would not merely record historical facts about the Son of God, he would preach *Him*. I would like to convey some little thought to you about preaching. It is not a mere announcement of facts or of doctrine, though there must be doctrine (and facts), but preaching has a moral bearing in that it affects a man *morally* (and if I am not affected morally I am not affected according to God), making him say,
{361}
like the disciples, "What sort of man is this?" @Matthew 8:27. And then, again, He says, "Whom say ye that I am?" @Matthew 16:15. They might have answered, "The heavens proclaim You are the Son of God", but they did not. Peter was affected morally, and answered for the rest, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". @Matthew 16:16. Preaching affects you morally. It is a presentation of the Son of God, declared to be such by resurrection.
Think of the import of resurrection! It is not merely a man brought back from the dead, but a man brought back in a new condition, and death overthrown. It is according to the Spirit of holiness -- which is a moral thought. The outstanding idea of the presentation of the Son of God by preaching is to produce an apprehension of holiness -- of an altogether new condition for men, outside the range of man naturally. It brings to light the Son of God, another kind of man, yet in relation to men, with all the power that is in Him available for men. But think of His glory! "This sickness", He says, referring to Lazarus, "is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby". @John 11:4. Think of the glory of the Son of God, in the resurrection of the dead, bringing in a new race altogether; an order of man that exists eternally, altogether suitable to God; living in the Spirit of holiness; living in power in relation to the Son of God. That is what is presented in the preaching.
How one would love to sit down and listen to Paul preaching the Son of God! He says, He "loved me". That is not mere history. He had produced a profound moral effect in Paul. How his countenance would irradiate as he announced that he knew the Son of God loved him and gave Himself for him! He knew Him as declared to be such by resurrection. How it would affect one's soul! I do not suppose I
{362}
should ever forget if I once heard Paul preach, or ever lose the impression of preaching by a man in whose soul was the knowledge of the Son of God. The declaration was known in Paul's soul. And hence he says to the Corinthians, "The Son of God who has been preached by us among you" -- and not only by Paul, but Timotheus preached Him too, and so did Silvanus.
I listen to Paul and receive an impression I shall never lose, and I listen to Timotheus, also, and should get, no doubt, a reduced impression; but, nevertheless, I would gain a fresh understanding of the Son of God in a young man, for he apprehended and preached the Son of God, and so did Silvanus -- a threefold cord that cannot be broken -- a threefold testimony in that city of Corinth of the Son of God. What light in that city of Corinth! So he says, It was "not yea and nay", but "yea is in him". Paul, indeed, says, "I am in accord with my preaching", but what he insists on is the fact that "yea" is in the Son of God. For he says, "Whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us".
How is it, my brother and sister, in your soul? Have you an apprehension of the Son of God in your soul? If you have, you are not living only "by the oaks of Mamre" @Genesis 13:18 -- you begin to live in Beer-sheba. I take it that the oaks of Mamre refer to *stable things* -- dimly seen, perhaps, but nevertheless seen. Now in chapter 22, Abraham is not only living by the oaks of Mamre -- he is living in Beersheba, which means, "well of the oath", and this suggests the immutable purpose of God. I think what I am saying will be simple to everyone here. I want you to look into it, and see where you live spiritually. What I am referring to is the suggestion to you of the value of the Old Testament -- it was written for us, and I want everybody to look into this and see where
{363}
he lives, whether in relation to unstable things, of which I have been speaking, or whether you are beginning to live in relation to stable things -- things that are proving themselves to be stable. Abraham had looked at an oak, and the fierce wind blew, and the oak stood. It would remind him of the stability of what is connected with God's world. And so I say, dear young Christians here, that you may look on your parents, some of whom have stood for fifty years against the fierce blast of Satanic power. They have stood for God; they are worth your consideration. They represent relative stability. Learn to live in relation to those who stand for God to begin with.
But I do not want you to stop there; I want you to go on to Beer-sheba. Now Beer-sheba is the "well of the oath". There was no oath in relation to the oaks. If God swears, He swears in regard to what is immutable -- "That by two immutable things we might have a strong consolation" @Hebrews 6:18 -- and so the swearing is in regard to Isaac, and Abraham lived in the light of that oath. He believed God; indeed, he had started with that; but now he believes in the God of resurrection. He believes typically in a risen Christ, for Isaac's recovery was the figure of a risen Christ. I ask you, beloved, where do you live? Do you live in Beer-sheba? It is a comfortable place to live in. You will not be afraid of the north wind, of the snow, or of the frost. Winter and summer you are perfectly secure in your soul as you live there.
One dwells, with peculiar satisfaction, on the voice from heaven, saying, "Abraham, Abraham!" I understand that to mean that Abraham had arrived in the history of his soul at an ideal that corresponded with the mind of God. If God from heaven calls out your name twice you represent an ideal. God has His ideals; He has reached them all in Christ, but as
{364}
*you* reach them in Christ you are taken notice of in heaven in a peculiar way. "Abraham, Abraham?" That meant that Abraham had arrived in the history of his soul at the knowledge of Christ risen from the dead. "I know that thou fearest God", was said to him. What a moment in Abraham's history! What light in his soul then! What a sense of heavenly favour and recognition as his name is called out twice from heaven! And so the oath, "By myself have I sworn". It is not that God needs to swear from His own point of view, but He needs to swear from ours. He knows our poor weak hearts, and so He would have Abraham in the possession of a strong consolation, and thus he goes down and rejoins his young men, and sits down in the comfort of the light that had come into his soul, that God was a God of resurrection and that He cannot lie. How established he was!
Well now I want to show in the later verses I read, that in that position the light of the assembly comes into your soul. We cannot be in the truth of the assembly, according to God, unless we are established. We may be the subjects of care from the Lord's people, but that is not the whole of the divine thought. We are to be in the assembly as established by the light of Christ risen from the dead, and that in Him every promise of God is yea and amen. So it is at this juncture that Abraham gets typically the light of the assembly -- not yet actually as the spouse of Christ, but as the potential spouse of Christ. She is qualified according to the *light* that Abraham had at this particular juncture to be the spouse of Isaac. Abraham thus comes typically into the light of the assembly. He knows now that such a person as Rebekah exists. I wonder if tonight the light of the assembly is in your soul. Not yet, at the moment, what it is in its "body" and "bride" aspects, but that it *exists*. The assembly is existent on earth.
{365}
I wonder if we all have the light of the assembly in our souls. Someone told Abraham at this particular juncture about Rebekah. You see, it is not mere history. The idea of the assembly historically is known to everybody. That is not what is meant by someone *telling* you. Someone tells you that there is such a thing as an assembly in this world. Presently you are to understand it; and in connection with this you are stabilised by the light of the knowledge of the Son of God; you *belong* to it. But for the moment I am concerned with the light of the fact that it exists.
It was told Abraham at this juncture, as he nestled down under the protection of the faithfulness of God. He dwelt in Beer-sheba in the sense of the faithfulness of God. In his history there had been established a proverb, as I may say, "on the mount of Jehovah will be provided". I can understand people saying to Abraham as he nestled there in Beer-sheba: 'Abraham, what about the possibility of famine? What about the winter that is coming? What about the education of your children? What about the politics of the world, and how they may interfere with you?' What would Abraham say to every such question? "On the mount of Jehovah will be provided". That was his answer, that was his *psalm*. It became established in Israel. It was light for every believer afterwards to nestle in. "On the mount of Jehovah will be provided". A stabilised Christian need fear none of these things -- what a government may do, what men may do. "On the mount of Jehovah will be provided". And so, whatever question arises, Abraham had that answer. He was living in Beer-sheba, in that place of security and stabilisation.
But the light of the assembly typically had also entered into his soul -- someone told him of Rebekah. When that light entered Paul's soul, he said, "I am
{366}
an awful sinner". The Lord disclosed from heaven, as Saul of Tarsus fell to the earth, that He had a body on earth. "Why persecutest thou me?" @Acts 22:7, @Acts 26:14. From that moment onwards Saul felt what a sinner he had been. He was not meet to be called an apostle, because he persecuted the assembly. It may be that you are persecuting the assembly. What, a Christian persecuting the assembly! Yes, a Christian persecuting the assembly -- many of them do. If you persecute the saints, you persecute the assembly. As soon as the light of the assembly comes into your soul you abhor yourself for persecuting the saints. You begin to look at them now in the light of the assembly -- of what is so precious in the eyes of Christ -- He gave Himself for her, and you are persecuting her. Let this precious light into your soul.
I want now to go on to chapter 46. I want to show you briefly how Jacob came into this same position. You see, the parents live with their children, as Abraham did with Isaac. If we live with our children as heirs with us of the same promises, we shall surely pass on to them the light that we possess, and God will bless it. And so, in due course, Jacob comes to Beer-sheba. And what you find is that he is in the light of his father, Abraham -- the light of the resurrection, and so, instead of sacrificing to the God of his father, Abraham, he sacrifices to the God of his father, *Isaac*. You see, there is now a definite recognition of Christ risen from the dead, for Isaac is ever that. Jacob was leaving Canaan outwardly. It seemed a contradiction of the promise, but it was no contradiction of the promise. The ways of God in His government perfectly correspond with His purpose -- they run together. "His purpose is on the elevation of a mount, His ways are in the plains"; they are perfectly reconcilable, and Jacob understands.
If, there are those here tonight whose circumstances
{367}
seem to be against them, I would say to you, that you are to be stabilised in these circumstances in the light of Christ risen from the dead, and in no other way. Whatever God has promised regarding you, His purpose for you is as sure as that you will be in heaven by grace. Every promise is yea in Him, so that I would say to any in this audience who may be in adverse circumstances (one knows what these are, one knows how Satan brings them to bear on our spirits to discourage and hinder us), that the answer is in Christ risen. "On the mount of Jehovah, will be provided". Not a hair on your head shall perish, your very dust is precious to God, and so Jacob, in the majesty of faith and understanding, sacrificed to the God of his father, Isaac -- in New Testament language, the God who raised Christ from the dead. And hence, we have again, "Jacob, Jacob!" He has reached the ideal in his soul. In adverse circumstances he has learned to trust God. He has taken refuge in the faithfulness of God. Although the promises seem to be, and are, in abeyance, yet Jacob knows that every one of them will be fulfilled in the risen Christ, and he is perfectly trustful.
I want to show, further, at this juncture, that the saints are taken account of by name. The sons and daughters of Jacob, and their sons and daughters in the third generation are taken account of by name. They are all taken account of one by one, in the light of the resurrection of Christ. At this juncture, further light comes into your soul. You see that not only are things secured for yourself, but every one is taken account of. Those whom you love are all taken account of one by one; they are secure in Christ. Even our departed ones -- how precious is the thought that comes to us, "The dead in Christ shall rise first". @1 Thessalonians 4:16. A flood of light comes into the soul. Every one of the saints is taken account of by name.
In chapter 37 of this book the Spirit of God says,
{368}
"These are the generations of Jacob", @Genesis 37:2 and the only one named is *Joseph*. The others are all lawless; they are murderers -- I mean the ten brothers; and poor Benjamin has to share with them the hiding, as it were, of the face of God until they all come to the recognition of Joseph, and now Jacob is going to Joseph. They have all come to recognise Joseph, and Jacob is on his way down to Joseph, and his sons and his daughters and his sons daughters are all with him, and the Spirit of God takes account of every one of them. They are not now murderers, they are taken account of in a risen Christ. They belong to resurrection. It is a wonderful thing to have the light in your soul, not only of the power of the resurrection on yourself, but on all those you love, and if you are a true believer, you love all the saints. Colossian believers loved *all* saints; Ephesian believers loved *all* saints. Hence in this passage I am confronted with the thought that all saints are taken account of in the light of the resurrection of Christ. Every divine thought regarding them was sure; for whatever promises there are, are "Yea and amen" in Christ. I suppose "yea" is what we have now by the Spirit; it is enough. "Amen" is what we shall be in bodies like Christ in heaven. The complete fulfilment, literally, of every promise and every purpose of God.
And so I want to show, just for a moment, from the passage in 2 Corinthians, that God, through all this light, is establishing the saints. "He that establishes us", says the apostle, "with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God". God is doing that now, and it is very beautiful and commends itself to every one of us as the beloved apostle says, "He is establishing us with you". It seems to me to fit in with @Genesis 46. Not only is Jacob established, but God is establishing his whole posterity with him. They are all linked up in the same bundle of life. Jacob
{369}
acted in the light of Christ risen. We are all bound up with Christ in resurrection, and so the apostle, in a beautiful spirit, linked himself on with the Corinthians, and he says, God establishes us with you in Christ, and anoints us. That is what God is doing. I do not apprehend that God would anoint something unestablished. It is one thing to have the Spirit, and it is another to be distinguished by the Spirit, for the anointing distinguishes you, so that you do not need any man to teach you, for the anointing by which you are anointed teaches you all things. You are greater than all the universities of the world -- all the seminaries and colleges. In regard to divine things, you are independent of them; you are set up in dignity by the anointing. God is doing that. He would have His people stabilised, dignified by the Spirit, so that they are not dependent on man. They are now qualified to represent God, for anointing signifies that I represent Him here. And thus He seals us, marking us off as His own people.
The seal is the stamp upon you that you belong to God. You are His properly, and if you love Him you cherish that thought, and you would not wish to wear anything that would discredit that seal; or to be in any circumstances that would discredit it. It seems to be different to the property of God -- the inheritance of God -- and then He gives us the *earnest* of the Spirit into our heart. That is your portion. That is God's present work, beloved, and if there is one here outside the range of that work, I would say, 'Get into it by submitting to Christ'. Come into all this, into the sphere of divine operations where God is*establishing*, as well as where He is anointing; where He is *sealing* believers, and where He is giving the *earnest* of the Spirit into our hearts.
{370}
THE GLORY OF THE SON OF GOD
@John 11:1 - 5; @John 12:1 - 3; @Genesis 18:1 - 8
J.T. We have in chapter 3 of 2 Corinthians, the expression "the glory of the Lord", @2 Corinthians 3:18 which has reference (which, indeed, we are said to behold) to the administration of the new covenant. Here we have the glory of the Son of God, which is linked up with resurrection -- the resurrection of Lazarus, who is one of a family loved by the Lord. So that the glory of the Son of God stands evidently in relation to the family of God. Such a suggestion would appeal to us, as we belong to that family, for John's gospel contemplates the family. It begins by remarking that the Lord came unto His own, and His own received Him not, but to as many as received Him gave He title to take the place of the children of God. So that the family of God is in view at the very beginning of the gospel, and I think the three at Bethany, who are said to be loved by the Lord, may be taken to represent that family, and so the glory of the Son of God is bound up with the family, which is brought into accord with Himself through resurrection.
E.E.L. I was wondering if the three, Mary, Martha and Lazarus, in the beginning of chapter 12 of John's gospel, would represent the family normally. There is nothing wrong with them there.
J.T. I think that is right. They are now in the light of the glory of the Son of God. He is no longer a mere friend of the family; He is all, as you might say. They made Him a supper. The connection in my mind of the passage in Genesis lies in the fact that Jehovah appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre -- that is how it should read, not simply the plain, but the oaks. Attention is called in the record
{371}
to the fact that the appearing was there, and then we have the manner of it. In order to bring out, as I understand, the fitness of Abraham as having profited by the light already vouchsafed to him, to receive and entertain a divine Person, Jehovah chose the place. He appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre. The correspondence is in the Lord coming to Bethany six days before the passover where Lazarus was. That is, the Lord chose the place and the time, and in each instance the fitness of those visited comes into evidence. They are equal to the occasion. These are both remarkable occasions, and bring to light certain spiritual conditions which God values, and as valuing them He brings them into evidence.
C.A. Is that why Mary's name is mentioned first in John's gospel, owing to her spiritual condition?
J.T. Yes; I think attention is called to her at the outset, so that we might have her in mind. It was the Mary who anointed the Lord's feet. She was, as it were, the link in connection with which you have the development of this spiritual condition -- she was the primary link. We have her first introduced in @Luke 10, and, from the very beginning of her coming into contact with Christ, she is marked by spirituality; she sat at His feet and listened to His word. In other words, there is the thought of an overcomer in Mary, which, I believe, may apply to almost every locality, because we have always to connect Mary with locality. I believe that in every locality where the Lord's people are, there is an overcomer or overcomers, and they form a sort of link which the Lord takes account of, and in connection with which spiritual conditions are developed of which He can approve. I speak of this because, in the addresses to the assemblies in Revelation, each locality is supposed to have an overcomer, or, at least, the Lord makes certain promises to the overcomer in each
{372}
locality, because it is not only the assembly, but the assembly in the locality in the addresses to the assemblies. And the overcomer, I believe, becomes the link of which the Lord takes account, and in connection with which He develops spiritual conditions that He can approve of, and that are suitable to Him as He comes to the locality; because He does come to localities -- "who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks", @Revelation 2:1.
G.A.v.S. Are you suggesting to us that overcoming is a necessary precedence to the apprehension of the glory of the Son of God?
J.T. I think it is that things are now on the principle of overcoming by individuals; the overcomer becomes the link and the fresh starting point for every movement.
J.A.B. You used the expression that they were brought into accord with the Son of God. They were in relation prior to this, were they not?
J.T. They were, but He had not as yet acquired the supreme place in the household, in the family. I have no doubt He had acquired this place in Mary's heart, but not to the same degree in Martha's or Lazarus, but He intended not only to have a place in the heart of the overcomer, but that there should be development, and that He should have His full place in the family; in other words, in the local circle. It indicates, to my mind, how much an overcomer may accomplish, both for Christ and for the saints in his locality. He shows the way. After the resurrection of Lazarus, the influence of Christ was irresistible in the family, but then Mary would give a lead, and did give a lead, because she sat still in the house. She waited until it was told her that the Master had come and called for her. She really gave the lead in the locality from the very outset. The Lord visited the locality, according to @Luke 10, and He found Mary in a right attitude. Martha was
{373}
not in the right attitude, but the lead that Mary gave Martha, I believe, coupled with the Lord's reproof, had much to do with the great result which we see in chapter 12, for, however much light there may be, aside from the principle of listening to Christ in quietude, we shall not progress spiritually.
J.A.B. So that is why you use His name as the Son of God in connection with the company? It is in company conditions that we realise all that there is in Him -- His glory.
J.T. Yes, quite so.
E.E.L. And this feast made to Him at Bethany -- it was not merely a household affair; Lazarus apparently was one of those who sat at meat; Martha served, and Mary took the ointment; but it was not merely a family matter, was it?
J.T. No; it is more local. I think the emphasis is thrown on the locality. He came to Bethany. There is nothing said about the house; only it is said that it was filled with the odour of the ointment.
C.A. Would you say that Martha in measure had the glory of the Lord before her in saying she was going to the Lord, whilst Mary, in sitting still, was falling short of the glory of the Son of God?
J.T. I think we see in Martha the same restlessness that appeared at the beginning, only it was modified -- she had got help. But her remarks as to the resurrection at the last day, and the time Lazarus had been in the grave, show that she was defective. We may come very near the thing and miss it. Mary sat still in the house. She, doubtless, may have appeared to be indifferent, but, as soon as she hears that the Master had come and called for her, then she goes, and although she says the same thing as Martha, yet the Lord says nothing. She says, "If thou hadst been here my brother had not died". @John 11:32. The Lord makes no comment; He goes after her, and He weeps as if He linked Himself up with her --
{374}
as if He could link Himself on definitely with her exercise; and that is how matters stand in localities. The Lord links Himself up with those who are spiritual, and then there is a development, and all come into it if there is *subjugation*. Unless there is self-will, I think that everyone of the locality will come in for what there is. The overcomer will get the best, of course, but they will all share in it.
E.E.L. Mary maintains her right place, does she not? She is again in the lead here.
J.T. That is very beautiful. As you say, she maintains her lead, because it is by her the anointing takes place, and the house is filled with the odour of it.
H.W.B. Do you think Martha felt that the Lord was calling for her sister? She could not understand Him? "The Master is come, and calleth for thee". @John 11:28. Had she a sense in her soul that Mary would understand Him?
J.T. I have no doubt that Martha well knew the superiority of her sister's spirituality to hers, and it is a good thing if we all accept our measure and recognise what there is. God acts through leadership, and that is not simply through persons who have gift or who have special light, but through persons who are spiritual -- in a sister, as we see here. I have no doubt that Anna was intended to give the lead in her day.
W.P. Do you get a lead suggested in @John 20 in Mary?
J.T. Yes. You see how, in that instance, she ran and told Peter and John, and then they ran, and the other disciple did outrun Peter. So that she led in the movement. But then running in itself is not very sure, you know. It is all well if you see a thing, or if you are told a thing, to lay hold of it quickly in your mind, but a spiritual person has to stop and think and meditate, and I think it is in that that
{375}
Mary Magdalene leads in that chapter. She remained at the sepulchre and she looked into it, and now spiritual developments take place. She looked into the sepulchre, and she saw two angels sitting, the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain. That was the light that was intended to impress her, and she was impressionable. She is prepared for it, and so she gets what she is prepared for. But then she is only being led up to something greater than that, and she turns -- that is a spiritual movement and she sees the Lord. She does not know Him, she does not recognise His voice, but He calls her "Mary", meaning; I suppose, that He is taking account of the spiritual formation that is there. He calls her by name, and then He adjusts her, saying, "Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended". @John 20:17. He is removing what would interfere with spiritual progress. Hers were Jewish thoughts, right in their place, but the Lord was now going to introduce heavenly things. Heaven does not suggest a garden -- the garden belongs to the earth, and so many of us have to be adjusted in regard to preconceived thoughts. He adjusts her, and, as adjusted, she receives the message, "Go to my brethren". @John 20:17. So that you see how "He that hath, to him shall be given"; @Matthew 13:12 but; then, what is given is really for all. Peter and John come in for the gain of her exercise; She contributes to them all, and that, I think, is the idea of an overcomer. You do not overcome for yourself only; the spoil is to be distributed, so that the whole company gets the gain of it. She goes to the brethren and tells them these things, so that they are now in possession of the light that she got from Christ, and on that *He* comes. He comes in relation to that. There is no need of a message here, because Mary, herself, is in the company -- Mary of Bethany.
G.E. The Lord did not despise Martha, but walked
{376}
with her and encouraged her. So we might not assume to have the light of Mary, but the Lord would encourage us on the lines you are speaking of.
J.T. Yes; He would encourage us. He had great regard for Martha, but, with all that, she was not equal to her sister.
A.H-h. So that spiritual instinct is developed on the line of affection, and not on the line of mental acquisition.
J.T. On the line of affection. The first thing is to listen to Christ. That is what marked Mary of Bethany; she sat at His feet and listened to what He said. For how can one be in the intelligence of God, unless he listen to the teaching of Christ?
J.A.B. Why was she put through the deep exercise of the death of Lazarus?
J.T. I think the Lord intended that she should know Him in His glory as the Son of God. It is an immense thing to have vouchsafed to us knowledge of the glory of the Son of God. He intended that that family should be enriched with the light of the knowledge of His glory *as* the Son of God; it is the chief treasure of the family.
G.A.v.S. That family you have in view in the scene in Bethany is representative of a locality wherever such things are discovered.
J.T. That is what I was thinking of. The locality is given, and its distance from Jerusalem is mentioned, because, I suppose, the reference is to the connection between every local company and the assembly.
G.C.McK. Is the revelation of the Son of God in chapter 11 a development of what the Lord proposes to the blind man in chapter 9? He said to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" @John 9:35. I suppose there he has to be outside the earthly order of things.
J.T. That is very suggestive, because the man in chapter 9 marks the point reached in the development
{377}
of truth in John. It was a matter of faith first -- "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" @John 9:35. The man said, "Lord, I believe, and he worshipped him". @John 9:38. He is now in the family, because that is how the threads have to be drawn through, and, as believing on the Son, he now is in the presence of the glory of the Son of God. The glory of the Son of God belongs to the family.
G.A. Would you suggest that he now has eyes of a spiritual character? The glory of the Son of God was brought to light in the resurrection of Lazarus.
J.T. That is right. I think that John's gospel up to chapter 12 is to bring out the sons of light. He says in chapter 12, "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light". @John 12:35. And the man in chapter 9 is a son of light in relation to the Son of God. He is the type; he represents them all. They have all come to that point, and chapter 10 is to bring in the shepherd, because the idea of the shepherd runs on collaterally with that of the Son of God, only it enlarges on His personal interest in the sheep, calling them by name, and putting them into the flock -- one flock, He says -- which is marked by the same life as He has; the same knowledge as He has; that is the thought that comes in between the light of the Son of God in chapter 9, and the light of the glory of the Son of God in chapter 11, which involves resurrection.
S.E.E. Would you mind sharing with us your thought as to the family of God?
J.T. As I remarked, the gospel begins with it. I suppose the reference in chapter 1 is preparatory, as comprising the result of the whole gospel. "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God". @John 1:12. Now, receiving Him would mean the full light in which this gospel presents Him. In this gospel, sign after sign was published. It is intended for us now; the Jews could come into this:
{378}
it was for them, but they did not receive it. "His own received him not". @John 1:11. It was not simply that He became flesh, but He was amongst them, and He performed signs amongst them, and they rejected Him. He is definitely rejected by the Jews. John says, consequent upon that, those who received Him -- there were some who received Him -- came into the position of a family -- not a nation, but a family. "Not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad". @John 11:51. In chapter 1 he says, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we have contemplated his glory; a glory as of an only begotten with a father". @John 1:14. Now that is what the family comes into. The apostles witnessed it, and they have brought the light of what they saw into the family, so that it is in the possession of this precious treasure -- the light of the glory of the Son of God, and that is known in resurrection.
E.E. Are we to understand that the glory of the Son of God is that He is able to bring into existence and form a family of God for eternity?
J.T. That is it exactly. The message from Mary is, as it were, the finishing touch. They are now linked up with the Father as Christ's brethren, as an ascended One. The garden is left behind -- it is an earthly thought. We are connected up with Christ in heaven; His Father, our Father; His God, our God; and we His brethren.
C.A. Is the thought of the family before you the priestly family?
J.T. The priestly family is a mediatorial thought. The idea of a priestly family is that there is a mediatorial system wherein we serve in holiness in the tabernacle. Of course, we are the same persons, but it is one thing to be of a priestly family, and another thing to be of the family of God. The priestly family means that I am of the order of Aaron, but what we
{379}
are dealing with is not that; it is the family of God -- the family that goes to heaven as named of the Father -- of whom every family is named. John develops the family, and the name would be in accord with all the traits we get in this gospel.
E.E.L. You may, I suppose, take account of the family of God as being the object of God's tender care and solicitude, but, in referring to the family in these scenes, you would encourage us to look at them as marked by the characteristics of Lazarus, Martha, and Mary, as seen here.
J.T. Exactly. This leads up to chapter 20, for it is a scene in resurrection here, but the culmination of the thought is in chapter 20, where you have further features. The whole point in that chapter is, "I ascend", @John 20:17 not 'I am risen'. He does not say, 'Go, tell my brethren that I am risen'; not that He was not yet risen, but the great point of resurrection is settled here in the family, so that the message is not that; it is, "Go, to my brethren and say to them, I *ascend* to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". @John 20:17.
G.A.v.S. Would you say that one of the family characteristics in that way is that it has such an apprehension of resurrection as set forth in the power of God in Christ as to keep that family upon this earth in the power of that, and in the display of every moral characteristic expressive of what God is as the God of such a family?
J.T. Quite so. And the family, having the knowledge of the glory of the Son of God, is impregnable. The great point is that we live in Hebron. We are in a position where we are impregnable, because we are in the power of Christ; we are in the power in which He rose. The idea of being brethren, and His Father our Father, is something beyond that. It is what we may speak of as a supreme privilege. It is, as it were, a circle within a
{380}
circle. The outer refers to the position and involves the power in which Christ rose. The kingdom, as it were, is outside still. But, within that, there is the idea of resurrection -- the truth of Colossians. As regards the forces of evil here, we are in the possession of the knowledge of the glory of the Son of God in resurrection, and there is no power that can overthrow that; so that we rest inside of that, as it were, and enjoy our supreme privilege as being His companions in heavenly relationships.
J.A.B. In the thought of that inner circle, of which you speak, there would not be the distinguishing of persons, would there? Each of these that have come into view have been elders, and have responded to the light. Would you take the supreme privilege as belonging to the family? It is not persons that are distinguished.
J.T. We are in the relationship of brethren and as sons of God, although John does not develop the thought of sonship. I mean he does not use the word in his gospel in regard to us, but the brethren, of course, are the sons of God.
G.A.v.S. He leads us up to it by what He establishes in our souls.
J.T. I am sure He does, and it is at this point that perhaps we are largely defective, because we are unestablished, unless we apprehend the glory of the Son of God, and that is why I suggest Abraham, because he is seen living by the oaks of Mamre. Mamre is Hebron, and Hebron in Scripture stands for the thought of God before the world was. It is what is before the world; the wisdom that He has prepared before the world for our glory. So that Hebron is a wonderful place in Scripture in that way, and the appearing in chapter 18 of Genesis is to call attention to the fact that God took account of it. In chapter 14, Abraham is said to live by the oaks of Mamre, and in chapter 18 Jehovah appeared to
{381}
him by the oaks of Mamre, as if God would call our attention to the fact that that is a principle with Him, that those who recognise the glory of the Son of God -- that is, in resurrection -- come in for such distinction as a divine visitation, and He gives us all the features of it, because He would bring out the dignity and qualifications of those who live there. He has great delight in that. He has great delight in us as we come into the knowledge of the glory of the Son of God, because He knows now the Son in us, and we are soon to be conformed to Him.
H.W.B. In what light would the Son of God present Himself to us so that we overcome the world, as John speaks in his epistle?
J.T. As we have been saying, "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?" @1 John 5:5. You see there are many of us who do not believe that really. We simply accept it as a historical fact in Scripture. That is believing it in a way, but believing it really means that I have the light of the thing in my soul, and, having that light, I overcome the world.
G.A.v.S. Does it involve a spiritual sense in me as to His being the Son of God, wrought by the work of the Spirit of God in me, so that I know Him in that way?
J.T. That is right; one would hardly be regarded as a normal Christian -- he would not be regarded as a Christian at all -- unless he accepted the doctrine of the deity of the Son of God. But one may do that, as true Christians do, and yet not have the light of the thing. John is insisting on the faith of it, and as having the faith of it in our souls we are specially under God's eye. I believe that is the reason why the incident in @Genesis 18 is given -- because God would call attention to His great interest in His people as they dwell in the light of the resurrection.

E.E. Are we to understand that as we come into the light of what belongs to the family of God, there is that produced, so that He can be at home, so to speak; in His family, and find that which is in perfect accord with Himself? Are we to take it that that can be maintained in each of our localities?
J.T. That is exactly what this is written for. There is the idea of Christ coming to the *persons* in chapter 20, and in chapter 12 His coming to the *locality*. In chapter 20 it says, He came "where the disciples were". @John 20:19. It is not a question of the place; but of the persons; but in chapter 12 it is the locality. He comes to *Bethany* six days before the passover, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, and whom He raised from the dead. He comes in relation to those who are in the light and power of the resurrection. That is the point.
G.A.v.S. How could Abraham have been said to have been that in chapter 18?
J.T. Because he is a type. He is not yet in the full light of the resurrection, but he is bordering on it, because He had previously said to him, "I am the Almighty God", @Genesis 17:1 and He changed his name from Abram to Abraham, which involved that God would act in power for Abraham.
G.A.v.S. Then would you suggest to us that God saw the light of this in the heart of Abraham, although it had not yet come into outward expression?
J.T. I think Abraham is the expression of the light that he had, and dwelling by the oaks of Mamre, it is seen that there was stability. I have no doubt that the epistle to the Romans, rightly understood, leads us to the oaks of Mamre. There is that which is stable, because Christ is presented to us as the Son of God, as raised from the dead. We are not yet said to be raised ourselves, but we see Christ as risen, and we have the hope of it, so that the principle of the oaks of Mamre, I think, is found in Romans.
{383}
In Colossians we are raised, and therefore I think that this chapter 12 corresponds with Colossians. He comes to Bethany in regard to one raised from the dead.
J.A.B. Do the activities of Sarah and the young man suggest anything?
J.T. You know they do! Perhaps you can tell us?
J.A.B. I thought there was response in them to the apprehension that there was in Abraham.
J.T. You see, it is as I said, that Abraham is the overcomer, and the others come into it. Sarah and the young man are in accord with it. And the things are all *fresh;* there is nothing stale at all. You have nothing three hundred years old, such as a prayer-book, in a scene like that. These stale things have no place in a scene of resurrection -- it is all living. Nothing grows old, it is all life, it is living. So that you see the Spirit of God in the record dwells on the beautiful etiquette of Abraham, how he knows what to do with such a visitor -- a divine visitor; for in this instance the Lord brought His company with Him. See what an acquisition to that circle at Mamre, and how at home they were with Him. They say unto him, "So do as thou hast said". They accept his proposal joyfully. Then there is no confusion, but there is haste, because as soon as a thing is revealed to you in the assembly you should not wait at all. It is right to wait till you get it from the Lord, but as soon as you get it, do not wait, so that, as soon as the way is clear, as soon as Abraham gets the word, "So do as thou hast said", he goes in all haste; everything is ready.
G.A.v.S. Would you apply that to the point of being available?
J.T. I would. It is an immense thing to be available in the assembly on these lines; that is to say, apprehending the glory of the Son of God.
G.A.v.S. About the Lord bringing His company
{384}
with Him -- would you find anything that would correspond with that now?
J.T. Yes, I think so. The Father and the Son are said to come in @John 14, and the Spirit is already here, so that we have the three Persons, as we speak. Wonderful heavenly visitation to the assembly!
E.E.L. You refer to Abraham as a man typically in the light of the assembly. I was thinking that his attitude, his expression, "My Lord", and "I pray thee", and his running suggest that in him you find the fruit of the kingdom principles in perfection.
J.T. That is good. He came in for the administration of the kingdom in chapter 14. A wonderful experience for a believer in service for Him, to come in for the administration of the King of Righteousness, the King of Salem, and the priest of the Most High God. It is the full *organisation* of the kingdom, and all available to one person. One person becomes the object of all that service. How affecting it is! And then he comes in for the light of the almightiness of God, the power of God in chapter 18. "I am the Almighty God". @Genesis 17:1. As soon as that comes into your soul; well, you say, '*There* is something stable!' God is able to do everything. God comes in in relation to that. He appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, because He knew that these things represented what was in Abraham's soul.
G.C.McK. Would you suggest that every one of these cases was the product of death and resurrection? Does where Abraham dwelt suggest the privilege of being in association with the company -- that there is the light of the glory of the Son of God?
J.T. I think it does.
T.H.G. Would you say that Abraham was dwelling on the promises of God in connection with His promising him a son in the previous chapter?
J.T. Certainly. I think that Abraham had taken all the promises home to his heart, and in the revelation
{385}
of the power of God, as God Almighty, He would say, I have a guarantee now for the fulfilment of every promise. He has not yet arrived at the truth of Colossians, at Christ risen in Isaac, but he is coming on to it.
T.H.G. That state of soul that could give God the credit of those promises!
J.T. Quite so. I think the oaks refer to the *knowledge* we have of God; the knowledge of the power of God. Abraham believed that He was able to perform that which He promised.
J.B.S. What is the thought in Abraham addressing the three in the singular person? He received the message from the three; the three address him, yet he replies in the singular. Is that spiritual instinct?
J.T. I think it is. It was right because one was the Lord. They are introduced at the outset as three, so that Abraham in spiritual instinct could discern who was the Lord in the three.
