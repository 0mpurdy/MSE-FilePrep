CHRIST ASSEMBLING WITH HIS OWN (1)
@Acts 1:21,22; @Matthew 3:13-17; @Matthew 5:1-12
J.T. It is said in @Acts 1, in view of the appointment of an apostle, that he should be from those who assembled with the disciples during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among them, beginning from the baptism of John until Jesus was received up. It is thought that the Lord would help us to consider in Matthew's gospel, what feature of the truth entered into certain occasions in which He came in among the disciples and went out as indicated there.
Our consideration of this subject should familiarise us with divine activities as seen in Christ in assembly service; whether it be the assembly meeting for the Lord's supper, and all that enters into that, or the meeting for prayer, meetings such as this for scriptural inquiry, or for prophetic ministry, or even for gospel testimony. We shall, in this way, become familiarised with the thought of the Lord's movements, not as on earth, but by the Spirit now; nevertheless, *His* movements. How varied the truth is; how each occasion of His coming in implies something distinctive, for in coming in He has confidence in us. It may be, however, to rebuke or to reprove us, as we shall see in these meetings of the disciples. In going out, He would leave us with the understanding that we are to carry on during the period of His absence. The fact that an apostle was required to have that experience shows how important it is.
Christianity is not a dead religion, but is marked by activity and intelligence; firstly divine activity, and then our activity, levitical and priestly, and especially in authoritative service. Unless service in some measure takes on authority, it has no effect. We have no formal
{2}
authority, but there is to be moral weight, and apostleship implies that. The period selected by the Spirit here begins with the baptism of John; not from John's birth, nor from the Incarnation, but the period when Christ's public ministry began until it finished; as it is said in the verses in Acts, "until the day in which he was taken up"; right up to that day His service went on.
We may see in the baptism of John, the beginning of a period. There was the announcement from heaven of sonship; and, as in Christ, how pleasing it was to heaven. He had come under God's eye for the previous thirty years, and the accumulated delight of heaven was expressed there. Then, as He is about to go up, He presents Himself to the disciples *living*. It is clear on the one hand that heaven is engaged with Christ in the testimony; and, as it saw Him here at thirty years. We too are to be engaged with Him as He would have us see Him. He was seen of the disciples *as He presented Himself*; meaning that He took up a particular attitude in which He would have them view Him.
H.H. Would @1 Timothy 3:16 fit in with that a little? "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory". Would that cover the period from the baptism of John until the time of His going up?
J.T. I think it would. It is the mystery of piety connected with the assembly which is the pillar and base of the truth. Timothy was to know how one ought to behave oneself in it.
C. Would you say there was great power in the authority of the word that came from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son"?
J.T. That is what I thought we might get clear about to begin with; how the Person of Christ comes before us; then His movements as coming in and going out. It says, "All the time in which the Lord
{3}
Jesus came in and went out among us". We have first heaven's testimony; then Christ's movements in the period mentioned; and finally His presentation of Himself to them living before He went up.
C. There were those at that moment who could appreciate the voice from heaven.
J.T. Well, one would hope that there are those now, ready to listen to what heaven has to say about Christ, as also to appreciate His own presentation of Himself to us, as in the Lord's supper.
E.P. Peter says, "It is necessary therefore, that one of these should be a witness".
J.T. The word ' necessary ' there is important. It was not a mere idea that came into their minds. The horrible death of Judas is spoken of, and we know how far away he was in his ways from the ways of Christ. We are to be warned by his ways. It is said he "became guide to those who took Jesus; for he was numbered amongst us, and had received a part in this service". Then we are told of the kind of death he met with, and the Psalms are brought in to testify. "Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no dweller in it; and, Let another take his overseership" (verse 20). There is a vacancy, and the Spirit of God stresses why there is a vacancy. Persons dropping out of the testimony leave places to be filled, and hence the necessity of this matter. "It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, ... one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection." That there should be no more such vacancies, each of us should stand true in his place.
H.H. The Holy Spirit would have regard for what is here now. It is not a lower level in principle than what came out in Christ.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. @Matthew 4:16 connects the light with Christ here below; it sprang tip; it is not spoken of as shining down from
{4}
heaven. Christ was the centre of everything whether in heaven or on earth; and so it is a question now of what He was. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (@John 1:4). The light of life was in Capernaum where He dwelt, and that runs through. His coming in and going out would all bear on that, the kind of life that was there; that life of movement and of light.
J.W.D. Do you mean that the testimony of christianity, as the result of life in the saints, corresponds with the testimony in Christ personally?
J.T. That is it exactly. What is happening now in the world is to bring out what is in the saints. God knows what is in us. We have had a good deal of light in an objective way; for one hundred years it has been shining. I believe the present pressure is to bring out the life. The life was the light. It is not simply what we hold in the way of doctrine, but what we *are*, and that is seen in the way in which we come in and go out amongst the saints; each one. The subject of eternal life had a great place some years back, and I believe it was for this very purpose; that there should be substance; not only doctrine, but substance. "In him was life", John says; that is the idea of substance, and that becomes light. It was light in Christ, and it is to be light in us. So John speaks of that which "is true in him and in you". "I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard. Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you" (@1 John 2:7,8). The old commandment would be that which is in Christ -- substance; the new commandment is *in the saints*. Hence it is a question with us of what each one is.
S.P. Would you link the word in @1 Samuel 18:13 with this? It is said of David that "he went out and came in before the people". The people had ascribed
{5}
a great place and power to David in saying, "Saul hath smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands". Then in verse 13, we read, "And Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people". Would you connect that with love in the saints?
J.T. Quite so. David "went out and came in" before them. Christ "came in and went out". It is also said of David that "thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel" (@2 Samuel 5:2). He went out and came in. Many have gone out and never come back. Saul did not come back, he was head and shoulders above all; a commendable young man when anointed, but he took his own way and never, as it were, came back. As following my own will, I do not come back. David took the people out and brought them back; he completed the matter. Samuel too; his circuit (@1 Samuel 7:16) means that he always came back to the point at which he began.
H.H. We need the subjective side in our souls in order to rightly take account of the objective.
J.T. Well, the truth is never verified in us until it can be said, "which thing is true in him and in you". The truth is never truly held in a mere intellectual sense -- it is to be true *in us*. John's epistle is to bring out this very point; hence he begins with the tangibleness of what came in in Christ -- it was substantial. Christianity is no mere theoretical religion, such as the Eastern religions, or even judaism. It is *Christ*, and expressed here below; "which thing is true in him and in you".
J.R.H. What Peter says, in @Acts 1, "It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us", would give greater importance to our meetings if we look at them in this light.
J.T. That is good. The footnote to verse 21 reads, "or ' at every time that '." Each time would have its
{6}
own distinctiveness and we shall see, from the facts that will come before us in Matthew, that it was so. There was always something distinctive when the Lord was among the disciples.
A.E.H. To refer back to @1 Timothy 3, would you say that the secret of the mystery of piety is spirituality?
J.T. Yes. It is real. The mystery of piety involves what is substantial. God was manifest in the flesh. It is not a mere theory. John says, "Which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life" (@1 John 1:1). It was all real. Their hands handled Him. He was not an austere religious leader, holding his followers at a distance. He allowed them to be familiar with Him, one of them lying on His bosom, showing the liberty that the Lord afforded to His own as coming in and going out amongst them. Peter might enquire from Matthias, Were you at such and such a meeting? Peter could say I was in each of the meetings. "The lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles" (@Acts 1:26). That is, he was the twelfth. Peter could easily question him as to whether he was at a particular meeting. Had he been careless in attending occasions in which the Lord was, he would not qualify for apostleship. That brings out the importance of attending all the meetings now. We miss so much because we fail to attend. Take the first great thought, the baptism of John. Were you there that day? No? Well, it was one of the most wonderful of all the days. The Lord came from Galilee to John to be baptised, and the heavens opened and said of him, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". Who would not say, I wish I had been there; I am sorry I missed it?
J.P. I was wondering if the question of having assembled all the time, would help us in the matter of formation and acquiring substance? Here it is the *men* who have assembled. Manhood would be developed.
{7}
J.T. Yes. The idea of *man* here is important. It enters into the position of the apostles peculiarly. The Lord uses it in speaking to His Father, after the discourses with them in @John 13 to 17. In chapter 17:6 He says, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world". Not simply persons, but men. Manhood certainly underlay the apostolic position.
J.T.Jr. Did Moses have this in mind when making his request in @Numbers 27:17, "Set a man over the assembly, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no shepherd"?
J.T. Yes. It confirms what we have been saying about continuing. What is needed now is men, but of course that in principle includes sisters, as well as brothers, because the first word for man covers both. "Let us make man in our image" (@Genesis 1:26); that was the order of being. But manhood in the sense of distinction is to appear in all of us. He "called their name Adam, in the day when they were created" (@Genesis 5:2), implies this. The appointment of an apostle is a test to bring out this point of what is necessary in service, involving authority. It is acquaintance with the Lord Jesus as coming in and going out amongst them.
H.H. It is not what is optional -- it is necessary. Some of us have made requirements optional.
J.T. I think the way meetings are attended indicates that, that I may come, or not come, without any feeling of delinquency; but at Pentecost all the saints were there -- they were all present. The Holy Spirit coming in at that point would mean that He recognised and honoured that. The crowd of names would mean that each person was distinguished in life. The name arises from what one is, and as being living. The experience of going through that period with the Lord developed maturity; it should mark every one within; otherwise you have
{8}
complaints and questionings. There is a tendency in young people to enquire complainingly -- Why is God allowing this or that? What is needed is bowing to the will of God in the exercise of *patience*, and that flows from manhood.
S.P. These features would safeguard life in the fellowship, over against the man in the preceding verses, whose bowels gushed out, whose feelings were entirely out of control.
J.T. Quite so. Judas was utterly wanting in right affections and compassions.
E.P. These men had no official status, had they? "Assembled with us", Peter says. Would the Lord's coming up out of the waters of baptism suggest a similar thought; coming up in that lowly way?
J.T. That is worthy of our consideration. We have had before us what Judas was, and the sorrowful end -- the field of blood. He gave the name to the field. "Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no dweller in it" (@Acts 1:20). It is a striking condemnation of the person who had dwelt there. Now in Christ, as presented in Matthew we have righteousness. It is one of the first things. Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptised of him. Others came from distinguished places. "Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round the Jordan, and were baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins" (@Matthew 3:5,6). They came from Jerusalem, but that did not prove that they were right. Jesus, we are told, came from Galilee -- that is a place of no account religiously. What would be commendable in Him was not from any place here; it was what was in Him; what He *was*. "Altogether that which I say unto you." It is what He was. He came "from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him; but John urgently forbad him, saying, *I* have need to be baptised of thee"; John was right there, I suppose, but persisted in maintaining that attitude. The Lord answered,
{9}
"Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". That is a very important point in our inquiry.
A.E.H. Since this is the first occasion that may be included in the period Peter mentioned, would you say that the first and outstanding feature of manhood is the ability to go out of sight, so there may be room for God. Is that the fulfilling of all righteousness?
J.T. Just so. The Lord does not say that He alone was fulfilling all righteousness; He would bring John to see the importance of righteousness, *all* righteousness is stressed. The Lord says it becometh *us*. Hence everyone in each meeting is in this. It would preclude all complaint as to what this one and that one is doing. What am *I* doing? Paul urges the Corinthians to "do what is right", whatever they thought of him (@2 Corinthians 13:7). Everyone must do what is right -- "it becometh *us* to fulfil all righteousness". The assembly is the home of all righteousness, every phase of it.
H.H. It would be righteousness on our part to own at the outset that we are unrighteous; and so we accept baptism and disappear in that way.
J.T. That is so. The gospel proposes righteousness from God, but then there is the *fulfilling* of it: "the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us". It is where God formally asserted His rights. They were perfectly answered to in Christ. They are answered to now in those who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit (@Romans 8:4). It is by the Spirit, not by legal effort, that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us.
H.H. Christians accept the idea that we have no righteousness of our own. We all stand in relation to Christ. Is that so?
J.T. Faith is reckoned to us as righteousness. That came out in Abraham. The Holy Spirit, however, enables us to fulfil all righteousness. The Holy Spirit maintains in believers what is in keeping with the cross;
{10}
that is practical righteousness. "If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him" (@1 John 2:29).
J.T.Jr. Peter's word in @1 Peter 3:12 helps us, "because the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears towards their supplications".
J.T. The righteous are also pleasing to God, so that the word is, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". It does not say *all* My delight here, as it is often misquoted. I think the word "all" is left out so as to make room for the righteous, those who are after Christ; they come under the divine eye as He does. What is true in Him is true in us, and it is pleasing in us even as in Christ. Room is allowed for the extension of what came out in Christ at the Jordan, making room for what was to come out by the Spirit in the saints; the body of Christ must be what is in accord with Christ.
J.S.T. Does that connect with the statement in @Ephesians 4:24 that "the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness"?
J.T. It links on, but there it is the new man, which is a *creation*. Christ is never said to be that, but it corresponds with Christ. The creation refers to us only, and that we are constituted in accord with Christ. It includes all that which is effected by the Spirit from Pentecost to the end of the dispensation. There is only one new man. In Colossians, it is freshness, but in Ephesians it is newness in the sense of being different from anything that has ever been.
J.W.D. We cannot get beyond what is in Christ. Everything in the saints is an extension of what is in Him.
J.T. The *extension* is made room for in what was uttered by the voice from heaven. It implied that room is left for increase. The divine ideal was met in Christ, and we are brought to that. All was perfect
{11}
at the beginning. John in his first epistle begins with this: "That which was from the beginning".
W.W. Would the extension be seen in the last chapter of Romans?
J.T. There are about twenty persons saluted, and the comments show the variety of that which is of Christ. What a wonderful thing that was in Rome; the extension of what came out in Christ, seen in the Roman capital! In this gospel when the women came to the sepulchre they were adjusted, the angel telling them to go to the disciples and say to them that the Lord was risen and that they should see Him in Galilee. They went immediately, and the Lord met them and said, "Hail". They were moving in subjection. No one will be saluted from heaven unless they are moving in the light of heaven. The Lord said, "Hail", and He uses the word ' brethren ', it implied elevation from the word ' disciples '.
This matter of righteousness should be taken hold of -- *all righteousness*; the assembly requires it; it is the home of it. If I question anyone in the assembly, I must see that all righteousness applies to me. It is an all-round matter.
H.B. Are the disciples being governed by righteousness in their coming to Jesus?
J.T. Yes. That is the next thing, in order that we may see the significance of the baptism of John, because that is the beginning of the period alluded to in @Matthew 3:15. In answer to the Lord's word, John took a lowly place in obedience though he was a little wrong in so urgently forbidding the Lord. If the Lord says anything, submission is the first point. When His mother speaks to Him about the wine, she accepts adjustment, and says, "Whatever he may say to you, do".
Of John we read "then he suffers him. And Jesus, having been baptised, went up straightway from the water, and lo, the heavens were opened to him". The Lord is getting approval in this course of righteousness.
{12}
It is one of the most precious things, the sense of heaven's approval. They opened to Him, "and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him: and behold, a voice out of the heavens saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". The Lord was Himself given to know heaven's interest in and approval of Him. That may be carried on to each of us as corresponding to Christ. Heaven makes known its approval of us in the fulfilment of righteousness, especially if I am doing something to put myself out of sight.
J.W.D. What form would heaven's approval take?
J.T.. Heaven would find a way. Of course everything is now by the Spirit, but sometimes He may use brethren to express His view of you. Heaven is concerned about Paul going to Jerusalem, and in every city, it is said, the Spirit witnessed to him that bonds and afflictions awaited him. The Spirit would undoubtedly witness through the brethren in each city, and we know how Agabus *portrayed* before Paul's own eyes what would happen to him at Jerusalem; that was according to heaven's thoughts. So the brethren may be used of God to give me to understand that I am approved there. They may lay their hands on me, or the like. Then again I would be before God in prayer, and I may get an inkling of it there. Heaven has its own way of giving us to understand its mind about us.
J.W.D. Why do you say heaven rather than God?
J.T. Well, it is a general form of expression. If we say that London or Washington says so and so, we mean the persons of authority in these places. In the gospel we read as here, "Lo, the heavens were opened to him". I only speak in that general way, but the Voice is what we ought to notice. It is substantial. It conveys the thought of the person who speaks, but it is the Voice. It is like handwriting.
J.T.Jr. Would the book of Daniel help? Nebuchadnezzar had to recognise that the heavens rule (@Daniel 4:26).
{13}
We have to recognise in regard to the present pressure that heaven is ruling in spite of what happens down here.
J.T. Just so. That is the determining factor. Heaven is asserting its rights and we have to recognise it. That is how the matter stands. Christ in heaven makes all heaven aglow. Christ on earth draws out heaven's delight, "This is my beloved Son".
T.M. Would this be a certain fulfilment of what is recorded in @Isaiah 64:1, "Oh, that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, -- that the mountains might flow down at thy presence"?
J.T. There the prophet is urging Jehovah to come down in a judicial way. Here the Father is addressing the supreme Object of His affection. In the epistles, inclusive of the Acts, heaven is asserting itself in regard of what Christ is up there. "Received up in glory". It is the sound from heaven in @Acts 2 and the Spirit coming in, laying hold of certain persons in relation to what is up there; with a view to testimony down here. Then the light from heaven in chapter 9, brighter than the sun; that is, it is the excellence, the superiority of it, the shining out of Christ, being up there; and finally the vessel from heaven which came down and finally went up and stayed there.
A.B. The heavens were opened to Him, but in Matthew the voice apparently is to others; not to Himself. "This is my beloved Son", as if setting the Lord forth in an exemplary way.
J.T. Yes, to call attention to Him. In Mark and Luke it is, "Thou art my beloved Son".
H.H. Does that cover all the thirty years of the Lord's life up to this time?
J.T. I should say so. "In whom I have found my delight". It would take in the whole life of Christ from the beginning.
H.B. Why does Matthew use the words "lo" and "behold" so much?
{14}
J.T. Well, they express *feeling*. You want to be feeling in the testimony. Interjections are generally expressive of feeling.
In chapter 5 we have, "But seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying". He *went up into the mountain*. Matthew's way of presenting the record seems to indicate that things are *difficult* in a way; because it is a question of testing out what is in us, whether we are genuine. The Lord does not ask the disciples to come to Him. He goes up, and "his disciples came to him". Matthew presents the disciples as corresponding with Christ here. This is the first instance. They come to Him on a mountain. He went up, and they went up; they did not express any difficulty about going to Him. We are apt to express difficulties, and make excuses when absent from the seasons in which the Lord comes in amongst us, but here they had none. They *came to Him on the mountain*. The point in the whole section, chapters 5 to 7, is to bring out the legislative features of the new system. It is important to understand the principles of legislation in the divine system. The Lord here is legislating for the kingdom, and the disciples were with Him. The disciples came to Jesus. This is one of the great features of the comings in and goings out of the Lord; what He says is authoritative. Fourteen times in chapters 5 and 6, He says, "I say unto you".
E.P. These blessings cannot be gainsaid. They stand.
J.T. It is very striking that in the legislative branch, so to speak, exacting as it is, and authoritative, the idea of blessing comes to light. Blessed are certain ones. It is mentioned in the abstract, first; "Blessed are the poor in spirit ... Blessed they that mourn ... Blessed the meek ... Blessed they who hunger and thirst after righteousness ... Blessed the merciful ... Blessed the pure in heart ... Blessed the peace-makers ...
{15}
Blessed they who are persecuted on account of righteousness"; and finally, "Blessed are ye". We want to come into that. The Lord is opening up a wide range of blessings, but He does not say ' ye ' until He comes to speak of suffering. "Blessed are ye when they may reproach and persecute you, and say every wicked thing against you, lying, for my sake". Well, I can put myself in there, but it means I must accept persecution. "As it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter" (@Romans 8:36). That is the attitude. So you are not surprised as you take up that attitude, and there is blessing attached to it.
W.G.T. @Matthew 5 seems to be what you may term acceptable legislation; that which is an advantage to the disciples.
J.T. Yes. We begin with blessing. You come into the kingdom as a sufferer, and if it becomes hard, as it will, you are not surprised. Peter says afterwards, "Beloved, take not as strange the fire of persecution which has taken place amongst you for your trial, as if a strange thing was happening to you" (@1 Peter 4:12). It is not to be regarded as strange.
J.W.D. This feature is the door to the kingdom.
J.T. I think so. The Lord is calling attention, in the abstract, to certain persons who are blessed, and He does not say ' ye ' until He comes to the matter of suffering. We can begin there anyway.
J.W.D. These blessings are in relation to the kingdom.
J.T. They are seen here as merited. It is not as Ephesians, where it is stated that God has "blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ" (chapter 1:3). Those are sovereign. These in our chapter are merited. God begins in that way. The Lord does not address the disciples personally, until it comes to persecution, and everyone may take up that attitude. The *ye*, as indicating those who suffer, corresponds with the poor
{16}
in spirit, and those that mourn; those that are meek; those that hunger and thirst after righteousness; those pure in heart; those who make peace. I *accept* the attitude of a sufferer as seeing that it means blessing, and that is how Paul is viewed when he was converted. The Lord said, "For *I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name" (@Acts 9:16). The suffering attitude is the way out; it avoids all complaint and resistance.
A.H.P. Would this show the way by which we are brought under the principles of righteousness? We are told that the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Yes. They are blessed who hunger and thirst after righteousness.
Rem. These things would mark one who had been with the Lord through His ministry, as referred to in @Acts 1.
J.T. These chapters in Matthew describe one of the occasions or seasons when He came in and went out. In after days, a disciple who missed it, would be sorry that he had not been there; one might have said the mountain was too high and my heart was too weak. You know how often such things are said as mere excuses. Well, those who thus speak miss this wonderful instruction.
J.A.T. The suffering, as spoken of here, would be connected with the apostles. The Lord had passed through the same suffering.
J.T. Yes. In addressing them He said, *Ye*. "Blessed are ye when they may reproach and persecute you, and say every wicked thing against you, lying, for my sake. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for thus have they persecuted the prophets who were before you". He goes on to say after that, "*Ye* are the salt of the earth".
J.W.D. What do you mean by the way out is by suffering?
{17}
J.T. The way out of the sphere of complaint and resistance is to accept suffering. Therefore, the apostle says, "In all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us" (@Romans 8:37).
V.D.S. "If ye are reproached in the name of Christ, blessed are ye; for the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you" (@1 Peter 4:14).
J.T. Quite so. Peter follows up this matter of the kingdom in his epistles, and suffering has a great place in them. He says, "That the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes, though it be proved by fire, be found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ" (@1 Peter 1:7).
J.R.H. Are you emphasising that at this first season at the Jordan, the Person of the Christ comes into view, and in the second season on the mountain, it is a question of His commandments?
J.T. Yes, He is owned from heaven -- He is authorised, so to speak. The position occupied by the Lord here is one of delegated authority, and the voice from heaven made a basis for that. In chapters 5 to 7, He is using the authority; it is conveyed in the words, "I say unto you". He was representing heaven really in this way of authority. Matthew presents the kingdom, the authority of heaven vested in Christ.
{18}
CHRIST ASSEMBLING WITH HIS OWN (2)
@Matthew 8:14,15; @Matthew 9:1-8; @Matthew 10:1-6
J.T. We have alluded to the light springing up in Capernaum (@Matthew 4:16). It was there to be seen; it *sprang up*, meaning that it issued from Christ, not as in heaven, but as here. Life is not stressed as to heaven, but as to what is on earth. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (@John 1:4). The statement in chapter 4 conveys what was in Christ as on earth. The voice from heaven, recognised Him not simply as having life on earth, and the source of it too, but as the *Son* -- sonship in Him is owned as here on earth. It came out through His own words, according to Luke, when He was twelve years of age. He spoke about His *Father's* business, which implied His own sonship. There are two thoughts as to Him here; the life, and the light consequent upon it; and then the voice proclaiming His sonship and how He afforded pleasure to the Father, whose infinite delight in Him was made known.
@Matthew 4 contemplates the far-reaching testimony of our Lord. "And Jesus went round the whole of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people" (verse 23). We have a summary of His service there, preceding, though doubtless going beyond, as to date, what we have in chapter 5. It is to bring out the effect of the light shining from Him, the light of life. That lays the basis for chapter 5, which is *legislative*, as we said this morning. The disciples came up to Him as on the mountain. "Great crowds followed him in chapter 4:25, but in chapter 5 His disciples came to Him; that is the principle of discipleship; it was there actively. In chapter 5, the Lord says, "But *I* say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do
{19}
good to those who hate you, and pray for those who insult you and persecute you, that ye may be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens; for he makes his sun rise on evil and good, and sends rain on just and unjust. For if ye should love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same? And if ye should salute your brethren only, what do ye extraordinary? Do not also the Gentiles the same? Be *ye* therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" (verses 44-48). The Lord is bringing out the character of the kingdom in speaking of the kind of persons who are of it; you might say who are "it". They reflect their heavenly Father. As He says, "Sons of your Father who is in the heavens". Substantial quality is what is stressed in the disciples as reflecting their Father, but all learnt in what Jesus was as coming in and going out among them.
H.H. The Lord comes down in chapter 8 with His disciples having that instruction in mind.
J.T. Chapter 8 brings out a further thought as to discipleship, which is stressed in this gospel. We learn in verse 23 that He went on board ship, and *His disciples followed Him*. He is perfecting the disciples in this chapter. "A scribe came up and said to him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou mayest go. And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven roosting-places; but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head. But another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go away and bury my father. But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead. And he went on board ship and his disciples followed him" (verses 19-23). Following Him is of greater importance than any natural claim. The disciple is to understand that he is not offered anything at all to gratify the flesh; "the Son of man has not where he may lay his head". These are all important facts as to our inquiry at this time. What is before us now is what marks households
{20}
in this gospel, and leading up to the appointment and naming of the apostles.
Chapter 10 says, "Having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, so that they should cast them out, and heal every disease and every bodily weakness". The disciples received power from Him. The second verse says, "Now the names of the twelve apostles are these". It would look as though they were already apostles before they are named. It would show that names are attached to us according to what we are. We do well to take note of what is said about discipleship, and how the quality here is seen in their moving as He moved.
W.J.C. In chapter 5 we read of the disciples coming to Him, and now in chapter 8 they followed Him. Would the following be the moral result of having come to Him?
J.T. I should say that. They were distinguished from the crowd, as you will observe at the end of chapter 4. "Great crowds followed him ... But seeing the crowds, he went up". He withdraws from the crowds to the mountain, and there His disciples came to Him. They are in keeping with His movements and are ready for instruction. "Having opened his mouth, he taught them". In chapter 8 He is challenging them in following Him, pointing out that there is nothing for the flesh in such a course. Nevertheless, He went on board ship and His disciples followed Him. Presently they are tested again, because "the water became very agitated on the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves; but *he* slept". They are further tested.
H.H. Do you mean that in coming to the Lord we are committed to discipleship?
J.T. I think so. Discipleship is coming to Him. They tax themselves to do so, for they have to go up to the mountain. It means elevation, and makes a demand on our strength. In chapter 11:28, He says,
{21}
"Come to me". He is urging us to do so, because of certain advantages. True discipleship is marked off by movements that are regulated by His, whatever the consequences. What is in mind is to call attention to the households of the servants; all of course, but the servants particularly. In @Matthew 8:14,15, He observed what was in Peter's house. He saw "his mother-in-law laid down and in a fever".
H.B. Would you say why this condition calls for a personal touch from the Lord? On a previous occasion He seems to heal at a distance.
J.T. The personal touch is always to leave an impression. He laid His hands on the little children, meaning He committed Himself to them. The impression was there potentially, but the touch is more. The touch means the impartation of sensation from one to another. It is intended to affect later service.
J.H-t.Jr. It says, "He touched her hand". Is there discrimination in that? He touched her in view of service. It says, "She arose and served him".
J.T. The hand symbolises the power of service. That is what is meant. He intended her to serve as healed; whereas she was laid down in a fever. In this state you could expect nothing from her in the way of service; she needed to be served. It alludes to the servant's house -- that He should have one there ready to serve, serving because the Lord had touched her hand and the fever left her. Luke goes further and says, "And standing over her, he rebuked the fever" (@Luke 4:39). That would be to impress her with Himself as having authority over her; in Matthew it is simply that He touched her hand. Verse 14 says, "And when Jesus had come to Peter's house"; it would seem to bring out that whatever brought Him there, He noticed the condition in the house. That is the idea, I think. The servant is to see that the Lord takes account of what is in his house and deals with it.
{22}
W.J.C. Does the Lord's touch here as in other places imply impartation of something of Himself to the person?
J.T. That is the thought. It is a sensation anyway. It brings out what is in Him. The woman in @Luke 8 touched Him; touched the hem of His garment and drew out healing virtue. Here the touch is from His side. It characterises the kingdom in Matthew. He touched her so that the fever left her.
J.T.Jr. Is there a connection between the first part of chapter 8, the leper coming to Him, and Peter's house? The leper comes evidently of himself. Would there be a link with the leper, in the servant recognising what he is in the flesh?
J.T. Well, quite so. "And when he had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. And behold, a leper came up to him and did him homage, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou art able to cleanse me. And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed" (@Matthew 8:1-3). It does not say it left him; he was cleansed. The man had a sense of uncleanness, and it was a question whether the Lord's disposition was toward him. He says, "Lord, if thou wilt, thou art able to cleanse me. And he stretched out his hand". He does more than He does for the woman in the house. He stretched out His hand and touched him.
H.H. How would you apply the fever? Is it activities out of proper focus?
J.T. I think whatever causes the fever comes into this matter. What would occasion this malady? She is said to be Peter's mother-in-law -- the house was Peter's. Our attention is called to irregular conditions in the household. The word says, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife" (@Genesis 2:24). Here we have the mother-in-law adversely affecting the house; irregular conditions in the household occasioning such things.
{23}
S.J.H. Is there something in the fact that He sees this? In Luke they called the Lord's attention to it.
J.T. Yes, I think Peter is in mind in Luke, in regard of the miracle in his house. He is not called Peter in Luke until chapter 5, when he says to the Lord, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man". Up to that he is called Simon only. Luke helps us in showing that Peter had not been making headway. There is no change of name until he makes his confession of being a sinful man. In @Luke 4:38,39, we read that "rising up out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon. But Simon's mother-in-law was suffering under a bad fever; and they asked him for her. And standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her; and forthwith standing up she served them". I think Peter's responsibility enters into this matter, especially as Luke gives it. He had not been making headway; he had opportunity to do it, but his name not being changed indicates lack of advance. The Lord comes into his house out of the synagogue where there had been another difficulty; that is, the unclean spirit. In Luke the Lord comes from dealing with the religious position to the household position, and apparently Peter was not affected even then. It is in the fishing scene in chapter 5 that he is affected, and the name Peter added to him. Here we have the name, but Matthew does not appear to make much of this. The Lord observed the condition in Peter's house, and asserts His supremacy. In Luke He does it by standing over her and rebuking the fever.
S.J.H. How, as the Lord is brought into the home, are these matters met by Him?
J.T. If the head of the house in a general way is right, the Lord may take account of things that he may not have noticed, but the Lord does things for us without hesitation. If He has to rebuke a thing, that would mean there had been delinquency on the part of the head of the house. *He* should have done the rebuking.
{24}
A.B. In chapter 4 the Lord says to Peter and Andrew, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men".
J.T. As Matthew presents Peter, his account is more favourable; not so much dealing with Peter's condition. In chapter 10:2 He says, "First, Simon, who was called Peter". He supports Peter as the leading apostle, and the Lord in calling him puts no responsibility for his qualification on another. He said, "I will make you fishers of men". The Lord undertakes to do whatever was needed to be done with them, and in going into his house the same principle applies. Peter was there, the first apostle, and the Lord Himself undertakes to see that he was really first. The Lord considers for His servant. He would support a man in accordance with what he is to be, and make him what He intended he should be; make him what is needed. That is the point of view in Matthew. The Lord is doing the thing Himself, and His great servant is not to be discredited. The condition of his house is not right. The Lord would say, I will see to that -- His servants must not be discredited.
J.W.D. Peter speaks of "the grace of life" (@1 Peter 3:7). Would the touch not impress him with the oneness needed in the house?
J.T. This touch would bring the mother-in-law into the grace that belonged to the household, because she "served him". Peter dealing with the husband and wife says, "as also fellow-heirs of the grace of life" (@1 Peter 3:7). It would be unsuitable to the servant to have anything else there. That is where light shines; life is light. "He that follows me ... shall have the light of life" (@John 8:12). The grace of life would be life in the christian household. This is a most touching act of the Lord, because it was to make Peter's house what it ought to be as the house of a great servant.
E.P. Do you think we suffer because things are not dealt with and met in this way?
{25}
J.T. Very much. We all feel it. Fathers and mothers who have brought up children would recognise the great disadvantage, where there is a condition of this kind in the house. The Lord feels it more than any, and in Peter's house He deals with it Himself, without anyone asking Him to do it, according to Matthew's account.
A.E.H. What do you have in mind in speaking of this irregularity?
J.T. There is nothing in the marriage contract to provide for the mother-in-law. The word at the beginning was (this comes down the ages) as Eve was brought to Adam, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh" (@Genesis 2:24). Moses in writing the book of Genesis put that in, the Spirit directing him. It seems that he got on wonderfully well with his father-in-law, Jethro. When Jethro comes to him in the wilderness there were the happiest relations between him and Moses, but there was a very humbling experience about the circumcision, as Moses was leaving Midian. Evidently Zipporah did not want it. She did not want to go the whole way. This is very often the case with wives. If the husband is spiritual, he is too much so in the wife's eyes. The Lord sought to slay Moses because of this matter, requiring that he should circumcise the children (@Exodus 4:24). It was Moses¬ desire, but Zipporah did not want it. "A bloody husband indeed art thou to me!" she said, as if in complaint.
H.H. The gospel has the assembly in view. Taking care of the household is important, in view of the testimony in the assembly.
J.T. Natural ties must not be allowed to influence the position. They would thus discredit the spiritual.
E.P. Paul refers to Cephas leading about a sister as wife (@1 Corinthians 9:5). It would seem he had kept free, evidently not hampered by his wife in his service.
{26}
J.T. He took her around in his service; he did not leave her at home. Paul says, "Have we not a right to take round a sister as wife, as also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?" It was not too much for him to take a wife in his journeys. No doubt, he would always remember that the Lord touched his mother-in-law, and as a result she served. The important thing is the Lord's touch in our houses. Peter speaks of the "grace of life", heirs together of it, that "prayers be not hindered" (@1 Peter 3:7).
J.W.D. Complications would cease as Peter's wife's mother served.
J.T. Yes. Luke says, "She served them", including the Lord.
J.T.Jr. In @Matthew 7 we have an allusion to the house of a prudent man. It was built on a rock. Would that not help in regard to this matter, what is at the bottom?
J.T. Just so, the *foundation* of the house. @Genesis 2 enters into this. "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh." Peter speaks of husband and wife as "heirs together of the grace of life", urging that prayer should not be hindered. We cannot serve without prayer. Peter would be supported by his wife as he led her about.
S.P. Better household conditions are seen in Acts in the three households that Peter had to do with particularly. In chapter 9 the household of Dorcas; in chapter 10 he lodged with a certain Simon, a tanner. It was there that he went up to pray. Then Cornelius and his household were waiting for him -- affording further liberty for service.
J.T. That is very interesting and instructive; and we may add the house in which Aeneas was; there Peter tells him to rise up and make his own bed.
W.J.C. What do you understand by the husband dwelling with the wife "according to knowledge"?
{27}
J.T. That is according to the knowledge that God affords as to that relation. "Fellow-heirs of the grace of life" is a beautiful expression. It is grace shining in that house, not natural light but "grace". That is the first thought. In @Matthew 9 we have the house of the ruler Jairus in which his daughter was raised up. There are more households in this chapter. There is that in which the two blind men had their eyes opened. The first is this house in Capernaum in @Matthew 9:1. It is to be noted it is in "his own city". Mark says "he was at the house" -- at home (@Mark 2:1-4). I mention Mark to bring out that it evidently was where the Lord dwelt. He was *at home* in contrast to being on a journey (see J.N.D.¬s note to word "house"). There was liberty there for any who were evangelical or interested in the souls of men. They even go up to the roof and dig through, and the Lord makes no complaint. It would bring out how a spiritual household is open and affords liberty to those who are interested in an evangelical way. He had been away at a distance; the sea denotes distance and separation. The Lord had been away in His service; He was universal in this. Now He has come home by ship, but He is not seeking repose or a quiet time. He is serving yet, as actively, in His own house, as He was elsewhere.
W.G.T. He would prefer to be in a home rather than a synagogue.
J.T. Yes, and if these four men came to Peter's house while his mother-in-law was ill and they took the liberty they did in the house in which the Lord was, no doubt there would be an objection. They opened up the roof and there is no complaint at all where the Lord was. There is great liberty there for persons engaged in His service.
H.H. You would ask a brother's permission before arranging a meeting in his house.
{28}
J.T. Certainly I would. The allusion to persons who have assemblies in their houses, would bear on this. If I open my house for the brethren to meet in it, they have a certain right of way.
W.L. Would this suggest that the servant has as much liberty and power in his home surroundings as when he is away?
J.T. I think so. According to Mark's record there is a report that He was at the house, and then "straightway many were gathered together"; people took advantage of the fact He was there. "So that there was no longer any room, not even at the door; and he spoke the word to them" (@Mark 2:2). He is not questioning the liberty taken, crowding into His doors. He carries on the service, and then we have, "And there come to him men bringing a paralytic, borne by four; and, not being able to get near to him on account of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having dug it up, they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay". It is a big operation; the couch a large affair, and the hole in the roof, but there is no complaint. The Lord meets the action with grace, "Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins are forgiven thee" (verse 5). He includes him in the family of God at once. That is wonderful grace. He calls the person, who might be an intruder, a child; connecting him with the family of faith.
J.T.Jr. Paul in his house in @Acts 28:30 was in accord with this. "And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging, and received all who came to him, preaching the kingdom of God.
J.T. I had thought of that. It is a reflection of this, "receiving" all that came to him. I suppose the word receiving there would mean more than a polite word at the door. He received them; uninvited persons coming to your house, especially if you are fatigued, are not always acceptable. The Lord had been on a
{29}
journey, and under these circumstances we would say, You ought to have let me know you were coming. There is no question about it in the Lord's case.
J.T.Jr. The position in Rome -- Paul and his open house -- would be in contrast to what is in that city today at the Vatican.
J.T. You would not get much of a reception there. It is very suggestive. How great a difference between the house the Lord was in, and the house at Rome *now*! The occupant is called Peter's successor!
A.H.P. Apollos being taken by Priscilla and Aquila and taught the way of God more exactly, would that correspond with the service of the Lord here?
J.T. Yes. They "took him to them" (@Acts 18:26).
H.H. Would you take forgiveness here to include what is governmental?
J.T. It is governmental. There was some cause for the palsy, and the Lord goes to the root of it in saying, "Child, thy sins are forgiven thee". That is the moral side of the matter, showing that there was cause for the state this man was in. The Lord comes in in power and grace calling him, not Sinner, but Child. If the paralytic did not have a conscience about his sins he should have, for he needed forgiveness. The Lord knew there was something wrong. This is one of the things that an apostle would have to learn; how to be in his own house, and in dealing with paralytics to know what to say to them. He would recall how the Lord spoke about the moral question, first, before the physical. James says, for instance, and no doubt he learnt from these meetings with the Lord, "Is any sick among you? let him call to him the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he be one who has committed sins, it shall be forgiven him" (@James 5:14,15).
{30}
W.L. Can we look for alleviation of what is governmental?
J.T. They are not always final, some of them may be. John says, "If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death. There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request" (@1 John 5:16). Something has happened, and it is going on to death. John says, I do not say of that that he should make a request. We should be able to discern whether to pray or not.
S.J.H. "Go to thy house." What impressions he would take back!
J.T. He would say to his wife and children, I have been in a wonderful house; the owner of that house is the Lord Jesus. He did not mind when they took up the roof. The man's bed would be seen first, a very unsightly thing to push into the house of another person. The Lord Jesus made no complaint about that; He recognised the man as in the family at once. He sees the faith of the four, and recognises this beautiful feature in the place; general feeling of sympathy is suggested. He saw *their* faith.
W.J.C. Do you think there was some exercise of soul on the part of the paralytic to be thus brought, so the Lord could also see he had the faith!
J.T. The four had faith. The Lord, I think, is raising the moral question with the man. He refers immediately to his sins, that they were forgiven.
J.W.D. There must be a very happy affinity between the household and the saints, to meet the requirements of @James 5:14,15.
J.T. James says to the sick man, You should send for them. They are available, and they should be.
T.S. We must be prepared to face any exposure that might be necessary in sending for the elders?
J.T. Yes. It is the moral side. That is always important. With so-called faith-healers, it is a question
{31}
if they ever raise a moral issue. The moral issue is the first thing to raise in these actions. The Lord deals with that at once in this man's case.
S.P. The man would be feeling the position he was in.
J.T. Clearly: "Is any sick among you?" James tells the sick man what he should do. The epistles all carry that sort of instruction for us. James is stressing the importance of the assembly, and what the elders were. They are to pray for the sick and to anoint him with oil. That is important as a typical suggestion; it means that if this man is to be raised up he is to be henceforth for the testimony. Otherwise, it is better that he should not be raised up. "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep" (@1 Corinthians 11:30). This is a merciful provision that James brings in; "and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he be one who has committed sins, it shall be forgiven him". It is the prayer of faith that heals the sick. Faith brings God in; and the Lord *sees* their faith. There would be nothing in all this great movement if the Lord did not see something. He knew things divinely, but then there is what He *sees*. Peter says to Him in John 21:17, "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee". That word *know* is subjective in the first two cases, implying that Peter says to the Lord, You know divinely that I love you. That is not enough, and the Lord wishes to see something in us to draw out His love. And so Peter uses another word which is objective. "Thou knowest that I love thee", implying that the Lord could see this in him. That is the point here. The Lord saw their faith. There is no value in bringing up the question of confidence unless there is something to see. If I have created a feeling of lack of confidence among my brethren, I must not claim that they should
{32}
have confidence; there should be something about me to show that I deserve their confidence.
J.W.D. Would that include something in the paralytic, too? Faith must be evident, not only by believing in Christ, but by something discernible in the one who has it.
J.T. That is so generally, as illustrated in the lame man of Lystra (@Acts 14:8); but it does not seem so here. The pronoun *their* refers to the four that carried him. "Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic". The faith is in the four, and the Lord now is dealing with the man himself on moral lines. He says, "thy sins,,.
D.G. @Matthew 17:20,21 helps. The disciples ask Jesus why they could not cast the demon out of the boy, and He says to them, "Because of your unbelief; for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Be transported hence there, and it shall transport itself; and nothing shall be impossible to you. But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting".
J.T. It seems that Mark gives a clearer view of that instance than Matthew, though Matthew calls him a lunatic. In Mark, the father of the child has a greater place. He says to the Lord, "If thou couldst do anything ... help us". In His answer the Lord implies, Do not apply *if* to Me, apply it to yourself; "*If* thou couldst believe". The basis of all these matters must lie in faith, whether in the person to be helped, or persons acting for him. The boy had no faith as far as the scripture shows, it was a question of the father of the boy. The father says to the Lord, "I believe, help mine unbelief" (@Mark 9:24). The Lord immediately helped him, and the demon was cast out. In @Matthew 9 the Lord honours the four who had faith. It is clear, however, that there was something in the man, because the Lord calls him ' child ', as we have seen.
{33}
E.P. As to the local position suggested in Capernaum, is there a suggestion in the letters to the assemblies, of the need to recognise the Lord's proprietary rights in coming "to his own city"? The city and the house are claimed by Him.
J.T. The local position is in mind; it is remarkable it should be so. He left Nazareth and went to Capernaum and *dwelt* there. So Capernaum had a great opportunity; great light shone there, and He says later, "*Thou*, Capernaum, who hast been raised up to heaven, shall be brought down even to hades. For if the works of power which have taken place in thee, had taken place in Sodom, it had remained until this day" (@Matthew 11:23). Localities where the saints of God are, or have been, are more responsible.
J.W. What is in your mind in regard to the anointing with oil?
J.T. Anointing is in view of testimony. You never get it save in relation to the service of the testimony. We are anointed for the testimony (see @Mark 6:13). Christ was anointed here on earth. God anointed Jesus of Nazareth, who went about doing good (@Acts 10:38). That is the idea of testimony. If a man is to be raised up he is to continue in the meeting and be useful in it, otherwise he might as well die.
H.B. In @Leviticus 14, the cleansed leper is anointed on the ear, the thumb and great toe.
J.T. Yes. He is made fit for the testimony.
H.H. The thought of the oil is priestly. It is not an actual bottle of oil. We ought to have a moral idea in mind. In praying for a person we ought to be priestly. We should know what we are praying about. A person might be under the influence of some evil if he were suffering under the government of God.
J.T. The word *oil* in @James 5 should, I believe, be taken up in a spiritual way. It alludes to the Spirit. The man raised up is to be in spiritual power from henceforth.
{34}
As regards our subject, household conditions bear on the service. Matthew makes a great deal of what is done in houses. Chapter 9:23 says, "And when Jesus was come to the house of the ruler, and saw the flute-players and the crowd making a tumult, he said, Withdraw, for the damsel is not dead, but sleeps. And they derided him. But when the crowd had been put out, he went in and took her hand; and the damsel rose up. And the fame of it went out into all that land". Here we see how the house is to be cleansed, or cleared of elements that would interfere with spiritual power. He said, Withdraw. And when the crowd had been put out the damsel was raised up; spiritual power became effective. That is another thing, flute-players and that sort of thing are inimical to all spiritual activities in a household. Matthew mentions flute-players and the crowd making a tumult. Jairus is a man to be respected, but he did not see the incongruity in having all this in his house. Mark and Luke tell us that the Lord suffered no one in the house, but Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the child.
H.B. The element of criticism runs along with this -- they are deriding the Lord.
J.T. It is what goes with looseness. The flesh regards flute-playing and people weeping in such circumstances as desirable and suitable, but those who carry on like that are ever ready to deride the Lord. He is not respected. This condition might be acceptable to the natural mind, but when tested out is not subject to Christ.
J.W.D. If we allow flute-players and other such things in our houses our local meetings will be affected.
J.T. All this bears on chapter 10 -- an important one. The passage selected suggests the idea of the Lord coming in and going out. We are to learn through what happened while He was there. "Having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, so that they should cast them out,
{35}
and heal every disease and every bodily weakness." Then the names of the apostles are given, and following that we are told that "These twelve Jesus sent out when he had charged them, saying, Go not off into the way of the nations, and into a city of Samaritans enter ye not; but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel". This shows that the early part of Matthew is distinctive as confining the ministry to the Jews, the house of Israel, and brings out another lesson in our service. Paul was restricted, and was directed to go to certain places. It was so as to Macedonia in @Acts 16.
H.H. Some of the twelve apostles were not very prominent.
J.T. We get all their names here and in the heavenly city, in the foundation of the wall of the heavenly city; so that they must all have had their part in the service of laying the foundation. The city has twelve foundations and the names of all are seen there.
H.H. No doubt they had their work and did it well. The cutting and polishing of the stones to garnish the Holy City would suggest much in the way of suffering.
W.J.C. The Lord was not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. How would the Syrophenician woman get blessing, if not through Him as the Sent One?
J.T. Well it was a question of her taking her right place as a dog of the gentiles; then she got the blessing. She called Christ the Son of David, but she had no claim on Him whatever under that designation. What the Lord said was to adjust her position; as Son of David He was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As Saviour of the world He is for all of us.
W.J.C. She owned Him as Lord, and she got the blessing.
J.T. She took her true place; she says, "Even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters".
{36}
J.W.D. You spoke about Paul being restricted in his service; he was forbidden to go to a certain place. Would that be through circumstances now; perhaps through our employment?
J.T. There are limitations. I only alluded to it as showing that we have to observe limitations today. Suppose a believer says, I want to be a missionary in China, or Africa. Is the Lord calling you there? Are there no limitations? I am only alluding to it in that way. We have to recognise limitations in our service in general. The apostles according to @Matthew 28 were sent to baptise all the nations; the Lord as risen sends them out to all nations. In Luke repentance and remission of sins were to be preached to all the nations. That is general, but then each servant has to ask the Lord for guidance, as to where *he* is to serve. I must get to the Lord as to the work I am to do. Each has his own work (@Mark 13:34).
W.L. So there is no such thing as a free lance.
T.H. Why were the names introduced here in detail?
J.T. They are first called "twelve disciples" and as such, Christ "gave them power over unclean spirits, so that they should cast them out, and heal every disease and every bodily weakness". As in possession of that power they are qualified and called "twelve apostles"; then they are named.
In @Mark 3, the Lord "goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would, and they went to him". He selects twelve "that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach"; meaning that they are on the elevated ground of companionship with Him. In Matthew they are given the power so as to be potentially equal to the position in which He sets them, and their names are given. It brings out that one is what he is, and his name conveys that.
{37}
CHRIST ASSEMBLING WITH HIS OWN (3)
@Matthew 12:46-50; @Matthew 13:36-50
J.T. Hitherto we have been largely engaged with authority in Christ; the kingdom of the heavens up to chapter 10. Chapter 11:1 says, "And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities". Evidently a complete course was finished, that is, authoritative instruction; then it is said of the Lord, that "he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities", as if to exemplify in Himself the instruction He had been imparting to them. Chapter 11 brings out this feature in Christ; that He is a model for us, and at the end of this chapter He says, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls". He is the model for us. He instructs us in authority, but He exemplifies the instruction.
Chapter 11 indicates the break between Him and the Jews. He is rejected; His ministry is rejected; His signs are rejected; so that we are told in verse 20, "Then began he to reproach the cities in which most of his works of power had taken place, because they had not repented". At such a time He turns to His Father, and says, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes" (verse 25). The things He had been teaching had been revealed to babes, in spite of the rejection by the Jews; so that, we have a complete break, and a new order of things introduced; a new beginning, leading to the assembly and christianity. In chapter 10:5, He had said that they were not to go in the way of the gentiles; "These twelve Jesus sent out when he had charged them, saying, Go not off into the way of the nations, and into a city of Samaritans enter ye not". Now from chapter 12 onwards the universal gospel is in mind, as we shall see,
{38}
and what is to be noticed particularly is the circle of the brethren, introduced in the first passage read, as the basis for what follows.
It is characteristic of what we are saying, the Lord Jesus coming in and going out among the disciples. This passage indicates that He had been saying things in an inner circle; for although He was speaking to the crowds, it is said that "his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him". They were outside and He was inside, nor does He bring them in; He rather remains where He was in the midst of those to be known henceforth as His disciples, and His true brethren. He says, "Whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother". Our consideration at this time will be of brethren from Matthew's point of view, and the teaching of chapter 13 based on it; the truth of the assembly brought out. The brethren are introduced into the secrets of His parabolic ministry, which hides the truth from certain who had been under it; they are not to understand; as to them the ministry is judicial in character. There are those who do understand; they are instructed in the *house*. "Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field". We get the mystery of the kingdom opened up to us in the house; we are distinctly in an inside position in this section, leading up to the assembly.
In this section of the gospel the assembly is in view, but presented in a parabolic way among the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. Only those who are initiated understand parabolic ministry; others are excluded *judicially* (verses 10-15).
H.H. Previously He had been working miracles, but now He is teaching by parables.
J.T. Yes, we are entering on the parables; there are seven of them in chapter 13, but it is important to
{39}
get the position of the brethren indicated as the basis of the instruction; they belong to the inner circle. Mark's account makes it a circle; "And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren" (@Mark 3:34).
J.T.Jr. The circle would involve the recognition of the Spirit. In chapter 12, the Holy Spirit is referred to as being the divine Person that is here sinned against (verses. 31,32). The recognition of Him would make way for the inner circle.
J.T. That is right. The Spirit was already operating in Christ. He says, "But if *I* by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you" (@Matthew 12:28). The circle of the brethren makes way for the Spirit, as the Acts will show; they received the Holy Spirit from Christ as ascended. In a way nothing is more important in relation to our subject than the position of the brethren as seen here in Matthew. All the evangelists speak of the brethren; Matthew, Mark and Luke place the subject on a moral basis, that is, "whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother". @Mark 3: 35 says, "whosoever shall do the will of God". @Luke 11:28 says, "blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it". @John 20:17 shows that the idea of brethren is on the basis of counsel; "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".
H.H. Would the Lord's appeal in @Matthew 11:28 help us to come into this inner circle? "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and *I* will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls; for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light".
J.T. Well, it does clearly; it comes in after the Lord's word to His Father, saying "All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows
{40}
the Son but the Father, nor does anyone know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal him". For this revelation we need to be free from burden. "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and *I* will give you rest." Present conditions in the world certainly are burdensome; they tax us very much, and are likely to hinder us in entering into this great thought of revelation. The Lord would bring us into rest; it is as we take His yoke upon us and learn from Him. He says, "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light". It is relief from burdens arising from conditions here, so that one should enter into the revelation.
J.H-t. The opening words of chapter 13 say, "And that same day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea". He dissociates Himself from Israel?
J.T. Yes, He leaves one house, and verse 36 shows Him entering another, "Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house". In this house He opens up the ministry of what He had been giving in the parables. The idea of ' house ' in Matthew is very instructive; it fits in generally with the subject before us where the Lord Jesus came in and went out.
E.P. Chapter 12:43,44 says "But when the unclean spirit has gone out of the man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and does not find it. Then he says, I will return to my house whence I came out". Do you think that stands in contrast to coming to the Lord and finding rest, and being taught as in chapter 13?
J.T. Yes, they did not find rest. The world does not afford any rest. The unclean spirit goes back to the house whence he came out, "and having come, he finds it unoccupied, swept, and adorned". That is very much like christendom. The passage alludes to the unregenerate Jewish condition in the last days.
E.P. The Lord makes everything clear and distinct; in @Matthew 5 the mountain position is in contrast to
{41}
the plain, and here in chapter 12, His brethren are seen in contrast to all else.
J.T. Matthew draws sharp contrasts. There is a severity in the way in which he presents the truth dealing with persons. In ministering the truth Luke is much more gracious; which is right in its place. The gospel is in mind in Luke, but Matthew has the kingdom and the assembly in mind, and there must be no compromise in that relation. His severity is mainly against the Jewish system.
H.H. We are to find rest for our souls.
J.T. It is not yet rest of body. Peter enlarges on this matter of *souls*. He says, "Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls" (@1 Peter 1:9). The subject runs through Peter's first epistle as over against body salvation, and relief. It is the rest of soul that is needed.
Chapter 11 comes in very instructively as following a finished course of instruction. The Lord finishes one course at the end of chapter 10, bringing out the importance of a righteous man, and a drink of cold water given in the name of a disciple. He finishes that instruction, and then John comes into view as having sent a message to Him, and the Lord says to the crowds in verse 7, "What went ye out into the wilderness to see?" He is challenging us as to what we went out for. Christendom has largely come, either from judaism, or heathendom. Well, why have we come out? Why did our forefathers leave heathendom? He is challenging us as to the position we take up, and He pursues that instruction until the end of verse 19, saying, "wisdom has been justified by her children". The children of wisdom come into view in chapter 11, and they justify wisdom in what they do. We must keep our eyes on the children of wisdom; we see wisdom exemplified in them. The Lord brings Himself into the position as an example at the end of the chapter. It is all most instructive, especially because it is a critical period. The Jews had
{42}
rejected Him and He was about to introduce another order of things. All the instruction of chapter 11 is to prepare us for a new order of things, and He is Himself the model of it.
J.P. Would there be a link with the latter part of @Psalm 132? "For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his dwelling."
J.T. Well, Zion is coming into view now. It is a question of sovereign selection and Christ addresses the Father as universal Lord, and praises Him because He had selected the babes to reveal these things to them. Then the quality of things, comparative qualities, comes out in chapter 12; we have come to *greater* things.
R.A. The queen of the south came to hear the wisdom of Solomon.
J.T. Yes. She is one whom the Lord mentions in order to condemn the Jews in rejecting Him. The queen of the south and the men of Nineveh in the judgment will stand up against the generation to whom Christ testified, and shall condemn it. So that we may say we are in the presence of the judgment seat of God in these chapters. No doubt each of us in his place will be called upon to witness in the day of judgment. It will be a wonderful time, the judgment day, when those who reject the truth and those who accept it are there; the latter to testify against the former.
W.J.C. The only ones whom the Lord recognised as His brethren are those who do the will of His Father who is in the heavens. They have learned from Him to do that will.
J.T. That comes out at the end of chapter 12, which is marked by comparison in greatness, "behold, more than Jonas is here ... and behold, more than Solomon is here" (verses 41,42). The most vicious evil is contemplated. In verse 24 the Lord Himself is charged with acting in the power of Beelzebub. So that He brings up this matter of the sin against the Holy
{43}
Spirit; it is very little understood, but it comes into this chapter opportunely, because it is not only a question of what Christ is doing personally, but the Spirit by which He is carrying on God's service of grace.
E.P. Is that why the Lord says, "more than Jonas is here" ... "more than Solomon is here"? He does not say "a greater" than Solomon.
J.T. Yes. It is not so much that *He* was greater, but *what* was greater, involving the Spirit as well, for He was acting in the power of the Spirit. The kingdom is implied. The greatest of all testimonies was operative.
A.M. Those that are linked with Him as taking His yoke upon them develop in moral qualities, in the sphere of His brethren.
J.T. It is those who *come* to Him. He relieves you of your burden, but gives you His yoke, which I would assume to be included in what He was as a Man before His Father; that yoke is easy and that burden is light. It is a delightful burden, a delightful yoke. It is not a yoke of bondage, and hence in the beginning of chapter 12 we have the incident of the Lord going through the cornfields; the Lord sets for us an example of how to be in liberty, for we cannot reach the idea of brethren unless we are in liberty; no hard legal requirements expressed by the Pharisees. "At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears and to eat. But the Pharisees, seeing it, said to him, Behold, thy disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on sabbath" (@Matthew 12:1,2). They did not say anything about His going through the cornfields, but what He did led the disciples to pluck the corn. He did not pluck the corn, but they did. They went beyond what He did. It is to convey the idea of liberty; not that they would go beyond what the Lord *would* do, but He indicates the way of liberty and they take it. They did not ask Him if they should pluck the corn and eat it.
{44}
A.E.H. Would you say that is a suggestion in connection with service in the assembly?
J.T. In assembly young brethren very often hold back and fail to take part until the older ones have done so; in prayer meetings too. In a certain sense it is right, but if it is carried beyond that sense it is legal and hinders, because the priests are always at liberty. It is a question of sonship, sons are free. "Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free" (@Matthew 17:26). Not any particular son but *the sons*.
A.M. Things are to be done in the same spirit in which Christ would do them -- the spirit of Christ.
E.P. Referring to the Lord coming in and going out amongst them, would not the disciples get the gain of the new position by the example the Lord gave in going into the cornfields?
J.T. They would see the Lord indicating the way. "At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the cornfields"; the passage does not say, He and the disciples. They went further, that is exactly what He had in mind. That is the liberty of christianity. It is the liberty in which Christ has set us free. He "has set us free in freedom" (@Galatians 5:1).
J.S.T. Does His yoke in chapter 11, and the will of the Father in the end of chapter 12, link on with this liberty?
J.T. Yes. This paragraph ending at verse 8 is to inculcate spiritual liberty; to familiarise us with it. The Lord *indicates* the way, but He does not say, You must pluck the corn. That is what He had in mind, and He defends them as having done it. They were doing it on their own initiative, as a result of the lead given by the Lord. He selected the sabbath for it. They did more; they plucked the corn and ate it, and He justified their action.
W.L. Does the attitude of the Pharisees here obtain today in the religious systems? They do not induce spiritual liberty.
{45}
J.T. They do not. A man-made religious system cannot contain true liberty. This is found in the assembly, where the Spirit of God is. The Lord must have scope, but He has none in a mere religious system. He had scope here and used it: "At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the cornfields".
A.B. "Wisdom has been justified by her children" (@Matthew 11:19).
J.T. That is the point; the disciples here are her children.
A.B. "But I say unto you, that there is here what is greater than the temple" (chapter 12:6); this would be in relation to the light that had sprung up.
J.T. Quite so; the Lord is bringing out the greatness of the new position and that the children of wisdom were in it; not only wisdom itself being there in Him, but her children are now present and they justify wisdom. That is, wisdom's children justified it, because it afforded them something to eat. If the legalist has his way they will die of hunger rather than they should eat on the sabbath. And he will not allow a man to be healed on the sabbath.
J.S.T. The Lord says, "Ye would not have condemned the guiltless" (chapter 12:7).
J.T. Quite so; the disciples were guiltless.
W.G.T. He refers to David who introduced something additional in the service of God.
J.T. He said to them, "Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him?" (chapter 12:3). The disciples were *hungry*; you could die of hunger as far as the legalists are concerned. Legality will not help; they will see to legal principles rather than satisfy the hunger of the children of wisdom. He says, "Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him?" He is virtually saying, If David were here he would do the same thing; "he entered into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which it was not lawful for him
{46}
to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only? Or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?" (chapter 12:4,5). He is bringing forward Old Testament examples to show that what the disciples were doing was right, and that brings out how the Old Testament is to be used. It is not to be used in a legal way to bind people hands and feet, and make them die of hunger. The *spirit* of the Old Testament is liberty. David exemplified it.
E.P. It is like "the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens" (@2 Corinthians 3:6). Do you think it is suggested that God was pleased with David entering into His house? The Lord says, "How he entered into the house of God, and ate the shewbread".
J.T. The Lord justifies it here. According to Mark He says, "Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered, *he* and those with him, how he entered into the house of God, in the section of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him?" (@Mark 2:25,26). The Lord says, "in the section of Abiathar the high priest", showing that David moved in the full light of the high priest. Legalism is not priestly at all.
J.S.T. David was fleeing from Saul when he moved in this liberty.
J.T. That is exactly the position here: in the presence of murderers He is setting up the great service of the new order of things. So He says, "But I say unto you, that there is here what is greater than the temple" (chapter 12:6); that is, the temple in that literal sense. It is worth while to get clear as to these items, so as to see the significance of the word in the end of @Matthew 12. The Lord there says, "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?" What are the features of the family relation? It is a question of the will of God.
{47}
E.P. Could you bring these relationships through to the present moment? "My brother, and sister, and mother."
J.T. Yes; we have them all alluded to in the epistles, have we not? Even to the word *mother*: "the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother" (@Galatians 4:26). This teaching shows how christianity liberates; the assembly is marked by liberty, she comes down from God out of heaven; that is based on sonship. Here the Lord mentions three relationships, "my brother, and sister, and mother".
H.H. The man with the withered hand would be suffering from disability. You do not want that brought forward into the family circle. The Lord would deal with that, would He not?
J.T. The service requires full manhood in activity. The hands are symbolical of our doings. We need our members in exercise in accord with the liberty of sonship.
W.L. Are we not hindered, more than anything else, by what is religious, and by our natural relationships?
J.T. They are usually linked together in local matters. Natural inclination is so often supported by some legal suggestion. The natural relationships are seen as *outside* in the end of @Matthew 12: "his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him". Then one says to Him, "Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, seeking to speak to thee". Evidently some person in the crowd would bring forward the importance of the natural relationships. The Lord, of course, knew they were there, but this person would be one in sympathy with them; though in the crowd listening to Christ, he is evidently in sympathy with those outside.
J.S.T. Those outside wanted to be heard -- "seeking to speak to thee". They should be listening to Him!
{48}
J.T. Yes. What *He* is saying should be supreme. Those standing around are interested, and particularly His disciples, who are now replacing Israel. Thus Jesus "answering said to him that spoke to him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?" That particular man is singled out, a sort of *fifth column* man to discredit what is going on. He would divert the Lord from what He was engaged with, and yet he appeared to be a sympathetic person, but his aim is to divert the Lord. It is often found in assembly matters; a diversion from the real things is introduced. This tendency is to be refused.
W.G.T. In @John 7 His brethren were suggesting He should go up to Jerusalem to the feast; they did not believe on Him; they were not sympathetic with His ministry.
J.T. In @John 2 the Lord's mother said to the Lord, "They have no wine"; and He answers saying, "What have I to do with thee, woman? mine hour has not yet come". She says to the servants, "Whatever he may say to you, do". She is adjusted; and verse 12 says, "After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days". The brethren are coming into view again there, the natural relations of Christ, that is, the Jews; and the Lord is taking them on; this is on the ground of adjustment. Any Jew or Jewess can be taken on as adjusted; as submitting to the authority of Christ, but here in @Matthew 12 it is not that at all. Why do not they come inside? They are standing outside. They want the Lord to go out there, whereas He is inside, and *He* must determine everything. The position is distinctly marked in Matthew. This man would have the Lord go out, but He is not going out. This man would break up the whole spiritual position here; the real brethren would not have been mentioned if he had his way. We want to go on with what the Lord is doing; every word He utters is pure
{49}
gold, but this man did not mind this at all, he said, "Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, seeking to speak to thee". He implied that the Lord should stop speaking and listen to them. That man must be adjusted. The Lord "answering said to him that spoke to him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?" Could that man tell the Lord? No! he had no idea of brethren; he was on natural lines. There are some that call themselves *brethren*, who cannot define the idea of the word at all.
E.P. Do you think it is important that these things should be met when and where they arise? A diversion should be met at the moment it arises? Why should a reading meeting, or any of our meetings, be affected in this way? Do you not think it is important that these things should be met immediately?
J.T. The Lord spoke direct to this man. "He answering said to him that spoke to him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?" This man is in His mind; he would break up the meeting, for he is making as much of those outside as of those inside, and more.
W.G.T. Is the Lord's "stretching out his hand to his disciples" an act of power?
J.T. It shows how definitely they were in His mind. The Lord leaves the house, we are told in chapter 13:1. "And that same day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea". That is, He went out from the house of natural relationships. We have to leave that house in order to come into the house of spiritual relationships, and as leaving we get these parables. We are told in verses 34 and 35, "All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them, so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the world's foundation". In verse 36 there is *another* house. It is another incoming of
{50}
Christ, involving another outgoing of Christ, and what have we learnt in it? We have the idea of brethren in chapter 12, and now we are to learn something of the assembly before it is formally stated by name.
W.G.T. The inquiry of the disciples within the house is marked by intelligence.
J.T. Yes, the disciples are progressing. He had dismissed the crowds, and going into the house, the disciples came to Him saying, "Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field" (verse 36). They are now wanting to know. It is a fine opportunity for the Lord when you want to ask Him questions inside. They did not stand outside as His mother and brethren did; they came to Him and asked Him questions.
W.L. We should learn to distinguish between the outside and inside.
J.T. That is what I thought we might see here. In chapter 12 we have the inside and outside, and now we have definitely reached the house and the Lord in it; and the disciples coming in. They have liberty to do that, they came into the house and asked Him questions.
T.H. I was wondering if the idea of speaking with the Lord was His great objective here, culminating in the highest thought as suggested in the thought of Moses and Elias talking with Him.
J.T. In chapter 5, they went up on the mountain. They did not ask Him questions, He opened His mouth and began to *teach* them; and later He went on board ship and they *followed* Him (chapter 8:23). Chapter 13:36 tells us that they asked questions. It is most important to ask questions. The young people especially should ask the Lord about things: "for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things" (@2 Timothy 2:7). In our chapter the mysteries of the kingdom are in mind, and we must ask questions, because we shall not understand otherwise.
H.B. Why do they particularly ask in relation to the parable of the darnel of the field?
{51}
J.T. Well, they wanted it expounded, they want to understand it. "He that sows the good seed is the Son of man, and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil one; and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is the completion of the age, and the harvestmen are angels" (verses 37-39). The Lord explains it fully. It is the *public* position that He is explaining to us. He instructs them not to pull up the darnel, because in doing so, they would damage the wheat. We cannot adjust christendom, but we must walk righteously and soberly, as the apostle says, "But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (@2 Timothy 2:22). We cannot deal with the "tares", we have to leave them. It is important to see the general condition of christendom; the Lord does not ask His saints to correct that. The devil has sown the tares and it is beyond our power to deal with them, they have to stay there until the end of the age. Then they shall be cast into the furnace of fire (verse 42).
J.S.T. Would you link the tares with one being like an angel of light and the work he does an imitation? The sons of the kingdom would be like Christ.
J.T. Yes. It is not like the seed of the first parable. In the first parable the seed is the word of God, but the seed here that the Lord Jesus sows, is *persons*. That is, converted persons are set in the kingdom, and the tares are persons too, as the Lord says, "But the darnel are the sons of the evil one; and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil" (verses 38,39). So that we have to deal with persons in the public history of christendom, and we cannot overcome this sowing of the devil, the sowing of persons, they are just to be left. It is not an assembly matter; when we come to that side of the truth, fellowship, association, is involved; we deal with persons "inside" who are evil, as in Corinth they put them away or, as in our times, we
{52}
withdraw from them, but in this parable we have simply the public profession composed of wheat and tares -- individuals; fellowship is not contemplated.
W.L. I was wondering if verse 36 would enable us to be more on positive lines. His disciples came into the *house*.
J.T. Yes, that verse may be connected with the assembly, with what is within. This is not an assembly matter. It is not an ecclesiastical matter, this parable speaks of persons sown in a public sense by the Lord on the one hand, and sown by the devil on the other.
W.L. In spite of such conditions in christendom we would seek to follow the Lord; is that your thought?
J.T. Quite so, we can work out assembly principles in spite of these tares. John takes them up as the children of God and the children of the devil.
W.J.C. The sons of the kingdom should be able to discern the darnel.
J.T. Well, they do too, but then you do not destroy the darnel. Rome, in the Middle Ages, tried to destroy them, viewing christians as the darnel. They did their best to destroy heretics as they regarded them, but that was violating the principle the Lord lays down here.
Rem. In @2 John 10 we read, "If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not receive him into the house".
J.T. That is an ecclesiastical matter. This in @Matthew 13 refers to the public history of christendom; persons sown by the devil, and persons sown by the Son of man; the sons of the kingdom and the sons of the evil one. It is what happened soon after the introduction of christianity; the position must remain "unto the harvest". On the other hand ecclesiastical principles have not failed. 1 Corinthians shows us what to do in regard to persons in the fellowship, we deal with them if they are evil.
{53}
R.A. It says, "While men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat, and went away" (verse 25). It is through weakness they are allowed to be sown.
J.T. Yes, the negligence of those responsible in christianity. It came in very early. The apostle Paul contemplates that there were some at Corinth; he says, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha" (@1 Corinthians 16:22). He also says, "Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works" (@2 Corinthians 11:14,15). In Galatia, too, conditions had made a way for them to get in, and the apostle says, "If any one announce to you as glad tidings anything besides what ye have received, let him be accursed" (@Galatians 1:9). He does not wait for the Lord's coming to pronounce the anathema upon him, it is so serious.
J.T.Jr. This judgment is final, whereas assembly discipline has recovery in view in the person.
J.T. A person that is withdrawn from in view of recovery, is not a child of the wicked one; we do not regard him in that way. The man put away at Corinth was not that.
C.M. He said to them, "A man that is an enemy has done this" (verse 28). In verse 39 when expounding the parable the Lord says "the enemy ... is the devil".
J.T. The Lord goes to the bottom of the thing in the exposition. Well, that is the first thing in this new position in the house; the exposition of parables and the opening up of mysteries. In verse 44 we have another view of the kingdom of the heavens, and this is spoken in the house. "The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field." That is a positive thing -- the treasure found in the field.
{54}
Then in verses 45 and 46, "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls; and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it".
Then verses 47-50, "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind, which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out. Thus shall it be in the completion of the age: the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth". The weeping and gnashing of teeth is connected with the exposition in verse 42; and now it is seen in the parable of the fish. This shows that Matthew has in mind the *full* thought of divine wrath in dealing with christendom.
H.H. It is remarkable that these references to judgment come from the lips of the Lord Jesus Himself. It is not second-hand.
S.J.H. Why does the matter of having ears to hear come in between these sections?
J.T. That is a formula in connection with parabolic or such ministry. Judicial ministry, as in the book of the Revelation in the addresses to the assemblies, has the same character as these parables, and you have that expression in each one. "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". It means that there are those who have ears, and those who have not. It is a judicial reference. Why should not each have an ear to hear? The absence of it is judicial, God has not given it to all. Isaiah speaks of this and his words are quoted in this chapter, verse 15; "for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the
{55}
ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them".
J.R.H. In this inside position in the house, we are encouraged, as His brethren, to look for more precious truths, as well as the exposition of the public side of things.
J.T. I think so. These parables cover the ministry during the last one hundred years. It stands in relation to those that have turned away from the other houses, the houses of denominationalism in christendom, and who have entered into this house to ask the Lord questions. They did not rely on catechisms, theological books, or orthodoxy. By the Spirit, they got things directly from Christ, the Head of the assembly, they recognised the house of God. They turned aside from man's organisation. The movement started in Dublin in a quiet way, and the truth opened up to them and became richer and richer. The inquiry as to prophetic ministry, that marked those days, helped greatly. The whole position of christendom was made clear. The service of gathering the good fish into vessels and casting the worthless out, was definitely entered on. This is seen in the last parable in our chapter. They enquired and the Holy Spirit opened up the truth to them.
W.L. Where the Lord is the Centre there is no limit to what we may expect in the way of opening up the truth.
J.T. Yes. The net, or seine, is the gospel net cast into the sea of nations. "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind, which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out". It brings out that there is discrimination. The brethren have learnt that, to refuse what is spurious, and to secure in vessels what is good. Our care meetings are for that purpose, to
{56}
determine who is right or wrong. There is deliberation, they *sat down* to it. So that Paul says, "Lay hands quickly on no man, nor partake in others¬ sins" (@1 Timothy 5:22). Deliberation is most important, discernment entering into it. David says to Abigail, "Blessed be thy discernment" (@1 Samuel 25:33).
W.G.T. It follows the parable of the "one pearl". As we lay hold of the truth of the assembly, discriminatory action follows.
J.T. First, it is the thing *found*, the treasure hid in a field, a man having found it; then secondly, a merchant is seeking a definite commodity -- "beautiful pearls"; as a merchant, he knows their value. Then the seine cast into the sea.
There is one thing I think we should have before us in closing -- verses 51 and 52: "Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, Lord. And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old". The teaching of Matthew stands largely in relation to houses and householders. A disciple, a scribe, "discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old". A very interesting man!
A.B. Does @Psalm 78:2-4 bear upon that? It says, "I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter riddles from of old, which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us: we will not hide them from their sons, shewing forth to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, and his strength, and his marvellous works which he hath done".
J.T. That is quoted here in verse 35. I think we should all aspire to be scribes discipled into the kingdom of the heavens. The word ' discipled ' meaning one taught under the rules of education, and he has a treasury in
{57}
which he has things new and old. He does not reject or underrate the Old Testament, he understands it. He has the old, but he brings out what is new as well. He has beautiful antiques, but also what is new.
Rem. The pearl is not a mechanically made thing.
J.T. It is a formed thing; a secret matter.
{58}
CHRIST ASSEMBLING WITH HIS OWN (4)
@Matthew 16:13-20; @Matthew 17:24-27; @Matthew 18:15-20
J.T. It is necessary to link these scriptures with what we closed with yesterday in chapter 13. We observed that in the house the Lord expounded to the disciples, at their own request, the parable of the wheat and tares. He enlarged on His teaching beyond what they could have thought of, because He introduced the assembly there, not under its own name, but in a parabolic sense; under the heading of the treasure and the pearl of great price. It is also in view in the parable of the net cast into the sea. They drew it to shore, and the good fish were put into vessels for further use. The further use is opened up in the scriptures now under consideration.
The Lord enquired of the disciples in chapter 13:51: "Have ye understood all these things?" We reached the end of a previous section in chapter 10. In chapter 11:1 we read, "it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples". He finished a certain course of instruction involving His authority. He is not always commanding. The Lord would also instruct us. The scribe discipled into the kingdom of the heavens would not need to be constantly reminded of the Lord's authority over him.
Now we are challenged as to whether we understand this teaching: "Have ye understood all these things?" (verse 51). Not only, are we subject, but do we understand? The Lord answered the disciples when they said they did understand, by saying that "every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder". The Lord thus brings in a very great thought based on their assertion that they understood what He was saying. He used the word *scribe*, meaning that we are not to understand things in a general way, but in a critical way; to be like the Bereans who searched
{59}
the Scriptures daily to see if the things Paul taught were right. We are not to be critical in an adverse way, but to be sure that what we are taking in is right. The Lord used the word ' scribe ', I think, as a suggestion of an *accurate* person; a person who writes. What we say at such meetings as these, as taken down in notes, is sometimes incoherent, and that is not always the fault of the note-taker. When we undertake to publish them, the idea of the scribe must come in; there must be accuracy. ' Householder ' is another figure which the Lord uses, it has a great place in Matthew, both the words, ' house ' and ' householder '. "For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old". That is, they are proved things. Like Mary, he keeps them in his mind, pondering them in his heart (@Luke 2:19). Thus he has treasure out of which he brings things new and old. He is a spiritually educated man; educated on right principles, as Enoch was educated -- on the principle of discipline.
It is *not* optional whether we read the Bible or not -- or spiritual ministry. It is a question of understanding, and being obligated to the Lord for it, too; for He will have to say to us as to what He furnishes for the blessing of His people -- whether we value and appropriate it. In Bible readings we can bring out "things new and old". A scribe discipled into the kingdom of the heavens is not speculative; he is an accurate man; he has tested the things by Scripture, and he knows what he is speaking about. I thought we should note, before we proceed, the words, ' scribe ', ' discipled ', and ' householder '. "A man a householder". He is a man, but he is a householder. That is really what is needed for stabilisation among the brethren in our localities -- following up Bible readings, ministry, and the like in the light of verses 51 and 52.
H.H. I feel how very important it is to get things accurately into our souls. Perhaps we are clear about
{60}
the pearl being the assembly, but what about the treasure?
J.T. "The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field" (verse 44). The Lord's exposition of the parable of the wheat and tares tells us that the field is the world. The assembly is largely secured in cities; it is remarkable how much is made of cities in relation to the assembly economy: but here it is not the cities, but the field -- a wide thought. The Lord pictures Himself as having found it, which, I suppose, would mean that He found it in His disciples. In @Matthew 10, in relation to the Jewish economy, He told them not to go elsewhere, but "to the lost sheep of the house of Israel". Now, He finds something wider than that; He finds this "treasure", as if He was not looking for it, but had been occupied with something else. He finds this, that the disciples were developing assembly qualities in their intelligence and affections, and so He is minded to buy the field. It is not now the land of Israel, but the whole world; the wide field in which the gospel was to be preached (@Mark 16:15). He sees the treasure there potentially. Similarly, when Paul came to Corinth, a gentile position, the Lord said to him, "No one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city" (@Acts 18:10). He had them there potentially, though not yet secured. So here, the treasure is said to be found, and He hides it. "Which a man having found has hid." It would be, I think, the saints viewed as affording the Lord more joy than He had found in the Jewish setting.
A.E.H. Do you think chapter 13:44 should be carried forward to our present scripture? The Lord, in chapter 16, names the revelation to Peter. In chapter 13 He found the treasure, but what it is, is not stated.
J.T. That is what I thought we might see. He names it in chapter 16, consequent upon the revelation
{61}
the Father had made to Peter, because Peter was thus constituted actual material for the assembly. Chapter 13 does not go that far. It is simply *treasure*. So far the Lord was only dealing with the Jewish disciples, but now He takes a wider outlook. He has bought the whole field in order to secure this treasure; it is going on yet, including America. He is securing it out of the whole world through the gospel, but then He hides it. It is not yet a public thing. It is a mystery, the mystery of the gospel.
J.R.H. In @Ephesians 3:15 the apostle addresses God as "the Father ..., of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named". There are other families beside the assembly, but would they be comprised in the treasure?
J.T. I think not. It is the assembly. The way it is spoken of would plainly indicate this. He enlarges on it in the next parable, which is another phase of the same thing. We have two other accounts; one in verses 45 and 46, and one in verses 47 to 50; the three together would form a group referring to the same thing, only in different phases. The pearl is a greater thought than the treasure, and it is something being sought by one who would know its value. He was seeking goodly pearls, and found one that was exceptional and secured it.
A.E.H. Going back to this question of hiding the treasure, does that develop in chapter 16, in connection with the various opinions that are abroad, and to which the Lord calls attention in His question? Is the secret or mystery of it seen in what is alluded to as in the soul of Peter?
J.T. Just so. The acquiring of the knowledge of Christ's sonship in chapter 16 is not by signs, as in chapter 14, where He is recognised as the Son of God, because of what is seen objectively in Him. That is not the foundation of the assembly; this in chapter 16 is what He is as revealed by the Father, and Peter as having that revelation is constituted actual material
{62}
for the building. These verses in chapter 13, therefore, as was remarked, are linked on with chapter 16, where the assembly is formally named, when the Father reveals to Peter who Christ is.
This section of chapter 16 is strikingly illustrative of our whole subject, because it is the Lord coming in among them. "When Jesus was come into the parts of Caesarea-Philippi, he demanded of his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of man am?" It is a meeting, a private meeting, you may say, with the disciples, and in His incoming the Lord's mind is engaged with something. What are men saying about Him? That has a great place today. What are men saying about Jesus?
A.E.H. This would be an outstanding feature in Peter's education for his service later.
J.T. He would certainly need to get the good of this meeting, because in his service he would find people enquiring about Jesus; some too giving their opinion as to who He is, and it would be very important to be able to answer questions of that kind, and to insist on the truth. The Lord has helped us in late years as to this great matter, and we should all understand the truth of the Son of God.
W.J.C. Is the mystery bound up in Peter's answer to the Lord's question?
J.T. It is bound up in the Lord's word to Peter, as given in verse 18.
W.J.C. Would you say that Deity is involved in it -- Deity in manhood?
J.T. That is right. First of all, what are men saying? The Lord is enquiring as to what others are saying, and in service we are bound to come into contact with these varied views as to Christ. Christendom is full of them now. It was not that they meant to be derogatory, but what they are saying *was* derogatory to Him. "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?"
{63}
To say that He was John the baptist was belittling Him: to say that He was Elias or Jeremiah was belittling Him. Then one who would say that He was "one of the prophets", was very vague and uncertain in his mind. So that what is needed now in meeting all these views is definiteness as to the Person of Christ. This definiteness is the outcome of the clear knowledge of Him by the Spirit.
J.T.Jr. In @Deuteronomy 33, Moses has a place in the affections of the Israelites -- "king in Jeshurun". Would that link on with our present thoughts? Moses was the one who had given commandments, but finally, the people give him his true place -- king in Jeshurun.
J.T. That was when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together. Men who knew Moses would honour him. A great concentration of spiritual wealth is contemplated in @Deuteronomy 33, and Moses was king in Jeshurun -- an upright people. Well, that is the point now. Am I upright in what I am saying about Christ? Where do I get my thoughts? Am I a scribe discipled into the kingdom of the heavens, endeavouring to be accurate? The Lord, we may say, is coming to the upright people; the taught people, in @Matthew 16:13. He says to them, "But *ye* (' Ye ' is emphatic) who do ye say that I am?" They are different from the generality of persons who were speaking about the Lord Jesus. The *ye* means persons who understood what He had already taught them, upright men. What good are we if we are not upright? King in Jeshurun means king among an upright people, and such a people would be accurate. They would not be speculative, but reverential in regard of Christ.
H.H. The word *Thou* is emphatic as to Christ: "*Thou* art the Christ"; and lower down as to Peter: "*thou* art Peter".
J.T. Personality is in mind. The same suggestion as in "But *ye*, who do ye say that I am?" The first "ye" is emphatic. We get one of the greatest
{64}
thoughts -- a revelation of the Father to one of those persons; it was not simply what Peter saw in Him objectively, as in chapter 14, but what the Father revealed to Peter.
W.G.T. Do you link this scripture with @John 6:69?
J.T. The authorised version is misleading there. According to the New Translation, Peter says, "*We* have believed and known that *thou* art the holy one of God". It was not a revelation, but rather what the disciples learned by experience; "*we* have believed and known" refers to past history. Peter and the others believed and knew, not that He was the Son of God, but "the holy one of God". It is a question of His priesthood, He is the Minister of the sanctuary. Peter is stating what he and his fellow disciples already knew. It is a settled matter. It is his own experience. "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal." Others were drifting away. The feeding of the multitude in @John 6 corresponds with @Matthew 14, and this incident in @Matthew 16 is later.
J.W.D. The revelation would bring about in Peter an affinity with Christ. The thought he expressed was interwoven in his spiritual being. He was subjectively part of the system that is headed up in the Christ. I am thinking of @1 Corinthians 12:12.
J.T. "So also is the Christ." Peter was included in that. And the word *stone* bears out the affinity you mention; the ideas of *stone* and *rock* being akin; so the affinity is striking both as to material and anointing. "The Christ" is connected with the anointing; and in @1 Corinthians 12:12 it refers to the saints.
A.B. Would "one of the prophets" suggest limitations in regard to the Lord in that sense?
J.T. Quite so. Some were saying He was John the baptist; a great man. Another says, Elias; a great man too. Then another says Jeremiah, coming down in the scale a bit; and then one of the prophets. Well, that would include the minor prophets. You can see
{65}
the man who says "one of the prophets" is very vague and very careless. There was no idea of guarding the Person of Christ, but that is so characteristic of what men are saying today about Jesus.
E.P. Do these parts of Caesarea-Philippi suggest the region of the speculative mind of man? Is it over against the Colossian truth -- the greatness of Christ, and the greatness of what was introduced in Him?
J.T. Yes. I think too the idea of territory is involved. He is in the vicinity of the nations. The gentile world is in mind. The Lord deliberately raised this question there. Territory or locality has a great deal to do with the assembly.
E.P. Do you think it is an imposing kind of thing, the idea of Caesarea-Philippi, the greatness of man in his own realm?
J.T. It is as to *name*. It denoted too that the Lord was going wider in His thoughts; going out into the gentile world. Peter opened the door to Cornelius, when Cornelius was an officer in the Roman army, and head of the band called "Italic"; Peter's action went out to the Roman world. God was working with Cornelius in view of the assembly, in view of the great thought of God indicated in the vessel coming down from heaven (@Acts 10:11). All the beasts were there; all the fowls of the air, and the creeping things: God was cleansing them, for He had in mind to go out to the gentile world. Peter did not preach the Son of God to Cornelius; he preached Christ. Paul brings in the Son of God in the testimony of the gospel. Peter knew that truth by revelation, but you do not get it in his ministry unless in the second epistle, where he speaks of the Son of God, announced from heaven (chapter 1:17). The truth of the Son of God is brought in by Paul, in whom God revealed Him, that he might preach Him as glad tidings among the nations (@Galatians 1:16). Paul could tell the whole truth of the Son of God in the gentile world.
{66}
E.P. Paul speaks about the gospel preached in the whole creation under heaven. Does that fit in with your thought?
J.T. Yes. In Colossians he greatly enlarges on the truth of the Son of God.
J.T.Jr. Is the thought of government in Matthew connected with "the Christ"?
J.T. Yes; the facts in the opening chapters indicate He is "called Christ", and the "generations in chapter 1 end in "the Christ". Government or rule is clearly in view. The magi ask for "the king of the Jews". Then "the Christ" is the one who does things for God. That is the point Peter makes -- Jesus of Nazareth, anointed of God -- "who went through all quarters doing good ... because God was with him" (@Acts 10:38). He was doing things for God, and God was with Him in what He was doing; but the Son of God is what Paul stresses as to Corinth. "The Son of God", he says, "Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus)" (@2 Corinthians 1:19). The two brothers with him preached the Son of God. It was a threefold testimony to this great truth, and significantly so in Corinth, where the foundation was. "Other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (@1 Corinthians 3:11). He does not say Son of God, but the Son of God was involved. He says Jesus Christ was the foundation he laid; no doubt because of the state of things in Corinth, and of course it enters into the general thought, but the Son of God is the great foundational thought. Jesus Christ is the moral side of the truth, what He was as Man down here.
H.H. Christ dwelling in your hearts by faith (@Ephesians 3:17), would that correspond with what has been before us?
J.T. Yes. It is a question of the great divine Operator, the Christ. The Holy Spirit operates subjectively, but He works under Christ. The Christ is the Messiah, but the appellation is taken up in christianity
{67}
with a deeper and fuller significance than it had in Israel. "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts." The great divine Operator is to dwell in our hearts.
J.S.T. Is there something to be gained by the thought of territory, in Saul being enlightened on the road to Damascus, and then the epistle just referred to, coming out of the Roman prison?
J.T. I think territory has a great deal to do with the testimony -- places God selects in which to witness to certain things. The Lord does not reveal Himself to Saul of Tarsus in Jewish territory, He waits till he gets into Syrian territory; and later He tells him to leave Jerusalem. The Lord says, "Go, for *I* will send thee to the nations afar off" (@Acts 22:21).
W.W. Paul wrote, "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord" (@Romans 1:4).
J.T. That brings up another thing. If we preach Him we must consider as to what phase of the truth of the Son of God we should present. The first announcement is, "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God" (@Luke 1:35). At Christ's baptism, the Father's voice proclaimed Him as Son, "Thou art my beloved Son" (@Luke 3:22). When we come to Paul's foundational epistle, Romans, he refers to the Lord being "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" (@Romans 1:4). It is not His own resurrection that is in view exactly, but that He could raise the dead; however many there were, He could raise them all. That is what is needed in the gospel. The Son of God "has annulled death, and brought to light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings".
H.H. The gospel extends to us on these lines, so one does not preach a full gospel if he leaves sonship out.
{68}
J.T. I think Romans would link the thought of the Son of God with Machpelah, the place where those who died in faith were buried. The Lord would take all those out of death. He is marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead. The word "dead" there is plural. No matter how long a man may be dead, Christ will raise him. The more you think of it the more wonderful it is to you.
W.G.T. "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God", would imply that the Lord would have to do with the resurrection world.
J.T. Quite so. It is also an allusion to the deadness of judaism at that time, and of course has great force, as bearing on the deadness of christianity today; it is not simply Son of God, but the Son of the *Living* God.
S.J.H. These different ways of speaking of the Son of God indicate what the scribe would understand -- he would know when to bring out a particular feature.
J.T. That is right. The different phases of sonship that the Scriptures open up to us are remarkable. Gabriel announced, He "shall be called the Son of God"; the voice from heaven addressed Him, "My beloved Son"; and John says, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father" (@John 1:14); and again, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father" (@John 1:18). It is not who *was*, but who *is* in the bosom of the Father. In the number of further instances, we have phases of this great truth as to the Person of the Son of God.
J.W.D. Why does the Lord say *My* assembly, and not God's assembly?
J.T. I suppose to confirm the truth of His Person as revealed to Peter. I would connect it especially with Him as the Christ, because it is a question of what He has now, His rights as Son of David being denied by the Jews. That He builds and possesses the assembly is a great testimony to His Person. @Hebrews 3:3-6
{69}
shows that the deity of Christ is involved in His building the house of God and being over it as Son. Here He says, "My assembly", which points to His deity. He says, "*I* also"; the Father had spoken to Peter and now the Son speaks to him -- speaks as a divine Person. The assembly would be His, and He would use it in His administrative service in the economy with which He was entrusted; the Father giving all things into His hands. So the assembly has a special place in the service of God. The Lord's supper is peculiarly His own matter; it is celebrated in His assembly, but He does not confine assembly service to the celebration of the Supper. He proceeds to the Father, to God; and finally to His Father and our Father, and to His God and our God. The Supper is initiatory to the great thought. The Lord's supper is His own supper, but as the Minister of the sanctuary, He proceeds from it to fill out the full service of God.
W.L. Would you say the thought of My assembly follows on chapter 13, and is connected with the treasure and the pearl?
J.T. Yes. He finds both.
A.B. He sold all whatever He had, in order to secure both the treasure and the pearl.
J.T. Yes, it is the cost to Himself, and this enters into His ownership of the assembly. It is, nevertheless, God's assembly in a wider sense. It comes down from God out of heaven as the heavenly city, but it also comes down adorned as a bride for her husband, so it belongs to Christ as the Bridegroom, and at the same time it is alluded to as the tabernacle of God (@Revelation 21:1-3). The ideas connected with the treasure and the pearl run together, but the pearl would point to Paul's work. The Lord's word to Peter, "Thou art Peter", asserts that he was material for it.
D.G. The woman at Sychar could say, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done:
{70}
is not he the Christ?" (@John 4:29). Is that material for the assembly?
J.T. The great truth brought out in her was that she discerned she was a vessel for service. She left her water pot and went her way to the city, meaning she had been secured as a vessel rather than as material for the assembly. She had been a polluted vessel, but now she is a purified one, and she comes to the men of the city, and says, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?". The Christ -- the One who does things and she is now ready to do things.
H.H. She had something in her vessel, "I perceive that thou art a prophet", and she has living water too.
J.T. It is a very important side of the truth, that we are secured as vessels. Immediately we are enlightened we become part of the service; and so the woman of Samaria immediately secures men for the Lord.
W.G.T. Would there be any suggestion here that there is the transfer of authority from judaism to heaven, in the reference to the Father in the heavens? Peter was to obtain the keys of the kingdom of the heavens. Judaism is no longer owned.
J.T. Yes. That is seen in Peter's service in @Acts 10. It is a movement of heaven, the vessel comes down out of heaven.
E.P. Do you think this thought of revelation should prepare us for something fresh? Heaven has the right to communicate its own mind in regard to matters at any moment.
J.T. It is wonderful; a new thing altogether, beginning with the Father. It is an extension of the Lord's remark in chapter 11:25, where He says, "I thank thee, O Father ... thou ... hast revealed them unto babes". Peter, however, is not viewed as a babe here. He has progressed in the truth. The Father reveals
{71}
this great truth to him; and as Peter makes the confession, the Lord acts on that.
S.P. Manhood is seen here in Peter over against manhood according to men in the area of Caesarea-Philippi.
J.T. Yes. Caesar and Philip were great names in the gentile world. Philip and Andrew came to tell the Lord that the Greeks said, "Sir, we would see Jesus". They thought it was important that the Lord should know that such people had come to find out about Jesus. The Lord immediately says, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone" (@John 12:24). The greatest of these men is of no account at all in the new world. All that is for God must be on the principle of death and resurrection.
E.P. Paul closes the epistle to the Romans with an allusion to the mystery.
J.T. Yes; he has laid the basis for it, and that would be the next thing for the Romans to understand -- the mystery of God. We have it here, and the Father is moving; so that we are in the full economy of God here. The Father reveals to Peter who Christ was. The Son reveals the Father, but the Father reveals the Son so far as the Son may be revealed. The Lord says, "No one knows the Son but the Father" (@Matthew 11:27), He does not say the Father reveals Him, but that the Son reveals the Father; so that the revelation here does not refer to the inscrutableness of Christ, but to what He was as Man before Peter's eyes and the eyes of others. That is what is in mind, even as in @Ephesians 4:13, where ministry is used for the perfecting of the saints, "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ". We are to know Him in that way.
W.J.C. In what way then does the Father make the Son known?
{72}
J.T. By revelation. That is the point here: "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee", meaning that Peter could not have learned it from any mere human source. It was the Father's revelation, the Father calling attention to the Person about whom the people were so puzzled; none called Him by the right name. The Father reveals Him to Peter, who calls Him by His right name; "the Christ, the Son of the living God". This is the basis of all that follows. If the Father draws attention to Christ, it is on this ground. We are all to be in the knowledge of Him as thus made known. It is a greater transaction in Peter's case than with ourselves, because it is foundational. Believers now are brought into this by spiritual means. Paul says, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations" (@Galatians 1:16). Peter did not get the revelation for that purpose, but for a foundation of the assembly. Peter's name means *stone*; he is material for the assembly, but the revelation to Paul was for *preaching*. He preached the Son of God at Corinth.
H.H. In his first epistle Peter speaks of Christ as a Living Stone disallowed of men, but chosen of God and precious.
J.T. Yes. We also are living stones built up a spiritual house, as coming to Christ in this light. There is thus the working out of the truth of this chapter in Peter's ministry.
Ques. Do we see the work of God in the blind man when Christ asked him the question, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?" The Lord told him. "And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage" (@John 9:35-38).
J.T. That is another view of what we are speaking of, the Lord Himself declaring that He is the Son of God. It was to a man that had been *cast out*. It is another point of view which is most important. He
{73}
says to him *thou*, addressing him personally, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?" And Jesus said to him, "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he". He is thoroughly secured as a worshipper of the Son of God.
W.G.T. The public matter, what men were saying, is left unadjusted here, whereas the private matter is adjusted and then kept secret.
J.T. It was not to be added to the public profession. I think christendom corresponds in the different views of Christ that exist in it; but this great matter was to be a secret. "Then he enjoined on his disciples that they should say to no man that he was the Christ." That subject is finished.
In chapter 17, we have the question raised of sonship in the brethren. The personnel of the assembly now is in mind, not from the standpoint of material, but from the standpoint of dignity, personal dignity. So the question arises in Capernaum, Does your Master pay the tax? and Peter, without thinking of accuracy, says, Yes. Peter did not understand sonship. He had been up in the mountain with the Lord and heard God proclaim Him as Son, and now he tells some questioner that the Lord is just like anyone else, and is subject to the temple tax. The temple belonged to God, and God had just proclaimed Christ as Son, and hence why should He be taxed? "When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him." This is another session in "the house", as in chapter 13:36. The Lord opens up the truth of sonship in its application both to Himself and to Peter; a very important item in our subject.
J.T.Jr. Does Peter represent therefore in a general way how the truth proceeds in our souls; that is, the revelation first, before the Lord tells them what is going to happen to Him in Jerusalem? Peter rebukes Him -- he fails; and then he fails again in this chapter. Is that the way we usually learn this great subject -- through our failures?
{74}
J.T. Largely it is so. The correction is intended to help us. Peter would not forget this. Possibly he raised the question with Matthias, if he remembered this incident as to how the Lord brought out sonship; how it applied to Christ and the saints; it is not a question of fitness for heaven here, but that I am immune from the taxation. It is a question of the temple tax, and God does not put me under tribute in His house. Sons are free in the assembly. We are all to learn this in the assembly, that we are free.
H.H. Sonship in relation to Christ would have Deity behind it. Sonship, of course, for us would not.
J.T. Quite so, we are adopted. We have the same Spirit, the Spirit of God's Son.
E.P. This house would be a place of increased light, in all this teaching as to sonship. Peter coming into this house gets a fresh touch as to what is proper to the new system.
J.T. Yes. If it were the house the Lord lived in at Capernaum, which is probable, it would give it all the more significance. Capernaum is called "his own city". I think the Lord brings out this truth of sonship, not so much now in relation to our heavenly calling, but as in the testimony, to set aside legal claims that might be imposed upon us in the assembly. We are apt to impose these claims, but if we understand the sonship of Christ, and that we have the Spirit of sonship, we can see there is no tributary claim to be made upon us.
E.P. Would this be felt in the care meeting in @Acts 15? Peter's word as to the matter of circumcision seems to result from this.
J.T. It is just what came out there. It was a question of sonship. The judaisers were endeavouring to bring the gentiles into bondage.
E.P. "It seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with the whole assembly, to send chosen men from among them with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch,
{75}
Judas called Barsabas and Silas, leading men among the brethren" (@Acts 15:22). The whole position was in keeping with it.
J.T. Just so. Bringing out how the spirit of liberty was still in the assembly at Jerusalem. So that the *Me* and *thee* in @Matthew 17:27 is beautiful. He says, "Take that and give it to them for me and thee". We are not obligated by God to do it, but lest we should be an offence we do it; but maintain the truth all the same. If men asked us to do something that others do, we are careful that the truth is not compromised by it. That is the point the Lord makes. He establishes the truth of sonship and then pays the tribute.
W.G.T. This is a matter that ordinarily would have been handled by Judas, who "had the bag", but it seems as if the Lord took it out of his hands.
J.T. The Lord did not enquire if Peter had something in the bag to meet the demand. The Lord's creative position is brought into this. The sea is His; He knew it; He made it. The fishes of the sea were His; He knew where they were, and here is one fish, and Peter was to get that fish, and it has in its mouth just what is needed and no more. The stater is enough to pay the tax for two persons, and the Creator provides it, which brings in another side of the Lord's position here.
E.P. It is really @Psalm 8:6-9 in principle -- "Thou hast made him to rule over the works of thy hands; thou hast put everything under his feet: sheep and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the field; the fowl of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, whatever passeth through the paths of the seas. Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!"
J.R.H. There seems to be a certain concession on the part of the Lord in paying this tax. Paul speaks of not giving place for one hour in this great matter that the truth might continue.
{76}
J.T. In relation to all governmental requirements, you go a long way; the demand was by an established authority. The temple tax was an established matter; there were those responsible for its collection, but the Lord makes the position of Himself and the disciples clear, before they paid it, so that the truth is maintained. That is what came up at Jerusalem. Paul and Barnabas maintain the truth at all cost. The letter written to "the brethren who are from among the nations" was very limited, but it contained what was needed to meet the emergency. It did not assert the truth of sonship. In the epistle to the Galatians where he refers to this very meeting at Jerusalem, Paul enlarges on the truth of sonship and the liberty that it implies. The letter sent out from Jerusalem did not go nearly as far as that. It was, however, supported by the Holy Spirit and carried the authority of the apostles at Jerusalem, which was needed to silence the judaisers. Paul carried and delivered it to the brethren, showing he was a son and ready to acquiesce with anything that was right and that furthered the prosperity and unity of the saints.
A.H.P. While the Lord provides this tax and pays it, the following chapters indicate that the dignity of sonship should characterise the assembly.
J.T. Yes. It is a heavenly people that compose the assembly down here. They belong to heaven and they are sons. Chapter 18 carries this forward, showing that we deal with assembly matters on this line of sonship. It says, "if thy brother" -- all is to be in the spirit of sonship. There is no exacting -- it is to gain *thy brother*.
S.P. Is the teaching of these chapters drawing closer to that which is inside; in the previous chapters we had externals?
J.T. Yes, I think we are getting nearer. Scripture says of David that he built *inward*. The gospels are all on that line, John particularly, although, of course,
{77}
they deal also with what is public, but I think sonship is what is in mind as the great inner thought linking us with heaven. Heavenly dignity and liberty are implied. All assembly discipline is to be carried on in that spirit. So the passage in chapter 17 bears on chapter 18.
{78}
CHRIST ASSEMBLING WITH HIS OWN (5)
@Matthew 26:26-40; @Matthew 28:16-20; @Acts 1:1-9
J.T. Some further remarks are called for on the passages read this morning in chapter 18, following on chapter 17 where sonship is introduced, linking up the saints with the Lord in it. In the word about the piece of money, the Lord says, "Take that and give it to them for me and thee". Then we have a meeting contemplated in chapter 18. The disciples came to Him saying, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens? And Jesus having called a little child to him, set it in their midst, and said, Verily I say to you, Unless ye are converted and become as little children, ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, *he* is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens" (verses 1-4). Their inquiry here indicated that they needed correction; indeed, they needed to be *converted*, an important item in our instruction; for those engaged in the service, this coming in and going out of the Lord involves instruction as to their aspirations. Their minds were on the idea of greatness in the kingdom of the heavens, and the Lord shows the way of it in a little child. "And Jesus having called a little child to him, set it in their midst." Verse 15 brings up the question of a brother sinning against another, and that the adjustment of the matter must include the spirit of sonship. The Lord says "If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother." It is a family matter.
A.B. Would you say more in regard of the incident at the close of chapter 17 as bearing upon chapter 18?.
J.T. Sonship belongs to heaven properly, but we are sons down here, and the spirit of sonship is to be seen in our relations with men. That is the point. It was in the town where the Lord resided, where He was known personally, and some enquirer said to Peter,
{79}
"Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?" Peter answered, "Yes", without asking the Lord. He did not understand the bearing of sonship. He did not carry down from the mount of Transfiguration the full thought conveyed there. The Lord Jesus, being the Son, could not be tributary to any one. The tax was not obligatory on Him; but Peter assumed that it was -- it means that he did not understand the Lord's sonship. When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him; that is, the Lord knew what had happened. Peter had not said anything to Him as yet, but the Lord knew what had happened, and He would adjust Peter as to it by bringing out these facts. He calls upon Peter to tell Him about the kings of the earth, meaning that the Lord expects us to understand such matters as that. He says, "The kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers? Peter says to him, From strangers". He knew that, but he did not learn the great lesson on the Mount of Transfiguration as to the Person of Christ.
A.B. He had been told that "there is here what is greater than the temple" (@Matthew 12:6).
J.T. Yes. He ought to remember that too.
J.H.Jr. Would the spirit of sonship provide a bulwark against the gates of hades? not only from the outside in chapter 17, but from the inside in chapter 18.
J.T. The outside is important because it is said, "Let your gentleness be known of all men" (@Philippians 4:5). We are not set against what the ministers of the government may require; we are ready to agree to do anything that does not compromise the rights of God. The Lord said to Saul of Tarsus, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?" (@Acts 9:4). Saul and his fellow persecutors had met the spirit of Christ in the houses of christians in Jerusalem. James says later, "Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just; he does not resist you" (@James 5:6). That is the attitude of the spirit of sonship, the spirit of Christ in the saints; a very important
{80}
one, when special demands are being made upon us by the military, customs and immigration departments. We are to take up this attitude, "But that we may not be an offence to them", the Lord says, "take that and give it to them for me and thee".
W.L. Chapter 18:14 helps us as to our attitude as sons in a practical way. The Lord had said of the little ones, that "their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens" (verse 10). Then in verse 14, "It is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones should perish".
J.T. The whole passage contemplates the little ones as inoffensive, unpretentious and outwardly unprotected. Paul says, "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter" (@Romans 8:36). That is the *suffering attitude*.
J.T.Jr. This gospel brings out at the beginning the little Child under divine protection; I suppose that is carried through.
J.T. Yes. Jesus is called the little Child several times. In the second chapter He is very exposed. The spirit of Rachel enters into this gospel: "Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not" (verse 18). Herod had murdered them. It is the bitter opposition of the enemy against the little children. The Lord is not here called a babe, but "the little child", and always put before His mother; His personal dignity is maintained, but He is still exposed to attack. Almost the whole of chapter 2 is devoted to the protection of the little Child. In chapter 18 it is unseen interest in the "little ones": "their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens". It means that they are represented up there and come in for the protection of God.
H.H. Is the protection connected now with the kingdom of the heavens?
{81}
J.T. The kingdom is provision for us in that sense. It is a bulwark, it is called usually the kingdom of the heavens in this gospel, to bring out the attitude of heaven. The Voice from heaven proclaiming the Father's delight in the Lord Jesus would show that we may look up there for the protection of what is lovable to heaven, the continuation of Christ here in the saints; they are lovable to the Father; "their angels ... continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens". It is a beautiful touch.
E.P. Would they discern correspondence in the little ones to the face they beheld in heaven?
J.T. I suppose so, reflection here; as in christians it is the continuation of Christ in a spiritual sense. It is very remarkable, the place children have in this gospel, beginning with the second chapter; the weeping of Rachel, the spirit of Christ we may say, because they are murdered; it came down through Jeremiah from Genesis, Rachel weeping for her children. Now in this chapter we have a little child amenable to the call of the Lord. In chapter 11:25, it is babes, the very smallest conception of human beings. The Lord says to His Father, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes". So that the work of God is built up from the bottom in the little ones. It is seen in this little child available to the Lord; He can set him down in the midst of the disciples. Then in chapter 21 we have the children singing in the temple; taking up a note which began with the blind men in chapter 20:30; they addressed the Lord Jesus as "Son of David". In the beginning of chapter 21 we have the quotation from @Zechariah 9:9, "Behold thy King cometh to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass". The crowds say, "Hosanna to the Son of David", a salutation carried forward, as we may say, from the blind men in chapter 20. It is maintained,
{82}
and carried forward in increased power among the crowd. Then in the temple, verses 15 and 16, "when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders which he wrought, and the children crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were indignant, and said to him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus says to them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?" It seems to me that the thought of children is greatly enlarged on in Matthew, as typical of christians; the note of praise is carried forward, and maintained by them in the temple, the Lord Jesus justifying it against attacks.
A.M. It is most important that we should learn this lesson so that right relations might be maintained with our brethren prior to moving on in assembly service.
J.T. That is right. Chapter 18:15, "But if thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone". We are to remember he is our brother, "If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother". It is clear that the offended one has the spirit of Christ, the spirit of sonship. You can see the thought of it in chapter 12. Jesus walked through the cornfields on the sabbath, establishing liberty. In chapter 17 He anticipated what was in Peter's mind. If you were there, the Lord would impress you with the fact that He is Son and you are one with Him. He is associating you with Him in sonship before the world, it is not before the Father here, but before the world.
J.R.H. How do you distinguish between before the world and before the Father?
J.T. @Matthew 17 refers to what I am in my daily life; the way I treat other people; the officials of the government and the like; I am subject; not self-assertive. The Lord as ill-treated was "as a sheep dumb before her shearers, and he opened not his mouth"; that is the wonderful testimony of @Isaiah 53, and @Romans 8:36,37
{83}
connects it with the saints; "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter. But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us".
H.B. The Lord gives quite a long answer to the question of the disciples in chapter 18.
J.T. You see how important it is that we should have this long answer, and then the long object lesson too in the little child as to who is greatest in the kingdom.
W.J.C. Does this cover anything more than personal trespass?
J.T. The Lord is dealing with the family, carrying the thought forward, it is the family, especially the brother. "If thy brother sin against thee." He is worth something, he belongs to the family. "If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he do not hear thee, take with thee one or two besides, that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three. But if he will not listen to them, tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer" (@Matthew 18:15-17). The *state* of the offender is in mind, for he goes forward in evil if he refuses to listen to the assembly.
W.J.C. Does the instruction apply to anything that might be known amongst the saints that has to be taken up?
J.T. The principle taught is wide; applying especially to discipline resulting from refusal to hear the assembly. That might arise in any case of discipline. You may not be able to prove wickedness against a person although you feel it is there, but the attitude the person takes up will in time tell. If he is insubject, if he refuses first one brother, and then two or perhaps three, and then finally refuses to hear the assembly, his will is at work; the principle of will being at work is lawlessness. That is a great matter in cases of
{84}
discipline -- how does the person involved regard the brethren?
H.H. How does it get to the assembly? Does the care meeting come in there?
J.T. I think so. That is where the witnesses are heard.
A.M. Is it important to see that it primarily should be kept in the smallest possible compass, the one brother first of all. "But if thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone."
J.T. That is quite clear there. You keep it within the smallest possible compass. There are some things that can be dealt with without bringing them to the assembly if the offending one is amenable to his brother. If he is not and thus disregards the possible loss of his brother he is void of the spirit of sonship.
W.G.T. "Unless ye are converted and become as little children, ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens" (verse 3). Would that not be of help to the brethren generally? We would have to be in that attitude to be of any use in dealing with such a case; we need to be priestly.
S.J.H. I judge if one were to go to a brother in the spirit of sonship, you might go once or twice before bringing others, so as to avoid legalism.
J.T. Yes, we are to preclude the legal element at all times. The apostle said to the Corinthians, "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly" (@1 Corinthians 4:17). As Paul's child, he was available. Paul would call him and send him to Corinth, a "beloved and faithful child in the Lord". Perhaps that is the combination that is needed! Childship is derived from Paul; Paul begetting through the gospel and personal influence, which you might say was the influence of Christ. Then the child is beloved, that is, a lovable person. Of
{85}
course, I must be faithful and bring the truth clearly before the offending one, but I want lovableness too. I may be wanting in the beloved character.
J.W.D. "Tell it to the assembly", did you say the care meeting was equivalent to that? It has been suggested that the assembly may be convened so that the excess of grace which is in it may be brought to bear on an offender before a meeting for formal discipline is called.
J.T. That grace marks the assembly is established in @Luke 24:33,34. It is said, "They found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together, saying, The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon". That is, this whole company is occupied with this point of grace. The Lord appeared to Simon, the *offending* one, the one who denied Him. That ought to pervade care meetings; if it is really a care meeting, love is acting. "How shall he take care of the assembly of God?" (@1 Timothy 3:5). In the meeting called the care meeting, we are taking *care* of the assembly of God, and I think brethren together in that way are normally an expression of grace; we ought to be expressive of grace. There should be the greatest consideration for the offender because he is our brother. But in cases of discipline the assembly should be convened *only* for executive service, not for investigation or deliberation.
R.A. Do you think the *Me* and *thee* enters into this -- the Lord moving on that occasion that He might not offend?
J.T. Yes. You do not want to lose the brother. The Lord would preserve Peter, "And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded to have you, to sift you as wheat; but *I* have besought for thee that thy faith fail not" (@Luke 22:31,32). The Lord would secure Peter, and so as risen He appeared to him on the first day; that is *grace*. The whole company was occupied with this one point -- "the Lord is
{86}
indeed risen and has appeared to Simon". Paul says, "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor, in order that *ye* by *his* poverty might be enriched" (@2 Corinthians 8:9). It is a question of the grace of Christ, and this is witnessed in the restoration of Peter. When the cock crew He turned to Peter, He paid attention to the hour. He turned round and looked at Peter. Peter saw it and went out and wept bitterly. The Lord had prayed for him; had looked at him at the right time and brought conviction. All this enters into @Matthew 18.
Then the passage brings out the greatness of the assembly in an authoritative sense; for "if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer" (@Matthew 18:17). That does not mean that the assembly is taking action; it is what he is to the person who is offended; "let him be to *thee*". The next thing is how heaven regards what is done in such cases. "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven" (verse 18). It is to bring out the greatness and dignity of the assembly administratively, as representative of the Lord here.
H.B. What would you say about the change from the word ' thee ' to ' ye '?
J.T. That word "ye" stands in relation to those who form the assembly. Something must be done if the brother refuses to listen, and he is to be regarded as a heathen; something must be done. It is to bring out that the assembly cannot be quiescent in the presence of that.
E.P. We are responsible to maintain what is due to the position in that way as indicated in the Lord's instructions here in verses 15 to 18.
J.T. Clearly so. What the Lord requires here contemplates manhood in *every one*. If the offended
{87}
one, it is a question of whether I am a man; the assembly is composed of such in a spiritual sense. This matter needs adjustment, and I must go the whole way with it, take it to the assembly. The instruction given is to bring out how things are solved. Matthew is the only gospel which furnishes us with this instruction. It is very needful that we should have it, because there is in the assembly the means for the solution of every difficulty.
E.P. The Lord goes on to speak of our being conscious that He is with us.
J.T. He tells us later He is with us. You can understand how important for Matthias, who was about to be appointed as an apostle, to have all this instruction before him. As an apostle he would have to do with these things in his ministry. Then when the assembly fails, it might be said, what are we to do now? Thus we have, "Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens". And again, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" (verses 19,20). So that even in remnant times, there is provision made for solving matters; everything is solved. The assembly should not carry forward unsolved difficulties.
Rem. In @1 John 10, we read that Diotrephes "casts them out of the assembly".
J.T. That is the reverse of all this. That is not assembly action at all. It is a man arrogating power to himself to cast out of it.
Now in chapter 26 we should see how the Lord's supper enters into this subject. It is a very important feature of our subject. Matthew says, "as they were eating", the eating was going on before He brings in the Supper. "And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken the bread and blessed, broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
{88}
And having taken the cup and given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it. For this is my blood, that of the new covenant, that shed for many for remission of sins. But I say to you, that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father. And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives". That is Matthew's account of the Lord's supper; the institution of it; and perhaps what is needed to be brought home to us at this time is the idea of *eating* attached to it. They were already eating when He brought in the Supper, showing that the thing itself, what enters into the assembly, requires constitution in us. It is not a prayer book service, but something that needs constitution in us in order to carry through what belongs to the assembly.
A.E.H. Am I right in thinking as to eating, that it is the passover?
J.T. That is what they were eating.
A.E.H. Would that enter into what we have had before us in the previous meetings? To take these things on we need an assembly constitution.
J.T. Yes. I think the application to us would be that we are eating what is needful for assembly service, for taking on the Lord's supper. In 1 Corinthians, the passover is brought in in chapter 5, the Lord's supper in chapter 11. "Let us celebrate the feast", the idea of carrying forward the passover is made plain there.
T.H. Why are the words, "this do in remembrance of me", omitted here?
J.T. They are omitted here and in Mark. They are only found in @Luke 22:19 and @1 Corinthians 11:24,25. I suppose Matthew and Mark have in mind the great pressure that attaches to the service of God in the assembly, and we need to eat; Luke is thinking of the absence of Christ, and would have us not to forget that. We are in danger of turning to idolatry if we
{89}
ignore His absence. In @Exodus 32:1 we read, "this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him!" They turned to idolatry, they forgot him, they did not carry him forward in their affections.
W.G.T. In @1 Corinthians 5, the thought is the *keeping* of the feast. Is it the continuance of the thing that is in mind?
J.T. It is kept "with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth". That is the significance of this eating; the feast is kept with that kind of bread.
W.L. The Lord says in Matthew, that He is with us "all the days, until the completion of the age".
J.T. Yes. Matthew contemplates that side of His service. Luke contemplates Him gone into heaven. Luke makes a great deal of His going into heaven; as early as chapter 9:51, he says, "When the days of his receiving up were fulfilled".
There is not only eating but drinking; "And having taken the cup and given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it". That is, every one of us, every disciple ought to drink it.
A.H.P. Why "for remission of sins"? Do you regard it as characteristic of the assembly, as well as what Paul "received from the Lord" (@1 Corinthians 11:23)?
J.T. The Lord does not include that in the word to Paul, for he says, "*I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, and having given thanks broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" (verses 23-25). It does not seem to be a memorial in Matthew at all; it grows out from the passover, carrying with it forgiveness, stressing the covenant as including the remission of sins.
{90}
J.T.Jr. In @Numbers 11 we have the children of Israel getting tired of the manna; they asked for flesh to eat. The government of God comes in. I think that there is a great deal of that amongst us, getting tired of divinely appointed food, getting tired of the meetings, lusting after the world.
J.T. So that the eating must go on. If we are only Sunday christians we shall soon cease to be christians at all, because there must be the weekly experience. In going through experience in a contrary scene, partaking of suitable food, we develop a constitution fitted for the service of God in the assembly. Hence, "let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread, and drink of the cup" (@1 Corinthians 11:28). Do not cease eating. If there is anything on your conscience, judge it, but keep on eating. "Let a man prove himself, and thus eat", do not cease to eat. Why should I cease to eat? Of course, if the brethren have imposed discipline that is another matter. I am speaking of how a brother or sister should proceed normally. This chapter provides me with the means of cleansing so that I can go on eating. In Matthew, as we have noted, there is no memorial, but in Matthew and Mark we have the mount of Olives to which they went after the hymn, which Luke does not give us. Going to the mount of Olives would imply that we have strength to move out on to a higher level. That is the point with these two evangelists. Eating enables us to move on to a higher spiritual level.
E.P. These are strenuous chapters, are they not, these closing chapters of Matthew's gospel? It seems like, "But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us" (@Romans 8:37).
J.T. Yes. The word strenuous is good. Matthew is severe, the matter is urgent; he has divine representation in mind both in the apostles and in the assembly.
{91}
A.E.H. In moving on to the higher level in the service of God we are often hampered by unsuitable contributions. Could you help us in regard to how we may meet that? I suppose the constitution helps.
J.T. It does. The hymn was sung in the city, and the breaking of bread was in the city, Jerusalem. The movement to the higher level would be as we come to recognise the Spirit as the only power for service; but a spiritual constitution in each of us is necessary if the Spirit is to use us. The woman of @John 4 represents this thought, what the vessel is, what she was when she left her waterpot and went away to the city. In principle the living water was in her and would support her, it was springing up. All this is most essential for assembly service. It shows what we are constitutionally, and whether the Spirit can take us on and use us. There is not only the eating, but also the drinking, as we have seen. In @Luke 22 and @1 Corinthians 11 the word ' supped ' in "after having supped", refers to the passover supper. After that, He gave them the cup and said, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" (@1 Corinthians 11:25). He speaks of the cup, and also says, "in remembrance of me".
W.J.C. Does sonship indicate the kind of constitution?
J.T. It does; but food for a suitable constitution is most important. The Lord says, "Have ye anything here to eat?" (@Luke 24:41). What we are speaking of now refers to eating *before* the Lord's supper. It underlies the movement from "glory to glory". I look upon it this way: the dwellings of Jacob are glorious, and from these we move out as coming to the assembly; they are not so glorious as the assembly, but they are glorious. In the assembly, as we sit down to the Lord's supper, there is glory; the glory attached to the bread and the cup; and then the Lord apprehended; it is Himself, the glory radiating, and He proceeds from
{92}
that on to other glories. The question is, Can I follow in all these glories? If I am not accustomed to eat suitable food, which builds up the constitution, I shall not be equal to the great occasion.
D.G. The Lord's supper is very testing to us. The Lord says, "Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves" (@John 6:53).
J.T. That is *flesh*. It is not flesh here, but the *body* -- the word is important. This gospel has the assembly in mind -- you are built up in relation to the assembly, what I am to my brethren, what they are to me. The apostle says, in @1 Corinthians 10:16, "The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of the Christ? Because we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf". The thought of the Lord's body leads me into the spiritual body composed of all the saints. @John 6:53 does not refer to that; it is not His body, it is His flesh; it is incarnation, human condition there. The point here is the body with which He did the will of God.
T.H. Eating and drinking are emphasised in @1 Corinthians 10.
J.T. Yes.
J.W.D. There are various ways in which we can eat. In @Matthew 26 it builds us up constitutionally, leading to the mount of Olives and singing the hymn.
J.T. There was evidently power to go to the mount of Olives. The hymn is sung *mutually*. *They* did it. The Lord is not specially mentioned as doing it. He would be included no doubt, but it is what they did; it is a mutual thing. The brethren are together in a mutual way having power to go to the mount of Olives. The mount of Olives suggests exercise; you leave the position of Jerusalem; you no longer move in a local orbit, but into the *spiritual* side now. That is where Matthew and Mark serve us well, suggesting the idea
{93}
of eating that we may enter the spiritual realm, which requires power in ourselves.
H.H. A brother on Lord's day morning gives out the notices; from that point of view, we are not thinking of going to heaven; we have in mind to attend the different meetings notified.
J.T. All these meetings are public testimony, that is quite in keeping with the beginning of our meeting for assembly service; but going to the mount of Olives is not that side, but our entering the spiritual realm; there are no limits there; it is "from glory to glory". We have "the Father of glory" too; ' thought beyond all ' *thought*, as the hymn puts it.
E.P. It says in @Zechariah 14:4, "And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem toward the east". Is that the outlook? Heaven is to be introduced into assembly service.
J.T. Yes. At night He went to the mount of Olives, we are told in @Luke 21. That would be His retreat; you could not find Him in Jerusalem; He would be with the Father. He taught in the temple during the day. When the day's work was done He retired to the Father. In the nights He was not in Jerusalem, He goes, as it were, outside that realm. He is in Jerusalem only to serve and to suffer.
J.T.Jr. Our being told that the Lord went to the mount of Olives Himself, would indicate where we too may go individually during the week. That would add to the thought in chapter 26, when they all went.
J.T. Yes. That furnishes you with the strength you need; it makes you spiritual. Constitution is what is in mind. Eating builds you up, so that you are able to leave the city position, the public position, for the spiritual position, where there is no limit. The Lord went *up*, according to the Acts; His ascension links the position in the assembly with Him up there.
{94}
So our next scripture (@Acts 1), leads upward. The spiritual side of our position is suggested here. In considering this last meeting of our Lord with the disciples our subject leads us to that point, "until ... he was taken up". The final meeting therefore involves the forty days between His resurrection and His ascension, so that we are now to be prepared for heavenly things. Luke summarises first by saying, "To whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God; and, being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which said he ye have heard of me". He uses the word *assembled* there; then in verse 6, "They therefore, being come together, asked him saying, Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?" We have the words *assembled* and *come together* so that we have here a very formal reference to our subject, "the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us" (verse 21). What were the lessons learned? All connected with spirituality; really the explanation and fulness of the idea of the mount of Olives.
D.G. As conscious of reaching the spiritual sphere, or the Father's sphere, should we dwell on the thoughts of the Father as known, or should we say, "God and Father"?
J.T. God is the great End in divine appellations; "that God may be all in all" (@1 Corinthians 15:28). It is not the Father all in all, but "that God may be all in all". That is final, so that we should go on from Father to God in that sense. Of course, God is connected with the covenant and other matters, but here it is God in the fullest sense. God is the great End of all testimony and in assembly service: not the Father, but God.
A.B. Is the great result of revelation secured in the thought, "that God may be all in all"?
{95}
J.T. Yes. It is not "all and in all", but "all in all". He is all as in us, as God, filling us, and yet of course the Supreme. There is correspondence with @Genesis 1, "God" there is a plural word; plural in the sense of emphasis, the Supreme, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", but you do not there get "God all in all". As He comes into the garden He is not *in* Adam and Eve, the devil is in them. The great thought of redemption comes in so that God might secure His place in men, which involves sonship; "all in all", that stands eternally.
J.W.D. Do you think that where the apostle speaks of God and Father the thought of God being supreme enhances the blessedness of the name of Father?
J.T. The Lord Jesus Himself limits the name "Father" in @John 5:22. He says, "Neither does the Father judge any one"; whereas God judges; every divine attribute and function must find a place in God. God includes them all, judgment and all else, but the Father is more limited, more precious in a sense, as conveying the family thought. The order in the Lord's words is, "My Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (@John 20:17).
H.H. He is the Father of *all* families.
J.T. Father is a family title, whereas God is much wider; it stands related to creation too. He is Supreme.
D.G. In @John 17 He prayed to the Father; not mentioning the title God. In the sense of family relationship we address Him as Father; when we address Him as God and Father we are taking in the creatorial setting in relation to Him who brings all into being.
J.T. In @John 20 He says, "My Father and your Father, my God and your God", and in the address to Philadelphia He says, "My God", several times. As we are alongside of the Lord by the Spirit we really get the full thought of God, in so far as creatures may get it; we apprehend Him as Christ's God. As near enough to
{96}
Christ to observe His holy emotions and gestures, we would get the idea of what God is to Him. John says, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth" (@John 1:14). That is how they saw Him. They would learn how to speak to God; how to speak to the Father, as seeing how the Lord was with Him, "an only-begotten with a father".
W.G.T. The question raised here in @Acts 1 was as to the time the Lord would return, and the Lord answering said that it was a matter the Father had placed within His own authority. He indicates that He as Man regarded the Father as having superior authority in a matter of this kind.
J.T. That is a point of importance. Matthias would have to know what this last meeting was; undoubtedly he was present at that last meeting. What did the Lord say about His coming? They were on kingdom lines; they wanted to know when He would restore the kingdom to Israel, but He puts them off. "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority". It is left open, we have to wait. The date of His return is on the Father's calendar. Our business now is with the Spirit. The Lord says, "The Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth". The disciples were to be occupied in bearing witness to Christ in the power of the Spirit. It is all left open, but the Spirit is stressed. We are living in the period of the Spirit at the present time; no one can predict when the Lord will come back. The Lord says, "Yea, I come quickly" (@Revelation 22:20). That is His purpose and promise. The exact time of it is the Father's matter; even the Son does not know of the day (@Mark 13:32).
A.B. Does the economy terminate?
J.T. I think not. We shall enjoy and know divine Persons in eternity on the same principle as we do
{97}
now; only, of course, all difficulties or occasions of darkness in us will be removed.
W.J.C. So that God is to be known by us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
J.T. Quite so: that is the general position. Each of the divine Persons is seen acting as God, but the Father retains definitely the *place* of Deity -- "to us there is one God, the Father" (@1 Corinthians 8:6).
{98}
MANHOOD IN EXODUS (1)
@Exodus 1:20-22; @Exodus 2:1-14: @Exodus 3:11-14: @Exodus 4:1-8
J.T. It is believed that the subject of *manhood* will prove helpful, under the Lord's hand. In Exodus we see manhood, not as allowed to develop as it were without restraint, as in Genesis, but manhood under restraint. In view of what we are, and the influences around us, there is no way of developing what is of God, save as we are under restraint. It was thought this book would yield much. The beginning is to be noted: "And these are the names of the sons of Israel who had come into Egypt; with Jacob had they come, each with his household" (@Exodus 1:1). The footnote in the New Translation indicates that literally it reads *The man and his house*. This is carried forward in the New Testament as Paul says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house" (@Acts 16:31). The word *son* should be noted; "sons of Israel", each had come with his father; not only each man and his house, but Jacob is seen as father of his sons and grandchildren, and then they are numbered.
The development of manhood involves suffering. It is said Pharaoh "set over them service-masters to oppress them with their burdens ... But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and spread; and they were distressed because of the children of Israel" (@Exodus 1:11,12). These thoughts offer material to think over. Then there are the directions of the king of Egypt to destroy the male children and how it is frustrated by *females*. Five females are used for their salvation. Three of them are employed for salvation of one male child, Moses, who is saved and grows into manhood.
E.G.McA. Why do you bring in the female side?
J.T. It is to show how God can take up weak vessels to save the males alive, to build up His world.
{99}
A.B. In @Genesis 32 Jacob comes with his family; in chapter 33 Esau comes with four hundred men, there is no mention of his family.
J.T. Jacob makes much of the household. He caused his family to pass before Esau in chapter 33. Jacob valued the family side; and when you come to Rachel, Joseph was put before his mother, showing the spiritual element on Jacob's side in family matters. Christ is to be before all.
E.G.McA. In God saying to the serpent, the woman's seed "shall crush thy head", He is taking up for His own work what Satan thought he had spoiled.
J.T. Yes. Satan attacks through the most vulnerable side, he is attacking the young people now in that sense. God takes up *some* young people, not all, alas! and makes servants out of them. The seed of the woman is used, she was deceived for the moment, but her seed "shall crush thy head", is triumph; it is Christ on man's side.
G.A.T. The male side is attacked through the female.
J.T. It was Satan; the male seed is in view from the outset; that authoritative and administrative element of the human race. Satan knew he could not directly attack Adam, but he employed Eve, because she was weaker. He will have the same difficulty in this new movement of God seen in Exodus. Thus the males must be out of the way, they are more difficult to overcome. It is a question of what the respective sexes represent. The male is the intelligent governing element; the female the subjective, and hence extending to the general state among the saints. This may be reversed literally through divine formation in the sisters. Scripture furnishes many examples of this, as Hannah, Abigail and Manoah's wife.
Ques. God created male and female; is it to bring out the balance there is in creation, they are to have dominion?
{100}
J.T. We have the word "Man" in @Genesis 1:27, but chapter 2 brings out the detail; that he was made, formed of material already existing. The woman is not created out of the dust, like Adam, she is builded out of the rib. The position is perfectly poised. And God had brought the lower creatures to man to see what he would call them; what he called each, that was its name. In effect, God said of man, There is no one like him; it is not good that he should be alone. He caused a deep sleep to fall upon man, and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its stead. He built this rib that He had taken from man, into a woman and brought her to man, without saying anything as to where she came from; it is to bring out what man was, his intelligence. God just brought her to him, "And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman"; this was a new word in his vocabulary. It is the beginning of man as relative to his wife; he called her by name. The name he gave her evidences his intelligence, because he did not *see* how she had been made; he could see she was himself over again. God says, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife". The conversation that would go on between Adam and his wife would be delightful to God; there was perfect balance, because he was her origin.
J.D. Piety would always have the maintenance of the male line in view.
J.T. Therefore the salvation of the male children was not a matter of philanthropy; God's rights were involved. The two midwives point to the assembly as caring for the male element in view of the testimony. Pharaoh's edict would cause the Israelites to decrease; besides this the women would be affected by their sufferings. They feared God and He made them houses. There is a standing testimony to what God thinks of such feelings and service.
G.A.T. They were not afraid of the king.
{101}
J.T. That is an element of faith, that you do not fear the enemy. The Lord Jesus says, "Fear not them which kill the body" (@Matthew 10:28). These women had the fear of God, which is a great feature. Human life is very cheap now in certain parts of the world, but they can do no more than kill you. God can do more than that, the Lord says; He can destroy body and soul in hell, so we must fear Him. The king of Egypt, "who did not know Joseph" is Satan in type; rulers who do not know Christ are ruthless. The world depends on males. The Lord says, "I am not come to destroy men's lives but to save them". A follower of Jesus cannot take the sword to kill a man. The christian says, "For thy sake we are killed all the day long" (@Romans 8:36); *we* are killed, not we shall kill others.
A.E.H. There are young men who do not go into active service in the army, but into munition works of various kinds; would that be damaging?
J.T. Of course people have to work with their hands. Government is good and must have a sword. If the government want you to do work of that kind, you cannot refuse as a christian. If you have to work overtime, God can come in and give you relief. It is wonderful what the Lord's people are able to do in spite of exacting employment. If needing employment I would rather work for the government than anyone else, but not to take life. "All who take the sword shall perish by the sword" (@Matthew 26:52). The christian cannot take the sword.
The word "Man" in @Genesis 1:27, viewed spiritually, covers sisters as well as brothers; but the feature expressed there is that which in the males is specially to represent God, and these midwives typify an element that has that in mind all the time. The fear of God is brought into it. It is very striking.
These names have come down the centuries to us, and their houses. You could not get a better style of house than what God would make for them, and they
{102}
would pass that down to the young people. A young man might say, One of these women saved my life. That element comes down and is an accumulative thought. He would have respect for that sister and her house, and perhaps would like to pattern his own house after hers. This divine strain was to go right down through Israel in the testimony.
G.A.T. It would exercise me as to what I have in my house.
J.T. What is your motive in building a house? This is a challenge to us; God takes into account that He is considered in such a matter -- that a God-fearing person built that house.
E.G.McA. There would be no houses in Egypt like those of these women.
J.T. Pharaoh's house would be nothing compared to them morally.
W.G.T. There is the cry of the *man* of Macedonia, and then Lydia says, "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there" (@Acts 16:15). The man of God cannot come into my house if it is worldly.
W.B-w. In the book of Genesis there was more latitude than in this book.
J.T. Yes; take the history of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi; the first represented natural corruption; and Simeon and Levi slew men; their rage was cruel. There was want of restraint, but now God is going to pass them through suffering, placing them under restraint. There was a great want of restraint in Jacob's house.
E.C. With the incoming of the law, restraint takes place. Romans says sin is not put to account until the law (@Romans 5:13).
J.T. The service the law renders should be well understood. By it is knowledge of sin (@Romans 3:20); it came in, in order that the offence might abound
{103}
(@Romans 5:20); and "in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful" (@Romans 7:13).
S.P. Would Ephesians develop manhood, as seen in the exhortations in chapter 5 to husbands and wives, and in chapter 6 to children and servants?
J.T. Yes. Wives come first, then husbands, children and servants. Satan attacks at the weakest point, and this is in persons specially in the place of subjection, such as wives, children and servants. Those under restraint are apt to be irritable and resentful. You can see throughout Scripture how God resents the want of control in households.
W.G.S. Would the family Bible readings help in the way of restraint?
J.T. Very much; you could get up a little earlier to extend it. Making it fit into a minute or two is not much for God; five or ten minutes earlier means sacrifice. God speaks of Himself getting up early to send prophets, and we surely should get up early to hear what the prophets have to say.
H.B. Pharaoh ordered the males to be *cast* into the river; Moses¬ mother laid him in the sedge.
J.T. Yes, she *hid* him first, then laid him in the sedge on the bank of the river. Moses¬ mother did not cast him in; the casting is Satan's work, that was destruction. In chapter 15 *wood* is found and cast into the bitter waters. Christ was cast in; He died at the will of another; they "killed the Prince of life". It was positive murder to *cast* the children in. Moses was laid in the sedge on the bank of the river. It was death as expressed in baptism. As living on here the believer must experience death. That is the thing to see.
J.D. @Exodus 1:22 is Pharaoh's charge to all his people, every son is to be cast into the river. Evidently Moses¬ mother disobeyed that.
J.T. She "did not fear the injunction of the king" (@Hebrews 11:23). Still she put the child in the river. She
{104}
did it in this way so that he did not drown; he was taken out again by other hands.
G.A.T. There is affection in the exercise gone through in making the "ark of reeds".
J.T. The New Testament comments on this; but what her feelings must have been! There is the gentleness of affection, but the child must go that way -- through death.
J.T.Jr. There is no cruelty in Levi here; there is in Genesis; this is the feeling side, and intelligence in the home.
J.T. Evidently that had been judged before God. We may rightly connect this passage with what is said of Levi in @Deuteronomy 33. In @Exodus 1 they are "the sons of Israel"; it is a spiritual thought.
Rem. In verse 2 Moses is called "a son", in verse 3 "the child" and in verse 6 "the boy".
J.T. Sonship is family dignity. The first use of the word *son* in Scripture is in relation to Cain; he called his city after the name of his son. Family dignity in the world is seen in this, but God has taken up the word *son* to indicate dignity that is opposite to the world. The sons of Israel came each with his household, we are told. In verse 6 Pharaoh's daughter opened the ark "and saw the child, and behold, the boy wept". Child is a general term, it may mean one of either sex. Boy is development -- what Pharaoh's daughter saw would suggest development; he wept; he is going to be a man of feeling, and that for others.
S.P. Herod slew all the boys in Bethlehem.
J.T. Then we have "Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not" (@Matthew 2:16-18).
Ques. What is the river?
J.T. It is a figure of death in an active sense. "Death reigned from Adam to Moses" (@Romans 5:14). His mother put him in the river; it is baptism. The eunuch asked
{105}
"What hinders my being baptised?" No one can question it, the believer accepts death for his child.
E.G.McA. There is much developed in the background here -- this man of the tribe of Levi and a daughter of Levi deliberately setting up a home. It says in @Malachi 2:5 "and he feared me, and trembled before my name".
J.T. This ought to enter into all marriages of believers; they should be sons and daughters of Levi. It is a very good thought that is worked out by the Spirit of God in the couple, and the result -- Moses and Aaron -- the great product in the history of Levi. Phinehas shines in the testimony in @Numbers 25:6-9. He deals ruthlessly with wickedness and God gives to him the covenant of an everlasting priesthood. We must deal ruthlessly with positive wickedness. We have *five* women here looking after the male children. Some are risking their lives with no personal consideration in the matter. In the early verses of chapter 2 there are two, Moses¬ mother and sister, they are serving God and He is honouring them. It is a standing testimony of what women's service may be in this matter.
J.S.T. The boy wept; his later features are indicated in that. Moses was to shine in feelings for God and His people.
J.T. No one *felt* more in this sense in his day. Because of the killing of the boys by Herod (@Matthew 2), we have a wail coming down from Genesis, through Jeremiah, to Matthew -- Rachel weeping.
H.B. The boy indicates his identity: "This is one of the Hebrews¬ children".
J.T. Yes, it is the reproach of Christ. Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ; as grown, he identified himself with the Hebrews.
J.S.T. With regard to trade unions, there is much suffering to many who cannot join them because of the truth; they are suffering for righteousness. This
{106}
should draw out from us all, feelings of sympathy. The Lord said to the Jews, "That all righteous blood shed upon the earth should come upon *you*, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar" (@Matthew 23:35).
J.T. *Righteous* blood from Abel to Zacharias, it is very touching. God said to Cain, "The voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground" (@Genesis 4:10). All that is done against God's people comes unfailingly into His reckoning.
C.T. What is the thought of God using Pharaoh's daughter as His servant?
J.T. We have to pay attention to any divine trait that we see. Here Pharaoh's daughter is used as Moses¬ saviour; she names him Moses, meaning *drawn out*. She is an example of how God uses persons outwardly in the enemy's camp to defeat him. There was an element of good there; she was not cruel like her father. We may always look for something of this. Pilate's wife is an example.
J.T.Jr. Would this chapter lead us to think that a sister might take the lead in the thought of baptism?
J.T. I think so. It is remarkable that Lydia's is the first household said to have been baptised. The mother is nearest to the children, and thus normally would have a peculiar interest in this important matter. Moses¬ mother did not put him out in the main stream; she put him where he would be preserved from its power; it is the thoughtfulness of affection in her.
J.T.Jr. The child is weeping, being in different circumstances. He was accustomed to being in his mother's arms; this would bring out the great place a mother's affections have.
J.T. Little children having been brought to the Lord that He might touch them, it is said, "having taken them in his arms, having laid his hands on them, he blessed them" (@Mark 10:16). In @Matthew 19:15,
{107}
it is said, "having laid his hands upon them, he departed thence", as much as to say, You must look after them now; putting it on the parents. Moses¬ mother and father are models for us as to what we see potentially in our children, and show how we are to use every effort to save them. The first thing is to have them baptised. In this we bring them formally and openly to the Lord and own that His death is the only ground of their salvation.
G.A.T. God says of Abraham, "I know him that he will command his children and his household after him" (@Genesis 18:19).
S.P. There is a fine touch in @Acts 21:5. Luke writes of leaving Tyre with Paul and others and says, "All of them accompanying us, with wives and children, till we were out of the city. And kneeling down upon the shore we prayed". They brought their children under the influence of Paul. That is a very beautiful scene.
A.E.H. Putting him in the sedge shows love's influence thrown around the children, and this, combined with the practical side in making the ark, saved Moses from being carried down the river.
J.T. The force of the current is broken by the sedge; it was something living. It is the life that surrounds the children which holds them. The ark in the river would be death in its application, but in the sense of which we have spoken.
A.B. She bore a son and saw that he was fair; fair to God (@Acts 7).
J.T. Son is potential; of course *son* is a male child, but it involves more; the full thought of God is in mind, and Moses is on the way to it. At the outset God made a man and a woman; "sons of men" (@Proverbs 8:31), would mean manhood in the freshness and energy of life in sonship.
Rem. Had Moses¬ mother not put the child in the ark, the servants of Pharaoh might have discovered
{108}
him and cast him into the river; it is moral death for the child that is *not* baptised.
J.T. The ark represents the element of protection entering into baptism. Death is accepted, but overcome: "In which ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead" (@Colossians 2:12). The ark was secure against the force of the water. The truth is that while the water of baptism is death, it is robbed of its power, Christ having come out of it. Faith understands this, hence in Colossians baptism implies resurrection: "through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead".
J.K. His sister stood afar off to see what happened. Baptism is not enough, living interest must be maintained.
J.T. Yes. In a sister here.
E.McA. A sister could be a resource; we owe a great deal to spiritual sisters.
J.T. She understood nursing; she speaks intelligently, saying, "Shall I go and call thee a wet-nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?" (@Exodus 2:7). She is one of the group of three saving this boy; she would take note of the weeping. She was his sister and knew what to say.
W.B-w. When he was grown he came into fellowship.
J.T. The word *grown* is to be noted, and the growth accompanied by right feelings. Baptism is not a mere religious rite; that is, not from God's point of view. The mother took the child and nursed it, and she gets wages. Another idea of growth is that when he became *great*, as the New Testament says, he went out and looked on his brethren. We ought to see that growth implies interest in the brethren. I want to see what my brethren are suffering, and I am with them in it. Of Moses it is said, "choosing rather to suffer affliction along with the people of God" (@Hebrews 11:25).
{109}
Rem. Full dignity in the royal household would be his position in Egypt.
J.T. Yes. He was evidently brought up as a prince.
Ques. Would the mother nursing the child for Pharaoh's daughter bring in right influence?
J.T. She is now a servant and gets wages. She had him until a certain age; it was to his advantage; he came under his mother's influence in time of nursing. This was clearly of God.
J.D. The discipline that God puts Moses through in Midian is in keeping with what is before us.
J.T. Yes. And this results in a change in Moses; a complete change in his humanity. Jehovah enquires of him, "What is that in thy hand?" A staff; no doubt what he had been using in tending the sheep; it was in his hand. God says to him, "Cast it on the ground". It is to demonstrate that humanity had got completely out of hand. Man came under satanic power. The staff became a serpent; that is, what I am capable of. "Take it by the tail", God said, and it became a staff; in that we see humanity brought under control again. The word in @Romans 6:11 deals with the matter, "reckon yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus". Man is taken under control through and in Christ -- in a new order of manhood. We are baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus, and to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; it is a question of light, privilege and power. We reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus; I am alive in Christ. I believe that is meant here. Man is taken *back* -- the divine idea resumed *in Christ*.
J.T.Jr. There was no restraint when Moses slew the Egyptian, but in his second forty years he sat down by the well. He would say, I slew that Egyptian in my own strength; but now I see I am to use the power of God -- the Spirit. It is man taken up in a new way; God now finding His delight in him.
{110}
J.S.T. Paul speaks of "admonishing every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ" (@Colossians 1:28).
J.T. Every *man* perfect in Christ -- what a great thought!
W.B-w. Moses has power over the serpent as he gets hold of it by the tail.
J.T. Yes. There is an immediate change to the primary thoughts. Look at Levi, he was a man marked by evil; instruments of cruelty were in his hand, but now he is another man; the victory is complete in Phinehas as he uses, by his hand, a javelin in ruthlessly dealing with sin (@Numbers 25:7,8).
A.E.H. Is it not touching that God gives Moses at the beginning an intimation of what the end of his service would be -- complete deliverance of Israel out of Egypt? "I will be with thee; and this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain" (@Exodus 3:12).
J.T. The sign there is that they should "serve God upon this mountain". The signs in chapter 4 refer to the way God has brought about a *change in man*, answering to His own thought.
W.B-w. Moses comes into humble circumstances. Is this a reminder to the young men who would serve to be willing to accept reduction?
J.T. Yes. This thought works out in a remarkable way. There was a great disparity in Moses¬ circumstances in Midian to what he was used to in Egypt. It is said, "Moses consented to remain with the man", not wishing to have something greater. He is serving as a shepherd, and learning all the time, able to take in the divine instruction. He is developing in *manhood*, and in due time God will take him on. Continuing in the spirit in which he slew the Egyptian, Moses would have damaged the testimony, but he is subdued, and suitable for God's service. God is asserting Himself
{111}
and Moses recognised it, and would be in accord with God's way. God would have him experience forty years in humble life; then He takes him up and uses him. Paul was a wild man doing anything he liked against the people of God, but he became like a little child.
The next thing in Moses¬ experience refers to his bosom -- his affections (@Exodus 4:6,7). "Put now thy hand into thy bosom." It became leprous. Man's *state* had become corrupted. Moses is directed to put his hand in the second time, and it was turned again as his flesh. Paul says, "Put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness" (@Ephesians 4:24).
W.B-w. He acquires ability to handle the enemy as he seeks to attack God's people. Paul shakes off the viper in @Acts 28:5.
J.T. That refers to the first sign; the staff turned into a serpent. The most advanced of us are liable to come under dark influences. The incident in @Acts 28 is remarkable, as showing the power over the enemy which the Lord gives to His servants. He says, "These signs shall follow those that have believed: in my name they shall cast out demons: ... they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them" (@Mark 16:17,18).
And then, as remarked, we have the second sign, which refers to man's inward state. The believer is purified by the gracious work of God through redemption. "But ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God" (@1 Corinthians 6:11). This is included in the new man, as remarked above.
{112}
MANHOOD IN EXODUS (2)
@Exodus 4:10-17; @Exodus 6:20-30; @Exodus 7:1,2; @Exodus 12:11-20; @Exodus 16:4,14
J.T. We finished this morning by commenting on the change of humanity indicated in the instruction to Moses in @Exodus 4 -- man taken up again in Christ. Hence in baptism we reckon ourselves "dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus", @Romans 6:11. It is man in Christ henceforth, as to his justification, subjection to God, and his inward state. In @Romans 5 it is "through our Lord Jesus Christ", and in @Romans 6 it is in Christ Jesus". In @Romans 7 the inward state of man is rectified; the writer thanks God for his deliverance. Moses put his hand into his bosom and it became leprous; he put it in again and it turned again as his flesh. The inward state of man is corrected -- in keeping with his position *in Christ*. The Holy Spirit becomes the power henceforth according to @Romans 8. Chapter 7 is the *light* for adjustment; chapter 8 is the power -- the Spirit *in* the believer.
The next point in regard to our subject is the question of *speaking*, for we are to speak aright. The Lord, we are told in @Mark 7, in dealing with this matter of speech took the man apart from the crowd; "he put his fingers to his ears; and having spit, he touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven he groaned". The result was that "he spoke right". This matter comes up here. Moses says, "I am not eloquent". God brings out the truth as to the power of speech. "Who gave man a mouth? or who maketh dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? have not I, Jehovah? And now go, and I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shalt say". God further says to him, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well". God's word to Moses brings in another man besides Moses, distinguished in the
{113}
service; the want of faith in the servant Moses is thus overruled. God never looks at these matters as accidental. He overrules so that everything is according to His mind. Aaron is brought in, and God says, "I know that he can speak well". He knew him in relation to speaking. God had Aaron ready for this emergency. The work of God is to go on; God is ready for any emergency caused by a defect in any of us, so that the service goes on. In connection with that we have a *brother*. The person who remedies the difficulty is not going to detract from the position. He is a brother. God said, "And when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart".
Following on that is the idea of the representation of God in testimony in manhood. In chapter 7 we have representation of God in a system, as we may say. Jehovah says to Moses, "I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet". Aaron was to speak to the people, and now he is to speak to Pharaoh. That is what I thought we might consider first.
Then secondly the question of *food*; this is essential to manhood. What we are given to eat is provided by God (chapters 12 and 16).
E.G.McA. How could a brother coming in help one that is slow of speech?
J.T. I think Aaron here typifies the resourcefulness of God. God never regards anything as an accident; there may be something to be deplored, but it is not irremediable in God's account.
G.A.T. Is it important to see that Jehovah did not set Moses aside when He brought the brother in?
J.T. Yes. God had no thought of setting him aside; his deficiency was to be made up in Aaron.
A.Pf. We do not get any previous history of Aaron. Of Moses we do.
J.T. God had him in reserve, and he is just the man needed, and his qualification is already known to God.
{114}
It shows the divine training school is always functioning, and thus needed ones are ready. Such a one will be of use when the time comes; he is just the man.
J.D. What do you think of Jehovah being angry with Moses?
J.T. It is remarkable how much is said of God being angry with Moses. Each of us has to learn that. He is the God of grace, but when it comes to a servant, a man that should know better -- in such cases God is severe. For instance, God met Moses at the inn, and was going to slay him (@Exodus 4:24). I think it is to produce seriousness in us, as we are dealing with God in His service. He will not brook our wills. His service is too serious a matter. Christ as His Servant is our example in service. Moses says, typically of Christ, "And Jehovah was angry with me on your account" (@Deuteronomy 4:21); that is *vicariously*. I have to learn that for my own soul. God hid His face from Christ. "Why hast thou forsaken me?" the Lord said.
W.B-w. It is easier to complain than to take on the principle of restraint. "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death" (@Romans 8:2). In the light of @Romans 7, and as having the Spirit, we are able to restrain ourselves.
J.T. Yes; "if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (@Romans 8:1). The severest thing we have to go through is to be "reckoned as sheep for slaughter" (Romans 8:36). The apostle contemplates the saints as in that position. It is very severe. Our brethren are suffering something like that, but where God allows that, He furnishes grace to meet it. Look at what Paul says in @2 Corinthians 11:23-27; he gives a list of things he suffered. "From the Jews five times have I received forty stripes, save one." The alleviation "save one", would indicate that God intervened. What must he have gone through afterwards!
{115}
One stripe was deducted because God did not allow the lash to go further than he could bear.
G.A.T. Was God angry with Christ?
J.T. Moses says, speaking typically of the Lord, "Jehovah was angry with me on your account"; it was on Israel's account; he suffered instead of them. It was a vicarious position. It refers to the penalty of sin which could have no application to the Lord save as taking our place on the cross. In this sense Christ suffered for Israel and for us. Personally He was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners" (@Hebrews 7:26). The exact words of Jesus on the cross are given; "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (@Matthew 27:46). God's wrath was against sin, but it was meted out to Christ as taking our place. He was *made* sin for us (@2 Corinthians 5:21).
Rem. Moses returned to Jethro and requested him to let him go (@Exodus 4:18); and Jethro said, "Go in peace". Moses was thus free to take up his service.
J.T. Yes; a serious thing came in afterwards; "Jehovah came upon him, and sought to slay him". This is very remarkable, and shows the severity of God with His servants, when they disregard His word or principles. Moses ought to have known better than to allow his child to be uncircumcised.
J.D. Moses said to God, "I am not eloquent", but in the service it is a question of substance.
J.T. This is strikingly seen in Moses. What a wonderful servant he becomes! Jehovah says, "My servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house. Mouth to mouth do I speak to him openly, and not in riddles; and the form of Jehovah doth he behold"(@Numbers 12:7,8). Moses is to be God to Pharaoh, and Aaron is to be his prophet.
N.B. How is this going to work out practically in localities amongst us? Moses and Aaron were outstanding brothers. A brother may not be able to say anything. How would this affect us?
{116}
J.T. We may learn from what is before us. The bringing of these two brothers together involves the principles of balancing. Moses is three years younger than Aaron. The principle of balancing must come into the testimony, as in the "balancings of the clouds" (@Job 37:16). The idea of *system* enters into the testimony, especially as seen in Exodus. You must have two or more and so there must be the principle of balance, otherwise there is complaint and rivalry. Aaron was an older man, and he could speak well and Moses could not; moreover he was brotherly, he loved his brother. God said to Moses, "When he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart". Well, there must be in Moses what will balance all that, and there was -- evidently not only gift, but *moral* qualities. These are what Jehovah alludes to in @Numbers 12. Thus whatever one may lack can be made up on moral lines, as the word to Timothy indicates -- "Let no one despise thy youth" (@1 Timothy 4:12).
At the outset all was well, for "Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel; and Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people. And the people believed. And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped" (@Exodus 4:29-31). That is a fine result. You could not get anything better. God's ways are good. The result of the service of these two men working together is that the people believed and they worshipped God.
E.C. The Lord sent out the twelve and the seventy disciples two by two (@Matthew 10:2-4, @Luke 10:1).
J.T. We have that now. One by one, and two by two as well; but a system is involved -- centred in Christ in heaven. Sometimes it is better to be isolated, ministering to your brethren, but at other times you can get on better with another. That may mean that
{117}
you must be able to take second place. You find Peter and John together. Peter is always active, but John is *there*. He *adds* to the position, although he may not be active. In certain circumstances in the service of God some possessing ability to serve may be present, but not taking verbal part, but their sympathy and spirituality add greatly to the position.
C.T. It augments worship in the company. These two being found together in ministry effected this in the people.
J.T. Moses has to take first place, but he is not pushing himself. The appointment of God required this.
Rem. "He was mighty in his words and deeds" (@Acts 7:22). Here he says he cannot speak.
J.T. He is not relying on his natural education or ability. God had brought him down. He had gone too far in speaking of himself. We may take the attitude of smallness and be unbelieving in it.
A.B. God says to him, "And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the other sign" (@Exodus 4:8). Testimony in two signs and testimony in two men.
J.T. Yes. The Lord brings out that principle in regard to the Father Himself testifying (@John 8:17). Aaron brought forward in this way is striking. He completes the position.
A.E.H. In the beginning of Luke we have a priest speaking in unbelief. Zacharias speaks wrong, and then learns to speak right.
J.T. Yes. How one dispensation merges into another is strikingly seen in Zacharias; being a priest according to the law of Moses, he becomes a priest and prophet according to the Spirit. "Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth" (@Luke 1:5). Both were fully accredited, but he has to endure nine months
{118}
of dumbness because of unbelief. Then when the time is completed he writes of the promised son, "John is his name" (@Luke 1:63). It was the divine word as to John's name. Then his mouth was opened and, as a priest, he blesses God, and being filled with the Holy Spirit he prophesied -- first about Christ, and then *to* John.
J.D. Is it right to say that the Father and Son were set forth in one Person? The Lord said, "He that has seen me has seen the Father" (@John 14:9). Is the Father one witness and Christ another?
J.T. They are, of course, always two Persons. The Lord says, "I am one who bear witness concerning myself, and the Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me" (@John 8:18). It is John the evangelist who tells us that "the Father loves the Son and has given all things to be in his hand" (@John 3:35). Love is the thing in economic testimony, otherwise there will be rivalry among the servants.
G.H. "Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother" (@1 Corinthians 1:1).
J.T. That bears out the thought. He brings a brother in. The Corinthians may say, That is only Paul's word; some, that his speech is contemptible; but he associates others with himself to give force and attractiveness to his service. That is what comes out in Aaron, in whom we have the brotherly element.
W.G.T. Jacob was seeking to avoid his brother Esau in @Genesis 32. Though a false brother, Esau would have to be reckoned with.
J.T. I think it was of God that Esau should be appeased. Jacob sends a message, in which he tells Esau of his property, including bondmen and bondwomen (@Genesis 32:5). He told him how much he had, but Esau would not be helped by hearing that; he was himself a rich man. Esau came to meet him with four hundred men, which caused Jacob great concern (verses 6,7). He began to pray (verses 9-12); and God met him
{119}
and humbled him in a natural sense, but blessed him. Spiritually he drops the idea of being a rich man; he is now a lame man; he is limping, but he has a change of name. His name is now Israel, and he meets Esau as Israel. He is now a spiritual man. He makes Esau a present of some cattle. It is a question of love now. Jacob arranges his wives and children to pass before Esau, and in this Joseph takes priority to his mother. Thus Jacob meets his brother on spiritual lines, and they are able to kiss one another (@Genesis 33:4). In this way brotherly conditions prevailed for the moment. In the procedure a testimony was rendered to Esau. It must have liberated Jacob's spirit. In view of the purpose of God as to Jacob, it was of importance that as constituted spiritual, according to chapter 32, he and his household should appear before Esau at this time. Esau was affected for the moment, and this would be used of God later.
A.B. There is a definite change in Jacob in that chapter. He reached Esau's affections so that he took a blessing or gift. There is advancement.
J.T. We are all to be set to affect people in this way.
J.W. "I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam" (@Micah 6:4).
J.T. What discipline they had been through! All three were far advanced in years as taken into service.
T.S. Has the ability to speak well any relation to our speaking to God?
J.T. Yes. One says, "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah" (@Psalm 19:14). I suppose God had heard Aaron in this way. As taken up in view of being high priest, there can be no doubt he had been accustomed to pray.
N.B. As to things amongst ourselves, does gift enter into the matter of speaking? Does prophecy as referred to in 1 Corinthians imply good speaking?
{120}
J.T. The power of speech refers to the vessel. We have to distinguish between the vessel, and what is in the vessel. The vessel is *designed* creatively. God has made us all, and He refers to that fact in saying to Moses "Who gave a man a mouth ... have not I, Jehovah?". In giving a gift, God takes account of the man long before he was born. He sees to the circumstances of his birth and education. The vessel is one thing, a spiritual gift is another. The gift is to be the expression of Christ in him. He may be able to speak well about anything, but he is to see that God has taken him up to speak well of Christ. The greatest speaker was, of course, Christ. They marvelled at His manner of speaking (@Luke 4:22). You do not want to speak out of accord with Him. Peter and James and John and the other apostles were specially qualified to speak. The twelve spoke in a remarkable way. "Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them." The Spirit was in him. And having heard, three thousand were converted. At Iconium, Paul and Barnabas "so spake that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed" (@Acts 14:1). All the hundred and twenty might speak of Christ, but it is important to distinguish those who speak formally in testimony as representative of God. Peter and the eleven were such at Pentecost. You do not want a man speaking to Pharaoh that, through want of ability, would discredit what he has to say. Moses would know how to speak to a man like Pharaoh, but while Moses was to speak to him, Jehovah said, "Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land". This shows how important the matter of speaking was at that time.
J.McK. John the evangelist remarks, "There was a man sent from God, his name John" (@John 1:6). The Baptist could say of himself that he was "the voice of one crying in the wilderness" (@John 1:23).
{121}
J.T. I think the brethren would do well to consider the difference between the vessel, and what is in the vessel. In @Ephesians 4 the vessel is included in the gift; "*he* has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers". He gave them to the assembly. The passage does not say the *gift* of prophecy, etc. The apostles were given to the assembly, their bodies, their minds; it means all that they were by the grace of God. In the service of God effective speaking is stressed; as remarked of Paul and Barnabas at Iconium they "so spake that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed;" and at Lystra, Paul was regarded as the chief speaker (@Acts 14). And yet one at Corinth said, "His presence in the body weak, and his speech naught", (@2 Corinthians 10:10).
E.G.McA. Do we get the two in Paul's statement of himself; "God, who set me apart even from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me"? (@Galatians 1:15).
J.T. Yes. The whole man is there as a gift. In Aaron and Moses you have the whole position as to testimony set out. Moses is not going to Pharaoh alone; he is going in the system God has established; he represents God before Pharaoh. He is to be like God, as it was said to him, "See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet". This thought deserves great consideration. Was he cowering in Pharaoh's presence? No! He stood up like a man to represent God. You must be a man to represent God -- "Let us make man in our image" (@Genesis 1:26).
S.P. Is it seen in the Lord Himself as He speaks as one having authority and not as the scribes?
J.T. Quite so. It is worthy of consideration. In the gospels great men and poor men are seen as in contact with the Lord. He never says a word to Herod, but He speaks to Pilate, and in a most instructive way. Of Paul, the Lord said that he was "to bear my name
{122}
before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel" (@Acts 9:15). Consider Paul's address before Agrippa. Besides the king, several grandees were sitting on the bench. "Paul, stretching out his hand" said, among many things, "I would to God, both in little and in much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as *I* also am, except these bonds" (@Acts 26:29) -- "as *I* also am, except these bonds" -- that is how he finished. What triumph in manhood!
Rem. "I have believed, therefore have I spoken" (@2 Corinthians 4:13).
J.T. That shows that speaking in God's service should not be apart from faith. It is a quotation from @Psalm 116:10.
W.B-w. In what way does circumcision help Moses into manhood?
J.T. It was Colossian truth he was defective in, as *many* of us are. Philosophy and vain deceit could only be met by circumcision. Man as in the flesh is no good at all; leprosy is in him. Circumcision is the putting off of the body of flesh (@Colossians 2:11). Leprosy in the head is ability used in God's service which is merely natural. Moses was well brought up, taught in the wisdom of Egypt, "and he was mighty in his words and deeds" (@Acts 7:22). He stood before the greatest men in Egypt and talked to them. Is he to bring that into the service of God? No. He neglected circumcision, and hence there would be in him the danger, as in the service of Jehovah, of having recourse to what marked him in Egypt.
N.B. Zipporah did not want circumcision.
J.T. Clearly so. Education and the polish that goes with it are apt to deceive us, and may be regarded as adornment in christianity. Circumcision meets this. Moses had evidently neglected circumcision, but he became a type of Christ in enforcing it. The sovereignty of God enters into the selection of His servants, and
{123}
we must accept them as He provides them. Zipporah was a Midianite, and as the wife of a great servant of God it was most important that she should bow to the truth of circumcision.
W.G.T. The radio has a social place, especially where men are talking about the things of the day. Moses and Zipporah were at the inn. Hotels cater for men's natural sensibilities. Hence the need of accepting circumcision in view of our public relations.
G.A.T. Would you say the wives are against this truth?
J.T. Well, what is stated of Zipporah has surely a voice for them.
J.D. Paul says of the things of God, "which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual things by spiritual means" (@1 Corinthians 2:13).
J.T. That is a most appropriate word for us all.
E.G.McA. The incident in the inn would show that anyone who does not accept circumcision in his service and testimony will end in death morally.
J.T. God hates the bringing of mere natural ability into His service. Apollos was an eloquent man, mighty in the Scriptures, and God used him. "For he with great force convinced the Jews publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ" (@Acts 18:28).
A.E.H. As regards baptism and circumcision in Colossians: is baptism the application of death to me as in this present world; and circumcision the application of death to me in regard of entrance into another sphere and the things of God?
J.T. Colossians puts circumcision before baptism; then quickening. "Ye have been circumcised with circumcision not done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ" (@Colossians 2:11) -- the totality of the flesh, not a shred of it to be left in the service of God. The bearing of baptism is towards the world; I reckon myself dead
{124}
indeed unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus. But in Colossians it involves resurrection: "in which ye have been also raised with him" (@Colossians 2:12).
J.T.Jr. There was unbelief in Zipporah in regard to circumcision; refusal of it; hence the complaint against her husband.
J.T. The whole position was in danger by it -- after all that God had done in bringing Moses forward. This position of the two in regard to circumcision was so serious, because Moses was *responsible*. Thus the *severity* of God as to him is seen; Jehovah was about to slay Moses.
W.G.T. His wife did the thing.
J.T. Yes, but she bitterly reproached her husband. It was done, however, and hence the Spirit says, "he let him go" (@Exodus 4:25).
J.S.T. Abraham enforced it in his household.
J.T. That is where the truth of it comes out and is applied in the most complete way, in @Genesis 17. God changes Abram's name there. The extension of the name implied circumcision; the new name was to work out in the power of the Spirit. Clearly the application in such thoroughness in Abraham's house, according to @Genesis 17, is the ground of the divine visitation in chapter 18. There Abraham is the friend of God.
W.B-w. Moses enforces the thing here, and God says to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses".
J.T. Yes; the position is thus stabilised. All this is leading up to the testimony to the people by Moses and Aaron; and then the testimony to Pharaoh in Egypt. One thing that comes out is skill in the service as it proceeds.
This chapter is to bring out the levitical line. Amram and Jochebed are the names of Aaron's and Moses¬ father and mother. Aaron is not mentioned until he is 83, and Miriam is not mentioned by name until she is even older. God is placing *qualities* before names; now we have the names. "And Aaron
{125}
took Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, as wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar". These are important personages. Then we have "Eleazar Aaron's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and she bore him Phinehas". The end of the genealogy here is in Phinehas; in him we come to *genuine* priesthood. We have in the priesthood a carefully selected line; no mixed marriages; no unconverted husbands or wives taken into the marriage contract. This is the most difficult thing we have to do with today.
E.G.McA. There should be the endorsement of God in every marriage.
W.G.T. Phinehas was raised up to deal with an ungodly marriage.
J.T. He is figurative of Christ. He has an everlasting priesthood (@Numbers 25:13).
G.A.T. How would you deal with ungodly marriages today?
J.T. They are condemned in Scripture. We ought to condemn them and refuse them. It is one of the most baneful things we have. We *must* deal with it; and in doing this to preserve the fellowship, the Lord will be with us. If those involved refuse to listen to their brethren, they add to their guilt and they must be refused as unfit for the fellowship of Christ's death.
G.A.T. The person not breaking bread may be a christian.
J.T. If he is a christian he ought to be in fellowship, otherwise he is questionable. He does not prove his genealogy if he does not come in. Certain ones were disallowed in the recovery in Nehemiah and Ezra because they did not show their pedigree.
W.B-w. The Spirit of God says, "This is that Aaron and Moses".
J.T. In verse 27 it is "this is that Moses and Aaron". From the priestly side Aaron is first; from the apostolic side Moses is first, so that there is perfect balance.
{126}
The first reference may imply Aaron's priority of age, the latter to Moses¬ priority morally and officially. This appears more and more in the history.
Ques. Moses¬ family is not much spoken of; why is this?
J.T. They are mentioned as Levites, some of them with distinction in the days of David (@1 Chronicles 26). But considering the great place Moses had in the testimony, the comparatively small place his family had is to be sorrowfully noted. The fact may be intended to remind us that authority alone in the father cannot be a guarantee for a godly family. Besides, Zipporah, being a Midianite, would not tend to develop "a wholly right seed". Her history would show this.
J.T.Jr. Moses¬ grandson was an idolator -- the first paid priest (@Judges 18:30). Phinehas came of the line of Aaron.
J.T. In connection with the terrible conflict with Benjamin (@Judges 20), Phinehas, the faithful priest, is mentioned. But Jehonathan, the grandson of Moses, is mentioned as an idolatrous priest, as already remarked, in chapter 18:30. J.N.D.¬s note shows that some copyist sought to conceal this by corrupting the text.
J.D. You would fear for a brother in fellowship taking a sister outside.
J.T. When Levi was born Leah said, "Now this time will my husband be united to me" (@Genesis 29:34). The name signifies union really -- Levi.
J.D. "A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi" (@Exodus 2:1).
J.T. That is according to the divine way, and the result is according to God, as @Exodus 6 shows.
E.G.McA. Aaron and Moses, and Miriam also.
J.T. Yes. They were together used for the deliverance of Israel; they were successful in speaking to the people, as chapter 4:29-31 shows.
Pharaoh is the next consideration. The success of the ministry in Egypt depends on how these two meet
{127}
Pharaoh. They overthrew the whole Egyptian system by their ministry, and delivered God's people from it.
Rem. There seems to be something more in your mind about marriage.
J.T. We know mixed marriages are wrong. How can you expect the children to be "wholly a right seed" (@Jeremiah 2:21), and material for the assembly, where a mixed marriage is taken on? It will rather be a mongrel condition -- the book of Ezra deals with that. Of course we may have a family turning aside even when the father and mother are in fellowship, but that may mean that the truth is not maintained in the family.
Rem. Right household conditions and manhood are closely connected (@Exodus 1:1). We read of Moses¬ father as a "man" (@Exodus 2:1).
J.T. A man and his household runs through the book of Exodus. Manhood is seen in that you recognise your own parents according to what is due to them; and then bring up your own children according to what is due to the Lord and to them -- bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Thus the line is maintained.
J.T.Jr. Would it be seen too in the way you work with others? When Moses and Aaron go in before Pharaoh, "they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days¬ journey unto the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with sword" (@Exodus 5:3). This would be the result of God's operations in bringing the two men in unity.
J.T. Yes. The testimony takes the form of a system (chapter 7:1,2). It runs through chapters 7 to 11. It is completely successful. Egypt is brought down by the power of the ministry and that is what happened in apostolic testimony, as seen in Acts, the world was brought down *morally*.
We come now to chapter 12. The next thing is, how, as going out of Egypt, are we to be maintained?
{128}
It is a question of the *food* we eat. If I am to be maintained I must eat what God provides for such circumstances. Each has to learn to go on by himself. One must possess the ability to get on by himself, and stand for the rights of God under difficulties. One says, "As for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah" (@Joshua 24:15). Aaron failed in this. In the absence of Moses he gave way to the idolatrous wishes of the people. This shows the importance of each one learning to stand on his own feet in dependence on God. "Having accomplished all things, to stand. Stand therefore" (@Ephesians 6:13,14). This is not simply "doing what you can", but doing *all that should be done* see note in New Translation.
J.D. I think we would appreciate a few words on the character of food.
J.T. It is one of the most important things we can look into. The first is self-denial in what you are eating, chapter 12. That is, unleavened bread. The second is the manna; something you admire; it is a question of Christ, what He was here, in our circumstances, chapter 16. It is important to have these two thoughts before us.
A.E.H. Moses on the mount would not be getting food that would puff him up, but Aaron *with the people* lent himself to that.
J.T. The people made much of him. Those mentioned are the two ideas one had before one as to chapters 12 and 16: the first is that we are reduced, the flesh starved; and the second, Christ, as in current circumstances, as seen in the gospels. The first is self-denial, the second appreciation of Christ. The manna was "on the face of the wilderness". God said, "I will rain bread from heaven for you". It was from heaven, but here below in everyday circumstances, available to the people. It builds up manhood according to what was seen in Christ in the scene where He was in the days of His flesh, but in which He is no longer; His people are in it; and to be here as representative of Him, we must feed on the manna.
{129}
MANHOOD IN EXODUS (3)
@Exodus 20:1-6; @Exodus 21:1-6; @Exodus 24:9-11
J.T. In the early part of chapter 19 we have the statement by Jehovah, "And now, if ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples -- for all the earth is mine -- and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests" (verse 5). It is perhaps needful to dwell a little on priesthood, God having in mind that it should apply to all the people.
So as to carry the thoughts relative to our subject forward, priesthood is mentioned here, and later in this chapter there are certain ones in Israel alluded to as priests without naming them. In @Exodus 19:22 God says, "And the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, shall hallow themselves, lest Jehovah break forth on them". That is a collateral thought with what we have had. Priesthood is founded on manhood according to God, but also on sonship as applied fully in the New Testament -- the Son is the Priest. God expresses His thoughts for us and carries them forward. The full setting of priesthood is seen in chapters 28 and 29.
It is a feature of the position of God's people from the beginning. Every one who has the Holy Spirit is a priest; he may not be functioning for the want of intelligence or spiritual energy, but he still is a priest as having the Holy Spirit. What enters into this, I think, is seen in the first passage read, where God speaks of "them that love me", *lovers of God*. It is hardly worth naming a priest who does not love God, for he is to serve a God whom he loves -- a known God. To know God is to love Him. We have in this passage a statement, "I, Jehovah thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and to the fourth generation of them that hate me, and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments". That
{130}
is a point I think we might rest on. Are we among the lovers of God? It is an advance feature of manhood. It is said of our days in @2 Timothy 3:2-4 that "men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, ... lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God". Alas, that is manifest. Yet God here alludes to "thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments". No one can be regarded truly as a lover except as keeping the commandments.
G.A.T. "I love my master" (@Exodus 21) -- is that the thought?
J.T. That is the next passage. It is an advanced thought: it is love of a three-fold kind. It goes up to the master, is horizontal to the wife and descends to the children. Love to God is ascending, love to a wife is horizontal, and love to children is descending. We come to an experienced lover in chapter 21, that is, typically, Christ Himself; He is the Bondman who loves.
J.D. Paul says in @Romans 8:28, "All things work together for good to those who love God".
J.T. It is a testing passage. We are apt to say loosely, It applies to all the saints. Let us get the actual wording: "all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose". It takes us back to the counsels of God; hence you are comforted that what is transpiring amongst the brethren is for good. Lovers of God come in for good no matter what happens. "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God" (@Romans 8:16). This chapter is to bring out the victorious character of christianity. It ends triumphantly in each true believer, and as a dispensation, and that is very comforting. Loving God is a great feature of manhood; that is, manhood as in His purpose; manhood implies perfection or full growth.
S.McC. In @Judges 5:31, Deborah's song, "Let them that love him be as the rising of the sun in its might". It is a victorious idea.
{131}
J.T. Very beautiful! It might be connected with @Psalm 19:5 where you have the tabernacle for the sun, "And he is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber; he rejoiceth as a strong man to run the race".
W.G.T. If we say that we love God, the next thing is, do we keep His commandments?
J.T. Yes. "He it is that loves me" (@John 14:21). Anyone really right has a fear in claiming to love God, unless keeping the commandments.
S.P. Is this reciprocal in character? In @Exodus 19:4 God speaks of bringing them to Himself, but here in chapter 20 it is a movement of love from the people to Him, "them that love me".
J.T. I think that is the thought, the beginning of what we call the ten words. God is asserting His rights in chapter 20, and no person can deny that God has rights over His creatures; above all He has rights to their affections. Young people are told, "Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth" (@Ecclesiastes 12:1). God's rights to the affections of His people are the spirit of the law. It refers to God's rights. The great commandment is, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding. ... Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (@Matthew 22:37-39). It is a question of love fulfilling the law.
A.B. The apostle says, "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him" (@1 Corinthians 2:9).
J.T. That fits here; it is a quotation from @Isaiah 64:4, and shows what jewels you get out of the prophets. There is in it a suggestion for those of us who try to serve the Lord's people -- as to how to use the prophets; that we not only quote them, but clothe them more richly. Paul changes the words used by the prophet here.
{132}
W.G.T. As to love, @1 Corinthians 13 stresses it in a remarkable way as greater than faith and hope. Chapter 12 introduces the thought of spiritual manifestation; chapter 13 is love and chapter 14 the prophetic line.
J.T. In @1 Corinthians 16:22 the apostle says, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha"; and in chapter 12:3 he says, "No one, speaking in the power of the Spirit of God, says, Curse on Jesus". The idea of curse is turned round; such was the dreadful condition among christians at Corinth that there might be such a spirit there as would curse the Lord Jesus. "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit"; the Spirit would enable you to say that in the assembly in affection. The Holy Spirit in our hearts would cause all the out-goings to be clothed with love.
J.McK. What is the difference between the priests of @Exodus 19:6, "ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation", and @Revelation 1:6, "and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father"?
J.T. In the New Translation the passage in Revelation reads, "and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father": the saints are a kingdom by themselves, and in addition to that they are "priests to his God and Father". We have a further reference to priesthood in @Revelation 20:6, "Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection: ... they shall be priests of God and of the Christ". There they are definitely marked off as having part in the first resurrection. They are priests of God. We are characteristically that and also "of the Christ". That is, the saints are an official priesthood; that is of great importance now in regard to what is current; we are not national, but priestly; it is our proper function, it gives the saints more power than any. They are determining victory, "priests of God and of the Christ".
C.T. "A holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" (@1 Peter 2:5), is
{133}
what we are now. "Priests of God and of the Christ" (@Revelation 20:6) is a millennial function.
J.T. God in @Malachi 2:7 called attention to what priesthood really is. "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts". As we have been saying, love is a great basis; it never fails, as we see in @1 Corinthians 13. Then at the end of the chapter, "And now abide faith, hope, love; ... and the greater of these is love" (@1 Corinthians 13:13).
W.B-w. That explains the fact that keeping the covenant precedes the priesthood in this chapter, "if ye will ... keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession ... kingdom of priests" -- priesthood is on the principle of love.
J.T. As loving God, we keep His commandments. Thus we are qualified as priests. Christ, in type, saying, I love, in @Exodus 21:5, shows how infinitely fitted He was to be High Priest.
E.G.McA. Would those who love God *actively* be more conscious of all things working together for good for them, than those who do not love Him actively? With many christians love is not active towards God.
J.T. I think that is manifestly so. Our exercises just now turn on what is current in the world. How is it affecting us? We find it difficult to see *good* working out in what seems outwardly so adverse. It would relieve us a great deal if we could see the good working out to those that love God. *We should look for it*.
J.D. What is the point in "I ... am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and to the fourth generation of them that hate me, and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments"? How would the first part work today when we are not under law but under grace?
J.T. That is what God does, or *may* do, according to His sovereign right. @Deuteronomy 24: 16 directs
{134}
that "fathers shall not be put to death for the sons, neither shall the sons be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin". This, of course, is the law, which was to govern *men*. There is no difficulty in the statement, "visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and to the fourth generation". This may happen even in this dispensation of grace. It has happened to the Jews. Vengeance may be deferred, and it may not. Those that do not love the Lord Jesus *will be* cursed, that is, at the Lord's coming (@1 Corinthians 16:22), while Galatians shows that wicked teachers may be cursed *now* (chapter 1:8,9). There are people that are not to be saved at all. Some do not think of that, but Paul says, "But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost" (@2 Corinthians 4:3). When they are tested it is found that they hate God. On the other hand, the sons of Korah were saved. Psalms are inscribed to them. The sovereign mercy of God is seen there. God works of Himself and who can question Him in visiting the iniquity of the people that hate Him? On the other hand, who can question Him in exercising His rights in mercy?
G.A.T. "Who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind? Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents" (@John 9:2,3).
J.T. That is to bring out the sovereign work of God, "that the works of God should be manifested in him". That is a great principle; acting sovereignly, God may convert the son of a very bad man.
W.G.T. A man might influence his children and his grandchildren in a right or a wrong way.
J.T. A grandson of Moses was an idolatrous priest (@Judges 18:30). That is a very solemn thing.
W.B-w. The Canaanites were dispossessed of their land. Is that governmental?
J.T. Yes; but God waited and would have Israel wait until their iniquity was fully developed. "The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full" (@Genesis 15:16).
{135}
Abraham must wait for that. The patience of God is remarkable; He waited long before He struck, though the Canaanites were wicked above all people.
W.B-w. The Lord says to the Pharisees at the end of @John 9, "Your sin remains". Is that judicial?
J.T. Yes. "But now ye say, We see, your sin remains." God in His sovereign work selects whom He will to save. He follows up tribes, peoples, families, fathers, heads of houses: follows them up in a governmental way. It is a serious matter, because in the passage before us the generations of those who hate Him are visited.
E.G.McA. Are those who hate Him spoken of in @Romans 2:8,9? "But to those that are contentious, and are disobedient to the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there shall be wrath and indignation, tribulation and distress, on every soul of man that works evil".
J.T. Yes. The wrath of God is revealed against anyone on that line. The apostle puts off the curse until the Lord comes, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha". Maranatha means when the Lord comes. Then we have in Galatians, as already remarked, an immediate curse threatened. The apostle further says, "I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion" (@Galatians 5:12).
J.D. Do you think we see the government of God in the way He addresses Esau in the prophet @Obadiah 10,11: "Because of violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away captive his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them"? Government followed Esau and there was no blessing.
J.T. Yes. "I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau" (@Malachi 1:3.) This is not said until the last book of the
{136}
Old Testament. There are people in this world called *lost* by the Spirit of God.
J.D. There are those who are characteristically opposed to the children of God.
J.T. Yes, as Cain. How can a man love God if he does not love his brethren?
T.S. We are either in one category or the other; those who love the brethren or those who hate them.
J.T. The Spirit in 1 John speaks in remarkable abstractness, saying, for instance, "Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God" (chapter 3:9). This, however, cannot be made to conflict with the fact stated plainly elsewhere, that believers, viewed in their ordinary or mixed condition while down here, are capable of sinning. The man put away at Corinth was a believer, but fell into gross evil; he was delivered "to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus" (@1 Corinthians 5:5). The second epistle shows that he was restored.
T.S. Men are steadily taking on these anti-christian characteristics you have been speaking of.
J.T. "Men shall be ... lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God" (@2 Timothy 3:2,4). Wrath awaits those who are regarded as "lost", and who are characterised by the sinful features already mentioned; but discipline in the assembly is usually exercised with a view to recovery, as we have noted. The object is to *save* those disciplined. In @Hebrews 9:19, we read "For every commandment having been spoken according to the law by Moses to all the people; having taken the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people". The section of Exodus from chapters 20 to 23 contains the words of the book, and the writer of the Hebrews is applying the blood of the covenant to the book as well as the people. These
{137}
chapters are full of instruction as preparing us for *ascension* which is the next thing. To be prepared for ascension we begin with Christ in chapter 21. In the type heaven hears a man who says plainly, "I love my master, my wife, and my children". It is like the word to John, "Come up here" (@Revelation 4:1).
W.B-w. Do you apply the ascension to going up to the mount?
J.T. Yes. It comes out in @Exodus 24:1, "Go up to Jehovah, thou and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship afar off". Then they went up (verse 9). These chapters are to prepare us to go up; but the basis morally of ascension is that we love God and keep His commandments. This is working out according to the pattern of Christ as presented in @Exodus 21, who says plainly, "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free"; God honours remaining in obedience in the exercise of love. Typically heaven claims Christ here; that is the position of chapter 24.
W.G.T. Are chapters 1 to 3 of Revelation the present dispensation -- "the things that are"?
J.T. Yes. "Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these" (@Revelation 1:19). It helps us as ministering the truth, to set our subjects in order. What John is to write is set down by the Lord in the order of first, second, third. First, "what thou hast seen"; then "the things that are"; and then "the things that are about to be after these". That is the order of the subjects in the book of Revelation.
J.D. How many things are taken in by the expression, "the things that are"?
J.T. It is chapters 2 and 3 of the book -- what relates to the assemblies. What happens in the world generally follows, beginning with chapter 4. Although the events related under this head are after "the things
{138}
that are", this has to be understood also in a moral sense, for much of the third series are historically concurrent with the second. They extend back to Paul's ministry -- "For the mystery of lawlessness already works; only there is he who restrains now until he be gone" (@2 Thessalonians 2:7). That all enters into the third sub-division of John's book, namely @Revelation 4 to the end, and in these chapters we have protracted history which includes events extending back to the beginning of christianity. "And there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes he must remain only a little while" (@Revelation 17:10). "One is" refers to the *time of writing*. Prophetic history as regards the world to some extent has been running concurrently with ecclesiastical history.
J.T.Jr. The book of Revelation alludes to *bondman*. It would link with @Exodus 21, John being the apostle who was the expression of love.
J.T. Yes, the word *bondman* in this book involves love; that is the underlying thought. I hope we shall see it active in priesthood in @Exodus 28 and 29. The word in @Isaiah 8:16 is, "Bind up the testimony, seal the law"; this implies priesthood, for the priests were custodians of the law. The Hebrew bondman prefers to remain; and then he is brought to the door, and his ear is bored; resulting from that, "he shall be his bondman for ever" (@Exodus 21:6). He has entered into that now. The service is finished and he is free, but instead of taking freedom he accepts this new kind of bond. Death is involved in it. The Lord accepted death to remain a bondman. A wonderful expression of love! He takes it on definitely because of love -- threefold love. It is worth while, like Jacob serving for Rachel, the seven years were as single days because of his love for her.
A.J. Being brought to the door would be a family allusion -- a public testimony, as to how the Lord entered into death for us.
{139}
W.G.T. Coming into bondmanship was for a limited period -- the six years, he accepted it for that time.
J.T. That is not an eternal position, but what he enters upon as saying, "I love", is an eternal position he is ever ready for; anybody that comes in sees that. The Lord Jesus died in love. "Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it" (@Ephesians 5:25).
C.T. "I love my master." His Master is the first thought of.
J.T. God has that place. Christ's love in its activity is fully differentiated.
G.A.T. Is this the working out of the Lord's prayer, "Not my will"?
J.T. He submits to the will of God, but here in @Exodus 21 there is no reluctance, this is entirely a love matter. We cannot say He is *restricted* to bondmanship, for He never ceases to be who He is, "over all God". It is a question of how far His love goes.
S.McC. "Emptied himself, taking a bondman's form" (@Philippians 2:7). How far would that go?
J.T. It refers to His becoming Man, an allusion to the attitude of His mind. He became Man to serve. So the Lord would do any service amongst the disciples. It is the attitude of His mind, but we must not restrict Him to that. He lays aside His garments, as seen in @John 13, but He puts them on again. He has the liberty of the house. He is the One that built it. He takes the place of *house-father* in Emmaus, see J.N.D.¬s note to @Luke 24:30. He is Son in the house; His Person remains unchanged.
J.D. "Then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all" (@1 Corinthians 15:28). Does that apply?
J.T. That is not exactly bondmanship. It just sets out the position of subjection; that is all; even then
{140}
we cannot say, He must be that. In this respect, we cannot apply *must* to Him; His Person remains unchanged, and, as in manhood, He is said to be "the true God" (@1 John 5:20).
E.C. Bondmanship is only required as long as the need is existent.
J.T. The type here is to show what love in Christ has done. The type also shows the variety of His love -- ascending, horizontal and descending.
A.Pf. What would horizontal love be?
J.T. Love for the assembly. "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh" (@Genesis 2:23). Adam recognised Eve's status as on equality with his. Thus love for his wife was for a person equal to himself. "That the world may know that I love the Father" (@John 14:31), is ascending love; all His service is carried on in love. Love is the kernel of everything. Love to God is ascending. Descending love is to the saints viewed as children, and the Lord addresses the disciples as children.
Rem. Love existed between divine Persons before incarnation.
J.T. "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" (@John 17:24). That is a wonderful fact. The Father loved the Person now known as the Son before the world was. All Persons of the Deity were on equality, no inferiority of position then.
J.D. When a person loves like this, God says, Come up to Me into the mountain and be there (@Exodus 24:12). Is that the thought in ascension?
J.T. That is the teaching in these chapters; first, thousands of those that love God, and then a special One that loves Him -- Christ, as a Man among men, comes into the scene of love here below. John says, "Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us" (@1 John 3:16). Love is fully attested, so that we might know it. It underlies all these chapters until we come to chapter 24, then you get ascension; not only the ascension of Christ, seen in Moses, but
{141}
also that of the people. The people with one voice accept the words of Jehovah, and thus, in type, they are fit to ascend.
W.B-w. Are the thousands of those who love characteristic of the assembly?
J.T. The principle is that *love is there*; but now, chapter 21, in the typical allusion to Christ love is fully attested in the death of the Lord Jesus. *He would* remain a Bondman because of love, and testified to this by death.
W.B-w. The ear is bored through with an awl; why the ear?
J.T. The ear refers to the intelligence, power to take in things. It refers to the Lord's position in humanity. "He wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the instructed" (@Isaiah 50:4). It is the greatness of love that is before us. "Who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross" (@Hebrews 12:2).
A.B. "Even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us" (@Ephesians 5:2).
J.T. That enters into this passage very manifestly.
E.G.McA. Does this passage indicate the readiness to accept bondmanship?
J.T. Yes. We are "to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge" (@Ephesians 3:19). Paul says, "For the love of the Christ constrains us" (@2 Corinthians 5:14) -- that kind of love.
Rem. The bondman here says *distinctly*, "I love".
J.T. It refers to the Lord's attitude towards the Father and towards the saints. He leaves no room for question as to His love; it is manifest.
W.B-w. This love fits in with the Lord's supper, His body given for us, not as bearing the wrath of God on the cross. It is love in Man in the house.
J.T. Yes. The door would allude to the family circle, where the family is; the master is there and the
{142}
wife and the children, and the door is the public position, where there is going in and out.
W.B-w. The door-post is mentioned too.
J.T. Israel in Egypt knew what that meant, the blood of Christ kept the destroyer out, inside was the realm of love.
A.Pf. How does the love of God enter into this?
J.T. That is not here at all. It is love in a Man. The love of God is descending love, but that is another matter. The great fact of love here is introduced in a Man. It brings out the greatness of the love of Christ. I want to know the love of Christ, and to take it as an example. I want to learn how to love.
J.D. "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died" (@2 Corinthians 5:14). This was the incentive in Paul's service.
J.T. It is stressed at Corinth, because of those who were not lovers of Christ in the true sense. Every Lord's day the Supper brings it before us. The Lord's supper, given in this epistle, implies that we love Him and love Him continually.
A.B. Paul says, "If any one love God, *he* is known of him" (@1 Corinthians 8:3).
J.T. That is another point, loving *God*.
Ques. "He that loves God love also his brother" (@1 John 4:21). Is the latter horizontal love?
J.T. Yes, the brother is my equal.
W.B-w. Paul as constrained by the love of Christ has got to the centre, and he would deal with persons who were not in accord with it.
J.T. Yes; and he prays elsewhere "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, ... to know the love of the Christ" (@Ephesians 3:17,19).
E.G.McA. In @Romans 8:35 he enquires, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ"; and then goes on to show that nothing can separate us from it, or from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
{143}
Lord. As Christ remains a Man, there is that love which we are brought into, and a link between Him and us for ever.
J.T. We are inseparable from it.
E.G.McA. "We more than conquer through him" (@Romans 8:37).
S.P. In @Revelation 3:9 He says to Philadelphia, they "shall know that *I* have loved thee".
J.T. Others are to know of His love for the assembly.
J.T.Jr. In @Exodus 21 to 23, sin coming out is contemplated in relation to man; "he that striketh a man" and "he that stealeth a man", etc. It alludes to sin working in us. The Lord Jesus is a great model as we have seen, but, alas! sin works on our side.
J.T. Prominence is given to the word "man", and sin against him. Of course we know that in the history of the assembly that is what has happened; man has not been rightly valued or protected. The Lord says Himself, "How much better then is a man than a sheep" (@Matthew 12:12).
W.B-w. Each of these things is in contrast to manhood in Christ.
J.T. Typically manhood in Christ is in view all through.
G.A.T. A brother lays down his life for the brethren.
J.T. That is a great thought. John has that in mind. The Lord Jesus set the example, which we are to follow.
W.G.T. Man may fail, but there is always the point of recovery. Following the directions of these chapters we get adjusted with the brethren. "Quit yourselves like men" (@1 Corinthians 16:13).
W.B-w. What is the difference in the book of the covenant in Exodus and Deuteronomy?
J.T. Deuteronomy is a second covenant as we learn in chapter 29: "These are the words of the covenant that Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides
{144}
the covenant that he made with them in Horeb." The words of the first covenant are used as a text for Moses to speak, as we would use Scripture in ministering. He took up the first covenant as it was and used it to bring out the second covenant -- "besides the covenant that he made with them in Horeb" (@Deuteronomy 29:1). What is in mind is that he takes up the first, and amplifies it with *increased love in his heart* for the saints, so that it becomes another. In Deuteronomy Moses is enlarged as a lover of Israel and lover of God. He is greater in Deuteronomy than in the earlier books. Speaking brings out what the ministry really is amongst us today. Scripture is the basis of all ministry; but we are to minister Christ. @John 21:25 says, "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written". The first covenant is opened up so as to make another. It is a question of Moses¬ love for the people.
As to skill in ministry, Moses in seven verses of @Exodus 12 gives the gist of all Jehovah said to him about the passover, and he adds to the details when he speaks to the people. Verses 21 to 27 are Moses¬ own words, as if he were to say, I am going to give you a word about the passover; and he gives in seven verses what he received in twenty verses. This brings in the way to minister, that it should be according to what is needed for the moment; reducing rather than extending. He brings it into their range, and adds new thoughts too -- the hyssop and the bason. That brings out the levitical principle and shows how to use Scripture; clothing it with thoughts God has given you. The book of Deuteronomy is like that.
G.A.T. The Lord spoke to the two going to Emmaus about "the things concerning himself" (@Luke 24:27).
J.T. The Lord went over the ground we have been taking up these last two days, and we do not want to be saying anything different from what He would say.
{145}
W.B-w. The power for condensation is in the minister.
J.T. That is the idea -- the ability to condense or amplify as the circumstances may require.
A.E.H. In facing difficulties among the brethren, Deuteronomy affords peculiar help.
J.T. That is a good way to look at it.
W.B-w. You would not read a whole chapter in beginning to speak a word to the saints.
J.T. It is not good to bring in *much* scripture. Scripture is basic, and you can enlarge on it. Two or three short scriptures ought to be enough; three is good testimony.
S.McC. You might only have one. The Lord "found the place where it was written" (@Luke 4:17).
J.T. To the two going to Emmaus, "he interpreted to them in *all* the scriptures the things concerning himself". In the assembly it is "the law of Moses and prophets and psalms" (@Luke 24:44). In these instances the Lord was unfolding the truth as to Himself in its fulness, and hence should not be taken as models for us in giving addresses. The same is true of Paul's long discourse at Troas.
C.T. "They were astonished at his doctrine, for his word was with authority" (@Luke 4:32). It was what He *said*, not so much what He *read*.
J.T. The eunuch was reading @Isaiah 53, and Philip began there and preached *Jesus* to him.
Returning to our book, in @Exodus 24 we read verses 9 to 11, which relate the fact that Moses and the others mentioned went up. This alludes to what is possible in assembly service. It does not say *they* went up *to the mountain*, but that Moses was to go up (verse 12) -- Christ alone.
J.D. What was there, according to chapter 21 -- love to the master, wife and children -- would give impetus to the service; spiritual power for ascension.
{146}
J.T. Love is regulated; its objects specified -- "I love my master, my wife, and my children" (@Exodus 21:5). Love is active in the Lord's heart as He comes in. In assembly it is love first for Christ, answering to His love for us, that should be in action; when we go on farther it is love to the Father, or to God, that should be in action. It is a time of love; differentiated love. The kind of love applicable at any particular time is to be understood.
W.B-w. The seventy elders, or nobles set out developed manhood in those who go up.
J.T. Yes. First -- "Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu". We would say Nadab and Abihu should not be brought in, but they are, and they fit in here. Later they died under God's judgment (@Leviticus 10:2), but here it is not Eleazar and Ithamar, but the elder sons, the chief of them, and then "seventy of the elders of Israel", so that you have a very august company going up. Love underlies it.
W.G.T. What is the thought in "transparent sapphire"?
J.T. That we are to leave all envy or other adverse feelings behind, in assembly service. Do not go up in the murkiness of natural feelings; all is transparency there.
S.McC. We might be inclined to think Nadab and Abihu should not have been there.
J.T. They fit in here. We might say Jethro should not take the place he took earlier. Nadab and Abihu are Aaron's sons here. Judas was really an apostle, and was owned as such until he went out. We have many instances of persons being used of God who afterwards came under His judgment.
J.D. Those who went up, "saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the form of heaven for clearness". Does this involve intelligence
{147}
in us? Is it the knowledge of God needed for His service?
J.T. It is the realm of spiritual privilege, which can hardly be defined, you could not give an account of it. As in the enjoyment of our own peculiar place with God, we are made to feel that we are in the presence of infinite things. It makes you small, but you are in holy liberty, filled, as the apostle would speak of it "even to all the fulness of God", (@Ephesians 3:19).
J.D. In our chapter in Exodus we have the expression "as it were the form of heaven for clearness". The term "as it were" seems to suggest something indescribable in mere words, similar to the expression in @2 Corinthians 5:20, where the footnote in the New Translation is helpful.
J.T. This wonderful realm of things cannot be exactly defined, you are in the presence of infinitude. What can you say?
N.B. All this results from the Lord Jesus taking a bondman's form (@Philippians 2:7)).
J.T. Yes -- "his name is called Wonderful" (@Isaiah 9:6). What transpired before Manoah and his wife was wonderful (@Judges 13). Manoah was not equal to his wife; for as the angel *did wondrously* he was not able to take it in. His wife could, however, having spiritual instincts and exercises. The saints are to understand mysteries.
G.A.T. "They saw the *God* of Israel" (@Exodus 24:10), but in chapter 20:22 "Jehovah said to Moses", why is the title changed?
J.T. It is *God* in verse 11, but it is qualified by "of Israel" in verse 10, and thus is specially relative here. We are in the realm of God. God is the great End of all things. In such glorious circumstances we are filled even to all the fulness of God. My spiritual vision is tested. Can I describe it as beholding it? Following this great scene, as it is to be understood now, it means "that God may be all in all" (@1 Corinthians 15:28).
{148}
E.G.McA. It is a remarkable word, "they saw God, and ate and drank"; it is a most august occasion.
J.T. *God* includes all that relates to Deity; "Father" is more limited. The Father judges no one (@John 5:22).
S.McC. "They saw the God of Israel", it says, and "they saw God and ate and drank". There are various thoughts linked with the *God of Israel*, but "they saw God" stands by itself.
J.T. As already remarked, as we bring the thought into christianity, it may be connected with @1 Corinthians 15:28. We are putting christian thoughts into it, which is right.
W.B-w. In assembly service the covenant God comes after the Supper.
J.T. I doubt that God should be formally brought into the Lord's supper. Jesus is spoken of as the Mediator of the new covenant in @Hebrews 12:24. The Supper is the *Lord's* supper, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" (@1 Corinthians 11:25). It stands directly related to Christ in His supper. It is wise to keep the words conveying the Lord's supper in @1 Corinthians 11 steadily before us as partaking of it. Much that is stated in the gospels is left out there. The Lord in giving the wording of His supper to Paul, says of the cup, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me". He is stressing the *memorial* aspect in what He gave to Paul, and this refers to Christ, not to God.
J.D. What is the thought as to God being all in all?
J.T. What is behind the divine economy is inscrutable. "No one knows the Son but the Father" (@Matthew 11:27). We are dealing with the economy which goes right through.
J.D. "Then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him" (@1 Corinthians 15:28). Does that engage us with the Lord's Person in the economy?
{149}
J.T. Yes, but you cannot see all that enters into that from the divine side. There is that which we do not, and cannot know. When thinking of His subject position, I have to bear in mind that He is "over all, God blessed for ever" (@Romans 9:5). The general position is in mind in @1 Corinthians 15:28, "God ... all in all".
{150}
MANHOOD IN EXODUS (5)
@Exodus 28:1-4, 40-43; @Exodus 29:36-46
J.T. We shall look at priesthood. These chapters are taken up with much detail. In chapter 28, we have the garments of the high priest and his sons; chapter 29 is the consecration of Aaron and his sons, giving the general conditions that should be in Israel in the verses read. Priests are already recognised as in Israel in chapter 19 and the youths in chapter 24:5 functioned as priests, but nothing said about the garments. In other words, it was just such as they were, just what there was; but now we have come to the end of our subject in regard of manhood, and God would have us to understand His thoughts of manhood in priesthood. I think that is the meaning of the clothes. They are put on and as put on they are in accord with what is there, especially in the high priest. The wise-hearted are to provide these clothes. "Thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for glory and for ornament." The matter will be easier to consider if we look at these garments as expressive of divine thoughts. They are not put on superficially. The person on whom they are placed is equal to them. They convey divine thoughts. God would have His priests rightly regarded. He knows us and furnishes us with these thoughts of dignity. Insignia of office often denote the dignity of the person, it is a misdemeanour to regard them otherwise. Their clothes are put on. The principle is in the bride, the Lamb's wife. "And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints" (@Revelation 19:8). She is equal to that. The question is, How do we regard Christ and the saints? We must use our eyes in relation to the dignity attaching to each other, and see that we speak rightly of the saints, because when we get to
{151}
heaven we will be speaking too, and it would never do to speak other than rightly of each other to God and to Christ. I think in this way the furnishing of the habiliments of the high priest and his sons keeps our minds right.
J.D. Would you say something on the introduction of the priesthood following the directions concerning the holy oil for the lamp, which is to be kept burning. Is the thought introduced in connection with the maintenance of the testimony before men?
J.T. Priesthood comes in in this way as it is required; the need for it is obvious. The instruction regarding the tabernacle began in chapter 25. We proceed in the pattern to the end of chapter 27, where we have, "And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee olive oil, pure, beaten, for the light, to light the lamp continually. In the tent of meeting outside the veil, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall dress them from evening to morning before Jehovah: it is an everlasting statute, for their generations, on the part of the children of Israel" (verses 20,21). Then we have service -- "And thou shalt take thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may serve me as priest -- Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons". This is their service; I want you to have right thoughts about them in this service. Everything must flow out from God. These garments indicate His thoughts. The prodigal's father said, "Bring out the best robe" (@Luke 15:22). It is to display divine thoughts.
C.T. That is why they are called the holy garments.
J.T. Quite so. "Thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for glory and for ornament". We are in the presence now of dignity in manhood, really the supreme thought of God in manhood.
A.E.H. These divine thoughts take on the character of preserving what is inward, right feelings, thoughts,
{152}
and motives; and on the other hand the shutting out of what is wrong and evil. Priesthood in that way stands in the presence of a great system of evil.
J.T. God is guarding the dignity of His priesthood, so that every time I look at the high priest I must be careful what I say about him. We talk freely about the brethren, but no matter who they are we must conform with God's thought.
S.McC. @Psalm 99:6 says, "Moses and Aaron among his priests". Would that suggest the dignity of the personnel in the priesthood?
J.T. Yes. Moses is not called a priest. He really has more liberty with God than Aaron.
S.P. What is the particular reason for introducing Aaron here as "Aaron thy brother"? In the remainder of the chapter he is just called Aaron.
J.T. It is to bring out the link between him and the mediator. Christ is both Moses and Aaron in the New Testament, "the Apostle and High Priest of our confession" (@Hebrews 3:1). The link is here in the brother, not simply Aaron, but "Aaron thy brother". The thought runs through the epistles to the Corinthians. The brother is linked with Paul in the writing of those letters, so modifying the element of authority. Aaron is the modifying element. In chapter 16 when the people wanted to go back into Egypt, Aaron, not Moses, speaks to them. While Aaron is speaking they turn their faces away from Egypt and towards the wilderness. The gospel of Luke represents that feature of Christ. If Matthew and Mark do not succeed, bring Luke in. Luke is helpful to people who are in a bad way. Luke will always give you something hopeful about them, therefore you can follow that through to recovery. Keep on patiently. When Aaron spoke they looked toward the wilderness and they saw the glory which then appeared for their support in that view. Luke's side of the position is very important because it is the hopeful side. There are so many delinquents amongst
{153}
us, alas! Matthew is usually severe, cuts people off quicker, and makes punishment more severe. He brings in Gehenna. Luke is always hopeful. Luke begins with a delinquent priest, Zacharias, but there is something hopeful about him and he is secured. After nine months he is ready for recovery.
G.A.T. Luke is the physician that would go with him.
J.T. Just so, he would diagnose the case. The man at Corinth was recovered quicker than they expected.
J.D. We are so liable to think of those who have turned aside as impossibilities, but Zacharias is an unbelieving priest and Luke is hopeful. This ought to encourage the brethren to keep on praying for anyone we might think an impossibility.
J.T. It is very interesting to look into hopefulness in Luke.
E.G.McA. You mean Luke handled the case of Zacharias with these garments in view, although he had to give an account of his unbelief?
J.T. I think so. When John the baptist is born the neighbours would bring in natural thoughts and call him Zacharias after his father. That is a poor thing to call him after a man under discipline. Elizabeth says, "No; but he shall be called John" (@Luke 1:60). Is the father on natural lines? "He wrote saying, John is his name". Heaven had announced his name.
J.D. "Thou shalt speak with all that are wise-hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to hallow him". We are coming over to God's side and viewing the saints accordingly, when we clothe them with these priestly thoughts.
J.T. Take Luke's gospel, how he clothes Zacharias, and the shepherds watching over their flocks: "An angel of the Lord was there by them". They deserve it; they have status already, light from God about the birth of Jesus. The multitude that comes in joins in that. What do they do now? They say, "Let us make our
{154}
way then now as far as Bethlehem". They are priests and praise God about it. We do not hear of either Simeon or Anna until the second of Luke. They are clothed properly. A divine thought was revealed to Simeon "a man in Jerusalem" -- "that he should not see death, before he should see the Lord's Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple". The Spirit of God clothed him with priesthood immediately. Anna is also thoroughly fit for the clothing. In the Acts the saints come into view in the same way. "Barnabas ... a Levite, Cyprian by birth, being possessed of land, having sold it, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles" (@Acts 4:36,37). This is the first time he is brought in and he has already sold the land. What can you say about him? He is a son of consolation. His status is settled. Right through the Acts you see that.
J.T.Jr. Of Saul it says, "Behold, he is praying" (@Acts 9:11).
J.T. That is a priestly garment. The Lord clothed him so that Ananias would know his status.
S.P. Barnabas in disposing of his property would ornament what the saints would see.
J.T. He gets the name, "Son of consolation" from the apostles. They put the garment on at once.
C.T. Moses strips Aaron of the garments. Are they the same garments?
J.T. We have a word as to them here in chapter 29:29,30. It says, "And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons¬ after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. The son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tent of meeting to serve in the sanctuary". He is to become accustomed to them. Will he act as his father did? It is a question of what he can do. Eleazar did very well and Phinehas did very well. He is the one the genealogy terminates in. He knows how to dignify his office. "I glorify my ministry",
{155}
Paul says in @Romans 11:13. You do not detract from it. We have to begin with Christ; that is the way the chapter proceeds. The sons are mentioned at once, but you do not get their clothes until the end of the chapter. It is not Christ only, but also the sons. So that heaven says, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (@Matthew 3:17). It is not *all* my delight -- God reserves space for the sons. That is the idea here; the sons are mentioned at once, but you do not get them clothed until the end of the chapter. Aaron is the first one to be occupied with. It is a question of Christ through the chapter. See how careful God is that the saints should have His mind about Christ, that is clothing Christ with divine thoughts. God would bring us into that. We are to have wonderful thoughts of God about Christ. "God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions" (@Hebrews 1:9).
W.B -- w. "Serve me as priests", not as sons, it is the priestly side here.
J.T. In the word at the beginning of the book, "Let my son go, that he may serve me" (@Exodus 4:23), God is saying, although the son is there he must have these garments. That is, priesthood is to mark us, and holiness. It involves holy garments.
J.D. One feels the deep necessity for manhood in matters of discipline. "Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou take great heed, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them shall ye take heed to do" (@Deuteronomy 24: 8.
J.T. Yes. The Levites and priests have a great place in Deuteronomy; hardly any distinction is made between them. The Levite is elevated in Deuteronomy. The actual bearers of the ark were Levites, but called priests there. Certain books bring in these high, rich thoughts, books equal to them.
{156}
A.Pf. Paul writes, "But I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is minister of the assembly which is in Cenchrea" (@Romans 16:1), there clothing her and all the rest of those mentioned, in priestly garments.
J.T. Quite so. J.N.D.¬s note says, ' She did the needed service [of a deaconess] in the assembly there; she was not properly a servant '; see also the note to @1 Corinthians 4:1. It is a question of what a sister can do, and if she does it, it will clothe her. Bring in this idea of clothing to maintain proper dignity amongst us.
E.G.McA. In letters of commendation proper clothing is necessary.
J.T. In writing Paul speaks well of Phoebe and many others. She did the needed service.
J.W.D. Where we see these qualities, the priest blesses God in relation to them. Something concrete that you see amongst the saints fills the heart with movement Godward and thus creates a living point of affection.
J.T. Phoebe carried the epistle to Rome. She is a worthy messenger. The epistle would be read, and chapter 16 has about twenty salutations. God is clothing His saints with dignity based on what they are and what they do. We will get full recognition both in heaven and among the brethren according to what we are.
G.A.T. Martha has been doing the needed service but complaining.
J.T. Martha fails Luke here. He does not finish with Martha; he leaves her in a bad way. She received the Lord but criticizes Him and her sister; that is not priestly clothing. The next thing is the Lord is seen praying. I suppose He would pray for her, for @Luke 11 is assembly furnishings and undoubtedly He was thinking how poorly she acted. John comes in and gives us a full view of Martha serving rightly. She adorns the position in the feast at Bethany.
J.T.Jr. What is the thought in Luke giving us no more than that?
{157}
J.T. He would go as far as he could -- the Lord's prayer was answered in John's gospel.
A.L. We are clothed with what we are and what we do. David would not keep on the dress that Saul gave him. He did not try it but went wearing his ordinary clothes.
J.T. The clothes he had used in slaying the lion. We see here how all this applies to the sons of Aaron, who are mentioned by name, "Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar". Keep your mind on the high priest. One man draws out the mind and heart of God, nothing unsaid, perfectly clothed priests.
J.T.Jr. Peter in preaching in Cornelius¬ house says, "Jesus who was of Nazareth: how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power; who went through all quarters doing good" (@Acts 10:38). Peter turns their minds to Christ, converging them on the High Priest.
J.T. "God was with him".
E.G.McA. "And these are the garments which they shall make ... that he may serve me as priest". There is something in connection with the Lord's people which gives more liberty for the priest.
J.T. That is just it. For instance, the Lord brings us here today and the brethren are very sympathetic with what is being said. The Lord is able to do much more in those conditions. At Corinth, the apostle indicated he could not get along because of conditions. He could not open up the mind of God for them. He waited until they were generally right themselves. The Lord is hampered when there is a low state amongst us. We must clothe all the saints as mentioned, so that Aaron may minister, he would be hindered otherwise.
J.D. "Epaphras, who is one of you, the bondman of Christ Jesus, salutes you, always combating earnestly for you in prayers, to the end that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God" (@Colossians 4:12). Do you think Epaphras is a good example for us?
{158}
J.T. He is an excellent example, an approved man. He combats in prayer. There was great opposition to what he had in his mind.
H.B. There is much said in verse 4 as to the turban and breastplate, etc.
J.T. The breastplate is the prime thought in the list. "And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a cloak, and a checkered vest, a turban, and a girdle; and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may serve me as priest. And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined byssus, and shall make the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, scarlet and twined byssus, of artistic work" (@Exodus 28:4-6). The ephod is generally the idea of priesthood. The breastplate cannot be put on without it. It is dependent on the ephod which refers to the general idea of priesthood. Then there is the long cloak that goes with it, completing the covering of the priest. The next thing is the two shoulder-pieces. "It shall have two shoulder-pieces joined at the two ends thereof, where it is joined together. And the girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall be of the same, according to its work of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet and twined byssus. And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the children of Israel: six of their names on the one stone, and the six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth. According to the work of an engraver in stone, as the engravings of a seal, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of the sons of Israel; surrounded by enclosures of gold shalt thou make them. And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod as stones of memorial for the children of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial. And thou shalt make enclosures of gold; and two chains of pure gold; of laced work shalt thou
{159}
make them, of wreathen work, and fasten the wreathen chains to the enclosures" (@Exodus 28:7-14). That is one great thought after the ephod is mentioned, these two shoulder-pieces on which are engraved the names of the children of Israel according to birth. It is the great general thought of Christ upholding the saints as the family of God, not yet in testimony, but as a family according to their birth. The breastplate is not that, although the same people are repeated in twelve precious stones in a square. Their names are not actually given at all. It is the names of the saints according to the position of each in the testimony from divine counsel and selection as they surrounded the tabernacle. They are all wonderfully precious in the mind of God, it is a question of His counsel. Beginning with Judah each has his place in the testimony, and the eternal position too, that is the breastplate. The Lord has them there before Jehovah, we are supported as a family and we are supported in the testimony as well, that is the idea of the breastplate.
W.G.T. The Lord would have this chapter in mind when He said to the disciples, "Rejoice that your names are written in the heavens" (@Luke 10:20).
J.T. He had the Levites in mind. It is a question of a ' Who is who? ' book up there. He would say, each of them is like the firstborn -- not first, second and third, as on the shoulder. In the family, properly, Christ is the firstborn, but from the Levitical point of view everyone has the same dignity and status. Every Levite represents the firstborn in Israel. Every Levite is firstborn. There could be nothing like it in the universe. This chapter is worth taking in. It gives us equality with each other and promotes mutuality.
G.A.T. They are set in carefully, and are not to die out.
J.T. They are there according to birth. Reuben would have the first place in the shoulder-pieces. When it is the family, there is firstborn and second born,
{160}
but when it comes to the breastplate there is no firstborn at all; Judah has first place. In Numbers there are four sets of three each surrounding the tabernacle and the breastplate represents them as they stood there.
E.G.McA.. "To the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven" (@Hebrews 12:23).
J.T. That is an allusion to the Levites. It is the plural word for firstborn.
W.B-w. When I come together in assembly with the brethren I look at them all as firstborn ones, not in responsibility as a family.
J.T. We come into the family according to our birth.
A.Pf. What is the difference between Christ the firstborn and the firstborn ones?
J.T. "When he brings in the firstborn into the habitable world, he says, And let all God's angels worship him" (@Hebrews 1:6), "firstborn of all creation" (@Colossians 1:15). He is also "firstborn among many brethren" (@Romans 8:29). It is a question of Christ's personal dignity. No one else could have it, but He. Coming back to our chapter this position on the shoulder-pieces supports us in the family, and the position on the breastplate supports us in testimony, as set there according to divine selection. Paul is brought into it later on. He has a prominent place.
J.T.Jr. The disciples questioning who would be the greatest, in @Luke 22:24, indicates what is apt to be in our minds. The Lord brings in the great thought of service.
J.T. In @Matthew 20:20 the mother of the sons of Zebedee wanted a place. The Lord says, that is the Father's matter, a question of divine counsel. When it is a servant, see the provision the Lord made for Paul, a wonderful place on the breastplate. Paul says, "Who has loved me and given himself for me" (@Galatians 2:20). He was to endure. "Thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must bear witness at Rome also" (@Acts 23:11). No one really suffered
{161}
more than the apostle Paul, apart from the Lord Himself. What a place the apostle Paul had in the Lord's mind, and He supported him peculiarly day and night in his service.
C.T. Why is the breastplate square?
J.T. It is very regular this universal thought embracing all the saints; it is particularly a matter of the testimony. They were located around the tabernacle on this principle.
W.B-w. Why is it the Urim and Thummim?
J.T. We have already spoken of the mystery. It would bring in the mysterious side of the matter. The Urim and the Thummim is a very mysterious thought. The Urim is sometimes mentioned by itself. It is a remarkable thing. You can enquire there; where love is in a regular way, where the saints are taken account of according to divine counsel and arrangement; and get light from God. A right state among the brethren opens up the way for the unfolding of divine thoughts. Moses had much more liberty in unfolding his thoughts about the tribes in the end of Deuteronomy, than Jacob had in @Genesis 49. Jacob had nothing like the atmosphere Moses had. Moses was king in Jeshurun in @Deuteronomy 33:5, the people all loved him. Then the idea of the Urim and Thummim is light and perfection. There is liberty if a right state of things exists among the brethren.
A.E.H. Is it perfection toward God, and light toward man?
J.T. Quite so.
J.McK. "And thou shalt put into the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim, that they may be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth in before Jehovah; and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before Jehovah continually" (@Exodus 28:30.
J.T. Yes. In Moses¬ blessing, when he comes to Levi, he says, "Thy Thummim and thy Urim are for
{162}
thy godly one" (@Deuteronomy 33:8). That is remarkable because the Urim is first here. It is to bear out that if conditions are good you have perfection before light, that is the state of the saints.
W.G.T. Levi represents spiritual people.
J.T. That is how he is mentioned, "Thy Thummim and thy Urim are for thy godly one". That is Levi. I think the order of Paul's epistles help us, because where there is a good condition locally the Spirit of God is freer to open up things. "Thummim", that is perfection and then if you have Urim the light shines.
J.D. @Numbers 27:21 helps. The Urim is sometimes mentioned by itself. "And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him, by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, he, and all the children of Israel with him, even the whole assembly". It is a question of light coming in for the saints.
J.T. Quite so.
W.B-w. "And the Tirshatha said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up the priest with Urim and Thummim" (@Nehemiah 7:65).
J.T. Israel still waits for that, it is future.
G.A.T. We should be right together first before we expect light from heaven.
J.T. Local conditions have a great deal to do with it. Local conditions hindered Paul at Corinth.
N.B. The linen comes in at the end of the chapter.
J.T. And then as to Aaron's sons it is said, "Thou shalt make vests". The vest is not a public garment it is an inner one. It is a question of what the man is inwardly. "Keep thyself pure" (@1 Timothy 5:22). "But youthful lusts flee" (@2 Timothy 2:22). The vest is mentioned first. What young people need is this inner state of purity, to be in the service of priesthood. And then the girdles, they are recognised as servants. The high caps would stand for intelligence, governed by
{163}
priestly dignity. The high priest has a turban, it is a remarkable head covering. "And thou shalt make a thin plate of pure gold, and engrave on it, as the engravings of a seal, Holiness to Jehovah! And thou shalt put it on a lace of blue, and it shall be upon the turban -- upon the front of the turban shall it be. And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all gifts of their holy things; and it shall be continually on his forehead, that they may be accepted before Jehovah" (@Exodus 28:36-38), -- bringing out holiness of mind, how you speak about the things of God. Paul had to combat the opposite to this in the Corinthians. They used their own minds in the things of God.
H.B. Would the high cap be seen in @Romans 1:9, God "whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings"?
J.T. Quite so. Chapter 29 brings the altar in as anointed; verse 37 refers to the general condition in Israel, only the altar is specially mentioned as anointed seven days. The place of sacrifice among the people of God is holy. Seven days would bring it into accord with Christ. In Leviticus it is said to be anointed seven times, alluding to the Lord Himself. That is the general thought in sacrifice and suffering. All this is to bring out the dignity of things, and holiness is needed in dealing with them. It is outside the world and must not be brought down to the level of man's ways at all. Looking after the meeting room is a dignified service, not common. "And thou shalt weave the vest of byssus; and thou shalt make a turban of byssus; and thou shalt make a girdle of embroidery. And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make vests; and thou shalt make for them girdles; and high caps shalt thou make for them, for glory and for ornament. And thou shalt clothe with them Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and hallow them, that they may serve me as priests. And
{164}
thou shalt make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of nakedness; from the loins even to the hips shall they reach" (@Exodus 28:39-42). This is the general everyday condition among the people of God, contemplating manhood in priesthood in sonship, indeed in brotherly relations, with all these glorious thoughts put upon us by God, and we subjectively answering to them. What a time God has and heaven has every day among the saints here below!
E.G.McA. What is the altar today?
J.T. It is the power of endurance, continuance in suffering, in a holy way. Christ alone is the full expression of it. The measurements indicate what moral power there was in the Man, what He could endure in the way of sacrificial judgment.
G.A.T. You were speaking about taking care of the room?
J.T. That is not a common thing, it is not like working in your own house. We are in relation to the house of God in these matters.
A.B. The household of Stephanas devoted themselves to the saints for service. The footnote says the verb is connected with the saints, rather than service. This amplifies what you are saying.
W.G.T. In @Matthew 5:23,24 you cannot use the altar if you have anything against your brother: "Leave there thy gift before the altar, and first go, be reconciled to thy brother".
J.T. That is a good illustration. You would discredit the altar if you offered on it knowing a brother has ought against you. "Then come and offer thy gift." The morning and evening lamb would stimulate the heart of God. It is very beautifully taken up in Numbers. That is to bring out the general position for God amongst His people when manhood is secured in sonship in the Lord Jesus. The position is fixed immutably in Christ. It is the state of things that God gets every day as a result of the morning and evening lamb.
{165}
J.T.Jr. In the early chapters of the Acts, they go to their own company after being threatened. We find that we go to our own company, into the midst of those who have the same feelings.
J.T. Read us what follows that in the Acts.
J.T.Jr. "And they, having heard it, lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, *thou* art the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them; who hast said by the mouth of thy servant David, Why have the nations raged haughtily and the peoples meditated vain things? The kings of the earth were there, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ. For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in this city to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass. And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word, in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders take place through the name of thy holy servant Jesus. And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness" (@Acts 4:24-31).
J.T. That is exactly what we are at here, the general state of things in the company.
W.B-w. "It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you, to speak there with thee". It is a collective setting at the finish.
J.T. There are communications under these conditions. The tabernacle enters into all these things.
E.G.McA. In that passage in the Acts all are filled with the Holy Spirit, as seen in verse 45 here, "I will
{166}
dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and will be their God".
J.T. How successful the apostolic service was, and then Barnabas, an addition, ornamentation coming in. God says, "It shall be hallowed by my glory", a wonderful scene! glory present. Think of that, God sanctifying everyone of us, because of conditions. And then it goes on, "And I will hallow the tent of meeting, and the altar; and I will hallow Aaron and his sons, that they may serve me as priests. And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and will be their God. And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who have brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, to dwell in their midst: I am Jehovah their God". It is a wonderful ending to this great subject, manhood now, the full thought of it in Christ and His people, the sons of God.
J.D. The Philippian assembly would be an answer to this, the opening up of the bowels of the servant. The apostle found a congenial state where he could open up what would answer to this.
J.T. Paul's epistles help us on this line. In Colossians Paul was able to open up more than in Corinthians, and the Ephesians furnished the apostle ample room to open up his thoughts.
E.G.McA. God takes delight in dwelling in the midst of this service.
G.A.T. It is very important what company we are found in. "And having been let go, they came to their own company" (@Acts 4:23).
J.T. Quite so.
C.T. "I am Jehovah their God."
J.T. To make clear who He is, go back to @Exodus 3. "To us there is one God, the Father", (@1 Corinthians 8:6).
{167}
ELDERSHIP
@1 Chronicles 11:3; @Nehemiah 8:13-18; @Acts 15:6-23
I have in mind to speak about *eldership* among the people of God. It is a thought that began very early, involving the idea of rank as over against the great modern developments. We have the word *rank* applied to our Lord Jesus as the first from among the dead, "each in his own rank: the first-fruits, Christ" (@1 Corinthians 15:23). We have the thought applied to Michael also; he is called an archangel (@Jude 9).
What is in mind now is to speak of rank as based on *experience with God* as essential to government in the assembly; for if this truth is largely lost in the world it is to be maintained in the assembly. Every divine thought is to find expression in the assembly, and no thought is in a way more significant than government. As creating man, God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth. And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them" (@Genesis 1:26,27).
It is in mind now to stress experience with God as finding, if it exists, its own proper place among the saints in our times. If it does not exist we can only speak of it in the abstract, but if it does, it should be recognised. The thought begins in Paul's address to a youthful brother, Timothy, "Let no one despise thy youth, but be a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity" (@1 Timothy 4:12). The men whom Paul, under God, selected to ordain elders, were young; they were not themselves elders in the sense of age and long experience. What enhanced
{168}
their quality was that they were children of Paul, each is called a child of Paul, spiritually so. Paul had become an elder, "being such a one", he says, "as Paul the aged" (@Philemon 9); not simply being an old brother. In delegating Titus and Timotheus to appoint elders he certainly would avoid any charge of incongruity in using young men to appoint old ones. The spiritual link and character derived from Paul by these young men, qualified them as his children, and overcame all that. If anyone questioned Timotheus or Titus, Paul would soon call attention to the fact that they had overcome the discrepancy of youth in what they were doing; no one could despise their youth. They were so morally great that their comparative youth was no handicap to them. Hence the idea of eldership, or experience with God, should start with the very youngest here. The beginning is noted in the word, "Let no one despise thy youth". It means that I am putting on such features of maturity in my manners and ways that no one can rightly despise it; if they do, they discredit themselves.
I have selected these three scriptures, because they bring out this thought of eldership in function, for it is only as a thing, or a person, is in function, that you can determine what he is. If a brother never says anything in the meeting, he is not functioning. When he begins to speak in the assembly, and speak in a priestly way, then we begin to *name* him, but we cannot do it earlier except in a negative sense which, of course, we are loath to do. Sometimes one wonders whether the devil has not a hand in the silence that some brothers maintain in the assembly. It is said of the Lord that He taught the disciples how to pray. One of them said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples" (@Luke 11:1). The Lord immediately taught them how to pray, and gave examples of prayer too; and He goes on to the very greatest thing that may be obtained by prayer, saying "How much rather shall
{169}
the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" (verse 13). How can anyone be silent in the assembly in the presence of such a word from the Lord Jesus? The very greatest gift is the Holy Spirit. That is something that we can receive as a gift; it can be obtained by asking. The next thing we get from Luke about the Lord is that "he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb" (verse 14). He was *doing* it. His service as yet was not completed, He was *doing* it; He seems to prolong the process so that it might be understood, so that there should not be any silent ones. Any brother who is constantly silent in the assembly is open to a charge of being under adverse influence. I am not saying that is so always, but one is questionable if he does not speak in the assembly. The Holy Spirit coming into a believer *cries*! "But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (@Galatians 4:6). It is urgent that there should be some response to God from the great gift that He has given us, that is, the Holy Spirit.
I have been saying that young ones should develop in that way, and that no one should despise their youth. "Let no one despise thy youth." It certainly will be despised if you are frivolous, negligent, or careless in regard to the things of God, and you will become questionable as to any value at all in the assembly. So that eldership begins when we are young, as we avoid giving occasion to any one to despise our youth.
Now in the first scripture read we have, "And all Israel assembled themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh" (@1 Chronicles 11:1). They make a special speech to him, someone would do it, of course; some person, but it is accredited to them all. They say, "Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. Even aforetime, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah thy God said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over my
{170}
people Israel". A pungent and very appropriate speech. That was based on experience and observation as to David's manner even while Saul was king. I have been speaking of functioning; it is as functioning in it that you can be rightly named in any position. They had observed David serving under difficult circumstances -- when Saul was king. Saul eyed him from the very beginning and envied him, and would have slain him, but nevertheless David functioned as a leader in Israel, as they say, "Thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah thy God said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over my people Israel". He was the real king. This passage ought to be encouraging to all who have ability from God, who serve as priests, or with gift in the assembly; however much envy there may be, or opposition, there is no reason why you cannot function according to the ability divinely given; David did, and it had been observed. They had seen it earlier and they are speaking of it now. They kept quiet about it evidently until Saul was dead -- many of them at least -- but they had observed that David had led out Israel, and brought Israel in. He had qualified as a king; that is to say, a general state of things in view of what is right has come about. We can always count on that in local gatherings. The enemy is ever ready to work and, alas! usually finds means of operation, but we can always reckon, as dependent on God, that He will bring about a general state of things bearing in the right direction; and He brings the elders in; there is room for eldership. A divided state in a gathering tends to preclude eldership coming into evidence. They are not even mentioned in the letters to Corinth; they may have been there, but they are not mentioned. It is, I believe, because of the divided -- almost schismatic -- conditions that existed. Such a state of things tends to preclude the operation of experience with God.
{171}
We are robbing ourselves of a divine provision if we do not make room for those who have experience with God. Room is made for the elders according to verse 3. "And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah". The passage does not say he made a covenant with all the people, it is a question of trustworthiness. However few or many there are that can be trusted by God, such will be trusted, and brought into a position where they can function. David made a covenant with them. That is to say, the Lord is operating, He is watching, that we may have conditions suitable to God, and when the time comes for stabilisation the elders will be recognised. The Lord will never be satisfied until the elders are recognised. Assembly government requires them; and so here; "David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah". That is, David took the initiative; conditions had come about for stabilisation; Israel had been in the throes of bad government and evil conditions generally, and now the time has come for stabilisation. The general view is that David is the king; for he is qualified. In the midst of disadvantageous conditions he led out Israel and brought in Israel. Some of the leaders in Corinth would have led out the people without bringing them back. They were leading them into partisan positions; into divergence one from the other. If I lead a party of brethren out it is unlikely that I shall lead them back. I may lead them out but not back. Christendom is full of such mischief. Schismatic formations are brought out but the saints are not brought back. Bringing back means recovery to the assembly; there is no other terminus of God on earth. David led Israel out and led them back. True leadership is thus marked, and the elders come in at this point. David has qualified already as king of Israel; not only of Judah, but of Israel, and this gives room to the
{172}
elders. David recognises the elders of Israel and makes a covenant with them.
Then we read of the elders, "and they anointed David king over Israel according to the word of Jehovah, through Samuel". That is, they go back to the selection of David by Samuel, they go further back than the people. The people revert back to Saul's reign, and what David did in spite of adverse conditions, but the elders go back to Samuel. We are taught by that, and as advancing in the things of God *we* shall go back to the beginning always, as John does, "That which was from the beginning" (@1 John 1:1). He writes to the fathers as those that know Him that was from the beginning, "I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning" (@1 John 2:13). Old brothers are apt to talk about ancient things, but that is not enough. They sometimes like to talk of things which they remember and others do not. Here it is a question of Samuel. It was he that God used to select David, and the stabilisation of the position must include the beginning of the matter involving the word of God. It is not now by their choice or the result of the observation of the people that David was anointed king; the point now is the word of the Lord; everything must rest on that; it is a sure foundation.
In @Nehemiah 8, we have a similar position. They had a fine time on the first day at the water gate with Ezra reading the Scriptures to them, and the Levites giving the sense; happy conclusion to the first day of the *conference*, but when we come to the part of the chapter I read, verse 13, it is said, "And on the second day were gathered together the chief fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to gain wisdom as to the words of the law. And they found written in the law which Jehovah had commanded through Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month, and that they should publish and proclaim
{173}
through all their cities, and at Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive-branches, and wild olive-branches, and myrtle-branches, and palm-branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written". The first scripture we have been considering involves stabilisation. David is king over all Israel. He makes a covenant with the elders, then they anoint him according to the word of the Lord; that is stabilisation, what you may call the sure foundation of God. It is an immense thing to understand in these days of shiftiness, and wreckage, "Yet the firm foundation of God stands" (@2 Timothy 2:19). The elders understand, and David understands.
The feast of tabernacles involves *love*, and this comes out the first day of the meetings. It was a very full day and a very fruitful one. The Levites, with Nehemiah, gave the sense of the Scriptures to the people, and the people were to be happy. They were to eat the fat and drink the sweet, and send to those that had nothing; "And Nehemiah, that is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that explained to the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to Jehovah your God: mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law. And he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared; for the day is holy to our Lord; and be not grieved, for the joy of Jehovah is your strength" (chapter 8:9,10). That is what you might call the urgency of persons in responsibility, that at a particular time you should be governed by a particular thing, that we should know how to control our minds and our feelings. When it is a time of joy we should be joyous. There is a time to rejoice, particularly in assembly service, it is no time for weeping, it is a time for gladness, spiritual gladness. But you can understand that the urgency of Nehemiah's word could hardly sustain the joy, though it brought it about for
{174}
the moment. Exhortation in a gathering often brings about a condition which may fade away later, but still you remember that you had such an experience even if for only a matter of a few minutes, and it was worth while. You like to revert to that again and prolong it. Normally the service of God precludes sorrow or depression. Having control of our minds by the Holy Spirit we can prevent what is unsuitable. We thus have ability to dismiss from our minds what causes sorrow at a particular time and allow in our minds what causes joy. That balanced condition should never be lost. The idea of joy in the Holy Spirit is always to be present in the assembly. A suitable word often makes room for it among the brethren.
Then the fathers come together. They are not called elders here, they are called fathers -- a word that runs along with elders only that it brings in the family thought. "And on the second day were gathered together the chief fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to gain wisdom as to the words of the law". That is, these older brethren had deeper thoughts. No doubt they gained from Nehemiah's and Ezra's exhortation to be joyous, and perhaps led in the joy, but they want to go deeper than the thought of an exhortation. The effect of an exhortation may pass away quickly; these older brethren mean to go further than that. Let us value the chief fathers, the priests and the Levites, let them function! Do not get in their way! They speak on the second day, they come to Ezra, the priest, with the express desire as the passage says, "to gain wisdom as to the words of the law". Then we read, "And they found written in the law which Jehovah had commanded through Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month". They did not find that on the first day, nor is there a word about it in the first day, the great day of the meeting at the water-gate. It is the second day when the chief fathers, and
{175}
the priests, and the Levites are allowed their own proper place among the saints; they want to go deeper. We all love to say, We had a good time, good meetings. It is very rarely we hear anything else in these special meetings. Thank God we do have good times, but the elder brethren want to go deeper than that. They want to go below the surface of a three days¬ meeting, or a day's meeting, and see if we cannot stabilise joy as well as rule.
In David we have the stabilisation of rule according to the word of the Lord by Samuel, but here we have the stabilisation of joy. It is in the feast of tabernacles, the last of the feasts. It is the result of these old brothers and the priests and the Levites coming to Ezra. It is a question of the Bible, of reading all the books of Scripture. You will notice in the last verse of the chapter, "Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they observed the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance". Seven days! they covered a good deal of Scripture, no doubt. And we may conclude that they read in an orderly way. There were the law, the prophets, and the Psalms. The Lord Jesus opened them up to the disciples according to @Luke 24. The Bible is much larger now than it was in Nehemiah's time. We have the New Testament added to it, but the same principles apply; we must search its holy pages; look at this scripture and that scripture; search them as for hidden treasure. There is no doubt that the arrangement of the Bible as it is, in chapters and verses, is very wise. This arrangement is not inspired, but it is such as love would do, and God approves, for it proves to be most useful. So here every day, one day after another, all the days of the feast they read the book of the law.
But then I am coming to what they stabilised; they brought in what was typically the feast of love; the feast of tabernacles; the arrangement of the booths as
{176}
prescribed in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, for both books tell us of this feast. The interest and intelligence of these chief fathers, these priests and these Levites in making inquiry from such a man as Ezra the priest is impressive. He was a ready scribe in the law of God. A scribe is an accurate man. If you were to ask Ezra he would be accurate in his replies, as Aquila and Priscilla were when they were instructing Apollos, they "unfolded to him the way of God more exactly" (@Acts 18:26). Hence these old men would probably say to Ezra, What about the book of Leviticus? Think of the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Ezra, the great Priest, the great King! think of Him too opening up from all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. He did this to persons on the way from Jerusalem to Emmaus! I would like to ask the Lord, What is the difference between the account of the feasts in Leviticus and that in Deuteronomy? He would tell me accurately. The Lord said to one man, "What is written in the law? how readest thou?" (@Luke 10:26). It is a question not only of reading it, but *how* you read the Bible -- that is the idea. The Lord is concerned about us as to the way we read Scripture.
Well, the fathers here found the passage in Leviticus. "And they found written in the law which Jehovah had commanded through Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month, and that they should publish and proclaim through all their cities, and at Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive-branches, and wild olive-branches, and myrtle-branches, and palm-branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written". There is a slight variation in the branches: what are called *pine* are "wild olive" branches. In the anti-typical sense there are today many wild olive branches. They are real christians, but they are not altogether subject. Some are honest, but not subject. Those who are fathers among the saints now are
{177}
interested in them. One of them would say of any such, I know he is converted, I have discerned the evidence in him of the work of God, but he is not breaking bread, meaning he is wild to that extent. There is nothing optional at all in regard to being in fellowship! Every christian should be in fellowship, but even if he is in some sense wild, nevertheless he is brought to this feast. Get him among the brethren and love him, love him into fellowship, get him into the booth, as one might say. Booths are small dwelling places, but see where they are located. "And the people went forth and brought them, and made themselves booths, everyone upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the open space of the water-gate, and in the open space of the gate of Ephraim". We had something about the roof today, but it was broken through, but not this time. I suppose this would be a flat roof, such as are in the east, where a few brethren could sit down and have a love feast. Do not think I am theoretical in what I am saying. We may segregate in twos or threes or more to talk together of the things of God, and even a *wild* brother may be there. I mean wild in the sense that he is not abiding by the word of God. "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment" (@1 Corinthians 14:37). If I am not abiding by that epistle I am wild; but I am invited to this feast. If I go out as I went into the booth I visited then it is evident my will is still working, and I may not be invited any more.
One great feature in this passage is the law; "the law which Jehovah had commanded through Moses". Moses wrote the law by divine direction. Why should I not abide by it? It is the law of God by the hand of Moses. They made booths "in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the open space of the water-gate, and in the open space of the gate of
{178}
Ephraim". Each of these positions has some meaning, which I cannot dwell upon now. Then it is said, "all the congregation of them that had come back from the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths. For since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun until that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness". That is to say, there was opportunity for the mutuality of love and the continuance of gladness. Although we may not have Nehemiahs and Ezras, we may learn how to provide such occasions, for we are taught of God to love one another. Get close together! Invite the brethren to our houses! That is the idea of it, that is the way of stabilisation of love among the brethren. I believe God is turning to account the pressure of the moment to promote love among the brethren. Here it is not a question of pressure, but of getting together in *booths*. Primarily it was a wilderness provision, but it was to be continued in the land. Love for one another enables us to enjoy sharing small quarters together. We are glad to meet each other and opportunities to speak in holy communion as regards the things of God, are appreciated as love exists.
Well, the third part of my subject is in the Acts, and refers to the meeting of difficulties that arise amongst us. This chapter brings in the elders, and how the solution of the difficulty mentioned is through them. The apostles and elders came together to consider the matter. Now we have no apostles and no official elders, but their service in this important meeting is recorded by the Spirit, and hence it is to be kept in mind in our care meetings.
We recognise these facts of the Scripture, and although we have not apostles or official elders, we have light in this chapter as to how counsel was taken and difficulties met at the beginning. In Jerusalem in the presence of a great difficulty, schism among the people of God was averted by the wisdom that appeared in
{179}
the apostles and the elders. So Peter, in standing up to speak, says, "Brethren (*lit*. Men, brethren) *ye* know that from the earliest days God amongst you chose that the nations by my mouth should hear the word of the glad tidings and believe".
From the *earliest* days, literally "ancient" days, brings in the idea of time and experience with God; Peter's commission was from the very beginning. So Peter's word fits exactly; it is light governing what was in question. He reverts back to the beginning of ministry in christianity, and that he was deputed to speak to the gentiles. "Brethren, *ye* know that from the earliest days God amongst you chose that the nations by my mouth should hear the word of the glad tidings and believe". His experience qualified him to meet the serious crisis that had arisen. Who could question the moral weight of the apostle as he stood up to speak in that meeting? He did not desire to be personally credited, but to credit the testimony at that time. When Peter stands up and speaks to the apostles and elders, he refers to himself as having something from God from the earliest days, involving not only authority, but experience. He is a man of moral weight. This made way for relating the conversion of those of the nations through Paul and Barnabas, and the whole multitude are glad to hear of it. They were ready to listen to Paul and Barnabas speaking about the work of God among the gentiles. What they related would create a good atmosphere in the meeting.
In the matter of judgment another important point is the word of wisdom. It is a gift, and that is what James has. He says, "Brethren (*lit*. Men, brethren) listen to me:" he is a man that should be listened to. He reverts immediately to old things, "And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, listen to me: Simon has related how God first visited to take out of the nations a people for his name. And with this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written:
{180}
After these things I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David which is fallen, and will rebuild its ruins, and will set it up, so that the residue of men may seek out the Lord, and all the nations on whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord, who does these things known from eternity. Wherefore, *I* judge, not to trouble those who from the nations turn to God; but to write to them to abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood. For Moses, from generations of old, has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath". Then the assembly is brought into the matter and following that the Holy Spirit; thus we have a conclusion according to God. "Then it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with the whole assembly, to send chosen men from among them with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch". Finally "it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" (verse 28).
I want you, dear brethren, to follow the reference to *age* and experience with God in all these passages, to see how the cumulative thought of the testimony is brought down to bear on any given matter, and if there is a difficulty let us have all that is available to lead to, and to lend weight to a right judgment. Thus unity is maintained.
{181}
WHAT PLEASES GOD
@Matthew 3:13-17; @Hebrews 11:5; @1 Thessalonians 4:1
I wish to occupy you all and myself in this service, with *what pleases God*. In His abode above there is nothing displeasing to Him. The creature cannot compass the divine realm, because it must of necessity take on infinite proportions. We read of "the third heaven" (@2 Corinthians 12:2), which is, I suppose, the limit of the creature's approach. We have the expression "above all the heavens" (@Ephesians 4:10). How many there are is not stated. I suppose *third* would imply gradation, leading to what is wholly spiritual, a gradual leading to what is uncreated.
It is so in our own persons, we are very conscious of the physical, but we progress to the wholly spiritual condition. We must, of course, always remain creatures and never go beyond created conditions -- the heavens being included. I think we always stand related to the physical, involving our bodies of glory, but there may not always be the consciousness of this. In earlier days, there was at times unconsciousness of the physical. Paul said he did not know whether, as in paradise, he was in or out of the body. That extraordinary experience he had fourteen years before he wrote the second letter to the Corinthians. There would be increase of spiritual consciousness as he entered on the realm beyond the first and second heavens, reaching the third. How he knew it was the third, I cannot say; he had no doubt about it, however, according to the way he records what occurred. It is a most remarkable incident, especially as he says he did not know whether he was in the body or out of it. God knows, he says. Clearly the experience was intended to affect his service and testimony, and would give increased spiritual body and power to it.
I refer to these matters to increase our interest in what is spiritual; interest in the realm of God, in the heavens. Solomon spoke of the heaven of heavens,
{182}
that it is not capable of containing God, and we have the wonderful statement that He dwells "in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see" (@1 Timothy 6:16). The nearer we approach God in His own realm the more we are conscious of infinitude, and our own smallness. I am speaking of what pleases God, and I am sure Paul was conscious of that when he got there. Jesus went beyond all the heavens. That is a glorious thought. He is *our* Priest, "For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens" (@Hebrews 7:26). How much higher is not stated. He has gone beyond all heavens, so that man now has a wonderful place in the divine realm, and, as in Christ, fills the heart of God. Jesus as up there that "he might fill all things" (@Ephesians 4:10), is personally the same as He was on the banks of the Jordan.
The place man in Christ has in the divine realm certainly should appeal to us, because we are men. Paul says that Christ has given gifts to men; He had every saint in His mind in those gifts, so that we should all be equal to the position designed for us up there; and the time is nearing when we shall be eternally there. It is finishing time now; the gifts and the Spirit remaining here, with a view to finishing us for the wonderful place we are to occupy, where we are to please God. The heavenly city, one of the greatest conceptions, is presented as a cube. It is solid and would be altogether out of the question if it were merely physical. Myriads of men are required to fill what is described as the heavenly city. It is composed of men, not angels; although angels have to say to it at the gates; we compose it, they do not. All shall fit according to the divine design; there will be nothing to displease God. God and the Lamb are there, there is no discrepancy whatever.
Now the verse read in Matthew bears on it. God has *found* what pleases Him. John the evangelist uses that word considerably; in chapter 1 particularly, where we
{183}
read of persons being *found*. I wonder if everyone here has been found, for you have been sought. The divine eye has moved to seek and to find you. Take the sphere of glory John depicts in @John 12. The Lord was about to enter Jerusalem; it was a great movement, and there was great interest in the matter; crowds were there and the Lord said in effect, ' There is something wanting in this display '. What was wanting was the young ass. Can an ass add to the glory of Christ? Yes, if you look at him according to what he is symbolically. The Lord found what was needed, so that we may be sure that if any one of us is needed by the Lord, He is looking for you, He will find you if you are available. He needs you to complete the position. We are not yet finished, and whilst unfinished there is something needed. These last days are very interesting days to heaven. God is going on with His work, looking for and finding souls in spite of all that man is doing. He found the ass. The Lord must be carried into Jerusalem. It is not simply that you should get blessing, but there is a place to be filled and you are needed to fill it. The Lord is looking for you. We do not want you to miss it. Perhaps I am speaking to someone who has *not* been found. The best place to be found is in a meeting like this. There is a place to be filled and the glory requires you should be there to fill it. The Lord found a young ass and used it. If God finds what He needs He uses it at once. The question is what pleases God; the ass evidently did and the Lord had no difficulty in riding on it. The Lord rode on the ass into His capital, in glory. What became of him afterwards, Scripture leaves; symbolically that ass is of great interest to heaven.
In Matthew we have another scene; not Jerusalem, although the Lord had been there. According to Luke He was, as a Babe, taken to the temple at Jerusalem by His father and mother. Now He is about thirty years of age, and He comes from Galilee. There may be persons
{184}
here who belong to distinguished religious bodies; I do not know. There are some distinguished bodies; some very old so-called christian religions in the world. For such, this room would not be suitable, it would be altogether too mean. The greatest architectural skill has, for centuries, been employed for the abodes of those systems of renown. I mention all that because the Lord, about to take up His ministry, came from *Galilee*. That is a point for young people in moving to your place in fellowship -- whence you came. Jesus came from Galilee, we are told in Matthew, and Matthew never loses sight of Galilee. According to him the Lord meets His disciples for the last time in Galilee. Surely it must have something to do with the pleasure of God. A cathedral has no element whatever that is pleasing to God, in spite of what it may be in the eyes of men. It is therefore important for me to inquire, Do I please God in my initial movements? There are initial movements. First there is God's sovereign movement toward you, to do something in you, to change the texture of your being. However well bred and brought up, there must be a change in the texture of each if he is to be for God's pleasure. God moves to do that. "The wind blows where it will" (@John 3:8); that is sovereign action; no one can interfere with it; "thus is every one that is born of the Spirit". This is a divine movement toward you. At the time you were not intelligent about it, but it happened. Then there is the evangelical movement by some one so that your soul might be illuminated by the gospel. The Lord Jesus does that. We are told in Matthew that the "people sitting in darkness has seen a great light, and to those sitting in the country and shadow of death, to them has light sprung up" (@Matthew 4:16). That is the light of the gospel. John says "the light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not". This refers to judaism. But in Galilee it was apprehended by some, as Matthew testifies. In our chapter,
{185}
@Matthew 4:18-22, Peter, Andrew, James and John are called and they follow Jesus. This is pleasing to God.
The Lord came from Galilee, the place under reproach. He came purposely every step of the way to the Jordan. He was going to be baptised. The place, the river, the baptiser -- all are in the Lord's mind. I am speaking now of the Lord of glory, and how He moved here below; what He was in heaven's eye. John sees Him coming. I want to bring out this matter of heaven's proclamation of pleasure in the Lord, and the connection in which it is found in Matthew. It is a matter of His mind at the time, and of His walk; how He came and whence He came; and how and what He had in His mind as coming. *Righteousness* is prominent. His mind was full of that thought. Now He is there, and John is there at the Jordan, also others. How heaven watched those steps from Galilee! He is there to bring out the moral question -- because in coming to God, and dealing with divine things, we are apt to be very shallow, often mere imitators. It is imperative that we should dig deep in self-judgment, owning righteousness. In @2 Timothy 2:22 it is the first thing we are told to *follow*. The mind of the Lord Jesus here is taken up with what is suitable at the moment. It is a question of righteousness -- of the Jordan, John and Christ's baptism. He must be baptised by him. John deprecates it, saying he needed to be baptised of the Lord, but what was in the Lord's mind was to govern the moment. If He has a mind about a matter that is what I want to understand. He says "it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". Now that is most necessary in days of shallowness such as ours. This matter of all righteousness must come up. What a conversation went on between John and Jesus! Heaven heard all that conversation, and observed how the Lord Jesus prevailed over John. He would say to each of us, ' I want to prevail in your soul '; we shall do well if we let
{186}
Him have His way. John forbade Him at first, but this attitude did not last long. In having to do with the Lord we must not forbid Him in any way. The Lord is ready to do the best for us and our wisdom is to submit. John suffers Him to have His way; we should also. If we do not, we shall suffer loss. John is subject, he allowed the Lord to prevail in this matter. John baptised Him.
John the evangelist seems to know John the baptist in a special way. He tells us that John the baptist saw Jesus coming to him and he said, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (@John 1:29). There is no forbidding in John the evangelist's account. He says, "But he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God" (@John 1:33,34). John the evangelist is always aiming to get souls to come to the knowledge of the Son of God. This great Person coming to do things for God, baptises with the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus does wonderful things. Just now, as regards the assembly, He is doing the *finishing* things. There are positions to be occupied, and He is filling them, baptising believers into the body. He wants some who are here tonight with this in view; and He is perfecting those of us who are already in the body. All is for the Father's pleasure. Here "the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him: and behold, a voice out of the heavens saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". God had been looking for it and He found what pleased Him, and He proclaimed it.
I want to point out that in Mark and Luke, the Lord Himself is addressed. *He* is to have the sense of heaven's delight in Him. The voice says, "*Thou* art my beloved
{187}
Son, in thee I have found my delight". Here in @Matthew 3 the voice says, "This is my beloved Son" -- it is addressed to others. When the Father intimates His pleasure in the believer, there is the understanding that it has to be maintained; it is to be a continuous matter, but it can only be by the Holy Spirit. Matthew says, "Then Jesus was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil" (@Matthew 4:1). Will He be pleasing to God then? Yes, every moment! Never more so. @Mark 1:12 says, "And immediately the Spirit drives him out into the wilderness"; the Holy Spirit takes the initiative. The position here is that things are thoroughly against you. Many do well when things are favourable, but recoil from what is adverse. Mark says the Lord "was with the wild beasts", but He was never more delightful to God. The Lord is a divine Person, but He is here as Leader for us; a guide for us. If I am to continue in the pleasure of God, it is only as I let the Holy Spirit have His way with me. The Lord, as perfect in manhood here, let the Spirit have His way with Him. That is very remarkable. Mark says, He was *driven* into the wilderness; Luke that He was *led* by the Spirit in the wilderness. As to believers, we are instructed that "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God" (@Romans 8:14).
My next point is Enoch in @Hebrews 11. It is a question of the pleasure of God before translation. If I am to *continue* to be pleasing to God, it is to be by the Holy Spirit, and His presence and support must be accompanied by self-judgment. The word to us is, "but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (@Romans 8:13). That is self-judgment making room for the Spirit. Now Enoch is representative of the saints as about to be translated. He lived only a little more than one-third of the average life of the patriarchs mentioned before him. He lived only three hundred and sixty-five years. In these years he
{188}
was pleasing to God. No doubt the allusion would be to the three hundred years during which he "walked with God". The life of Jesus was short, it was taken from the earth. It was infinitely precious to God. What delight God has in the presence of Jesus up there all the time! Enoch is in a certain sense a type of Christ; but he is more exactly a type of the assembly; that is, as translated -- not going through the great tribulation -- and expressing what pleases God before the translation.
Jude tells us in his short epistle what no one else tells us, that Enoch was a prophet. He prophesied about wicked people. In verse 14 he tells us that Enoch was "the seventh from Adam". So in @Genesis 5 the names of those that preceded Enoch are mentioned. *Enoch* would seem to mean one disciplined or educated. To be properly educated you have to take account of what preceded you. The seventh from Adam is Enoch according to the fifth chapter of Genesis, not according to the fourth. He is on the line of education. Now Cain's son is called Enoch too. Cain's world would say, We have an Enoch as well as you. Our people are just as well educated as yours. But the education is different. The curriculum is different. If you look at Cain's world it is a question of so-called science; iron, brass, music, and all that goes with these. Not so with Enoch the seventh from Adam. He is in the line of faith and so belonged to God's world. Cain's Enoch was the *first* from Cain, and his father made much of him in relation to his world. The first use of the word *son* in the Scriptures is in connection with Cain. That is a remarkable thing. Cain built a city, such as would afford scope for the arts and sciences, and he called his city after the name of his son Enoch; but our Enoch has to do with discipline and education, not in the sense of greatness in worldly institutions, but in the school of God. No one can please God who has not taken up that course.
{189}
Experience with God is what is needed. It is the beginning, and it is the end. It is a question of *knowing God and walking with Him*. Do not forget the walking with God three hundred years. Enoch would pray to God; a walk with God includes prayer, for the believer is dependent on Him. God has lesson books. Adam and all the others, six of them, that preceded Enoch were like these. He would seek to learn what was to be learned in Adam, and in Seth, and all the others. These were the lesson books. Christians are to remember their leaders: "Considering the issue of their conversation, imitate their faith" (@Hebrews 13:7). I would urge all to recall our own leaders for the last hundred years. To be simple, we are perhaps "the seventh" from them. God's book is full of examples. He would not write down one, two, three, four, five, six, on the line of education, save as there is something for us to learn. Each one of these six afforded some lesson for Enoch to learn. The passage cited from @Hebrews 13 conveys the idea. I learn more from persons, consistent, intelligent christians, than I do from books. Such persons are living witnesses of the mind of God; it is portrayed in them, The point is, that there are to be disciplined people who have learned from their predecessors and contemporaries.
The testimony comes down to us in persons who appropriated it and were formed by it. The true believer wants to take on their traits. Wisdom in young people will seek companionship in older and more experienced christians. The testimony is in living persons. The Bible is authoritative, given by the inspiration of God. The Holy Spirit is in the persons. Enoch the seventh from Adam would learn from Adam and the others mentioned. He would also learn negatively from Cain's line or others who turned away from the truth. He prophesied of wicked men (@Jude 15): "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads, to execute judgment against all". The Holy Spirit reserved this for Jude. Jude says in effect,
{190}
I am pointing you to persons. I am not writing much. His epistle would teach us from personal examples, positively and negatively. And then there is the great and blessed thought of companionship with God. Enoch was a companion of God. Thus before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God.
Then finally, according to the verse read in 1 Thessalonians, we are to *do something* to please God. Heaven looks for naturalness in the saints; that we should be what God has made us. God loves His own work. Paul now says to us, "For the rest, then, brethren, we beg you and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, even as ye have received from us how ye ought to walk and please God". The point is the manner of the christian's walk -- that *it* should please God. (J.N.D.'s footnote in the New Translation is instructive here -- 'I do not say ' to please, ' because then pleasing God would be a distinct object. Here it is rather ' to walk so as to please. ' The point is, the ' how, ' that is, the manner of doing it, not that it ought to be an object, however true that may be. ') God has made us spiritually. The Lord Jesus uses that word ' made '. God made the lion, the horse, the goat, the sheep and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. They were God's handiwork. What Adam called each, that was its name. They stand according to the names he gave them. The name given each would convey the feature of life seen in it. They are all, as it were, a vocabulary of divine thoughts, because the names are representative of the workmanship of God. In Proverbs we are told of certain creatures that are comely in their going. They are not regarded as on parade, but viewed according to what each is by nature. When a lion turns not away from any, that is *characteristic*; it is a type of a christian -- a courageous christian. He turns not away from any in contending for the truth. He is not simply looking up to see if God is looking at him. It is naturalness, as it were. When he is natural, that is, as God made him, God is
{191}
glorified in the gait of the creature. Thus it is a question of *how* you walk; and in effect you please God. You are a subject of the work of God, and true to that, you do what is right. You are a kind of creature that God needs and you are a testimony in your walk. God has made you, and every day that that marks you, you are a testimony to everybody and you please Him. It is what you are as the workmanship of God, your gait; you are comely in going. Every step taken pleases God. So the walk in the Lord Jesus; John sees Him coming to him and calls Him the Lamb of God. Enoch walked with God three hundred years. It is a question of walk, how we walk and please God. The apostle says, "even as ye also do walk, that ye would abound still more".
{192}
THE TRUTH
@John 3:21; @John 8:31,32; @John 16:13
I wish to speak a little about *the truth*, and I have selected John's writings on which to base my remarks because he speaks more about truth than any of the New Testament writers. He uses the word truth about forty times, as compared with the use of it about sixty times in the rest of the New Testament. He has this phase of the testimony particularly in mind, and it is significant inasmuch as he is "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (@John 21:20). Sometimes love is mentioned as over against the truth, and it is, therefore, significant that the disciple who knew love perhaps better than any, for he was the disciple whom Jesus loved, refers to truth so extensively. He says indeed, "Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us" (@1 John 3:16). He does not base his knowledge on the fact that the Lord loved *him*, but on the great general testimony of Christ's death, that He laid down His life for us. That is a great objective thought.
John nevertheless had a great opportunity of knowing love subjectively, and several times he refers to himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved. He must have had wonderful experiences of love in the Lord's company. It is a remarkable thing that he is said to have been *in* the bosom of Jesus at one particular time. What times he must have had! and they were intended to impress him, for if he is to speak of love, he is not only to know it objectively, but to convey the thought of it as *enjoyed*. The Lord, speaking to His own mother, said of John, "Woman, behold thy son"(chapter 19:26); so that he would come under the influence and affections of a real mother, who had experience such as no other mother ever had, nor could have. John had that advantage, as he stood in relation to her as a son to a mother; and that was in "his own home". Whether he lived alone otherwise
{193}
is not stated, but he took the Lord's mother to his own home; and he is in the relation of a son to her there; and she in the relation of a mother to him.
John thus had remarkable personal qualities in the service of God; and these were not to terminate at his death. They were to be passed on. What was formed in the early days has come down to us in the Spirit; not that the Spirit does not continue to develop fresh affections in the saints, but it is one of His services to carry down things to us in a tangible way; so that the assembly is enriched with the peculiar personal qualities of this great servant.
The light of these things will help us in this great matter of the truth, having in mind the last days, as we have often remarked, when the truth will be greatly compromised and lost to view. John is very insistent on its being kept in view, and not only in the Scriptures, and in our meetings, but in general practice. Hence the first verse I read says, "he that practises the truth comes to the light". It is a very important matter at this juncture to see, as I hope to make plain, that the truth involves principles; these principles are apt to be beclouded, it is the enemy's business to becloud them. The mystery of iniquity which began in the days of the apostle Paul has specially taken on the character of deception. It will culminate in the man of sin, whose coming is in all deceivableness of unrighteousness. He is at our very doors, we might say; not that he is here personally, but his features are here; they have been, indeed, right through, only that they are now more manifest in our own times; deceivableness of unrighteousness is one of the great features, and through this means Satan seeks to becloud the truth.
There is great importance, therefore, in keeping the Lord Jesus before us. John would do this, as I have been saying, in a special way, as over against this man of sin. The Lord said, "If another come in his own name, him ye will receive" (@John 5:43). "In his own name",
{194}
notice that. Name is renown, and whatever renown I may have acquired, as a natural man I will capitalise and enlarge; this will mark the man of sin, and, alas! the Lord has to say, "him ye will receive". I would say a word on that especially for the young ones here, for hero-worship is one of the features of the present time. Men of great doings, great renown, are apt to affect us in their favour despite their conduct; whether they are marked by deceivableness of unrighteousness, murder and rapine -- we are apt to be worshippers of them. That is to say, we are wanting in righteousness, wanting in truth, and hence the importance of developing in truth, to fortify ourselves against what the enemy is doing. The tendency in the young is to love to read of men of renown, and in some they became almost objects of veneration. That is just what the enemy wishes them to be. The whole world will wonder after the beast. "Who can make war with it?" (@Revelation 13:4) will be a common saying; and every time you let such expressions into your mouth you become defiled; you become darkened. Thus we may be found admiring one "whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall annul by the appearing of his coming" (@2 Thessalonians 2:8). *He* can make war with the beast.
Our position requires that we make war with him now on *spiritual* lines; to make war with him in our souls; to disallow in ourselves the hero-worship I have spoken of. The true antidote to all that is the Lord Jesus. He says, "I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; if another come in his own name, him ye will receive". How terrible that is for the Jewish people! They will receive him. No true lover of Christ will admire antichrist or anyone marked by his features.
How great is the importance of the practice of truth in fathers and mothers, in elder brothers and elder sisters, as regards their younger ones in the local meetings and in the general position of the saints; the practice
{195}
of the truth is the great antidote to what is false. The maintenance of it is deliverance not only for the brother who practises the truth, but for those who are nearby him. The scripture says, "he that practises the truth comes to the light"; there is no question of a specific time. It is characteristic of a person who practises the truth that he comes to the light; he does not evade the light. Let it shine ever so brightly, he comes to it. One of John's special words is, *Come*. The Lord Jesus used it Himself. When two disciples followed Jesus and showed their qualities in saying to Him, "Rabbi, ... where abidest thou?"; He said to them, "Come and see" (@John 1:38,39).
The word *come* appears here; "he ... comes to the light"; what for? "that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God". See what such a person has; he has something worth while; something that is to be manifested. Let everybody see it. If my deeds are wrought in God, they are worth seeing; they are not to be concealed. Think of the relation of the doer of the truth to God, "wrought in God". He is not talking about his deeds; they are manifested. The more he comes to the light, the more they appear. We are told that "that which makes everything manifest is light" (@Ephesians 5:13). Well, what are the most delightful things to be made manifest? Deeds wrought in God! They are perfect jewels. It is not simply objective truth, what I have in my mind, but the truth practised. They are to be *manifested*. Precious stones are not to be hidden away; they are to be manifested; and the greater the light, the more they are manifested -- seen as they are.
That is the first thing I had in mind. The opposite of that is, "For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light that his works may not be shewn as they are" (verse 20). Have we any difficulties? Why cannot we have them all laid out on the table? Why come into the assembly under a dark
{196}
cloud? Difficulties only crystallise as kept in the dark. Why not have them all spread out in the light? Is God not God? If I am in a place where God is not, I should not be there. If I am in a place where God is, and difficulties exist, I must spread out everything. Let the whole matter be manifested. Why conceal it? The light is there. Everything will be seen as it is, and I will be adjusted. If others need adjustment, this will come about also if God is there. God is light; but do I keep away from the light? do I conceal unjudged things? If so, where am I? What are my associations? "For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light that his works may not be shewn as they are". That is the opposite to what I have been speaking of. "That his works may not be shewn as they are"; it marks one who does evil, and who is on the road to destruction, whereas coming to the light is on the way of salvation. You need not be afraid of reproof; you should be reproved if your deeds are not right. The assembly is the place for reproof, as Paul wrote, "Those that sin convict before all" (@1 Timothy 5:20). The apostle Paul says of Peter, "I withstood him to the face" (@Galatians 2:11). Why did he do that? "because he was to be condemned".
Why should I avoid that? If there is anything in me blameworthy, let it be faced. Why should things continue on day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out, unsettled? It should not be. Paul says, "that which makes everything manifest is light" (@Ephesians 5:13). Light makes everything manifest, whatever it be. Let us then come to it. What could be a greater service, if there are dark parts, than that they should be exposed to myself and others? "That which makes everything manifest is light." When we come into the assembly, we ought to make people glad. The Lord Jesus is an example, He came into the assembly and made the disciples glad. I should feel it if I knew that when I came into the meeting, someone
{197}
wished I had not come in. The disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. If you come in with darkness in your face and war in your heart, you would be better away. I say that without hesitation. I would rather see you away. There is no remedy for darkness in me if I shut my heart to the truth, if I do not allow the light to come into my soul, and that constantly. The assembly is a place of light. If I go there I must be prepared for exposure. He that doeth truth cometh to the light. It is the movement of the heart, that you come to the light, where the light is shining most brilliantly that everything might be made manifest. If your motives or works are evil, let them be exposed and judged. If they are wrought in God, they are like precious jewels which make the hearts of the saints glad.
In @John 8 there is a further reference to truth. The Lord Himself is that. "Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him, If ye abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples". One of the features of John is that he recognises disciples that are not just equal to the designation. He uses the word "disciples" of persons who are not genuine believers on the Lord Jesus. John quotes the Lord as saying, "If ye abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples". You are disciples, He says, but you want to be disciples *truly*, as the New Translation puts it. They had recently believed on Him, but they were below the mark; their quality was low; that is one of the things that John brings out. He says in chapter 2:11, "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him". It was the beginning of signs. What was that sign? It was the turning of water into wine. I am not going to speak now of literal wine, but of the spiritual. It was the best wine kept until the last, and it caused joy. Wine is a symbol of joy. Now, if we have not joy, we are hardly disciples who believe on Jesus. If we have dark countenances we do not indicate that we believe on Jesus. Our hearts are
{198}
to be made glad. It was the best wine; it was the Lord's own product. It makes the true believer's heart glad. "He maketh ... wine which gladdeneth the heart of man; making his face shine with oil" (@Psalm 104:15). The first thing is the heart made glad. If I come into the meeting like a dark cloud, am I a characteristic disciple that believes on Jesus? I am not.
It was the beginning of signs, and Jesus "manifested his glory"; it caused His disciples to believe on Him. I should like to have seen them that day. I do not suppose the disciples and Jesus were in a group by themselves at the wedding feast. The scripture tells us, "And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. And Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage" (verses 1,2). The Lord and His disciples were at the wedding; no doubt they moved there severally even as others. The Lord would be very simple at that wedding. I do not suppose anybody present enjoyed the position in the true sense more than He. It would remind Him of His own union with the assembly soon to take place. But His marriage with Israel is more in view here. It is the third day, pointing to His millennial marital joy. The prominence of wine also suggests this. There is plenty of good wine; it was provided by Christ, kept till the end. Wine suggests earthly joy.
As I said, the Lord, I am sure, would be simple in such a circumstance. His attitude would be in keeping with it. I can see the Lord of glory there. He would speak to the bridegroom and the bride, perhaps bless them. He made the wine; He made them all glad; He manifested His glory. I suppose there never was such a wedding as that before. You can see the glory radiating from the Messiah. Typically, He was introducing the millennial day with all its glory and joy. Did He shut all that up in His heart? No; He let it shine out there. They might say, Master, it is a wonderful
{199}
time. He would answer, It is a wonderful time, but you are going to have still more wonderful times. He had just said to Nathanael, "Thou shalt see greater things than these" (chapter 1:50). The Lord was manifesting His glory, "and his disciples believed on him". The signs had them specially in view (@John 20:30). It does not say the bride or the bridegroom believed on Him, but His *disciples*. That is a point John is making; disciples must be *true* believers. Their faces are apt to be dark and gloomy, whereas the Lord would cause their faces to shine with the joy of the new wine. The Spirit filling our hearts with the love of God, makes us suitable for the assembly, so that we cause the saints to be glad when they see us. "And his disciples believed on him." That would mean for us now, that any among us that are prominent should encourage faith in others.
The disciples already had faith in some sense, but not in this way. They had never been in a scene like this before -- the wedding at Cana of Galilee. Two of them had just been to the Lord's place of abode. Someone might enquire from Andrew as to Jesus. He could say, I was in His house. The enquirer would, no doubt, like to hear about that house. That would be a suitable conversation at such a marriage. Andrew could tell him what he saw where the Lord dwelt. We abode with Him, he would say, from the tenth hour. Did the Lord serve him a meal? Doubtless, He would be a Host in His own abode. Well, as I said, that would be a profitable subject of conversation. Another one might say, I was at the Jordan when the Lord Jesus came to John to be baptised; and I heard Him say to John, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" (@Matthew 3:15). That is a very interesting subject; a fine subject for a marriage. And two of them would be talking about what the Lord Jesus said about righteousness -- *all righteousness*. In discipleship it is needful to be righteous. I could refer to other things to indicate what wholesome conversations could have
{200}
been started by these disciples of Jesus at that wedding. You know how light the talk often is at such a time. There would be nothing of this in the presence of the Lord. His mother says, "They have no wine", He answered, "What have I to do with thee, woman?". He was there in a spiritual way; the conversation must be spiritual; that is what He said in effect. "Mine hour has not yet come". That is another subject of conversation. Why did the Lord say that? There is a lot of meaning in it. I am just indicating how that marriage day could be filled up with the most precious subjects. The Lord was there, and manifested forth His glory, and His disciples believed on Him. What a radiation of glory!
Well, in chapter 8:31, He says to them, "If ye abide in my word". Here the Lord brings forward an important point. His *word*. He knows the mind of God and can convey it to us. Let us take it into our hearts. What does He convey to us in what He says? It is the mind of God, and we are to abide in it. Thus you will be My disciples indeed, He says. Then further, "and ye shall know the truth"; that is the point I wish to make. The word *know* there is objective. Generally speaking, today what is needed in the service to the saints is a ministry of the truth, for many of our brethren are in dark surroundings and associations. There is no value in attempting to minister it in a subjective sense until it is apprehended objectively. Let us see it by itself, as it were. Let it come out in its beauty. Look at it in its beauty. The idea of school is very common, and the thought in schooling generally is objective. Of course, there is the matter of manners and that sort of thing, but the main thought is objective knowledge. Get to know things, and then put them into practice. It is in the putting of them into practice that you realise how the truth sets you free; but you must know *it* first. Never mind whether it convicts or not; just let it have its own place; it is entitled to it.
{201}
Just look at it. Let it into your mind. God has given us minds, and He has given believers the Holy Spirit so that we might have renewed minds, and we must let the truth in its grandeur and glory enter into our minds. Ye shall know it, the Lord says.
The next thing is, my associations are condemned by it; my conduct is condemned by it; but that is not what I am speaking of for the moment. What I am urging is that we should get the great outline of the truth; that is sorely needed everywhere today. The first thing is objective truth in dealing with souls. The Lord had referred to His word. That is the truth *presented*; but the truth is a thing by itself. It is the principle by which the universe was made; everything must have been governed by truth. Let it, as seen in Christ, come into your mind, and then take your place in relation to it; that is the next thing.
For instance, thinking of Saturn and Mars, if I had the mind of an astronomer I would want to know about these planets, their relation to the sun, and so on; but then, suppose I am a star, for that is what the saints are; they are to shine as the stars for ever and ever; that is our position. John says, "and ye shall know the truth", the truth will put us in our own proper places, which all need. I stand in relation to the sun and to all the stars. I see the grandeur of the truth and then I say, I am *included* in it and I want to find my place in it. The effect of that is I am set free. It is the freedom of love, but it is the truth that has done it. I am in my position, I have found my niche, my place in the universe; and I am free. The stars are free, because they are all in their set positions. They move in their set relations; they move in their orbits. John is astronomical, and he has in mind that each of us should be in his place.
If you are not in fellowship, you are a wandering star. It is a most solemn thing to be outside of the circle of the saints of God. To say the least, it is an
{202}
unsafe position. You may come into collision with heavier bodies and be destroyed. Here the Lord says "the truth shall set you free". How does it set you free? You are to know it objectively. Think of the grandeur of the universe, to use the illustration. There are the heavens and the earth, and all the subdivisions of sun, moon and stars; and as to the earth, the mountains, seas, rivers, and so on. It is the grandeur of the thing. Then, where am I in relation to all this? "And ye shall know the truth", the Lord says. The article is before it. It is not simply *truth*, it is the knowledge of the whole range of truth that sets me free. The Lord goes, of course, beyond that. He goes on to sonship, but I am not speaking about that. Sonship is in correlation with this. The truth puts me in my place in relation to God, the saints and all things, and sonship means that I am there in family dignity in the enjoyment of it all. I never lose the family side of the position. I abide in the house for ever, but the truth is the first thing.
Now, finally, in chapter 16 the Lord says, "But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself, but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming". This is the final thought I had. It is the Spirit of truth, "he shall guide you into all the truth". I was speaking about knowing the truth objectively, and I would add to what I said as to it, that if I am on that line, I will not ignore the meetings whenever I can be present, because normally it is there that objective truth is opened up. I am speaking now of what is normal in christianity. The Spirit of God is in the assembly, and these meetings for Bible consideration are intended as occasions to open up the truth in its full proportions. If I am a student, as every christian ought to be, not what is called a student of divinity, but a student of the revealed mind of God, I will take advantage of every opportunity of that kind so that I may know the truth; know it
{203}
objectively; know it as a grand system of things that God has opened up.
Well, enlarging on that, this verse says, "But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth". There were great teachers, Paul, Peter, John, but the Spirit of truth can only be the Holy Spirit. I want you to note that word *guide*. You say, I can have that in my room. No doubt a student of the Scriptures is very safe in quietly retiring to his room, and getting down on his knees, and telling the Lord he does not understand this or that. Paul says, "The Lord will give thee understanding in all things" (@2 Timothy 2:7). Getting up from his knees, he opens his Bible and looks into the scriptures that pertain to the matters that are concerning him, and the Holy Spirit helps him, He *guides* him; but this verse is wider than that, for it contemplates the twelve apostles. They must have had wonderful times in the early days. They are all mentioned in the first chapter of Acts. They were in the upper room; they were not idle there; they would consider the Scriptures there, even before the Holy Spirit came. Later it is said, "every day, in the temple and in the houses, they ceased not teaching and announcing the glad tidings that Jesus was the Christ" (@Acts 5:42). Before the Holy Spirit came Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren and quoted the Psalms. He knew what psalm to quote. Let us contemplate them in the upper room, after the Holy Spirit came. The twelve would be sitting there; maybe sisters, too, were there and others; one hundred and twenty names.
The early chapters of Acts indicate all the meetings we have, whatever the forms; but let us suppose that as together they read @Psalm 2:7. "Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee". Someone would enquire of Peter, What does that mean? Peter might answer, Do you remember the day in which the Lord said to us, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?".
{204}
And we said so-and-so, and so-and-so, and so-and-so. And then Jesus said, "But *ye*,who do ye say that I am?". And I said, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (@Matthew 16:13-16). Then Nathanael might say, I can tell you something about that. I was sitting under the fig tree, and Philip said to me, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth" (@John 1:45). I was not much interested at first, but Philip said to me, "Come and see", and I went to see; and as I went to see, the Lord Jesus said of me, "Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile" (verse 47). And I said to the Lord, How do you know me? The Lord said, "When thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee". The brethren would be set free from their natural reserve: they would be softened together in their hearts. These were real disciples; these were men of real experience with the Lord Jesus. And then, Nathanael would say, I said to the Lord, "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel" (verse 49). And the question would be raised, How did you know He was the Son of God? How did you know He was the King of Israel? I decided in my mind, Nathanael would say, just at the time that only the Son of God could say that; that He saw me before Philip called me. I did not see Him; He saw me. I got the impression at the time that He was the Son of God, and @Psalm 2 came into my mind, which says, "Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee". "And *I* have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness." Perhaps he would say, I was reading that psalm, and it was fresh in my mind as I spoke to the Lord, and said, "Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel".
Well, all the brethren there would be free. The Holy Spirit was there; He was *guiding* them. Peter said one thing, and Nathanael another, and Matthew could say another. All the apostles could join in, each
{205}
contributing something which the Holy Spirit could use to develop the truth. What would be the effect after that meeting? Well, they would say, We had a wonderful time today. We had @Psalm 2, and the truth of the Son of God shone before us. We see it all now. Who guided them? The Holy Spirit. That is what we should have in mind in our Bible readings. Let us make room for Him; "when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming". I could illustrate what I have been saying in many other ways, but you can see what opens up to us today, as we throw to the winds our own wills and preconceived ideas and critical hearts, and sit down with one another on mutual lines as those who know the truth in an objective sense, and make room for the Spirit. See what wonderful things will come out; "for he shall not speak from himself". What He speaks is immediately from heaven; "whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming". You can see what is opened up to us. We have seen it, but perhaps we will see it more than ever from these remarks, what is opened up to us in these mutual meetings; meetings where love prevails and the Holy Spirit takes of the things of Christ and guides us into all the truth. We do not need a catechism, we do not need a creed; we need the Lord; we need the Holy Spirit, we need the Bible, we need one another. Thus we have the temple of God. It is on these lines that the holy canon of Scripture has been determined.
{206}
OUTLOOK
@Genesis 13:14-18; @Genesis 15:5,6; @2 Peter 1:9
I want to say something about *outlook*; it is a much used word. The outlook of many is dark at the present time. Sometimes the darkness arises from one's personal circumstances; sometimes from a pessimistic disposition, which makes more of what is against it than what is for it; and sometimes from a fearful disposition. The outlook of the characteristic believer is always bright and promising. It hinges on three things -- faith, hope and love. Faith and hope are grouped together; love is put over against them both -- "the greater of these" (@1 Corinthians 13:13). They are both great, but love is greater. It would seem as if faith and hope are of about the same value, but love is greater. Indeed, without it the other two become of little value. Without love we are nothing, that is what Scripture says; and, of course, that makes a great many people worth nothing; far more than, perhaps, many of us have imagined. Without love we are said to be nothing, a very solemn matter, because it is the divine standard. When God comes to weigh things, which He will do and is doing, there will be a standard, and that standard is Christ. Not that judgment is not graded; it is graded. You can understand that, when you receive the things done in the body in view of having a place in the kingdom, God will take great pains so that everything is accredited to one worthy of credits; but those who have no faith, who die in unbelief, and consequently have no love, are worthy of no credits; a most solemn consideration. So that it is well, if there be one here who is without love, to look into the matter. For a person with no love is nothing; in the divine realm he is nothing at all. Thus his outlook cannot be bright or assuring.
Well, the outlook, as I said, of the true christian is bright characteristically; always bright. The more
{207}
extensive the outlook the greater the brightness; and so God begins early to teach His people to look, to acquire the habit of looking afar off. Esau represents one of those in that period who could not see afar off. Peter alludes to such as he, and states certain things that are to be *added* to the christian, which enable him to see things afar off. Esau did not have these. He was a twin; he and Jacob were twins. They had equal advantages, but Esau could not see afar off. He came in from the field, like a young man who has been out to the football match, tired and hungry, and Jacob was cooking. He was a practical man. Every true christian is a practical man. Jacob was cooking a meal, and Esau, who could only think of immediate material things, said, I would like to have some of the food you are cooking. Jacob saw afar off, and saw that it was his opportunity to acquire what belongs to the purpose of God; and he made a bargain with a willing man for his birthright. The commodities in that transaction were a birthright on the one hand, which looked on into the future, into eternity, and on the other hand a mere mess of pottage. Weigh those two things. Put them on the scales. Well, they were put on the scales, and Esau said to Jacob, I will have the pottage, and you can have the birthright. That was a transaction between the twins, the two brothers. The one could not see afar off, and the other could and did, and secured the inheritance; which implied the inheritance of God, which He assigns to faith.
Well, all that is preliminary, and it is for every young person here, for each of us, to inquire as to whether he has ever had such a transaction as that. Buying and selling is a very common thing, but did ever two commodities like those go into barter? Here is a mess of pottage. But what did the man say? Esau said, I am going to die; what good is the inheritance to me?. The fact is, he did not value the inheritance. Many millions of believers, who valued the inheritance, since
{208}
that day have died. If I die as a believer I shall rise again. Faith appropriates that great fact. Esau had no thought of that at all, and yet he will be raised. How will he be raised? As the man that God hated! Think of the awfulness of being brought up from the grave as a man who not only hates God, but whom God hates! What will become of him? God will assign him as far away as hatred will have him go. Divine hatred is always right, just as much as divine love is right. "I loved Jacob." What will God do to Jacob when he comes up? He has a fixed place in blessing. God says, "*I* am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not God of the dead, but of the living" (@Matthew 22:32). He *is* their God; not He was. And Jacob will be raised as one whom God loves. It is a rare thing for God to speak of one particular person in this way. He says in the last book of the Old Testament, "I loved Jacob" (@Malachi 1:2). It was an historical matter. There was evidence of his lovableness from the outset. He took his brother by the heel in the womb. He was a supplanter of such a man, which would be in accord with the mind of God, who, as we have noted, "hated Esau". But He loved Jacob. All things work together for good for every one who loves God and whom God loves. Everything that happens works out for them; those who are the called according to His purpose. I have said all that because of Esau. He was short-sighted.
I turn now to Abraham; it is he whom I have specially in mind; the father of all believers. Lot was separated from him. What can we say of people who turn away from the truth? Are they worth anything? If they have not love, they are worth nothing; but as they turn away from the saints, God takes account of them, and He says, in effect, to the saints, I know you miss them; I know they cause you grief, and I want you to know I can recompense you. And so He says to Abraham, "Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where
{209}
thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward".
I want to stress the idea of a long outlook. We are today in the presence of great pressure, great sorrow; the most sorrowful time one has experienced. It is a time of great sorrow. God intends it to be that, but one intent in what is transpiring is that God's people should look a long way ahead and see the *end* of all things. Scripture stresses much the end which God has ordained. James says, "the coming of the Lord is drawn high" (@James 5:8); and Peter says, "the end of all things is drawn nigh" (@1 Peter 4:7). And again, "For yet a very little while he that comes will come, and will not delay" (@Hebrews 10:37). The end is stressed. Well, if it be stressed, why not look out for it? That is looking forward a long way. What is going to be the end of all this distress? God has His end. He has everything scheduled, and all is on His calendar. Nothing happens without Him. The sparrow does not fall without God; how much more a soldier on the battlefield? Or a seaman at sea? God has everything under His hand. The point is to learn to have a long look-out and see what is in mind. It does not matter what is in the minds of statesmen, for at best they do not see things clearly. The christian only can see a long way off. An unconverted man cannot see a long way off. As christians we should cultivate the habit of taking a long outlook. Get up as high as possible. You will remember how the angel took the prophet John, as he tells us in the book of Revelation, to an exceedingly great and high mountain to show him the heavenly city. It was worth showing and worth seeing. In the *wilderness* he saw the false city, but the heavenly is seen from a great altitude, seen in all its glorious features.
That is the principle as to Abraham. God says, Lift up your eyes and look northward, southward, eastward, and westward. And Abraham did so. God
{210}
says further, Whatever you see is going to be yours. Notice that. If you become depressed, lift up your eyes. God would lead you out to see all that He intends to give you. "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him" (@1 Corinthians 2:9). God says, Are they not worth looking at? They are going to be yours. But notice: What your eyes see will be yours. You say, Is that all I am going to have? If that be so, some of us will not have very much, for our outlook is usually contracted. I am speaking of what is for the believer's enjoyment at the present time. What you see is yours. We often think too much of current happenings, and our vision is so short that we do not see beyond them. Of course, we cannot wholly ignore current things, but we must not allow them to becloud eternal things. There are limits, of course. Even the inheritance that God assigns to us is not infinite; it is finite, but it is extensive and we are to look as far as we can. It is a question of the land, and each is to look as far as he can over the land. Look in all directions of the compass, and what you see will be yours. That is a present reality. Even although I have not visited the place, I can see further than my feet have travelled. What a comfort that is. Yes, that wealthy land, we will say it is the valley of the Jordan, a rich territory, say it is Carmel (Carmel was a fruitful place on the coast of the Mediterranean) and all other rich parts of the territory -- well, it is mine. If I can see it, it is mine. That is what God says. I do not need all that, Abraham might say; I have not an heir. What good is all this territory to me, if I have not an heir? God says, You are to have not only an heir, but a countless seed; if you can count the dust of the earth then you can count your seed. You will have plenty of family companionship. Abraham would value that. It is said that he dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob. You say, Why not Esau? Well evidently Esau was not
{211}
available. He was a fleshly-minded young man, and Abraham was a spiritually-minded father. It is most sorrowful if a father cannot have companionship in a young son or daughter -- he being spiritual, and the young one carnal. Abraham did not have companionship with Esau, but he did with Isaac and Jacob. If he had a million like them he would dwell with them also. God impresses upon him, You will have an immense family. Throughout the north, south, east and west of the land they would be seen as the dust of the earth for numbers.
Well, now, we come to @Genesis 15, where we have the heavens; and I would point out that the chapter begins with "the word of Jehovah". It is the first time you get the expression; not that what He said to Abraham in chapter 13 was not this; but the word of God coming in formally has a certain meaning. "For the word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (@Hebrews 4:12). God now speaks to Abraham by His word, the word of Jehovah, and in a vision, implying, I believe, that Abraham is progressing in the truth. As spoken to in vision he is not diverted by external things; he is abstracted from natural conditions. Thus God can speak to him now wholly as He would wish to. It is all by divine arrangement. It is now to be God's word, and surely it will be so in Abraham's heart. "Thy word have I hid in my heart" (@Psalm 119:11). The word of God has a great place in that sense; it has a great place morally. That is the point in chapter 15. It is a question of vision and the word of God. God says, Look up and count the stars, if you can. You say, Well, what is the difference?. You cannot count the stars and you cannot count the dust of the earth. I would rather count the stars, if they are countable. It is more interesting work. Every one of them contains
{212}
something that encourages me. Dust in itself cannot encourage me at all; but God can make dust to *live*; and He did. The dust of Egypt was made to live. Gnats were made out of the dust, and the magicians of Egypt said, We cannot do that; we can imitate Moses and Aaron to a point, but we cannot produce life. Thank God! God does that. Man cannot do it.
As to the stars, every star as made has glory. To count things that have glory is educational. As so engaged I am likely to take on their glory. It is a remarkable suggestion, an opportunity for the taking on of glory; "for star differs from star in glory" (@1 Corinthians 15:41). What a field for the eye of faith! We can look away from this poor earth and its happenings. Abraham lived in a time of a great war; four nations against five. He did not join either; but he rescued Lot. That represents the fight of faith, and that, dear brethren, belongs to us; fighting for our brethren. The Lord says, "All who take the sword shall perish by the sword" (@Matthew 26:52): that is not the sword of the Spirit, the word of God. If I take this, I can use it. It is living and operative. So God said to Abraham, Count the stars. As I look on every face here, there is not one like the other. That is like the stars; "for star differs from star in glory". In one sense we are all alike, and will be in glory, but everyone will be distinguishable; and so it is with the stars; "for star differs from star in glory". That is how we shall be eternally. Think of the millions of glories shining in the saints!
@Genesis 13, I believe, alludes to Abraham's earthly family, and chapter 15 to the heavenly. Paul later says, "For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named" (@Ephesians 3:14). He knows all the stars, and all the earth is His. The Lord Jesus, when He comes in glory by-and-by, as He says Himself, will sit down on the throne of His glory, not simply a glorious throne, but the *throne of His glory*.
{213}
And all the nations shall be gathered before Him; certain on His left hand called goats, and certain on His right hand called sheep. And He says to the sheep: "Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the world's foundation: for I hungered, and ye gave me to eat; I thirsted, and ye gave me to drink ... (@Matthew 25:34,35). And He says to the goats, You did not do this. "Depart from me." You did not come to Me when I was sick. They did not have love. There will be those on earth presently called saved ones; the nations of those that are saved. They will all be known to God; as He says to Abraham, If one can count the dust of the earth, your seed also can be numbered. Thus God brings us into great things as to the number of persons of the seed of Abraham.
In @Genesis 15 it is the stars. That is, as I understand it, the heavenly family. And Abraham would have a long outlook; he could look into the distance. As possessed of faith, God gave Abraham power to look up into the heavens. "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (@Hebrews 11:3). It is by faith, not by telescope. God is speaking of persons when dealing with the stars. Look down the line of Abraham and think of the glorious persons; "this man was born there" (@Psalm 87:6). Think of the Lord Jesus. The great Sun of the moral universe is in the family of Abraham. He is the Root and the Offspring of David. Think of how luminous, how glorious He is! "*I* Jesus" (@Revelation 22:16). Does it appeal to you? He says, "*I* Jesus ... *I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". Does this appeal to your heart? It ought to. Abraham could see that; he had faith for it. The Lord Jesus says, "Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced" (@John 8:56). He was able to look down the line, and see that great Luminary, the Lord Jesus.
{214}
Well now, I have spoken about Esau and how short-sighted he was; and how long-sighted Abraham was, and what a testimony to this were the Lord's own words about Abraham. You say, How did the Lord know it? He says in the same section, "Before Abraham was, I am" (@John 8:58). Let us all have in our souls the truth of the Person of Jesus; who He is. Who do men say that He, the Son of man, is? Relatively, His Name is seldom mentioned with reverential respect in the world. The profane way in which His precious Name is dragged into the gutter by filthy mouths is distressing to those who love Him. Heaven hates it. The name of Jesus is taken in vain, desecrated, blasphemed. We read in the Scriptures of those who blasphemed the excellent Name; a terrible sin. So, as I said, let us get into our souls the truth of the Person of Jesus. He says, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?" (@Matthew 16:13). The disciples answered that some said one thing, and some another. But He says to them, "But *ye*, who do ye say that I am? And Simon Peter answering said, *Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (verses 15,16). He does not say, The eternal Son. That is a word in the creed, but not in Scripture. But He says, "Before Abraham was, I am". Who is the Creator of the world? You say, God. Yes. But who is the actual Person? Jesus. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. *He* was in the beginning with God. All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being" (@John 1:1-3). Jesus was the Person who took Abraham out and told him to look at the stars. Jesus, unquestionably. Who made the world when wisdom was there? "When he prepared the heavens I was there; ... when he appointed the foundations of the earth" (@Proverbs 8:27-29). Who was the Creator? Wisdom did not create the world. The actual Creator was the Lord Jesus; the Jehovah of @Proverbs 8:22; the "he" of verses 26 to 29. Let us
{215}
get these facts into our souls. They will make men out of us as we believe them. "Before Abraham was, I am". Not, I was. He is the eternal I AM. Essentially, He lives outside of time. He made time and has come into time, but abstractly, as in Deity, He is where there is no time. We cannot talk of time in the uncreated condition of things where God is. He has come into the created sphere, but nevertheless "dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see" (@1 Timothy 6:16). You say, That is before Jesus became Man. No, He is God (@1 John 5:20). "No one has seen God at any time" (@John 1:18). Let us have the truth of His deity in our hearts. He has come into time in manhood; but He is the same Person, unchanged and unchangeable, that is Jesus.
I have said all that as speaking of what the Lord said about Abraham, "Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced". Abraham was able to look into the future and see Jesus. At least, it is accredited to him that he saw Him. Then the Lord says, "Before Abraham was, I am". Not, Before Abraham *is* I am, but, "Before Abraham was, I am". That implies Deity. So that we must have the Lord before us in a worshipful way, in a reverential way. Like the magi that came from the east; they came to worship Him as born; as a Babe they came to worship Him. "Where is the king of the Jews that has been born?" (@Matthew 2:2). Let us get that worshipful thought into our hearts. Keep it all the time; always ready to bow down and worship the Lord. Jesus is to be honoured as the Father is to be honoured. That is what He says Himself. Well, you say, what about the eternal Son -- I have always believed that. Putting sonship, beloved friends, into pre-incarnate Deity is not right. It is not scriptural. The creed says, ' Begotten of the Father before all worlds '. Now analyse that statement. He is not begotten at all before all worlds. He is God before all worlds. He is begotten in time. "Thou art my
{216}
Son: *I* this day have begotten thee" (@Psalm 2:7). That is time, not eternity. You will pardon me for a little digression, but I see the importance of having the deity of Jesus before us. "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" (@Colossians 2:9). Everything attributed to the Father, every honour accorded the Father, must be accorded to the Son, or we have not the truth of the Person of the Son in our hearts. "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father)" (@John 1:14). Why does it not say that in the earlier verses? Scripture is infinitely accurate. It is as having become flesh that it is said of Him that He was contemplated and seen as an only-begotten with a father.
As we come to Peter, we have this confirmed. He speaks to us about things to be added, which give us long sight. "But for this very reason also, using therewith all diligence, in your faith have also virtue, in virtue knowledge, in knowledge temperance, in temperance endurance, in endurance godliness, in godliness brotherly love, in brotherly love love" (@2 Peter 1:5-7). Notice these additions to faith, to add to your faith. You begin with faith, then virtue, knowledge, temperance, endurance, godliness, brotherly love, and then love. Then he says, "for these things existing and abounding in you make you to be neither idle nor unfruitful as regards the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; for he with whom these things are not present is blind, short-sighted, and has forgotten the purging of his former sins" (verses 8,9). This is the word for us in a practical way, possibly involving a rebuke to our souls. We cannot see afar off. A young man or a young woman may be unable to see beyond his or her local matters, perhaps only immediate temporal matters. You may say, Things are dark. Well, lift up your eyes; it is bright beyond. If you are a believer your great property is beyond. Your life is not in the temporal things you possess; it is not even in your
{217}
business or family or acquaintances. It is beyond; it is above; therefore lift up your eyes. Learn to do it. You may inquire, What shall I see? Well, the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews would say, "we see Jesus" (@Hebrews 2:8). That is what faith can see. The writer of the Hebrews says that; he says it about himself and others. Where do we see Jesus? "Crowned with glory and honour" (verse 9). Stephen saw Him there. If Stephen were looking around only at the immediate environment, what would he see? Stones flying at him from here and there, and those who cast them. Terrible! But he did not look that way at all. He found a place for kneeling and knelt down. He says, The heavens are opened to me. "Lo, I behold the heavens opened" (@Acts 7:56). Oh, you say, that is Stephen. Of course it is, but is there not some little way in which I can see what he saw? What do I see inside the heavens? Stephen says, "Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God". What else would I see? The glory of God. Is the glory of God in those stones? Not a bit. The devil was in those stones, forcing the precious life out of the martyr's body. "And they stoned Stephen" -- and what was he doing? "Praying, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (verse 59). What were they doing? Servants of the devil, they were forcing his life out of his body. What was he saying? "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" (verse 60). How glorious! That was Stephen. Was he just looking at the stones? No. He was looking up; he had a long outlook, looking into glory. He said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit". Perhaps the Lord never received one with more delight. That spirit was received by the Lord Jesus. Stephen was His martyr. Paul, that great servant, later said, "And when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of them who killed him" (@Acts 22:20). I am speaking of Stephen's outlook. I would say, think of that --
{218}
what you may see up there; what I see on the principle of hope. Hope is based on promises and on counsels of God. "Hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (@Romans 5:5). What is there to be hoped for? We are hoping for sonship. That is what you get in @Romans 8. We are hoping for the resurrection. Paul says, "To which our whole twelve tribes serving incessantly day and night hope to arrive" (@Acts 26:7). And they will come to it; and so ourselves. What a hope! The hope of the resurrection. The Lord Jesus will come from heaven with archangel's voice, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, and then we shall be changed and caught up to be for ever with the Lord (@1 Corinthians 15:52; @1 Thessalonians 4:16,17). That is hope, is it not? Hope is an immense thing to have; hope of the resurrection. It is victory, as the Lord Jesus says, "Behold, the devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life" (@Revelation 2:10).
As things seem to be dark, look out at the great circumstances of hope, the great circumstances of love. Find out the centre of love. The centre is in heaven. The love of God is made good down here, shed abroad in the hearts of the saints by the Holy Spirit. Love is the greatest of all, says the apostle. If we have that in our hearts, the radius becomes greater and greater. The radius of love is eternal; the radius of hope, of course, has a limit, because when the hope is realised there is no more need for it, but love realised is eternal. It is the greatest of all qualities. I am speaking now of the radius of hope. If my circumstances are dark today or tomorrow, look out into the distance, into the realm of promise, into the realm of counsel. It is hope that makes not ashamed, because of the love of God in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.
{219}
Over against all that there is the solemn fact of which Peter speaks, "he with whom these things are not present is blind, short-sighted, and has forgotten the purging of his former sins". That is to say, if we are lacking those things, we have a short outlook, so short that we even forget that our sins are forgiven us. How terrible that plight would be! A man who once rejoiced in the forgiveness of sins has forgotten it and is plunged back into the darkness of unbelief. That really is the end of those who separate themselves from the realm of faith, hope, and love, the principles of fellowship. Such become short-sighted, whereas in the Spirit we shall never have dark days. We always have relief in looking outward, to the east, west, north or south, of the great realm of divine purpose in the heavens. There are three mentioned, but there are countless heights beyond the numbered heavens. The uncreated realm of God cannot be measured. Let us look off in that direction.

Pages 220-407 -- "The Second Established". Readings on Job and other Ministry, Canada, 1941 (Volume 155).
THE SECOND ESTABLISHED (1)
@Job 1:1-22; @Job 2:1-10
J.T. The Lord, I believe, will help us in looking at this book as showing how priesthood is reached and how God "takes away the first that he may establish the second" (@Hebrews 10:9) The *first* is seen in the prominence given to the eldest brother, and how the sons and daughters carried on without their father. Their father, on the other hand, exercises priestly service for them. It is said, "Job sent and hallowed them; and he rose up early in the morning, and offered up burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually". He exercised priesthood in regard of his family. In verse 13 we read, "And there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn". This is mentioned in view of the calamity about to come on Job. We are reminded thus that the natural must give place to the spiritual, and the book of Job shows how this comes about. While the natural is being preserved in Job's family, the sons of God do their part; they have to be taken into account, for an underlying thought in the instruction is, that God had *His* family. The sons of God come to present themselves before *Him*, and we shall see how this works out as we proceed. God had a family in mind before He developed that thought in relation to man. It was, I suppose, an angelic family forming a background for God's operations on the earth.
L.E.S. Where does the book of Job fit into the canon of Scripture?
{221}
J.T. Well, it clearly does fit in. The canon of Scripture has been reached through spiritual intelligence and understanding in the saints, and Job has its place as thus determined. The link between mankind in general and God's special people who were taken up from Abraham, is clearly set out in the book. The relation between the persons spoken of and Abraham's family is seen in Genesis, but the book contemplates a work of God outside of this family, for God is not restricted to the family of Abraham. God is never restricted. He always has a free hand and a background of reserves. The sons of God were there and seen in relation to mankind. Job is seen in relation to mankind too, but he had no special link with God as Abraham had. He just belonged to the generations of Noah, and God operated to effect a new family in Job's house. The background to this is seen in God's angelic sons. Satan is challenged as he comes up among the sons of God. He had been, he said, "going to and fro in the earth"; not yet attacking Israel as God's special people; the whole earth is his field, and he is watching what God is doing with a view to nullifying it. There can be no doubt of that; it has developed throughout the history of man. The constant effort of the devil is to set aside what God is doing, but this book shows God's triumph. "In all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed anything unseemly to God". The battleground was in Job and God triumphed in Job.
D.R. Is the final triumph seen in the first being taken away and what is spiritual, the second, being established?, "afterwards that which is spiritual".
J.T. That is clearly written in this book. At the end, Job's second family does not increase in number as his sheep, camels, oxen and asses do, but Job's family increases in *quality*. It is an entirely *new* family. The first is set aside to establish the second; typically, the second is christianity.
L.E.S. As to Satan here; what is the teaching?
{222}
J.T. Well, he evidently assumes to be of the angelic line, as one of the sons of God. He was there as they were there, "an angel of light". In the typical reference to Satan in Ezekiel, he is spoken of as beautiful, one of God's creatures, raised up above other angels, but he is not seen in that connection here. He is having to say to the human race, and for this purpose transforming himself into an angel of light (@2 Corinthians 11:14).
J.D. The testimony of the Spirit to this man Job is that he was perfect and upright and one that feared God and abstained from evil. He was all that, and probably contemporary with Abraham.
J.T. Clearly the history fits in with Genesis, but it shows that God is not restricted to Israel; you may see this also in the New Testament in the wise men from the East. There is no evidence that they knew the Scriptures as they arrived at Jerusalem, but they had light from God through a star. "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse sheweth the work of his hands. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech and there are no words, yet their voice is heard" (@Psalm 19:1-3). These men were astronomers, probably, and God takes them up in that connection. They understood the stars; they knew Christ's star. They did not worship the star, but they recognised the King of the Jews and worshipped Him.
L.E.S. Knowing God in that way, they fear Him.
J.T. There was always something in evidence throughout the Old Testament. Take a man like Melchisedec, contemporary, perhaps, with Job; he is "king of righteousness", not only a righteous man, but *king* of righteousness, a man with authority to enforce righteousness. He was also king of peace; there was authority in that connection. He is a wonderful type of the Lord Jesus, but undoubtedly a real man amongst men. He *blessed* Abraham.
{223}
J.D. There is no record of how Job became "greater than all the children of the east". With Abraham, it is different. He came out of his country and from his father's house.
J.T. God had something special in view. He had evidently taken care of Job. Indeed each one of us has the special attention of God in this way; and Satan attacks us accordingly. "And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah". It is not said that God's sons were told to do this; but it may have been a fixed arrangement. "There was a day," literally ' the ' day; that would seem as if it was an arranged matter. Now for us the Lord's day is *the day* of the week. Israel had many days for special convocations. God made time; He used it first, and now it is available for His people. Here evidently the angels have part in time as we have.
L.E.S. There is a reference in @Lamentations 4:21, to the land of Uz, as well as the three references to the name Uz in Genesis.
J.T. Yes. It is remarkable that the weeping book should include the land of Uz. It indicates some relation to Esau, and thus with Abraham's family; and yet Job is clearly to be viewed as outside of Israel. The book of Job stands in relation to man generally.
D.R. You were speaking of priesthood. What is to be learned in Job's "burnt-offerings"?
J.T. That is an indication of priesthood, but in relation to the old order; the first family. He exercised the service himself; the desire for it did not seem to arise with his family; he *sent* and hallowed them, and offered up burnt-offerings according to the number of them all. Why did he not go and see what was going on? It seems that they were carrying on without their parents. They were celebrating; each one on his day, evidently in relation to the order of nature. "And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the first-born".
{224}
Clearly that is the order of nature which God, in principle, had already set aside in His dealings with Cain: also in Noah's family, for Shem, although not the elder (@Genesis 10:21), had the first place.
W.F.K. Although Job was perfect and upright, and had priestly features, God passed him through discipline so that he might be a better priest.
J.T. Yes; what is stressed at the end is that he prayed for his friends. They were to go *to him*, taking specified burnt-offerings with them. "My servant Job shall pray for you, for him will I accept", Jehovah says. He acted in grace towards those who persecuted him. The spirit of Christ was in him. In principle, he functioned as a high priest, securing divine favour for those he served. "Jehovah accepted Job." God would bring in another family and another order of priesthood. Cain called his city after his son (@Genesis 4:17) -- the first time in Scripture that the term ' son ' is used. Cain pursued the natural line and way, but Adam had a third son, Seth, who accepted man's status as having sinned, calling his son, Enos; meaning that he was *mortal*. The purpose of God could not be worked out in him; there must be another man. Christ is needed, who has annulled death and brought to light life and incorruptibility (@2 Timothy 1:10). He is eternal life, and it is in Him for us. This contemplates a new order of manhood, a new divine family, in which Christ is Firstborn. He is a new Priest constituted "according to power of indissoluble life"; and "a Son perfected for ever" (@Hebrews 7:16,28). All this is in mind in the book of Job.
J.D. In referring to Job in a priestly way sending and hallowing his children, had you thought that would help them in regard of their affections Godward? "For Job said, It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts".
J.T. Yes; but it was done at a distance, and clearly aside from their exercises. He would hold them in a
{225}
superficial way. Were their exercises Godward at all? It is questionable. They were carrying on in a social way by themselves, evidently leaving their parents out, and leaving God out also. They were taken away most solemnly by "a great wind from over the wilderness". The first is thus taken away.
D.R. Jehovah had the spiritual line in view.
J.T. Yes. He would bring out His own work. There are 29 chapters showing the thoughts of man, but what God said about Job at the outset was true. The two conversations between God and Satan teach us that. In his first efforts Satan was defeated. We are told by the Spirit of God that "In all this Job did not sin with his lips". Satan utterly misjudged Job; he cannot tell what is in the hearts of believers; he only knows what is in our hearts by our words or actions. In chapter 1:22 we read "In all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed anything unseemly to God", then in chapter 2:10, "In all this Job did not sin with his lips". So Satan is not formally mentioned in the book afterwards. God's work so far is successful. Thus the children of God are manifest (@1 John 3:10). They cannot sin because they are begotten of God. This, however, has to be viewed abstractly, for as in their mixed condition, they can sin (@1 John 1:10).
Ques. What do you understand by the "hedge"?
J.T. "And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side?" What Satan said was malicious, and it was untrue as the sequel showed; he would make out that God's work would not stand alone: that, in fact, Job's piety was only the outcome of material gain and through God's favour, and that it could collapse if this gain were withdrawn.
J.C. How do you understand God's word to Satan? "There was a day when the sons of God came to present
{226}
themselves before Jehovah ... And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou?"
J.T. Well, what a day it must have been! How did the sons of God come up? How many were there? Did they know Satan was amongst them? Or were they like the apostles with Judas amongst them? The Lord said, "Have not I chosen you the twelve? and, of you one is a devil" (@John 6:70). The apostles apparently did not know, for when the Lord said one of them would betray Him, each of them said, Lord, is it I? Not one of them pointed to Judas. Did these sons of God know Satan as distinct from themselves? Well, if they did not know it, God did. If one at all like Satan comes among the saints, God will expose him. "And Jehovah said to Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job ...?" Satan spoke as if he had full liberty on the earth, as if he had right of way there. God says, I have a servant on that earth. Will *he* give Satan right of way? Will he open his door to him? Satan may assume much more than is true, but can he go up and down in Job's property? God implies that *He* has something on the earth. All the pressure only serves to bring out what God has on the earth. This is strikingly true in certain countries today.
Ques. Would it be in keeping with what the Lord says to Peter, "Satan hath desired to have you"? (@Luke 22:31).
J.T. He sought to have them all. The Lord prayed for Simon that his faith should not fail. The real Priest had come in then. It is hardly so with Job here. The real Priest comes in for Peter. "Satan hath desired to have you"; the *you* there would refer to them all; but then the Lord says, "I have prayed for thee"; that is Peter individually; "that thy faith fail not". The Lord would allow the testing and even the failure with a view
{227}
to Simon's gain through the consequent discipline, but He prayed that Simon's faith should stand.
W.F.K. Here the sons of God present themselves before Jehovah. Would that be like the Lord's day morning meeting and service Godward at that time?
J.T. Well, it points to the service of God, which enters peculiarly into the Lord's day. "And there was a day" -- a day on which the sons of God gathered themselves before Jehovah, and Satan knew about it. It is literally ' the ' day, as already noted.
L.E.S. Does this thought of sonship in angels set out that sonship is a primary thought with God?
J.T. Clearly. God had a family of His own, before man was created. Angels were created before the earth (@Job 38:7); but this family is not the final thought of God. Man is the great thought of God, as we see in @Psalm 8. @Hebrews 1:14 also illuminates the matter. God shows what is in His mind, but the angels are not set aside; they take a certain place in active service as seen in the gospels; they are subservient to men -- those who inherit salvation.
There is a certain family sphere seen here, "the sons of God". Could Job be numbered amongst them? He could at the end of the book. Israel was designated Jehovah's son (@Exodus 4:22), and individually the Israelites were His sons (@Deuteronomy 14:1). Job would be a son too, as chastened of God and as made a priest, as in chapter 42. All this awaited the incarnation, for it is in Christ that it took form according to divine counsel (@Galatians 4:1-7). In offering burnt-offerings for them all, Job said, "It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts". The passage does not tell us that he went to inquire. As information is needed about young people, it is wise to ask their fathers and mothers. They are the ones that should know. It does not seem as if Job had found out if they had sinned; he says, *may be* they have. It is not to be a question of "may be"; we should know. If a young
{228}
person wishes to break bread, we should ask the parents about them -- they are in the position to know, and, as with God, they will know.
Ques. Does this have any bearing on the two sons of Eli? Eli did not check them at all.
J.T. Yes, that would fit in. He failed to restrain his sons, though he knew of their wicked conduct. Job's sons were feasting, and they sent for their three sisters, but what about their father and mother? "And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn". Well, Job was not invited as far as we know, but then, why not go uninvited? It says, they were drinking wine; perhaps they were drinking too much wine. Why not go and find out?
L.E.S. Would there be a marked contrast with Abraham? Scripture says he dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob (@Hebrews 11).
J.T. Yes; and Job was probably contemporary with Abraham, who dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob. Esau was not there. He had the character of Job's family; he sold his birthright, and thus was not an heir with Abraham.
Ques. Job acts in a priestly way, and yet it did not seem to be very effectual.
J.T. The Spirit of God gives us this account; He mentions that Job offered sacrifices for his family. There is much in it for us. We have talked about the book of Job being in the canon of Scripture, but is it practically in our canon? Is it an inspired matter with us? Every inspired book is written for a definite purpose, and we are to discover this and gain by it. In the book of Revelation the Lord tells John what to write, and it is the same thing here. A spiritual man wants to find out the lesson in it for him.
A.D. Satan destroys the first family (chapter 1), but there is another family seen in the end of the book.
{229}
J.T. Yes. This is a solemn matter. It is a question of what has place in my house, the first or the second. Am I going to promote what is connected with the first?
L.E.S. It is beautiful to note the order of Scripture. Job comes before the Psalms, and what the Psalms indicate.
J.T. Yes; the whole book of Psalms has Christ in mind. The "second" is in mind from the outset. Did Job in the beginning have the second in mind? He was a very rich man. Each of his sons had his own house; and Job would have his own house, the largest of them all probably. There was great evidence of wealth, but much material wealth tends to shut out the "second" -- Christ. The apostle Paul says, trust not "on the uncertainty of riches" (@1 Timothy 6:17). Money always promotes show. Job was the greatest man in the East, but what place had Christ typically with Job? There had been evidences of Christ. The Spirit of God preached through Noah, who was a preacher of righteousness (@1 Peter 3:19,20; @2 Peter 2:5). Noah had built an ark for the saving of his house. The point for each is, are we going to hold our families? It needs more than outward religious observances; the Spirit of Christ must be manifested in our houses. This came out in Noah in a striking way, and so was a testimony on God's part which Job should have known.
W.F.K. If we do not take account of this, God will come in in government.
J.T. Baptism must be brought in; not only baptism *to* Christ, but to His *death*. The death of Christ brought into the house will make way for the second; it implies the taking away of the first and the establishing of the second.
J.D. Satan speaks of the great care exercised by God over this man, saying, "Doth Job fear God for nought?" The following chapters show how far God can use the enemy in bringing about a true priestly state in us. Is it something like the thorn for the flesh?
{230}
J.T. Just so. A messenger of Satan it is called. Satan did not realise that he was doing such a service to Paul. It shows what God may order or allow in His discipline of His people. Every true father and every true mother here knows what happens in this way in families so that the first might be set aside and the second brought in. In speaking of widows Paul says, "Let a widow be put upon the list, being of not less than sixty years, having been wife of one man, borne witness to in good works, if she have brought up children, if she have exercised hospitality, if she have washed saints¬ feet, if she have imparted relief to the distressed, if she have diligently followed every good work" (@1 Timothy 5:9,10). She qualifies because she has set aside the first in the house. She is brought into the gain of Paul's ministry; the second is established in the house. Lydia had all this in mind as she asked Paul to come into her house, *after she had been baptised*. She recognised the necessity of setting aside the first. Cain had no idea of that. He called his son Enoch, which implies education, which would, in his house, be after the order of nature, after the order of this world.
W.F.K. Job is a servant of God, but Satan attacks him through his family.
J.T. You can see it in verse 13 before there is any mention of discipline. "And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn". The Spirit of God sets all this down in that verse. This time it is in the elder brother's house, the firstborn; they were eating and drinking wine. Did Job go and look in there? If he knew himself, he would know what young people are capable of. They invited their sisters. They would make the most of family connections, but where were the father and mother? Job says, Possibly they have sinned. Why not go and find out? He is aiding them in their worldly course. It is evident they were not married, and hence their father's house should have
{231}
been their abode, for it is as married that a man leaves his father and mother (@Genesis 2:24).
Rem. The children did not invite him.
J.T. Well, if they will not come to you, you go to them. Of Abraham it is said that he dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob. It could not have been for long in Jacob's case, because Abraham was one hundred and sixty years old when Jacob was born -- a matter of about fifteen years before he died. That is generally the most difficult time of a child's life. Parents must watch them then.
D.R. Adonijah was not restrained by David and so he wanted to be crowned king in a lawless way.
J.T. Yes; his father had not grieved him at any time in saying, "Why doest thou so?". It is Nathan the prophet who comes in to settle the matter; he tells Bathsheba of Adonijah's aggression; he reminds her of the promises regarding Solomon. Every parent has promises about his family. Indeed, the first commandment with promise is connected with the family (@Ephesians 6:2). So Nathan goes first to Bathsheba and prompts her to go to David, and then he himself can augment what Bathsheba says, primarily on the line of promise. That is what the ministry meeting should effect as there is a prophetic touch in it; to bring in correction so that evil that may be current is dealt with.
Ques. Who is the messenger in verse 14? "there came a messenger to Job".
J.T. There are four of them: verses 14, 16, 17 and 18. They all bring tidings of disaster. Elihu speaks of a messenger, one among a thousand, to show man his duty (@Job 33:23). He brings a man to uprightness, in judging himself; he brings about repentance. That would be a messenger, one among a thousand. These bring tidings to Job, which are calculated to cause unspeakable sorrow. It was a necessity to bring out Job's integrity.
{232}
J.C. In @Malachi 2:7, the priest is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.
J.T. Each of the messengers who came to Job says, "I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee". These messengers bring tidings of sorrow. Job did not know what had overtaken him until these men came; but in all this Satan is not successful, although he would do anything to overcome Job.
J.D. These messages maybe like a prophetic touch in the meeting for ministry. Everything is not destroyed, for one escaped to tell.
J.T. The Spirit of God has called much attention to @1 Corinthians 14:23-33. The passage shows what effect the prophetic word has. A man comes in as the prophetic ministry goes on; he falls down convicted of all, judged of all, and worships God. These messengers brought accurate tidings, and all, while testifying to calamity of the most dreadful kind having befallen Job, only brought out the triumph of the work of God in him. "Job rose up, and rent his mantle ... and worshipped; and he said ... Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah! In all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed anything unseemly to God". The testimony to disaster is conclusive, and Job accepted it. He does not say, That cannot possibly be true. He accepted the testimony at the mouth of two or three witnesses. There must be that at our assembly disciplinary meetings. Is the thing so? Paul says, deliver him, "being such" (@1 Corinthians 5:5); the witnesses prove the matter is so.
L.E.S. The recovery of the ministry meeting is of great importance!
J.T. God is blessing that meeting. Were you to inquire of the man the apostle alludes to as coming into the assembly, asking what happened, he might say, It was the power of the word as ministered. I was convicted and fell down. I was in the Jewish synagogue, but there was nothing said like what I heard in the
{233}
christian assembly. The whole meeting is affected, for the person is convicted of all, judged of all (@1 Corinthians 14:24,25).
D.R. In a case of discipline, what is the value of a confession at the assembly meeting?
J.T. If the person in question seems genuine in his repentance, he should be forgiven.
D.R. What would you do about the withdrawal?
J.T. Normally the brethren are sensitive as to good *and* evil; they would be able to discern whether the confession is real. If a man is repentant, he has executed judgment on himself The assembly should be able to take care of such a case. The person whom Paul mentions would be qualified for fellowship; he worships God.
J.D. If a person had not heeded the brothers who have visited him, and they find sufficient ground for bringing the matter before the brethren and finally for having an assembly meeting, but at that meeting the person breaks down, would he be cleared at that moment, or would the judgment of withdrawing go on? Would it be too late for such an one to change his mind?
J.T. It would not be too late. If a person is really convicted, "he is convicted of all". A sensitive brother discerns that he is truly repentant. If he falls down and worships God, God has accepted that worship, and are you going to ignore it?
J.D. Should a rebuke be administered or is genuine confession enough?
J.T. For general effect, especially in view of young people, something might be said. Of course, the circumstances must always be weighed, and these might require delay in formal restoration. What underlies the matter is the work of God, and God values His own work. The cleansing of the leper would help. The priest sees that the sore is healed, but much detail happens after that until the man is anointed. The trespass offering is presented and slaughtered, and
{234}
the priest puts the blood on the man. When the priest anoints him, the sin-offering, the burnt-offering and the meat-offering are offered, and the man is set up again in the testimony.
L.E.S. David, until the child dies, retained an unmistakable attitude of sorrow (@2 Samuel 12:16-18).
J.T. Yes; but when the child had died he arose, and washed and anointed himself and worshipped. Nathan said, "The Lord also hath put away thy sin". David, however, goes through a great deal after that. The removal of his sin by Jehovah was immediate after his confession, but he did not enter into the house of God to worship until he had gone through the experience described in verses 15 to 20. It is a question of what God does. Of course, we are dealing with this subject in the abstract. Alas, we do not get much of immediate self-judgment in cases of discipline. The records of David's restoration are particularly instructive.
The point in the second chapter of Job is that Satan is defeated, and we do not find him directly referred to in the book afterwards.
J.D. "And Job rose up, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped". Do you think God received that from him?
J.T. I am sure He did. He has not come to the forty-second chapter yet, but still his attitude is mentioned approvingly. Satan also would see that expression of response to God. He fell down on the ground and worshipped. God accepts what is genuinely given. God is worshipped and Satan is defeated, although it is a long time before Job reaches God's end, as seen in the latter part of the book.
J.D. "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither". That is a beautiful note amid all the pressure and sorrow. Would you link that with what has been said as to genuine repentance in persons under discipline?
{235}
J.T. For the moment there is enough to testify to the work of God in the man, and Satan is defeated. The devil is watching, and as defeated he will try another way. Job's wife said to him, "Dost thou still remain firm in thine integrity? curse God and die". Another member of the family comes out now. Look at what she suggests! Job does not rail on her, however. A wife might be like that, utterly out of accord with a godly husband. Job says to her, "We have also received good from God, and should we not receive evil?" He reasons with her, You have had part in the good we have received; God has been good to us. Job appeals to her; he was not overcome by his wife. Adam was overcome by his wife, but Job was not. "In all this Job did not sin with his lips". Thus the work of God in Job so far triumphed.
{236}
THE SECOND ESTABLISHED (2)
@Job 2:11-13; @Job 3:1; @Job 32:1-22; @Job 33:23-33
J.T. The limitations imposed on Satan, as seen in chapters 1 and 2, are to be noted for our encouragement. He can only move against God's people as God allows it. That he does seek to move against us, and move even God against us, is very solemn. God says to him, (chapter 2:3), "Though thou movedst me against him, to swallow him up without cause". In allowing Satan to do all this, God says to him, "Behold, he is in thy hand: only spare his life. And Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah; and he smote Job with a grievous botch from the sole of his foot unto his crown" (verse 7). It is an external effect that is produced. Although God does allow Satan to touch Job, He limits him. God keeps Satan to the external side -- our bodies, so that life is spared for God to work out something in us. God has in mind to work out a state of priesthood. This is seen as we go through all that this book presents. The christian state, as we reach the end of the Lord, is seen in the presenting of our bodies as a living sacrifice (@Romans 12:1). Thus the triumph of God in His own work is seen.
Job's wife says, "Dost thou still remain firm in thine integrity?" God had said that he remained firm. "Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil?". He remained firm in his integrity. God said so to Satan, who now has an agent in Job's wife to urge him *not* to remain firm in his integrity. She says in verse 9, "Curse God and die". The work of God is thus tested in a very insidious way here, and Job's answer is one of consistent fidelity. "We have also received good from God, and should we not receive evil?". He, so far retains and manifests a certain priestly condition. A
{237}
priest's lips keep knowledge; there is no such knowledge in cursing God. Satan is defeated, and Job's wife having taken sides with Satan is defeated.
Now we have the seven days¬ trial occasioned by the three friends. "They came each one from his place". There is no evidence that they came from God, or that they asked God about Job; each came from *his place*. Each came in the importance of what he was in his place, and they came in the attitude of friendship with Job. The seven days of silence bring out the state he was in under these circumstances -- he cursed his day. He interfered, so far as he could, in the arrangement of God in the days. This opens the whole controversy between himself and the three friends, running on to chapter 31. These chapters remind us of the state of christendom. There are many good things said, yet generally a wrong spirit and application in saying them. The Spirit of God is not dominant. Job too is remiss in what he says. Some of the sayings, however, are quoted in the New Testament as just in themselves (chapter 5:13 and @1 Corinthians 3:19; chapter 5:17, and @Hebrews 12:5).
W.F.K. These three friends, as you said, represent something of christendom in speaking right words.
J.T. Yes. There is an exposure of them in the book. What a medley of thoughts there is! Much real matter, intended to bring God in, and yet the Spirit of God has no direct part in it. The premises of Job's three friends are wrong, although many things said are quite true in themselves. Job, on the other hand, being a subject of the work of God, had light and speaks touchingly of God at times, affording much that by the aid of the Spirit, helps the believer, and it also can be used in ministry.
The discourses of the friends of Job indicate that some place was given to God in their minds. Each *came from his place*. Eliphaz would have reputation in *his* place. Even as I have *seen*, he says (chapter 4:8). He
{238}
speaks of his *experience*, how it gave him a right to speak to Job as he does. Then Bildad, the Shuhite says, "inquire, I pray thee, of the former generation" (chapter 8:8). The point with him is *tradition*. And Zophar, the Naamathite, comes with what he knew and what can be known scientifically. "Oh that God would ... shew thee the secrets of wisdom, how that they are the double of what is realised", he says. So these three features come out: -- what speaks of experience, what speaks of tradition dating back to the fathers (the Lord alludes to the traditions of the elders used against the truth), this is very powerful with men; and then knowledge that is current through investigation, including religious belief, of which the present day is full. There has never been such a day as the present for investigation. All these are brought to bear upon this man Job in whom God is interested. He speaks wrong things, too, but the work of God always rings true. There is always something definite from a man God is working with. Others may trust in experience or tradition or in discoveries, but there is no definite end reached. In fact, God says of Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar, "Ye have not spoken rightly of me, like my servant Job" (@Job 42:7). The man whom God is working with has the most to say here; he says more than two thirds of what is said, but finally, "The words of Job are ended" (@Job 31:40). Elihu has definitely something to say, and he knows he is right: he is *authoritative*. God provides authoritative teaching for His people.
L.E.S. The three friends merely bring in human thoughts.
J.T. They misunderstand Job's case, being ignorant of the government of God in a world of evil; a government which in no way ignores sin, but would discipline the righteous for their good, sometimes delaying the punishment of evil, so that the divine end in the righteous should not be hindered. Thus Job's enemies remained
{239}
unpunished while the righteous man suffers. Job's so-called friends did not know God or His ways; or that God has a family here, the object of His love, and that even Satan is allowed to attack the members of it so that through discipline they should be perfected for Himself. The speeches of the *friends*, therefore, entirely miss the mark. While containing many true things there is no spiritual co-ordination in them, nor any moral authority.
J.D. The seven days have a result: "After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day". I was thinking of @Romans 7:25, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law". Here there would be some experience of the latter. The feelings of the flesh burst through, and he curses his day.
J.T. Quite so. This was due clearly to the presence, in such distressing circumstances, of the three friends. Real friendship should encourage a man, not influence him to curse his day. The Lord said to His own, "Ye are my friends" (@John 15:14). True friendship is a very precious relation. John says, "Greet the friends by name" (@3 John 14). The influence of three friends ought to be some encouragement. If I go to see a brother or sister and cannot encourage them, my visit has been a failure. It is not only what you say, but what you *are* as with the person you visit. "Ye who are spiritual" (@Galatians 6:1) indicates what is needed in our intercourse with the brethren.
J.D. The presence of such would be *felt*, for those that are spiritual have the thoughts of God.
J.T. Yes. The presence of Job's friends had a different effect. The silence of the seven days is extraordinary, resulting in a man cursing his day, who perhaps had never done such a thing before. If I go to see a brother or sister needing help, is there good feeling as a result, or are things worse? One may say, after coming back from seeing a brother, I did not
{240}
find anything of God. Well, did you *promote* anything? There *was* something of God in Job, but what comes out at this point is the contrary.
T.K. In coming to condole and comfort, you approach with grace.
J.T. Yes. The influence of a spiritual man effects good. God cannot link Himself with what the three friends say to Job. He charges them with saying wrong things -- "ye have not spoken rightly of me, like my servant Job".
This long silence was no good at all. At the Friends¬ meetings, I understand, they sometimes sit all through and say nothing. There is nothing for God in that. The Scriptures show that the service of God in the assembly is marked by oral participation. @Hebrews 2:12 quotes the Lord Himself as saying: "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises". The early christians ''were continually in the temple praising and blessing God". The young man whom the Lord restored to life at Nain "sat up and began to speak" (@Luke 7:15). According to the truth set out in Luke, he would be a *priest*, the priest's *lips* are stressed (@Malachi 2:7).
L.E.S. The counsel of Hushai, David's friend, defeated the counsel of Ahithophel (@2 Samuel 17:7-14).
J.T. As David's *friend*, I am sure David counted on him to speak, not to sit in silence.
J.D. Long silence in the presence of the anguish of a brother or sister who is under the discipline of God does not effect relief. True friendship directs the sufferer to God, and to what He is doing, enabling him to overcome in the matter practically.
J.T. Quite so. In @Luke 10 the Samaritan is a good example of this; he had the things necessary to revive the man; he brought them with him. The facts are not presented as though he expected to meet the poor, half-dead man, but nevertheless he had the needed things with him. A word in season, how good it is! So @James 5:14 says, "Is any sick among you? let him call
{241}
to him the elders of the assembly". They are expected to bring with them what is needed. He says further, "let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord". They must have the *oil* with them, and the things necessary to revive such a man. The assembly is the real place to come from in order to help a man like this, but Job's three friends each came from his own place; great men in their places no doubt, but why do they have to sit in silence? Priests¬ lips keep knowledge, and, in a spiritual man, there is always something in the way of comfort, which promotes good feeling and self-judgment.
L.E.S. Elihu, in a sense, brings in the liberty of sonship. In him also we come back to the link with Abraham. "Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite".
J.T. Yes. @Genesis 22 touches on the assembly typically in the mention of Rebecca, and that is perhaps the key to what this man is. Our times are marked by young men. In counting up those whom God is using, in all parts of the world, one is encouraged by the number of young men that are coming forward. Elihu, a young man, is not mentioned at the beginning, but he comes in here. "Then was kindled the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job was his anger kindled, because he justified himself rather than God; and against his three friends was his anger kindled, because they found no answer, and yet condemned Job. But Elihu had waited till Job had finished speaking, because they were older than he. And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger was kindled". The Spirit of God does not tell us of this young man before, but he must have been there all the time. He was saying nothing, but having a judgment of all that was said. One has often said one has a judgment of every brother one has to do with; knowing what he is, and of what value he is amongst his brethren. This young man is mentioned at this
{242}
juncture, and the time arrives when he has liberty to speak. The elders speak and he says, as it were, I will wait.
L.E.S. Would you say a word as to what his name sets forth.
J.T. It is governed by the word *He* as a designation of God; a divine title, as if there is no other person. It is used in this sense several times throughout Scripture (see note on @Deuteronomy 32:39, New Translation). This young man is not overpowered by great men. Young people are apt to be hero worshippers. True servants of God are honoured in heaven, but we must not go beyond heaven in our judgment of them. Elihu, young and timid, as we are told in verse 6, had right feelings and thoughts; he was "full of matter" and spoke to "find relief". He awaited his opportunity and then spoke. Young men serving, and one thanks God for them, need to have *God* before them. Elihu signifies, as remarked, *God is He*. I am not *He*; God is He. No true servant will make himself the object, or seek to have people occupied with him. Throughout time and eternity, God is to be *all in all*.
J.D. In visiting a brother or sister under the discipline of God from whatever cause, one should carry the elements of recovery. Eliphaz the Temanite says to Job, "Remember, I pray thee, who that was innocent has perished? and where were the upright cut off?" (@Job 4:7). Not much encouragement there! The mind of heaven is reflected in those of the assembly who seek to recover others (@Galatians 6:1).
J.T. That touches what the Lord brings in in @John 20:23, "whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". The Lord can *trust* the disciples. They are more ready to remit than retain. He mentions the remitting *first*. There may be some fault, but as thoroughly judged before God, there is no need to
{243}
make it public. You have the confidential instruction in @John 20, and the official in @Matthew 18. @Matthew 18 specifies procedure leading to a final result; @John 20 leaves all with the disciples. He trusts them to make sure that forgiveness was warranted.
Listen to what Eliphaz says, "Hath not thy piety been thy confidence, and the perfection of thy ways thy hope? Remember, I pray thee, who that was innocent has perished? and where were the upright cut off?" Job might ask him, What about Abel? God may allow adverse things to happen to the righteous. He should have known that some men die as martyrs for the truth. Then in verse 18 of chapter 4, he says, "Lo, he trusteth not his servants, and his angels he chargeth with folly". Well, this did not apply to all. God does trust His servants; normally a servant must be trustworthy; the apostles were, as we have noted in @John 20. The same is true of angels, although some He charged with folly. Job inquires later, "How hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?" (chapter 26:3). In chapter 4:12, Eliphaz says, "Now to me a word was secretly brought, and mine ear received a whisper thereof. In thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men: -- Fear came on me, and trembling, and made all my bones to shake; and a spirit passed before my face -- the hair of my flesh stood up -- it stood still; I could not discern the appearance thereof; a form was before mine eyes; I heard a slight murmur and a voice; Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be purer than his Maker?". He is relating *experience* which is his strong point -- his authority for speaking. Here it is a *vision*; it was a secret matter. He takes the ground of having a revelation -- he speaks as an oracle. He quotes himself as witness. What he heard was, "Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be purer than his Maker?". What does it indicate? "If any one thinks himself to be spiritual". Eliphaz is trying to make out
{244}
that he is spiritual, but what he presents as a revelation is what was, no doubt, generally accepted.
J.D. If a brother gets out of line, there should be power through the Holy Spirit to convict him.
J.T. Take what is called the Oxford Group. They meet together to confess to one another. Scripture makes clear that repentance is toward God (@Acts 20:21), and there is no need to meet in groups to repent toward God. It is right to confess our sins to one another as christians, but the first movement is to be toward God, and "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (@1 John 1:9). God alone can do it. No *group* can take the place of God and effect this. The assembly, or the apostles, had authority to remit sins, but this, according to the teaching of Scripture, would be delegated authority for governmental purposes here on earth, not plenary forgiveness, which is God's immediate and sole prerogative. True governmental remission is by the spirit of Christ in the assembly, and Scripture does not say the sins of certain ones *shall be* remitted, but that they *are* remitted.
L.E.S. The service of such an one as Elihu brings true repentance to light.
J.T. Yes; the three friends effected nothing. We have not time to go into all that they said. Elihu disposes of them quickly. They were unable to confute Job; God did not help them -- "that ye may not say, We have found out wisdom; God will make him yield, not man". Then Elihu proceeds to unfold the truth leading to Job's deliverance. The completion of this great service belongs to God; it is seen in chapters 38 to the end.
W.J.T. The three friends are still alive in their lines of argument.
J.T. They are. They represent people with a certain respect for God. His name is brought into what they say; each has his particular setting: "they
{245}
came each one from his place"; for example, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Baptist -- each with his own point of view. They do not effect anything, however. Job is not helped by them at all, for they are not taught of God.
S.J. In Elihu there is room for what is spiritual.
J.T. He represents one having the spirit of Christ. He was a young man; patient, observant, discerning and respectful, waiting until his elders had finished speaking. He knew God, and was taught of Him. He represents a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master (@2 Timothy 2:21). Job throughout represents the work of God: the end being to deliver him from himself, from sin, and correspondingly to constitute him a *priest*.
Ques. May we regard Elihu as a model for young men now?
J.T. Well, that is the idea. The proportion of youth amongst the saints may indicate that God has in mind to continue the testimony, for He has those through whom He can do this. The Lord may take away the elder brethren, or they may fail Him, but He continues with the younger ones as they are equal to the service. These three men failed, but God had Elihu ready and He uses him; no one could despise his youth.
W.F.K. "The words of Job are ended", before Elihu speaks.
J.T. Yes. He sets himself to finish -- a good sign so far; but alas! Job ended his words in justifying himself, in sounding his own praises. Elihu now has his opportunity. "And these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes". They would consider him hopeless; but this was not Elihu's judgment.
L.E.S. Elihu says, "There is a spirit which is in man; and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding".
{246}
J.T. That would allude to *fresh energy* in a young man, as over against mere experience in older ones. It directs the mind back to the second of Genesis, where God is said to have breathed into Adam. That is what made Adam different to the other creatures. The christian is different from others, because of being indwelt by the Holy Spirit. It comes out in @Acts 2:1-4 where God, as we may say, breathed at Pentecost; three thousand were converted at the first preaching in the power of that. "And when the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing, they were all together in one place. And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth". The word ' blowing ' is said to be ' as of hard breathing ' (see note in New Translation). Then follows Peter's great announcement of the glad tidings -- "by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven".
Those who professed to help Job failed. Elihu who had a history with God, comes forward. There is nothing said of him until he comes into service, showing that when God's time comes for a young man to serve, God will give him opportunities, far more than he can use.
S.J. Although Elihu is not heard of before, he is filled with substance now.
J.T. Yes; he says, "I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new flasks, it is ready to burst. I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips and answer".
In the book of Job we have a foreshadowing of conditions in christendom, with its medley of views, but wanting as to the truth; and necessarily having
{247}
no spiritual co-ordination. This appeared, too, during the time of the Lord's ministry, especially in what men were saying about *Him* (@Matthew 16:13,14). In the midst of this there were the subjects of the work of God, especially the disciples; the Lord went on with them. So today, there are those in whom God has wrought, and the Spirit is working in and with them, in order that they should be perfected. Job represents the work of God; the work goes on in him, through ministry and discipline, so that the divine end should be reached. The services of the three friends utterly failed, and Elihu makes a fresh start.
J.D. Of the three friends, Scripture tells us where they came from, but of Elihu it says, he was "the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram".
J.T. In @Genesis 22 you get the lineal connections of Rebecca. "Bethuel begot Rebecca"; this brings out typically the assembly's qualification to be the bride of Christ. In Elihu's ministry there is a link morally with the assembly, which is marked by freshness, as youth is, as we have seen. Job's fair daughters, as of the second family, are, in this respect, to be kept in view. The fresh start, over a hundred years ago, in the testimony in which we have part, bears the same marks. It began with a young man, whose ministry exposed and set aside *morally* the leaders of christendom at that time. God Himself has followed up the movement and it is now going on to completion.
L.E.S. In the address to Laodicea, the Lord says, "*I* rebuke and discipline as many as I love; be zealous therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking; if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me" (@Revelation 3:19,20). The words of Elihu, as to Job's friends, would be on that line.
J.T. Yes. Earlier in that address, the Lord speaks of Himself as "the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God" (@Revelation 3:14). Elihu,
{248}
in a way, is like that; a fresh start had been made in him. The address to Philadelphia shows that what had begun afresh would go on to the end; the promises to this assembly involve the completion of the whole body, and its translation to heaven. Christ is "the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God".
T.K. Elihu says, "Behold, before God I am as thou; I also am formed out of the clay" (@Job 33:6); and Paul says, "Brethren, if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest *thou* also be tempted" (@Galatians 6:1).
J.T. Elihu was formed out of the clay as Adam was. A certain set of circumstances surrounded the making of man. God had created everything and it was good. In @Genesis 2 we are told that there was no rain on the earth, but a mist went up from the earth and watered the ground. It appears thus that, in view of our understanding the formation of man, God would call our attention to the Spirit. Adam, we may say, was formed out of the *moist* dust; typically, the Holy Spirit had to do with it. God breathed into man and he became a living soul by the breath of God. Adam was thus representative of God. Elihu stands in God's stead; he was the kind of man to be trusted. In seeking to help people, as Elihu was seeking to help Job, we must identify ourselves with them as far as possible.
J.D. The anger of Elihu here would be justified. "Then was kindled the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job was his anger kindled, because he justified himself rather than God; and against his three friends was his anger kindled, because they found no answer and yet condemned Job".
J.T. Elihu clearly is right. There are always people that condemn, and yet *find no answer* to the one they condemn, but why not get to God and obtain the
{249}
truth? Elihu waited until Job had finished speaking and discerned that no answer was given by the three friends; evidently he heard all that was said. He is conscious that he cannot interfere so he waits the opportunity that God gives, and he is ready when the time arrives; what he says cannot be challenged. The idea is that God is beginning over again. You want to be with that. The thing that is needed in such cases is authoritative speaking. You cannot set aside what is said as from God, what is in the power of the Spirit. Peter says, "Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my words" (@Acts 2:14). He was there from God and they had to attend to what he said.
L.E.S. "My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart, and my lips shall utter knowledge purely. The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life" (@Job 33:3,4).
J.T. Such statements put down by the Spirit of God show what moral qualifications Elihu had, and hence the weight and freshness of his ministry.
J.D. We do not need to offer apologies in saying a word which we are assured is from God.
J.T. We need not fear in speaking the truth. We see that here -- a man who speaks the truth when the Holy Spirit moves him. He knew what to say and he *said* it.
J.D. Did it not come out in J.N.D. beginning with his ministry about 1830? There was authority with what he spoke, and he was fearless. We are reaping the benefits of that today.
J.T. An unspiritual man might say to Elihu, You had better refrain; these are influential men and you may not be equal to their rejoinders. But already the three friends are speechless, also Job. God takes up the matter after Elihu and finishes it. It is most encouraging to those who are in service to be assured that God follows up what is done.
{250}
Rem. Unless there is authority in speaking it will not bring about recovery.
J.T. Authority affects a man, making him feel that there is something in what is said. Throughout the book of the Acts there is a spirit of control. "And they persevered in the teaching ... of the apostles" (@Acts 2:42). The apostles displaced those who sat in Moses¬ seat. The twelve apostles spoke with authority.
J.D. "But there is a spirit which is in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding". Elihu thus speaks of God, and appeals to what God produces and promotes in man.
J.T. I believe that is the key to what he is saying. From the Pope down, all the great men in christendom, from the human standpoint, however well-informed they may be, are included in that word by Elihu; "It is not the great that are wise; neither do the aged understand judgment. Therefore I say, Hearken to me; I also will shew what I know. Lo, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasonings, until ye searched out what to say. Yea, I gave you mine attention, and behold, there was none of you that confuted Job, that answered his words". They are ruled out. It is a great matter to have them silenced. A young christian cannot learn from such as Job's friends without being beclouded as to the truth of God.
J.D. This would teach us the value of the saints who recognise the assembly. The young people should endeavour to get to all the meetings available to them.
J.T. Yes. "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" (@1 Corinthians 3:16). In the great literary movement about one hundred years ago, the Essays and Reviews, and such tracts, were intended by Satan to nullify the work of God which had begun somewhat earlier, and in which we now have part. God helped Mr. Darby to refute this effort, The ' Bull of Infallibility ' from Rome followed on this, clearly to offset the increasing
{251}
evidence of the power of the truth as to the presence of the Holy Spirit. Rome's lie was also exposed. Along with the Essays and Reviews, the Bull of Infallibility remains in the darkness which is native to both, and the authors of both morally silenced; the truth of God stands and is increasingly clearer to those who love it. Elihu says, "Yea, I gave you mine attention, and behold, there was none of you that confuted Job, that answered his words". Job, who represents those in whom God is working, is in trouble and nobody is able to help him. The creed cannot help, neither can the clergy. Something has to be done. This young man Elihu is in reserve all the time; he speaks, and they are silenced. There is no real meeting of the needs which arise in the subjects of the work of God by the silence of the religious leaders. The truth has to be stated. God has His men to say what is needed. Elihu -- ' God is He ' -- represents these. He says, "They were amazed, they answered no more; words failed them. And I waited, for they spoke not, but stood still, and answered no more". The way is cleared for the word of the true servant. He says, "I will answer, I also in my turn, I also will shew what I know; for I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new flasks, it is ready to burst". This is to be compared with what the Lord says about the new wine (@Matthew 9:17). Elihu goes on, "I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips and answer. Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person; neither will I give flattery to man. For I know not how to flatter; my Maker would soon take me away". Christendom speaks flattery, with its *Right Reverend So and So*, and *Lord Bishop So and So*. Elihu says in effect that if he followed this example in using such adulatory titles, his Maker would soon take him away. The Lord says to Peter and Andrew, "I will make you fishers of
{252}
men" -- not lords of men. Peter himself says, "Not as lording it over your possessions, but being models for the flock" (@1 Peter 5:3).
J.C. The Lord says, "Many shall come in my name, saying, *I* am the Christ" (@Matthew 24:5).
J.T. Well, that points to the end, the thing is named -- it is antichrist. "If another come in his own name, him ye will receive" (@John 5:43). That is antichrist. The point for us is to understand what Elihu represents to us; that is, those whom God has provided for His service in the circumstances contemplated in the scriptures before us; those who are qualified to represent Him; through them we get the truth, and a ministry of Christ, and we are on sure ground.
D.R. "For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of wise discretion." (@2 Timothy 1:7).
J.T. Paul says earlier, "Calling to mind the unfeigned faith which has been in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in thee also" (@2 Timothy 1:5). This passage assures us that God provides ahead to meet the needs of His people.
L.E.S. All this shows the need of being together and taking advantage of every opportunity. We should avail ourselves of every meeting and seek to be there. Even where there are three or four meetings in a town, you would, if possible, avail yourself of all.
J.T. You feel how many opportunities are missed to our loss. I do not think you would find Elihu passing by any available meeting. It would take considerable time listening to all Job and the three friends said. Elihu listened to all. He was a competent witness of the whole matter, and thus knew what to say as God gave him opportunity to speak. This indicates the importance of those active in the service becoming acquainted with the history of the testimony.
{253}
L.E.S. In order to be concerned about the work of God in the whole town, I must avail myself of every opportunity to observe that work.
J.T. In @1 Corinthians 14 the whole assembly is together in one place. I should want to be there, to hear the prophets; also to observe how God is carrying on. Normally every such meeting affords some new feature. A man may come in and fall down saying, "God is indeed amongst you" (verse 25). What a disadvantage to miss such an occasion!
J.D. Elihu has a thorough knowledge of each of these four men. It must have been a painful time, especially as he was so full of matter.
J.T. Clearly he had entire control of himself. He might have spoken earlier, but he was under restraint. "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law" (@Romans 7:25). One has control of oneself. One of the fruits of the Spirit is self-control (@Galatians 5:23). Young people are apt to be hasty -- "There is ... a time to speak" (@Ecclesiastes 3:7). God gives you that time as you wait for it.
In chapter 33, which we have already touched on, Elihu is dealing directly with Job; he says, "My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart, and my lips shall utter knowledge purely. The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. If thou canst, answer me; array thy words before me: take thy stand. Behold, before God I am as thou; I also am formed out of the clay. Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, nor my burden be heavy upon thee. Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words: I am clean without transgression; I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me; Lo, he findeth occasions of hostility against me, he counteth me for his enemy; he putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. Behold, I will answer thee in this, thou art not right; for God is greater than man. Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. For
{254}
God speaketh once, and twice, -- and man perceiveth it not -- in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; then he openeth men's ears, and sealeth their instruction, that he may withdraw man from his work, and hide pride from man. He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the sword. He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and with constant strife in his bones; and his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food; his flesh is consumed away from view, and his bones that were not seen stick out; and his soul draweth near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers. If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his duty"; (' duty ' means uprightness; that is, a man judging himself) "then he will be gracious unto him, and say, Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be fresher than in childhood; he shall return to the days of his youth. He shall pray unto God, and he will receive him with favour; and he shall see his face with shoutings, and he will render unto man his righteousness. He will sing before men, and say, I have sinned, and perverted what was right, and it hath not been requited to me; he hath delivered my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall see the light. Lo, all these things worketh God twice, thrice, with man, to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living" (verses 3-30).
In these wonderful words we have ministry from God. The exercised soul is convicted as brought face to face with Him. It is in one made by the Spirit of God, and to whom the breath of the Almighty has given life. The erring believer is shown that he is not right. "Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters". Man is chastened, and as he judges himself, God will deliver him from going down to the pit, having found a ransom.
{255}
Then the believer's flesh shall be fresher than in childhood. He shall pray unto God, and He will receive him with favour; and he shall see His face with shoutings. This is all the blessed result of the reception of the gospel, which sets a man up in righteousness before God and before men.
It is to be noted that Elihu speaks of what God *is doing*, not simply what will be done; this is encouraging. In Abraham's time God was not limited to him, for in addition, He had Melchisedec, Job, Elihu, and others. God is working in humanity all the time, and those mentioned witness to this.
What we are considering is most instructive and heartening at the present time. After much darkness and uncertainty in what professes to be His service, God has brought in a clear testimony in the gospel and in the truth generally; and with a measure of authority and freshness; all making for the sure divine end, the establishment of the *second*: the family of God, which is to abide for ever.
{256}
THE SECOND ESTABLISHED (3)
@Job 37:1-24
J.T. In the perusal of the book of Job it is in mind, as already said, to see how God "takes away the first that he may establish the second". Job's first family is taken away and the second established. There is also the angelic background to what God had in mind; this is seen on the day in which the sons of God appeared before Jehovah; they are the angels, who were created before man and before the earth; for in chapter 38 they are seen shouting for joy as earth's foundations were laid. Priesthood, too, is to be noted. Job had served as a priest, but only in relation to his own family; God intended to make him a priest to those who had persecuted him, that he should intercede for them as he does in the end of the book. The appearance of the sons of God is definitely after Satan fell, but he comes amongst them; he is not bound in the abyss, but at liberty to go through the earth, and he challenges Jehovah as to Job. God encounters Satan, and selects His own battle-ground which was in the heart of Job; the heart of a man in whom He was already working. Satan makes certain remarks and God allows him latitude to touch Job in a very serious manner, yet Job held to his integrity; he will not curse God. The second day in which the sons of God come up, Satan again appears, and God brings up the subject which had been selected for the battle, and Satan is again defeated. Job sinned not with his lips; he remained firm in his integrity. At the end of chapter 2, Job's three friends appear. They sit for seven days without saying a word; at the close of these days Job curses his day. Through a long series of discourses in which the three friends take part, and Job takes his part, there is no good result, for the three friends were of no help to Job.
{257}
It is in mind to look into Elihu's service, who comes forward next, before proceeding to the direct service of Jehovah. Elihu's name signifies *God is He*; as if that would mark the service of this young brother. He made more of God than he did of himself; the other three were no friends of Job really. "And they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights; and none spoke a word to him; for they saw that his anguish was very great. After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day" (@Job 2:13 and 3:1). They failed to do what Elihu does, and their counsel comes to nought. They were unable to confute Job. Elihu's ministry brings in God. This book contains much for ourselves, especially in view of the conditions since the Reformation, as men, breaking away from Rome, obtained latitude to serve God according to their own way. Much that is good has transpired since the Reformation, but there is no certainty or spiritual co-ordination in the public ministry. Independency marks it. It fails of true spiritual authority, which is according to God. There is authority, but of a partisan kind, similar to that enforced through Rome; not such as Christ and His apostles taught. With Elihu we find discernment, and his ministry is morally authoritative; the saints should see this. There is no question raised in the book against what Elihu says; he is not questioned. That is what we need -- authoritative ministry which issues from the temple of God where *God is He*. God speaks in His temple. I think we shall see that there is progress in chapters 32 to 37.
J.D. You referred to the fact that each of the three friends came from his own place. Elihu here speaks in God's stead. Would each coming from his own place answer to the seminaries of today, the different seats of learning, but the man that really helps Job is the one that comes from God?
J.T. Each coming from his place would mean that each came from his local situation. Each denomination
{258}
has a different outlook, its own viewpoint, and no proof is brought forward that it is from God. Eliphaz may claim to have special light, but he brings no witness, and what he says does not prove that he has any position of authority. It was a position of some kind, but it was irregular; nothing accredited from God. He speaks of experience, but that in itself cannot command the enlightened conscience. Like all the cults; they all claim something to start from, but give no accredited evidence. The apostles made a great deal of evidence: "It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection" (@Acts 1:21,22). That is christianity. An apostle is a man sent from God; indeed, sent from being with God. John the baptist was a man sent from God. So Elihu is in God's stead. Job wanted a daysman, one like unto God and like unto him. Elihu says to Job, I am in God's stead. That indicates a position in ministry that is authoritative.
J.D. The definite voice of the Spirit of the assemblies during the last hundred years should be enough for those seeking help. We should listen, as Job does to Elihu, to one who really speaks on God's behalf; that is, the Spirit speaking to the assemblies.
J.T. That is the wise way. Look for the ministry of the Spirit. Paul says to Timothy, "Have an outline of sound words, which words thou hast heard of me" (@2 Timothy 1:13). Follow up Paul's ministry. The epistles to Timothy and Titus lead one to have courage in serving. Paul makes his own ministry the test; "the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also" (@2 Timothy 2:2). "In the presence of many witnesses" -- witness is made a great deal of in connection with what is authoritative.
{259}
What is said authoritatively is tested by what is written in the Scriptures. The leaders of the Reformation did not settle the matter of canonicity -- it was settled long before by spiritual men. Luther rejected the book of James, while the Roman Catholic Church canonised the Apocrypha. Generally, however, the Reformation stressed the authority of Scripture. As to the Scriptures, a brother may say of any of the books, it is in the Bible, and therefore is inspired, but is it inspired? It is for us to find out. The spiritual discerns all things. No *true* christian living today would for a moment question the authority of what is called the Bible; but is it inspired to you as you read? There is spiritual understanding and discernment and one possessing these recognises what is divinely inspired.
L.E.S. Does Elihu have authoritative teaching in mind in this verse? "Lo, God is exalted in his power; who teacheth as he?" (@Job 36:22).
J.T. Yes. The Lord Himself says, "And they shall be all taught of God" (@John 6:45). What the Holy Spirit says is authoritative, but there is a difference between spiritual ministry and the Scriptures. While the former has, as already said, an authoritative character, it is not formally and verbally inspired; it comes through men encompassed by human weakness, and hence may be verbally and otherwise inaccurate. The Scriptures are "divinely inspired", which words, taken with other scriptural statements, indicate plainly that the vessels used in the great work were held by the power of God so that no taint or imperfection of any kind entered into it. Paul, Peter, John and others speak of themselves as in a divinely abstracted condition as receiving communications from God.
W.F.K. God uses creation to expound things to Job.
J.T. That is generally so in chapters 37 to 41. What is seen in these primary speeches by Elihu is peculiarly applicable to our own times. We have the servant
{260}
bringing forward evidence of his being with God. Paul did this, and in fact all the apostles did, and God confirmed what they said; "when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness" (@Acts 4:31). "And the Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord" (@Acts 11:21). Elihu establishes himself in chapter 32, and then in chapter 33 he brings in the gospel in a beautiful way. "Behold, before God I am as thou; I also am formed out of the clay. Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, nor my burden be heavy upon thee" (@Job 33:6,7).
The period in which Job lived was clearly the patriarchal times: he was possibly contemporary with Abraham. It seems that he had certain family links with the patriarch, but none religiously. Job represents a separate work of God. It is instructive to see how far back the gospel, in a formal sense, reaches. The Scriptures preached the gospel to Abraham, we are told (@Galatians 3:8); but here is a man -- a man from God -- preaching the gospel to Job. So today, after the appearance of all these ' isms ' from which we have been delivered, we find the power of the Holy Spirit in preaching the gospel.
J.D. No one should trust the word of a man unless it is authoritative, as witnessed to by Scripture. "When therefore he was raised from among the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken" (@John 2:22). The resurrection of Christ attested the Scriptures and the word of Jesus.
J.T. Yes; and that adds to the thought already mentioned that the apostles were desirous of completing their number by one qualified to be a witness to His resurrection. The Lord speaks of "that world, and the resurrection", showing how great a place the resurrection has in the testimony. So at Athens, Paul gives
{261}
testimony of Jesus and the resurrection, "And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, and some said, We will hear thee again also concerning this" (@Acts 17:32).
The Scriptures are absolutely essential to the testimony; also the temple of God, resulting from the presence and recognition of the Spirit. The Lord greatly stressed them and their authority in contending with the Jews. The local company at Corinth would not be the temple of God in its entirety, but it had the character of the thing, for the practical working out of the assembly in its varied features, as here on earth, is in the local assemblies.
L.E.S. How would it work out in subdivisions in a city?
J.T. Any subdivision would have the character of the whole. You will note that the article is omitted, "Do ye not know that ye are temple of God", it is *characteristic*. It is co-extensive with the idea of the breaking of bread, which is "in assembly". It is a question of the character. Paul, in reference to the breaking of bread, says, "when ye come together in assembly" (@1 Corinthians 11:18). In chapter 14 we have the article attached to the word "assembly". "If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place" (@1 Corinthians 14:23). In chapter 11 it is "in assembly" -- the character of the thing. There may be twenty gatherings in a city, each coming together on that principle; but the fourteenth chapter makes provision for the whole assembly coming together -- evidently for ministry.
S.J. If Lord's day afternoon meetings are held in the central meeting room, would that suffice?
J.T. I think it would be better during the week, as giving the added support needed during the week. It is a question of "the hill of God" (@1 Samuel 10:5); the strength of God in the place; this would be apparent in the power of prophetic ministry. You mention the Lord's day afternoon, and I am afraid that some think
{262}
it a little too much to have an extra meeting through the week. There is, however, a need of sacrifice to get together as "the whole assembly" (@1 Corinthians 14:23); *the whole assembly* in one place is greater than one subdivision. God helps us in subdivisions, but in the whole assembly together, there is more power; it provides more scope for the Spirit of God.
L.E.S. We are to use our days in view of definite spiritual gain.
J.T. Yes. It requires the giving up of an extra night for the sake of spiritual gain. That is a difficulty with many.
W.J.T. What is the character of the meeting?
J.T. Well, it is based on @1 Corinthians 14, and makes room for the Spirit in authoritative, prophetic ministry. The apostle contemplates an unbeliever coming in, who, being convicted, falls down and reports that God is there.
J.C. Would the whole assembly come together every week?
J.T. Yes, the scriptural thought of weekly meetings would include it; it would imply *the whole assembly* in a city coming together for ministry; some have it every month. Besides the prophetic meeting, there is the possibility of a meeting of the whole assembly for the reading of the Scriptures. It would take on more power in such a setting, and the saints, and particularly young people, would be greatly benefited by the consciousness of the increased power.
Rem. It would work both for the increased help of the saints, and to provide more opportunity for the Spirit of God.
J.T. Yes. The whole assembly together in one place gives God more scope. There is no such thing now as the whole assembly on earth coming together, even representatively; what is contemplated in @1 Corinthians 14 is the whole local assembly coming together.
{263}
In every place where there are subdivisions of the assembly, there is a need for all to come together at stated times, so that the full idea of the assembly of God, where He speaks, should be seen. It is a great support to the young people. They see what christianity means -- the power of it, and what is in the assembly.
Rem. Coming together in one place would also be a preservative for the families of the saints.
J.T. Yes. It confirms the young people to see what is of God on the earth. Meetings such as these are a great help. They are local in their setting, but, as often including many from other parts, are suggestive of the fellowship in its general bearing; for indeed it is one; still, it is not a general assembly. Such gatherings of the saints are basically of a local character, but never independent.
Well, we must come back to Elihu. He is intended to be a lesson for us. He arrives at a judgment as listening to what passed between Job and his friends. He was evidently present throughout, although there was no hint of his being there. The truth of God had fallen to the ground between the four. Chapter 32 brings out Elihu's moral qualification to speak, and chapter 33 the testimony of God in the gospel. This is what God has in mind. These chapters have been touched on already. The succeeding chapters, to 36, while having Job in view throughout, justify God in a remarkable way. In chapter 34:1-3, we are told, "Elihu answered and said, Hear my words, ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. For the ear trieth words, as the palate tasteth food". As coming together we experience the power God gives to the spiritual ear to try words, as the palate tastes food. As our ears listen they arrive at what is right. Elihu says, "Let us choose for ourselves what is right: let us know among ourselves what is good!" (chapter 34:4). A good word for the assembly meeting for discipline!
{264}
Then he continues, "For Job hath said, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my judgment: should I lie against my right? My wound is incurable without transgression". Job is thus condemning God and justifying himself. Elihu answers, "What man is like Job? he drinketh up scorning like water, and goeth in company with workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men". Natural conscience would not thus judge a man like Job, but Elihu is in God's stead and has discerned the true character of Job's discourses -- notwithstanding his apparent piety. Job was taking upon himself to charge God with unrighteousness. Elihu is a man sent from God to tell him the truth and convict him of the errors in his words. Men of such faithfulness are rare. He is manifestly a man who seeks no prominence for himself. He would justify God, as we have said, but would at the same time deliver the sinner by convicting him. He rebukes also in saying, "Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be wickedness from God, and wrong from the Almighty! For a man's work will he render to him, and cause every one to find according to his way. Yea, surely, God acteth not wickedly, and the Almighty perverteth not judgment. Who hath entrusted to him the earth? and who hath disposed the whole world? If he only thought of himself, and gathered unto him his spirit and his breath, all flesh would expire together, and man would return to the dust" (chapter 34:10-15). What a fine statement that is! It is from a man who is himself full of the truth, and indignant that men like Job and his friends, in the presence of what was then known of God, should falsify it.
L.E.S. A man has great influence who speaks wise words such as these.
J.T. He cannot be overcome in a moral sense, although he may suffer in his body. Elihu is not said to have suffered, but it is characteristic for a faithful
{265}
witness to the truth to suffer. The Lord himself at Nazareth is a remarkable example. Stephen enquires, "Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?" (@Acts 7:52). It is solemn and searching that it is the disposition of our natural hearts to persecute those who testify to us the truth of God. In Elihu, we see also the principle of separateness, for he did not join in the discussions of Job and his friends; he kept apart, and when his opportunity came, he spoke as one by himself, representing God.
J.D. "Should he that hateth right indeed govern? and wilt thou condemn the All-just?" (chapter 34:17). Elihu challenged their right to govern. The three friends would govern Job, but Elihu would not allow it. It is unthinkable that before God one could claim the right to govern, and yet hate right.
J.T. Quite so. The Corinthians would go before unbelievers in settling matters between themselves. Normally the saints are right and should govern; they are yet to judge angels and the world. What a thought! Thus the apostle says, "Set those to judge who are little esteemed in the assembly" (@1 Corinthians 6:4). That is what is in mind here. "Should he that hateth right indeed govern? and wilt thou condemn the All-just? Shall one say to a king, Belial? to nobles, Wicked? How then to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich man more than the poor? for they are all the work of his hands. In a moment they die, even at midnight the people are convulsed and pass away; and the strong are taken away without hand. For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his steps" (@Job 34:17-21). We have not time to go into all the detail, but all will see the importance of this chapter. The moral conclusion is that no one can assume to judge God, and yet men do it. People pass judgment on anything, and they do not hesitate to judge God. The apostle asks, "Thou, O
{266}
man, who art *thou* that answerest again to God?" (@Romans 9:20).
W.F.K. It is better to be like the Bereans and search the Scriptures to see if these things are so.
J.T. Yes it is. We see that Elihu's ministry is progressive until we come to chapter 37. Job had said, My righteousness is more than God's" (chapter 35:2). Elihu says, "I will reply to thee in words, and to thy companions with thee". He links Job with his friends. This points to the present time -- how evil in its varied forms has to be met. The wickedness of one may affect many, and they may cry out because of oppressions. How much of this there is! "But none saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night ...?" (verses 8-10). God Himself is above all that man can do (verse 6), and hence their transgressions are against each other (verse 8). This brings out God's independence of man. "But none saith, Where is God my Maker ...?" He is ready to help, even giving songs in the night, but He is not sought after, He "who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth". Job might say he did not see Him, yet "judgment is before him, therefore wait for him" (verse 14). God had not visited His anger on Job; yet did he not know his own arrogancy? His case was serious, indeed, for he had "opened his mouth in vanity, and made words abundant without knowledge" (verse 16).
In chapter 36, Elihu continues to justify God, while seeking to deliver Job from his self-righteousness and multiplying of words against God. Elihu says, "I will ... ascribe righteousness to my Creator. ... He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous ... he openeth their ear to discipline. ... If they hearken and serve him, they shall accomplish their days in prosperity. ... Even so would he have allured thee out of the jaws of distress into a broad place, ... and the supply of thy table would be full of fatness". Job was warned, and Elihu tells him that "God is exalted in his power";
{267}
manifestly He is great, and hence Job should submit. It is man's wisdom to do so.
Thus Elihu progresses in his ministry, and in chapter 37 enlarges on the various elements of God's power in creation; he had said that God covereth His hands with lightning and commandeth it where it is to strike. His thundering declareth concerning Him. He appeals to Job to "hear attentively the roar of his voice. ... He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven".
L.E.S. We should know how to use the creatorial works of God in view of the moral work in the souls of men.
J.T. Paul and Peter used them. Paul at Athens brings the creation into his testimony; and at Lystra he brings it in. And in @Romans 1:20 there is a remarkable statement that, "from the world's creation the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity". Thus we learn how created things are a lesson book for faith.
L.E.S. It is a living thing -- Jehovah takes up what Elihu introduces. Jehovah spoke out of the whirlwind.
J.T. Yes. He had a way opened for Him by Elihu. Elihu says God put the snow on the ground. Not simply that it falls as by the principle of gravity, but God puts it there. He says to it, "Fall on the earth!". Everyone can see it. If you are preaching the gospel you can point to it, it is there. God *does* such things so that man can understand. God is active in the eyes of Elihu. All this shows what testimony was there apart from God's taking up any special family, as in Abraham.
J.D. "He ... holdeth not back the flashes when his voice is heard" -- this reminds you of Paul on the way to Damascus.
{268}
J.T. Yes. In connection with that, the sun is brought in as a pattern, as an example of light, and God brings in a greater light -- *above* the brightness of the sun (@Acts 26:13).
W.F.K. In speaking to Job, Jehovah asks him if he has entered into the storehouses of the snow (chapter 38:22). Would there be a thought there of not only taking creation as testimony, but looking into the things of God?
J.T. Just so. God is greatly honoured by Elihu as he brings in the creation in seeking to help Job. Elihu speaks of the snow, and Jehovah challenges Job, "Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow ...?" Contemplation of these things makes way for God. In serving, one has to consider whether his ministry makes way for God. Can God come in after you to confirm what you have said?
L.E.S. One plants and another waters, but God gives the increase.
J.D. It should be a great exercise to all that serve, to see that God can come in after them.
J.T. He leads to definite results. The three friends and Job are silent, although they had been saying many good things, some of which are even quoted in the New Testament, but there was no definiteness, and many bad things were associated with the good. There was no clear shining. And this marks christendom, so that many get a bad start. What Elihu says in chapter 37 is remarkable. "For he saith to the snow, Fall on the earth! and to the pouring rain, even the pouring rains of his might". The snow alludes to a standard of purity. As to the rain, at this time the deluge would have been a known thing. Elihu might have alluded to the character of that cleansing. Peter says, "God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: which figure also now saves you" (@1 Peter 3:20,21). The deluge was judgment, but it was a cleansing
{269}
process also, and thus a saving process. The eunuch says, Behold water" (@Acts 8:36). You must have water. God provides the water for baptism. Philip did not call attention to it, but his presentation of the gospel led the eunuch to see the *necessity* for it, and so he appropriates it. Then Elihu says, "He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work". God would have man's works to stop so that *His* own work should be known. All are to know God's work.
J.D. Mr. Darby has a note to that: ' Or that all men, whom he hath made, may know (him) '. God delights in men being brought to know Him.
J.T. In the light of the gospel it would mean that man's work must cease, for salvation is by faith, not works; hence way is made for God's work to be known, and Himself known. This sealing of hands is interesting; God does it that His works and Himself should be known. The legalist or mere religious official would tie God's hands -- making His work depend on human ordination. Elihu represents a true ministry of God which He has, in our days, released from religious shackles. "And the wild beast goeth into its lair, and they remain in their dens". Every worker of the devil, as it were, goes into his den. The Lord said, "Get thee away, Satan", and the devil left Him (@Matthew 4:10).
Ques. Would the wild beasts here correspond with the apostle's statement, "I have fought with beasts in Ephesus" (@1 Corinthians 15:32)?
J.T. They would be figurative of wicked men. Paul would, no doubt, have overcome them, and so they went into their dens. The teaching of the epistles would, in general, force evil men to retire so that the work of God may go on. The history of the work of God in the book of Acts affords examples of this repelling power of God. His work must go on. The letters to Corinth would have forced some opposers into their dens. The ruling authorities, as such, sometimes help
{270}
in this way. Certain wicked systems are limited in this continent at the present time. We can attribute that to God. The servant of God would attribute it to Him.
L.E.S. We need greater courage in preaching, particularly in the open air.
J.T. If men will not come in to hear the gospel, we can go out to them in testimony. Go out with the word, "in season and out of season". I can count on God to help me all the days of the week. He will tie up the hands of wicked men, through government, so that the gospel may be preached in the open air.
A.D. Would that bring in the side of reproach?
J.T. Yes, christianity is marked by reproach -- the reproach of Christ.
L.E.S. The Lord Himself witnessed a good confession.
J.T. Exactly. He says, "Reproach hath broken my heart" (@Psalm 69:20). Elihu tells Job, "From the chamber of the south cometh the whirlwind; and cold from the winds of the north". These point to necessary discipline in the testimony. The north wind is clearly discipline, but it profits and promotes what is real and of God. No one loses by discipline, who is with God. Adverse winds blow, but as accepting it, the believer grows and the testimony goes on.
J.D. The bride in @Song of Songs 4:16 says, "Awake, north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my garden". That is how discipline would help us spiritually.
J.T. Yes. She says, "Awake, north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow forth. Let my beloved come into his garden". The Bridegroom says in answer to her, "I am come into my garden" (chapter 5:1). This chapter in Job is remarkable as showing how Elihu's ministry advances in using God's creation to convey spiritual things.
{271}
W.F.K. The Lord says, "For as the lightning goes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man" (@Matthew 24:27).
J.T. Yes, it is used as a symbol of His coming. Further, Elihu says, "By the breath of God ice is given; and the breadth of the waters is straitened". That is remarkable -- waters turned into ice by the breath of God. Waters straitened, would symbolise death. This should remind us a little of the Lord Jesus in death. It was not possible for Him to be held by its power, but He was actually in death -- in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. It was a question of God's judgment; Christ having become a sacrifice for sin. Elihu would not understand all this, but the limitation involved in death is implied in the reference to ice.
Rem. As pointing to Christ coming into death the reference is touching.
J.T. Yes. It is a very solemn thing that this should come in by the breath of God. The reference to God in this way is figurative, for God does not live by breath as we do, but the truth is brought down to our way of thinking, the breath pointing to inward power and feelings, as in @Psalm 18:15 and Isaiah 30:33. In @Psalm 18, ' blast ' in the Hebrew is the same as ' breath ' in @Job 37:10. How thoroughly God's feelings as to sin were seen in the vicarious sufferings of Christ, who was held there as the Sin-bearer, and forsaken of God! He bore the judgment of God in His death and burial.
J.D. One had always linked the breath of God with life. God "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul" (@Genesis 2:7). Here you suggest the breath of God is connected with His power and feelings.
J.T. That is clearly the position here. God entered into this with all His feelings. The Lord Jesus says, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (@Matthew 27:46). God did not answer; the limitations were there; Christ
{272}
was held there. Scripture speaks of the fire of judgment resulting from the breath of God. Isaiah speaks of this under the name Topheth; he says "the breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it" (@Isaiah 30:33). It is prepared for the king -- one having that place, corresponding with the judgment of the beast and false prophet, who alive are cast into the lake of fire. God has to do with this as He enters into judgment. It is not one God that saves us and another that judges -- it is the same God. The lake of fire is a necessity of the love of God. There must be this testimony against sinners, "Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched" (@Mark 9:44). Unrepentant sinners are *not annihilated*, but cast into the lake of fire (@Revelation 19:20; @Revelation 20:10).
J.D. The suffering of the Lord Jesus on the cross, involving the forsaking of God, and His death, all come into this thought of the ice straitened by the breath of God.
J.T. That same breath ignites the fire of judgment -- the lake of fire which is the second death. It is a most solemn thing. Judgment is a necessity of the love of God. Elihu continues from this thought and says, "Also with plentiful moisture he loadeth the thick clouds, his light dispels the cloud; and they are turned every way by his guidance, that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the circuit of the earth, whether he cause it to come as a rod, or for his land, or in mercy. Hearken unto this, Job; stand still and discern the wondrous works of God. Dost thou know how God hath disposed them, and how he causeth the lightning of his cloud to flash? Dost thou know about the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him that is perfect in knowledge? How thy garments become warm when he quieteth the earth by the south wind". In referring to the plentiful moisture with which God loadeth the clouds, Elihu leads on to the results of the resurrection
{273}
of Christ. Moisture causes fruitfulness, pointing to the Spirit, involving the resurrection and ascension of Christ. The passage continues on until we come to the south wind -- the wind of the gospel -- how warm it makes our garments. How we are warmed by the love of God and the activity of the Holy Spirit!
L.E.S. Verse 13, "Whether he cause it to come as a rod, or for his land, or in mercy". Every condition justifies the dealings of God.
J.T. I think these verses evidence the dealings of God in love. "But we *do* know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose" (@Romans 8:28). Take one who has been brought in through the gospel, how true it is that, by the Holy Spirit among the saints, his garments are made warm. Your business sphere is chilly, but as you come in among your brethren your garments grow warm. All this makes christianity -- the assembly, the essence of it here below, corresponding with Christ in heaven -- most attractive. It is essential to the gospel.
Rem. As you read @Psalm 19 you feel there is heat there.
J.T. The sun shines upon us, the north winds are adverse, the south winds favourable. All are found in @Romans 8:28, just quoted. The words in @Job 37:17 clearly speak of the effect of the Spirit's gracious services. In verse 18 we are reminded of our smallness and God's greatness. "Hast thou with him spread out the sky, firm, like a molten mirror?". How grand the environment above us! Then, "Teach us what we shall say unto him! We cannot order our words by reason of darkness. Shall it be told him if I would speak? if a man so say, surely he shall be swallowed up. And now men see not the light as it gleameth, it is hidden in the skies. But the wind passeth by and cleareth them. From the north cometh gold; with God is terrible majesty". The *gold* in verse 22 may mean
{274}
*the golden light*; the aurora borealis is in mind, no doubt. To the spiritual mind it speaks of what is of God coming through mixed circumstances; all ordered of God as His creation, involving discipline for His people, but withal, enrichment and blessing generally. A question for all is, whether there is something of God in each as he goes through discipline -- adverse winds from the north? But from the north cometh *gold*; as we go through adverse circumstances with God, gold will result.
J.F. The results of the winds vary. Gold here in Job, and spices in the Song of Songs.
J.T. In the latter, the spices result from a combination of the north and south winds. "Awake, north wind, and come, thou south" (chapter 4:16). In our chapter, gold is said to come from the north, no other action is mentioned; whereas in the Song of Songs the spices are in the garden, and are brought forth by the winds; the spices are fragrant and spiritually of great value; gold suggests durable riches.
J.D. "With God is terrible majesty." The word Elihu uses for God is Eloah, the singular of Elohim: the Supreme. It is Deity, God in contrast to the many false gods of the heathen.
J.T. In verse 14 of this chapter Elihu uses the word El for God, but in the next verse he uses the word Eloah. "Dost thou know how God hath disposed them?". The title Elohim would be the full thought of God in creation. Elihu shows intelligence in the use of divine names.
L.E.S. It is said that ' Eloah ' is mentioned forty-one times in Job.
J.T. It has a great place in the book. It is the singular, a personal touch. Elohim is the plural title. In the ministry of Elihu in our chapter, we are reminded how the truth developed in Paul. The principles and structure of the created sphere are brought in to augment the ministry, and the saints are taught by that. As in
{275}
@Ephesians 3:17-19, "being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God". That is the position following the thoughts of the creation. Elihu brings in the history of material things to convey spiritual things, and the material world should help us into the spiritual world in this way.
J.D. Would the later chapters in Job suggest thoughts similar to the ministry developed by Paul?
J.T. Yes; in a general way, the universe is contemplated, including "the ordinances of the heavens". Jehovah speaks to Job of the foundations of the earth and its corner-stone (chapter 38:4-6). Paul refers much to creation. In treating of the mystery, he speaks of God creating "all things" (@Ephesians 3:9); and in @Hebrews 3 all things are said to be built by God, and in chapter 11, the worlds framed by the word of God.
{276}
THE SECOND ESTABLISHED (4)
@Job 38:1-11; @Job 39:13-30; @Job 40:1-5
J.T. It has already been remarked that this chapter shows how God follows up His work in souls, identifying Himself with approved servants and reaching the desired end. That is, "the end of the Lord", as @James 5:11 says. Elihu's ministry was clearly of God, and now Jehovah answers Job out of the whirlwind. Job is addressed as a *man*; as if the instruction so far has been to that end, that Job should reach manhood. "Gird up now thy loins like a man; and I will demand of thee, and inform thou me". Then follows a series of questions in which God mentions thirty or more of His creatures. And Job answers according to the verses read in chapter 40: "Behold, I am nought: what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further". The remaining part of chapter forty and chapter forty-one, however, show that the work in Job was not complete. While he makes a remarkable statement in chapter forty it requires the remaining two chapters to complete the work in Job. All this shows that the end of the Lord requires that we go the *whole way* in self-judgment.
L.E.S. What do you understand by the references to behemoth?
J.T. Behemoth is introduced in chapter 40, verse 15, and in verse 19 he is spoken of as "the chief of God's ways". In the next chapter we have leviathan, suggesting a different feature of the government of God, more warlike. Behemoth is more docile. It seems as if the last beast, alluded to as leviathan, has more power. God created him for a certain purpose. "He is king over all the proud beasts" (verse 34). That would be a clue to what he represents. These two great creatures complete the instruction, so Job finally reaches, in chapter 42,
{277}
the divine end, saying "Therefore have I uttered what I did not understand: things too wonderful for me, which I knew not" (@Job 42:3).
Jehovah starts in chapter 38, and "out of the whirlwind" He challenges Job to answer "like a man". Paul says, "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child ... when I became a man, I had done with what belonged to the child" (@1 Corinthians 13:11). God addresses Job here as a man. At the outset God did not create a child, but a man.
D.R. In the beginning when God created man He saw that His work was good. "And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good" (@Genesis 1:31).
J.T. Here God looks to Job to be a man according to what a man should be. In the beginning God created man. Adam and Eve were full grown. All others were born.
F.R. The thought of God here is that man should be able to address himself to God.
J.T. He says, "Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth" (@Ecclesiastes 12:1); this would be in view of man answering to God in full manhood. It is a question of being a man. As the apostle says in @1 Corinthians 16:13, "Quit yourselves like men". They were like children, using their gifts as toys. Christianity involves manhood; the full-grown thought. "A man in Christ" (@2 Corinthians 12:2) suggests one outside the range of the flesh and all its pretensions. It is in effect complete deliverance of man according to God. "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (@Ephesians 4:13).
J.D. The ministry of Elihu has respect to that. The three friends fail to bring out manhood in Job whereas the ministry of Elihu leads him to it.
J.T. I think so; that is, by *representing* the idea before him. Manhood was there in Elihu; it came out in this
{278}
young man. John the baptist was a young man when beheaded, but what great things come out in him! The Lord Himself began His ministry, "beginning to be about thirty years old" (@Luke 3:23). His great ministry was in comparative youthfulness. He was taken away in the midst of His days. He said, "My God, take me not away in the midst of my days!" (@Psalm 102:24); having said, "He weakened my strength in the way, he shortened my days". The idea of youth has a great place in this book. God takes it up when elders fail. Elihu represents manhood, a young man, but a mature man. We get the idea stressed in the early books of the Old Testament. Joseph and Joshua are two striking examples of youth standing for God.
J.D. Paul selects Timothy as a companion in the Acts because he had spiritual features.
J.T. He had a good report from the brethren in his district. That is important! A man may make a good show in a meeting, but be very poor in the estimate of the brethren in his own town.
W.F.K. It is the young men who are the overcomers in @1 John 2.
J.T. Yes; they overcame the wicked one, but they were, in danger of the world. "Love not the world, nor the things in the world" (@1 John 2:15). If a man has a family he has to go to business to support them. He may have a grasp of the truth, but the world may get him. It is there that John contemplates the believer overcoming. We are to overcome the world, as well as the devil. "Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?" (@1 John 5:5). It involves the full thought of manhood. You *arrive* at it according to @Ephesians 4.
J.D. Moses recognises the features of manhood in Joshua, in @Exodus 17.
J.T. He had great confidence in Joshua. In @Exodus 17 Moses allows him to choose the warriors whom he designates *men*, although Joshua was only a young man
{279}
and not mentioned earlier. He is certainly regarded by Moses as reliable. Later, God says of him, "a man in whom is the Spirit" (@Numbers 27:18). He was a man in whom the Holy Spirit had scope. That is what God had in mind; and the book of Job would show the way to it. We are coming to the thought in chapter 42. God first brings before Job a selection of His creatures. There are about thirty of them, animate and inanimate. In chapter 39 the references are to many *living* creatures. In chapters 40 and 41 two prominent living creatures are brought forward. The inanimate things of the earth and heaven are in mind first. They would convey to Job that he is limited. As to the sea God says, "Hitherto shalt thou come and no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed". It indicates the limitation of a great power; however great, it is limited! Job is told to answer for himself, but he does not say a word: it is God who speaks throughout chapters 38 and 39. Job's silence was an appropriate answer, meaning, I am not like that! Every time Job answered a question inwardly, he would say, I do not know these things. He finds out he is very limited.
J.D. Elihu did not speak of himself, but sought to impress Job with the mightiness of God.
J.T. Yes, he was like the apostles assuming no awe-inspiring attitude, but as Peter, who, when Cornelius would have fallen down to worship him, said, "Rise up: *I* myself also am a man" (@Acts 10:26). Peter made him rise up, and they walked into the house together; yet Peter was a great apostle. The apostles bring into view the greatness of God in Christ; the things stated by them bring out deity in a Man down here. That is what subdues us, and yet we are drawn to that Man. As we follow the line of the apostles we see God in that humble Person; Deity operating in manhood. It is the overwhelming testimony to divine power in Man. It would be well for us to put ourselves in the position of being inquired of by God, as Job was. Every question
{280}
and every truthful answer would bring out *how limited I am, and how great God is*. Our chapters, however, do not present God in Christ, but God in His *creation*. It is the testimony through which He was then operating. God is dealing with the foundations of the earth on which Job was; it was but a part of the great universe, for we read that "he made the worlds" (@Hebrews 1:2). We are not told how many. "Of old hast thou founded the earth" (@Psalm 102:25). As Asaph says, too, "like the earth which he hath founded for ever" (@Psalm 78:69). All this enters into what Job is challenged about. "Where wast thou when I founded the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who set the measures thereof -- if thou knowest? or who stretched a line upon it? Whereupon were the foundations thereof sunken? or who laid its corner-stone, when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?". What could Job say? Where was he when these great things happened? Angels were there, but not he. He was unborn: and even now that he exists, what tenure of life had he? In verse 21, Jehovah refers to this *ironically*: "Thou knowest, for thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great!". How well off believers are to have a God and Father who has recourse to such effective methods to bring us down! Job could not say anything in the presence of these things.
W.F.K. The sons of God are again spoken of in verse 7.
J.T. That is in keeping with what we have in chapters 1 and 2; they are in the background which God has in this book. He has not yet secured representation of Himself in Job, but He has it in angels. Their creation was much earlier than that of man. Man may be called a *recent* creation of God.
L.E.S. @Proverbs 30:1,3 says, "The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the prophecy uttered by the man unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal: ... I have neither
{281}
learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the Holy".
J.T. Well, they are the words of a man who has learned to judge himself. He had learned something of what Jehovah is seeking to teach Job here.
L.E.S. Further he says, "Every word of God is pure" (verse 5). Yet he had to say, "Truly *I* am more stupid than any one; and I have not a man's intelligence" (verse 2).
J.T. Yet he was a man of remarkable intelligence. You wonder how he could say that, and how Paul could say that he was "less than the least of all saints" (@Ephesians 3:8). The greatest wonder of all is that the Lord Jesus could say prophetically, "I am a worm, and no man" (@Psalm 22:6). These expressions imply great compression of thought. They were written for our learning, and true self-judgment in us brings us into correspondence with them. In the presence of these things we are helped of the Lord to realise our nothingness as in the flesh. In the discourses of Job and his three friends each sought to show how *much* he knew; Agur stressed how *little* he knew.
Ques. Would correspondence be brought about in us by obeying the word, "let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 2:5)?
J.T. Quite so; the *descending* mind of Christ, "who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men; and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross" (@Philippians 2:6-8). This descending mind is to be *in us*.
J.D. "Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?". How different to Paul's word, "I desire to speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue" (@1 Corinthians 14:19).
{282}
We might be using words to darken counsel. God reproves the words of Job.
J.T. Yes, he says about two-thirds of the words that were spoken by him and his friends. In the assembly, brevity is important in its place; five words with the understanding rather than ten thousand words. *Ten thousand* is a term of Paul's, expressing what is valueless because of its *quantity*; he speaks also of ten thousand instructors. The speeches, the many words, are ended after Elihu comes in, and then there is this long service of Jehovah Himself to reach His own end. James speaks of the *patience of Job*; that would refer to the first two chapters; but there is the *patience of God* throughout the whole book; especially seen in chapters 38 to 42. Chapter 40 brings out that God is not satisfied with half measures in working with His people. Job makes an acknowledgment, but not enough for God; He would have us go all the way to a full confession; this is seen in chapter 42. Paul laboured to "present every man perfect in Christ" (@Colossians 1:28).
W.J.T. Would all this exercise lead us to manhood?
J.T. I think so. That is peculiarly brought about in Job. He says in chapter 42:3-6, "Who is he that obscureth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered what I did not understand; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and inform me. I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee; wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes". Job has thus come to the end of the matter from his side. God is no longer seen as speaking in the whirlwind. In chapter 40:6, He retained His position in the whirlwind after Job made confession; showing that He was not satisfied with it, but now the whirlwind is not mentioned.
D.R. What impresses you is the foundation that is laid in Job.
{283}
J.T. That is a most important matter. You get foundation suggestions in Matthew and Luke -- the man digs so as to have his foundation on the rock; and the apostle says, "the firm foundation of God stands" (@2 Timothy 2:19). Paul also says he laid the foundation at Corinth: "According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation" (@1 Corinthians 3:10). The Lord Jesus laid the foundation of the assembly in a general sense (@Matthew 16). "Solomon's foundation" referred to in @2 Chronicles 3:3 typified this. God says to Job, "Where wast thou when I founded the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who set the measures thereof -- if thou knowest? or who stretched a line upon it? Whereupon were the foundations thereof sunken? or who laid its corner-stone, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?". That could only be answered in the negative by Job. What could he say to it? He knew nothing. The morning stars knew, they were before him; the sons of God were before him too. They "sang together"; they celebrated what God was doing. The sons of God thus learned wisdom. Solomon tells us that wisdom was there. "Jehovah possessed me [wisdom] in the beginning of his way, before his works of old" (@Proverbs 8:22). Job was *not* there, so that he is not even equal to angels, or the stars, on this point. How humbling, sobering and yet instructive are the questions Jehovah asks of Job!
J.D. Creation has its part here in bringing Job to the desired end -- "the end of the Lord".
J.T. That is what I thought. Job would have to admit that he had no part there. The three friends would remind Job that with them there were men older than his father. God is not talking of men older than Job, but of angels who were living long before Job. It might have been millions of years before; we are not told. Job was *not* there. He has to learn the limitations of
{284}
the creature -- of man. The creature must learn from God if he is to know anything. Man is not God; man is but a creature; such sobering thoughts are needed for our souls.
L.E.S. Wisdom had freedom to operate and her "delights were with the sons of men" (Proverbs 8:31).
J.T. Things were worked out by her. Proverbs helps greatly in regard of wisdom. She had part in the joyous time when God appointed the foundations of the earth; "the habitable part" was in view, when "the sons of men" would be there.
J.C. Would the morning stars represent the inanimate creation, and the sons of God the intelligent part?
J.T. Yes. Everything praises God in one sense. The psalmist calls upon everything that has breath to praise God (@Psalm 150:6). Inanimate creation praises Him too.
J.C. "The sons of God shouted for joy". Would that be before the fall of Satan?
J.T. I think it would be the angels before their fall; Satan had no status as a son after. He is seen earlier in the book of Job, as coming up with the sons of God, but he is not one of them. The sons of God would be the angels with that recognised status. God would enlarge our view. Faith helps us in this. "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (@Hebrews 11:3). Our minds are enlarged in this way by faith.
L.E.S. There would be greater buoyancy of spirit as observing all this.
J.T. It would help in the service of God. It is a question of service here. The first singing we get in Scripture is in @Exodus 15. There is a *leader* there, but there is no leader here. I suppose the allusion in @Exodus 15 is to Christ having become Man. In view of Christ's manhood there is leadership, but here the sons of God have no leader.
{285}
Ques. Does @Proverbs 8:22-31 refer to the Lord?
J.T. No. I think wisdom is a *quality*, and it is personified in that chapter. The Creator was Jesus -- Jehovah. Everything was made by Him. Wisdom in @Proverbs 8:22-31 is not doing anything, but is in the fullest sympathy with what Jehovah was doing; the Person who was creating was Christ (@John 1:3).
J.D. That is important. In the past we wrongly viewed wisdom in @Proverbs 8 as typifying Christ personally; and attempted by it to prove Christ's sonship before time.
J.T. That is derogatory, because wisdom is there spoken of as being "brought forth" and as brought forth she was beside Jehovah; but according to @John 1:1, "the Word was God". Wisdom is a quality from God. Christ, *as Man*, is wisdom. He is spoken of as our wisdom in Corinthians. Then wisdom is justified of all her children. He was wisdom manifested on earth. Wisdom in Proverbs is a quality personified like other qualities in that book.
We must keep this matter of limitation before us as God brought it before Job. We are so apt to go beyond our measure. God is a God of measure. How could He have made the universe without being a God of measure? The spiritual universe is on the same principle; each has his niche which does not allow for inflation; we must learn our limitations. In @Romans 12:3 we get the thought, "as God has dealt to each a measure of faith".
L.E.S. Paul refers to the measure God had given to him.
J.T. That measure reached to the Corinthians, as he said, "according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach to you also" (@2 Corinthians 10:13). The Corinthians, we may say, had no measure at all; they were "comparing themselves with themselves". The point raised was, how far a man can reach in his ministry. In this day things
{286}
are small and limited, yet God would help us so that each may understand his measure.
J.D. God takes up Job as assuming to have knowledge as to His operations. "Where is the way to where light dwelleth? and the darkness, where is its place, that thou shouldest take it to its bound, and that thou shouldest know the paths to its house? Thou knowest, for thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great!" (@Job 38:19-21).
J.T. The lesson is of the great limitation characterising man as he is. God is calling attention to these features of creation to bring this out. Elihu had already called attention to some of them; but there are greater thoughts in regard of them as spoken of by God. Elihu speaks of the rain and the snow. "For he saith to the snow, Fall on the earth! and to the ... pouring rains of his might" (chapter 37:6). God speaks further, "Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, and hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail, which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of battle and war? By what way is the light parted, and the east wind scattered upon the earth? Who hath divided a channel for the rain-flood, and a way for the thunder's flash; to cause it to rain on the earth, where no one is; on the wilderness wherein there is not a man; to satisfy the desolate and waste ground, and to cause the sprout of the grass to spring forth? Hath the rain a father? or who begetteth the drops of dew? Out of whose womb cometh the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who bringeth it forth?" (chapter 38:22-29). Then in verse 31, "Canst thou fasten the bands of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion?".
These are great things above. They are wonderful features of the heavens, and they affect the earth. Job is asked for information about these things. This clearly is to impress him with his ignorance, so as to humble him, that he might judge himself and get right with his Maker; but, on the other hand there is the
{287}
need now of believers understanding the things that are made, for there is light from God in them. Thus it is said "the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made" (@Romans 1:20). These things are intended to be in our minds in a spiritual way. Could Job fasten the bands of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion? What could he say about the constellations? They have influence on the earth. There is spiritual meaning in these great creations. Thus David says, "The heavens declare the glory of God ... In them hath he set a tent for the sun, and he is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber; he rejoiceth as a strong man to run the race. His going forth is from the end of the heavens, and his circuit unto the ends of it" (@Psalm 19:1-6). How much spiritual truth enters into this! In @Genesis 1 we are informed of the sun, moon and stars, and the purposes for which they were made, but in the psalms they are the occasion of thanksgiving in the service of God. "To him that made great lights, ... the sun to rule by day ... the moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever" (@Psalm 136:7-9). The rule is not the determining of seasons here, but just to afford light during day and night. They are the occasion of thanksgiving. You cannot say you love God if you are not interested in what He is doing in His creation; we are to be worshipful in regard to it. He is known in it. "One God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all" (@Ephesians 4:6). If I love God I am interested in the worlds, for He made them, and sustains them; He keeps them in operation. It is by *faith* that this is understood. The inner side of our position is in the power of the one Spirit -- "one body and one Spirit"; the outer circle is "one God and Father of all, who is over all". In the present economy, as seen in @Ephesians 4:4-6, the Father is over all things -- over the universe. If we love Him we are interested in all His worlds. "By faith we apprehend that the worlds
{288}
were framed by the word of God, so that that which is seen should not take its origin from things which appear" (@Hebrews 11:3). The last clause of that verse sets the doctrine of evolution aside as false: the origin of what is seen is not in itself, but in *God*.
L.E.S. In @Job 38:28 we get an inquiry as to fatherhood.
J.T. "Hath the rain a father? or who begetteth the drops of dew? Out of whose womb cometh the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who bringeth it forth?". The family thought is introduced metaphorically. In Joseph's dreams regarding his father and mother and eleven brethren, the family thought is linked with the physical universe. These questions are asked as a challenge to us, and we are to be learners. It has a humbling but wholesome effect, but what Job came into through this process is open to us. The education of this book is most important.
T.D. Paul tells us that "what is known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested it to them, -- for from the world's creation the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity, -- so as to render them inexcusable" (@Romans 1:19,20).
J.T. It is thus in @Job 38:31-33 that the heavens in their influences are strikingly introduced. "Canst thou fasten the bands of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion? Dost thou bring forth the constellations each in his season? or dost thou guide the Bear with her sons? Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? dost thou determine their rule over the earth?". Every question presses home on Job the thought of his own littleness and of God's greatness. Besides this, there is instruction as to the things themselves, the invisible things of God being hidden there; they are "perceived ... through the things that are made" (@Romans 1:20). "For of him
{289}
and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever, Amen". (@Romans 11:36).
J.D. The Roman epistle brings out the mightiness of God.
J.T. It results in a worshipping people; the writer at least was affected in this way. Speaking of God as Creator, he says, "who is blessed for ever. Amen" (chapter 1:25).
L.E.S. Our worship takes on a greater character as we take in the great thoughts made known about God. They enter into our worship as we proceed in our measure in the service of God.
J.T. He is before men constantly in the immensity of His creation. He is behind all, causing the universe to function continuously and all beings subsist through Him. Thus there is in God's creation a steady testimony before men; those who have faith apprehend this, and it causes us to fall down and worship God. The heathen worship the creature, but believers in God worship the Creator. We do not worship the creation, we worship the Creator of the universe, while, as knowing Him through redemption, we worship Him as the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Ques. Does a man worship God because of what He is?
J.T. Yes, but we worship Him *also* because of what He has effected: what He has effected in creation, and in redemption. The man in @John 9 says, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?". Then he worships the Lord Jesus as He makes Himself known to him as the Son of God.
Now, to come to @Job 39, where the questions bring forward *life* -- living creatures. The section begins at chapter 38:39; the lion and raven are mentioned first, and then Jehovah inquires, "Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? dost thou mark the calving of the hinds?". Then it mentions certain other creatures; the wild ass, the buffalo, the
{290}
ostrich. What can we learn from the ostrich? It is a creature of God void of wisdom. "For God hath deprived her of wisdom". A very solemn thing! "For she leaveth her eggs to the earth, and warmeth them in the dust, and forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the beast of the field may trample them. She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were, not hers; her labour is in vain, without her concern". God is now speaking to Job about wisdom appearing in the creature. We should be different from her for we should have wisdom. "If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all freely and reproaches not, and it shall be given to him" (@James 1:5). Christians, characteristically, are the children of wisdom, and therefore should know how to look after their children. The care of children is regarded in Scripture as very important, calling for much wisdom. "The wing of the ostrich beats joyously -- but is it the stork's pinion and plumage?". She is not like the stork whose affection for her young is proverbial; who uses her pinion and plumage in wisdom for the care of her young. The wing of the ostrich testifies to power, "she scorneth the horse and his rider", but her feathers are not used according to wisdom like the plumage of the stork. "For God hath deprived her of wisdom, and hath not furnished her with understanding". All this is to emphasise the great need of wisdom more than power, in an external way, and to show that wisdom comes from God; we are dependent on Him for it.
Ques. Job was to learn from the ostrich regarding his children.
J.T. That is right. She lacks wisdom and its resulting feelings for her young. Parents allowing their young people to order their ways by themselves, to have too much latitude, results in disaster. Job allowed his children to carry on *by themselves*, as we have noted.
Rem. These are different from those of the woman whose children rise up and call her blessed (@Proverbs 31).
{291}
J.T. Proverbs was written by the son of the father's love. It is the instruction of wisdom, intended for God's family. Solomon says, "I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother" (@Proverbs 4:3). He learned much from David, his father, and also from his mother; thus he was qualified to instruct and admonish others, especially the young, using terms of parental affection.
J.D. This all impresses the soul with the wisdom of God.
J.T. The purpose of the inquiry is that we should understand all this. What comes out in the chapters we are considering impresses us with the greatness of God in creation, and we are to carry that into the spiritual world. The New Testament teaches us how to do so. In the physical creation, God impresses things upon us so that we may learn from them. Wisdom as to created things is one of the remarkable features of Scripture. Their use in conveying spiritual and moral instruction is particularly impressive. Creation is stressed in the book of Job, as involving the testimony God provided for men outside of Israel.
J.F. As pondering and understanding these things, we shall be brought to worship God. As humbly owning our lack we say, We do not know. Thus we shall get true knowledge through inquiry, and worship the true God.
J.T. Exactly. Job came to this; he had previously darkened counsel without knowledge. There are about thirty creatures, animate and inanimate, brought to our attention in chapters 38 to 41. As to each of them we must answer with the admission of our impotence and ignorance. It makes us humble, and God gives grace to such and exalts them. He can use them. When we accept our limitations, the Spirit of God can use us. All this enters into christianity. Romans teaches us not to have high thoughts above what we should think; "but to think so as to be wise, as God has dealt to each
{292}
a measure of faith" (chapter 12:3). God allows even physical weakness to teach us our limitations.
Rem. We get the masculine and the feminine in these creatures.
J.T. Yes. You have the feminine side here in the opening verses. "Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? dost thou mark the calving of the hinds? Dost thou number the months that they fulfil? and knowest thou the time when they bring forth? They bow themselves, they give birth to their young ones, they cast out their pains; their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field, they go forth, and return not unto them" (@Job 39:1-4). Such inquiry is intended to induce sympathetic feeling, in which males are prone to be deficient.
Then we come to the horse, verse 19 -- a very fine beast, not like the ostrich, deprived of wisdom. The war-horse answers to the description given. We get an allusion to it in @Proverbs 30. "There are three things which have a stately step, and four are comely in going: The lion, mighty among beasts, which turneth not away for any; a horse girt in the loins; or the he-goat; and a king, against whom none can rise up". God says to Job, "Hast thou given strength to the horse? hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane? Dost thou make him to leap as a locust? His majestic snorting is terrible. He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength; he goeth forth to meet the armed host. He laugheth at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from before the sword. The quiver rattleth upon him, the glittering spear and the javelin. He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage, and cannot contain himself at the sound of the trumpet: at the noise of the trumpets he saith, Aha! and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting". We may surely use this to illustrate the spiritual military instinct, power and courage of the christian in his heavenly
{293}
warfare. There is courage in the horse, he despises fear. Such is a true christian in contending for the truth; he does not cower before the enemy, for God is with him. David overthrew the giant, he did not cower before him; he said to the Philistine, "Thou comest to me with sword, and with spear, and with javelin; but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied" (@1 Samuel 17:45).
Rem. Would Paul before Agrippa be an example?
J.T. Yes; and the Lord Jesus supremely so as He battled with Satan and defeated him by the word of God.
Rem. Paul says, "For the rest, brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the might of his strength. Put on the panoply of God, that ye may be able to stand against the artifices of the devil" (@Ephesians 6:10,11).
J.T. That is a good scripture to bring in here, in connection with the war-horse, for Paul goes on to say, "Our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies". What are we to do? Take the *whole* armour of God, "and, having accomplished all things, to stand". It is not simply having done *all you can*, but, as the footnote to the passage says, Carry through and put in execution all that is purposed and called for in spite of opposition. @Ephesians 6 furnishes light as to the *all things* needed for this heavenly conflict.
J.D. @Isaiah 28:5,6 says, "In that day will Jehovah of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the remnant of his people; and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate".
J.T. "Turn the battle to the gate" is the point. That is to say, bring it to the assembly; recognise the assembly as to any conflict. The real warrior pursues
{294}
this line; he gets wisdom in the assembly. The full thought of conflict is collective; so we have to turn the battle to the gate, if there is to be victory. The Lord says of the assembly, "hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16:18).
J.D. The gates are the place of administration and judgment according to the mind of God. God would teach us how to war according to Himself, by these features seen in the war-horse.
J.T. What a fine, capable animal he is! @Proverbs 30 says it is stately in its step and comely in going. "There are three things which have a stately step, and four are comely in going: ... a horse girt in the loins". "Girt in the loins" is indicative of the war-horse. Paul says, "having girt about your loins with truth" (@Ephesians 6:14). Solomon speaks of its stateliness and comeliness; and this is written that we might be stately in our going. @Ephesians 6 also speaks of praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and of the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. The Lord Jesus was stately indeed in His conflict with Satan. This is seen in the word: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God" (@Luke 4:4). He said, *It is written* -- that is the sword of the Spirit. Conflict reaches conclusion in the assembly, therefore the battle must be turned to the gate.
J.D. The four living creatures in Revelation would suggest a link with the creatures in Job; they have intelligence.
J.T. Yes; they have eyes everywhere and they praise, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come" (@Revelation 4:8). Their character is seraphic and they witness to God's holiness in what they say. They are *living* and are suggestive, in this sense particularly, of what should mark the younger element among the saints. They give glory and honour and thanksgiving to God, referring to Him "who was and who is, and who is to come".
{295}
The twenty-four elders would suggest *experience* with God; they wait until the living creatures celebrate the holiness of God and then they "fall before him that sits upon the throne, and do homage to him that lives ... saying, Thou art worthy, O our Lord and our God". The elders fall down and worship, as the living creatures celebrate the holiness and power of God.
W.F.K. Would there be a suggestion of government in the horse?
J.T. Yes; the horses in Zechariah allude to the four monarchies of Daniel. They stand before the Lord of all the earth. They represent governing powers.
Ques. Would the three friends of Job suggest typically the disregard of authority in the assembly? they move independently.
J.T. Yes; each comes from his *own place*, having no doubt, local characteristics. Those of the assembly are taught of God, and are marked by subjection and the unity of the Spirit.
God proceeds instructing Job and brings out further thoughts bearing on wisdom. "Doth the hawk fly by thine intelligence, and stretch his wings toward the south?". This bird has its own governing characteristics, it seeks change of climate, and hence is migratory and would by instinct "stretch his wings toward the south". He does not move by man's intelligence, but by what God has given. "Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make his nest on high?". That reminds us of our prayer meeting, and of what @Isaiah 40:31 says, "they shall mount up with wings as eagles". "He inhabiteth the rock and maketh his dwelling on the point of the cliff, and the fastness: from thence he spieth out the prey, his eyes look into the distance; and his young ones suck up blood; and where the slain are, there is he". The Lord's words in @Matthew 24:28 confirm this last sentence, "wherever the carcase is, there will be gathered the eagles". The eagle is also much used in Scripture
{296}
as typical of the features of spiritual life. It appears among the living creatures in Ezekiel and Revelation. In @Job 39 the first feature mentioned of the eagle is that he *mounts up*. The point in Jehovah's question to Job is that he should learn that the eagle does not move at man's command.
It does not appear that God is satisfied with Job's confession in the beginning of chapter 40, so that He proceeds further, and in chapters 40 and 41 brings forward two great creatures and uses them for final instruction. If we have been away from God, He is not satisfied until we are *thoroughly* restored.
J.D. It is very touching that God should come near to us in this way.
J.T. God comes near to restore us and to complete His work. The gospels show how God finishes things. Everything the Lord does in the gospels is done *perfectly*. "He does all things well" (@Mark 7:37). Peter speaks of the "complete soundness" of the man healed at the gate of the temple (@Acts 3:16).
{297}
THE SECOND ESTABLISHED (5)
@Job 40:1-14; @Job 42:1-17
J.T. Chapters 40 and 41 bring out God's additional service so as to complete His work in one needing recovery. Job makes a statement that might be satisfactory to most of us in such cases, but then it is not satisfactory to Jehovah. Job says, "Behold, I am nought: what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further".
Jehovah continues on the same line as previously and continues to speak to Job *out of the whirlwind*. "Gird up now thy loins like a man: I will demand of thee, and inform thou me. Wilt thou also annul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous?". It would seem as if the root of self-confidence is not fully removed in Job, so God brings forward these two great creatures. The first is behemoth. "See now the behemoth", God says. It is thought that this refers to the hippopotamus, but whatever it may be, it is a great creature, and the Spirit calls it "the chief of God's ways". He seems to have great strength, but is not ferocious or warlike, and yet is impregnable. It is said, "Lo, the river overfloweth -- he startleth not: he is confident though a Jordan break forth against his mouth". Then Jehovah refers to another creature, called leviathan, which is said to be the crocodile, but this too is uncertain. We have to understand them by the descriptions given. It is said of leviathan, "He beholdeth all high things; he is king over all the proud beasts". These two great creatures are brought to Job's attention to complete God's work in him. Job then says to Jehovah, "I know that thou canst do everything, and that thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine". And he further says, "Who is he that obscureth counsel without knowledge?
{298}
therefore have I uttered what I did not understand; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and inform me. I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee: wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes". He says, "Mine eye seeth thee". God Himself comes into the view of the speaker.
Of these two great creatures, seemingly one represents somewhat what is good, while the other is fierce and invulnerable; he is named "king over all the proud beasts". He is marked by pride.
D.R. Why was Job's first confession not sufficient, and why does this second confession bring about the end of the Lord?
J.T. Well, we must compare the two confessions. The first goes a long way and indicates real progress. "Behold, I am nought: what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further". Well, he could proceed further, but he decided not to. In the second confession, he repeats what Jehovah had said in chapter 38:2; for now Job says, "Who is he that obscureth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered what I did not understand; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not". He thus quotes what Jehovah had said as wholly applicable to himself. He is now thoroughly in accord with God. There is full confession and contrition of heart. "I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee". He did not say that in the first confession. Finally, he says, "Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes"; not simply dust, but also *ashes*, alluding to the necessity of fire -- the depth of self-judgment is suggested in ashes.
L.E.S. Would what is seen in the two confessions be somewhat analogous to the cleansing of the leper in the first and seventh day? "And it shall come to pass
{299}
on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair, his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows, even all his hair shall he shave, and he shall wash his garments, and shall bathe his flesh in water, and he is clean" (@Leviticus 14:9).
J.T. Yes, there is the progressive idea in the cleansing. There is much to be done after the priest sees the leprosy is healed, before the person is brought into the camp; in principle, brought into fellowship again. Full recovery implies that one is brought into accord with God, and anointed. The priest finally anoints him. So he is set up again, qualified to take part in the service of God.
W.F.K. Job recognises his limitations here. "I uttered what I did not understand".
J.T. Quite so. The result of the mere human mind acting in divine things must be ignorance. Job says to God, "I know that thou canst do everything, and that thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine". He is now acquiring true knowledge. He says, God can do *everything*. He is coming to understand Him. "Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me" (@Jeremiah 9:24).
W.F.K. Would @Romans 7 show that I learn to abhor myself?
J.T. "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell" (verse 18). Normally the believer condemns himself thus; and he thanks God that He not only condemns what he abhors, but that He has terminated it judicially in the death of Christ.
J.D. Would experience be set forth in these two creatures?
J.T. It seems as if the first creature would be serviceable in a way. He stands in relation to Job; he is not adverse to him. God says, "See now the behemoth, which I made with thee: he eateth grass as an ox"; the allusion would fit into @Genesis 1:30. It was the
{300}
learning time and God Himself was completing His work in His servant! He calls Job His servant first and last. There must have been a great deficiency in his service before all this discipline. Here this great creature is brought forward as one from whom Job should learn, for he is "chief of God's ways".
The creature in chapter 41 is different. "Lay thy hand upon him; remember the battle, -- do no more!". Man is not equal to him in strength; he is marked by pride. "He beholdeth all high things; he is king over all the proud beasts". He is not docile, rather the opposite. We must judge of him by the divine description. Scripture says "every species both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and of sea animals, is tamed and has been tamed by the human species" (@James 3:7); but there is no evidence of tamability in this creature; he causes dread. "When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: they are beside themselves with consternation". Compared with man as a creature, Satan is indicated in this. On earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. God only could overcome him, which He did in Christ. Goliath was unmatched until David came on the scene. As we pursue this subject of apparent invincibility in a creature into the New Testament, we see the Lord Jesus led into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil. He overcame the great antagonist of God and men; bound him, and through death He annulled him. We can understand now how Job's first confession was not enough. The idea of God's power must enter into the believer's self-judgment. It had come up in the dialogues between Job and his friends, but only as generally regarded or academically. Now, in the presence of this adverse power as described by Jehovah Himself, Job begins his satisfactory confession by saying, "I know that thou canst do everything, and that thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine". By amplification, this would include the great work of God in
{301}
redemption; the work of Christ in overcoming leviathan in all his power. God can be hindered in *no thought of His*. Thus the precious thoughts of His love have all been effected, and are Yea and Amen in Christ. It is an immense thing to know God in this light; to know His power, for it implies the operations of His love; what He had wrought in Christ, and what He is now working in the saints, the power which works in us. We cannot wage the heavenly conflict, nor exercise priestly service, save as we realise the Spirit of God working in us.
J.D. What do you think of behemoth, as "the chief of God's ways", in relation to what is said of him in verse 23, "he is confident though a Jordan break forth against his mouth"? Does God intend to draw attention to the might of this creature?
J.T. Jordan would typify death. This would be something in the creation that would point to the overthrow of death, or superiority to it. "He is confident though a Jordan break forth against his mouth". The reference is not just to an ordinary river, but *Jordan*; not the Nile, or Euphrates, but a river that represents *death* in its full power. Paul speaks of being delivered from so great a death (@2 Corinthians 1:10). This involves power. Believers are superior to death, because of Him who broke its power; through Christ we are delivered from the fear of death (@Hebrews 2:15). Leviathan, as we have seen, is "king over all the proud beasts". Man cannot cope with him, but God can. Job draws attention to that in the statement, "I know that thou canst do everything". The knowledge of God in His power which, of course, is in the resurrection of Christ, enables us to overcome. The apostle prayed, "that ye should know ... the surpassing greatness of his [God's] power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead" (@Ephesians 1:18-20). That power works in us. Paul as to himself says,
{302}
"I have strength for all things in him that gives me power" (@Philippians 4:13).
J.D. Paul would have the Corinthians restore the man who had been put away lest he be swallowed up with excessive grief. Then he says, "That we might not have Satan get an advantage against us, for we are not ignorant of *his* thoughts" (@2 Corinthians 2:11).
J.T. We are taught of God how to contend with the devil. According to the first epistle to the Corinthians, the devil is made to serve God, for Paul says, as to the man who had sinned, "to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh" (@1 Corinthians 5:5). He is viewed there as a servant used for the discipline of man, but in the second epistle Paul says, "we are not ignorant of *his* thoughts". He wanted the man restored, but Satan would destroy the man wholly if he could. The Corinthians were not working with the apostle in the matter, they were holding the man in the position of discipline. Unwittingly, they were acting in the interests of the devil. No doubt they were largely ignorant of his devices. "Rather show grace and encourage", the apostle says, "lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief". The devil would hold him longer, but as under God's control Satan had done his work, and the man is to be restored. We must be careful not to help the devil. Job's wife helped the devil. In 2 Corinthians the devil is viewed as antagonistic. The man was in danger of being swallowed up with grief. The wicked man had now become the repentant man, and so must be restored, as forgiven and set up again among the brethren. The devil is defeated.
So there are two features in the service of God, in these chapters. The first one represented in behemoth being chief of God's ways, used to serve God. The second one, leviathan, Satan himself in type, who was made before man. This first creature is the chief of the ways of God, who says to Job, "which I made with thee".
{303}
J.D. As regards the man disciplined at Corinth, we cannot deliver one to Satan; that is apostolic, but the principle of the thing is there. We need priestly feelings on the side of watching over such to see the signs of repentance.
J.T. The law of the leper's cleansing shows that great exercise is involved in his being brought into the camp, and anointed. When he is anointed, he is himself in power. Paul says, "He that ... has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts" (@2 Corinthians 1:21,22). As thus adjusted, the restored believer can confront the enemy with confidence. One great feature of the priest is sympathy. The true priest is the Lord Jesus as seen in type in the bondman in @Exodus 21, "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free". He said plainly, *I love* -- whether it is in relation to God, or the assembly, or the saints as children. In the book of Exodus later (chapter 28), that man is clothed, so to speak, in the garments of the high priest. The saints are brought into all that. "Brethren, if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual" (that is real priests) "restore such a one" (@Galatians 6:1). Notice it is not said, *If* you can do it, but you *are* to do it.
These two beasts in @Job 40 and 41 stand in relation to a man under the discipline of God. Behemoth suggests kindliness, even sympathy. "His strength is in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly". The apostle says, "if any bowels and compassions" (@Philippians 2:1); these are the powerful inward feelings needed for the restoration of an erring one. The Corinthians were straitened in their own bowels (@2 Corinthians 6:12), and so not usable for the restoration of the erring one. The apostle would soften them and make them priestly, having "bowels of compassion". Satan is employed to do the rough work, needed at the outset in some cases of sin, but destructive if allowed to go beyond a certain point.
{304}
J.D. The first beast not being wild as the second, would be to assure us that God is for us.
J.T. "He is the chief of God's ways". The ways of God are unsearchable, past finding out, but they work in our favour.
L.E.S. God made Nebuchadnezzar to eat grass like an ox, until he learned to bless the Most High and praise and honour Him that liveth for ever and ever.
J.T. He was *with* the beasts of the field; they would do him no harm. In the dream, the stump of the tree was left. The root, the work of God in Nebuchadnezzar, was not destroyed. He was in the state of an ox until seven times had passed over him; the result was that he worshipped God. God did not let Satan into His discipline of Nebuchadnezzar. His ways with him were in accord with behemoth. Daniel was cast to the lions, but God sent His angel who stopped their mouths. The lions were of the character of the second beast, who would destroy us. The Lord Jesus was with the wild beasts in the wilderness, and clearly suffered no harm; at the end of that experience He bound Satan.
W.F.K. The first beast as related to discipline, might be connected with the word of God.
J.T. Yes; Daniel was able to help Nebuchadnezzar through the prophetic word. There was recovery after the "seven times" (@Daniel 4:34-37). Job reaches the end in these two chapters. In cases of discipline we must not be too easily satisfied. God would help us to discern when complete self-judgment has taken place.
J.C. Job came to know how *vile* he was -- he had completely judged himself.
J.T. Well, that is seen more fully in the dust and ashes. "Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." That is one of Abraham's phrases. "I, who am dust and ashes" (@Genesis 18:27). As far as we know he was the first to use it. It shows that he had accepted the judgment of God through sacrifice. Abel's testimony implied sacrifice, and this must be linked with Abraham's
{305}
confession. If there is no sacrifice, the ashes would refer to the lake of fire. It is only through the sacrifice of Christ that there is any recovery at all. Chapter 42 says, "And it came to pass after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, that Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, Mine anger is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken rightly of me, like my servant Job. And now, take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for him will I accept; lest I deal with you after your folly, for ye have not spoken of me rightly, like my servant Job". It is clear that Job's last statements satisfied Jehovah and led to what He says in favour of Job. Job is now *accepted*. God owned him as His servant, and said that he has spoken rightly of Him. It is when a man has been all this way through discipline he can speak rightly of God.
D.R. God enlarges on what Elihu says and gets this result.
J.T. Yes; He continues on from Elihu. Is your ministry such that God can identify Himself with it? There are ten thousand instructors in christendom and it is certain that God can link Himself with but very few of them. Elihu plainly says, by his name; ' God is He '. He is not putting himself forward; he is letting no one despise his youth. No matter how young I am, no man can despise me if I speak like Elihu, or Timothy or Titus. "Rebuke not an elder sharply", Paul says to Timothy (@1 Timothy 5:1). Where rebuke of an elder was needed, Timothy, governed by this balancing word in administering it, would fortify himself against any despisal of his youth.
D.R. Why would he not be despised?
J.T. Because of moral power and wisdom in the way he acted. God has given us a spirit "of power, and of love, and of wise discretion" (@2 Timothy 1:7), and in maintaining this, a young brother can serve
{306}
God and men as acceptably and effectively as those who are older. It is clear that Timothy and Titus represented the apostle Paul even in the appointment of elders.
J.D. "Let no one despise thy youth, but be a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity" (@1 Timothy 4:12). If a young man is a model in this way, you are bound to admit his moral power.
J.T. Exactly; as we have already noted with Elihu; although he was a young man, Job and his three friends did not question his moral right to speak.
F.R. Job says, "I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee". How would that come about?
J.T. Evidently by what Job saw in the great creatures of God; in *what God called attention to in them*. If we take what is going on in the world at the present time, God has much to say in it. He is effecting *something which we should see*. It may stand in relation to behemoth or leviathan or both. He may at first have used the leviathan element to do the rough or scourging work, and this being accomplished, cast it off as an enemy. Then God may have recourse to the elements friendly to men, compassionate as made *with him*; that is, behemoth. This word is said to be the plural of excellence, or intensity, of the Hebrew word for *domestic cattle* as in @Genesis 1:25 and 2:20, and hence suggests an extensive element in God's creation having a special link of sympathy with man. Being "the chief of God's ways", there would be the working out of *good* in the creation toward men in the awful trial that has come upon us all. Thus we see *God* in all that is transpiring and we say it is among the "all things" that work for good to those who love Him.
Leviathan is a creature of God, too, as we have seen. We are not told that he was made *with* man as behemoth was. God uses him for certain purposes. But great as
{307}
this creature is, what is he compared with God? (chapter 41:10). Job says *God is greater* -- He can do everything.
J.C. God created both the beasts.
J.T. Yes. He created Satan, of course, but not *with* man. The lake of fire is made for Satan -- "For the devil and his angels" (@Matthew 25:41).
L.E.S. Creation in that way would help us to understand the ways of God.
J.T. Well, it would all contribute; especially he who is the *chief* of those ways, as said already. Abstractly, creation is good and ministers to God's praise. "*Thou* hast created all things, and for thy will they were, and they have been created" (@Revelation 4:11).
D.R. God goes into detail regarding the creation in these chapters to reach, as James says, "the end of the Lord". The Lord is very faithful in leaving undone nothing needed to reach His end in Job.
J.T. Quite so. In the first chapters Job maintained his integrity, defeating Satan's efforts, but here he says, I have "uttered what I did not understand; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not". He is not now seeking to establish his own righteousness, but God's; so he reaches the end of the Lord, as James alludes to it. It is most encouraging to look into the final chapter; chapters 40 and 41 lead up to this. The Lord Jesus had to do with this last creature; that is, Satan as depicted in this way. The result is that the believer is recovered, as seen in Job in the last chapter. The creature mentioned in chapter 40 would, as we have seen, speak of something favourable; this is seen in some respects in government. The governments in this empire are favourable to the christian. We must not carry the application too far, but that much is there. The adverse government would be seen in the second beast; it is against us. Government in these countries is not acting against us, and God is using them. We are, nevertheless, to remember that Pilate justified the Lord, and yet, under adverse influence, crucified Him.
{308}
L.E.S. Paul says he "fought with beasts at Ephesus" (@1 Corinthians 15:32).
J.T. They were wild. The second one here is mentioned in that way. "Lay thy hand upon him; remember the battle, -- do no more". What can you do? But then God can do something. Job learned that God could do everything. These two confessions show the purpose of discipline. The first, "I am nought", may be found with us; but then there are further discoveries to be made, as we come up against these two creatures, which are used in God's disciplinary ways. The end of the Lord is reached and we are not overcome by adverse elements, but we overcome them. Paul says, "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter. But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us" (@Romans 8:36,37). That is the idea, we are supported through the sufferings by Him that loved us. He is greater than them all. "For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (@Romans 8:38,39).
J.D. What do you think is meant by, "When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: they are beside themselves with consternation". That power was roused up in full force against the Lord Jesus Christ.
J.T. Yes, but it had to go. The Lord said, "Get thee away, Satan, ... Then the devil leaves him" (@Matthew 4:10,11).
T.K. Would you get the two characters of government you alluded to in Herod?
J.T. That is right. Herod did not intend to kill John the baptist, but rather than break his word before his friends he did so. The same is seen in Felix; he listened to Paul, but he, "desirous to oblige the Jews,
{309}
to acquire their favour, left Paul bound" (@Acts 25:27). A politician has to obtain favour of the people.
J.D. It is a serious thing to come under the power of leviathan. It needs the full armour of God to withstand him. One going out from the fellowship is exposed to his power.
J.T. Satan goes about, @1 Peter 5:8 says, "as a roaring lion ... seeking whom he may devour". If one is withdrawn from by the saints, he is deprived of the protection which the assembly affords, he is exposed to the devil. You cannot expect God to keep you, if you turn your back upon the light and go into darkness. I think that is the point with Job. Being instructed by God as to these two beasts leads to complete recovery. If I have the second one to contend with, what can I do? I must have God, and for this I must abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes.
S.J. Do you consider that Job understood the import of what God was bringing him to here?
J.T. His confession shows that he did. Do *we* understand it? The Holy Scriptures were written to be understood. @1 Peter 1:11,12 says the prophets were "searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these. To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things". Hence the importance of reading the Scriptures so that we may understand. I do not suppose that Job would understand *all* that is written in this book, but as we read, allowing the Holy Spirit of God to affect our minds, the full import of the Scriptures comes to us. How great the position is! It is the day of the ministry of the Spirit of God, who understands everything, searching for us even "the depths of God". The whole import and meaning of the Old Testament is thus brought to us.
{310}
Chapter 42 goes on to show how thorough is the recovery that has taken place in Job. He quotes what God said to him at the outset. Sometimes, in dealing with a brother who has failed, we find that he goes so far, like Job in chapter 40, and then there is a big *but*. That is why these two chapters are brought in. There is now no excuse offered, but a thorough bowing to the will of God.
D.R. There was no *but* in David's confession.
J.T. What occasions it is usually silenced through discipline. Sometimes we have to wait long for *full* confession.
W.F.K. After Job's confession he is found praying for his friends.
J.T. It is a question of the second being established in the testimony of God -- in christianity; praying for his enemies. "If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for, so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" (@Romans 12:20,21). Fire brings down his head -- he *bows*. You do not do it to destroy, but simply to make him bow before God. Job was brought down and now the three friends are brought down. God secures *all*.
J.D. God says to Eliphaz, "Take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, for ye have not spoken of me rightly, like my servant Job". They are to see what God has arrived at in Job.
J.T. Yes. Job is made, we may say, a high priest. They are directed to take for themselves offerings and go to Job and offer them up, and Job would pray for them. They act as priests, bringing their burnt offering, and offering it, but Job serves as high priest, and is accepted, and they are accepted through him. The high priestly position is reached, through which God can
{311}
be approached. "Jehovah accepted Job". We are accepted in the Beloved (@Ephesians 1:6).
J.D. It is not a sin-offering, but a burnt-offering.
J.T. Public christendom fails to come to this. The high-priestly place is assumed, but there is only one true High Priest. We come in under Him, all christians being priests. God accepted Job, not only himself, but in relation to Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar.
Rem. Job is mentioned in @Ezekiel 14:12-14, "And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by working unfaithfulness, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off man and beast from it; though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, should be in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness".
J.T. That is a remarkable testimony to Job. What we have been considering in this chapter shows that in this book God had in mind the whole testimony of Scripture and the whole divine system typified in Israel, and now set up in Christ, our great Priest in heaven.
L.E.S. Abraham, who was contemporary with Job, also had to do with God's priest.
J.T. Yes; the great priest, Melchisedec. Abraham, great as he was, had to pay the tithe to him; this brings out that Christ as Priest was there in type. Noah, Daniel and Job placed together in the prophetic testimony, all serving outside the land of Israel, point to God's sovereign universal activities in all dispensations.
J.D. Many christians do not see much in Genesis, but in following it through in this way, we see what God gives us from it.
J.T. Genesis is a great book to us. Much of what is current is hidden in it; hence the enemy has sought to discredit it. The priest of the most High God is a millennial thought.
L.E.S. The divine family is brought in through Abraham.
{312}
J.T. Yes, through Isaac. "In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee" (@Genesis 21:12). In the families of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the sovereignty of God is seen in family eliminations and adjustments. Ishmael is excluded from Abraham's family; Esau from Isaac's, and Joseph is placed before Reuben in Jacob's. The double portion is Joseph's. The general features of the family of faith are seen in Genesis. Joseph is a type of Christ rejected by Israel and afterwards made known to them as His brethren. "He came to his own, and his own received him not" (@John 1:11). In connection with Joseph we have the remarkable feature of the family conveyed in the sun, moon and stars (@Genesis 37:9). Christ is thus seen exalted in the house of Jacob. "He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever" (@Luke 1:33). In Job the idea of the family of faith has a great place, as we have seen. The first family is taken away that the second might be established.
Rem. Job was not told to *offer* these sacrifices.
J.T. No. The three were to take the offerings and *go to him* and offer for themselves. He would pray for them; "for him will I accept", Jehovah says. His position is high-priestly. Then we have the whole position that is recovered; the second family is established. "And Job lived after this a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons¬ sons, four generations. And Job died, old and full of days". There is complete change in Job, and in his circumstances. God has effected this. Jehovah turned the captivity of Job when he had prayed for his three friends. All is refreshingly changed. It is a foreshadowing of the Jews in the last days and their recovery from their long captivity. It will be "life from among the dead" (@Romans 11:15).
D.R. Why does God enlarge on the three daughters, and give their names?
J.T. To bring out the subjective side in the new order of things. For us, pointing to the assembly, also suggesting
{313}
the Israel of the future, the feminine qualities which are for Christ, as seen in Song of Songs.
D.R. Beautiful women set out the thought of the assembly as constituted for Christ.
J.T. Eve, Rebecca and Abigail. As Eve is brought to Adam, he implies in what he says that she is like him. Abigail and Rebecca are beautiful women, and outstanding as types of the assembly.
L.E.S. It is through discipline we are brought to name things. In chapter 1 the daughters are not named.
J.T. Discipline tends to clear the vision. We can understand, in view of the history of the first family, how Job's experience would enter into the names he gave the daughters of the second. According to the information available, they all convey attractive feminine qualities. The sons¬ names are not given. The attention directed by the Spirit to the beauty of Job's daughters and their names, indicates that the feminine or subjective result of the discipline is stressed rather than the governing side.
J.D. I was noticing how it is put here, "And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he had prayed for his friends". Not only was Job's recovery in view, but that of his three friends, too.
J.T. Yes. As he prayed for them, he would typify Christ as Priest. You have the thought of the high priest brought in there. God accepted Job, and he is interested in others. The whole position is now changed, including that of the three friends. They are in favour with God, and blessing generally marks the position through one man who is accepted by God.
J.F. Why is everything that he has doubled except the sons and the daughters?
J.T. What appears in the family is that it was *new*, different from the first, not in quantity, but in quality. It is the second established, as we have seen. The double quantity of cattle, I think, points to what Christ has in the millennium. As to the family, there is a link
{314}
with @Numbers 27:6,7. The daughters of Zelophehad were given "a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren".
D.R. The spiritual family in the seven sons and three daughters far exceeds in quality the natural or first family.
J.T. Yes. It is not said now that they were feasting in the house of the firstborn"; but it is said that Job saw his sons, and his son's sons". He is not now seen acting at a distance -- the children meeting by themselves in each other's houses. "He sent and hallowed them" at the beginning (chapter 1:5). In the closing chapter Job in *seeing* "his sons, and his sons¬ sons, four generations" becomes a patriarch like Joseph, who "saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born on Joseph's knees" (@Genesis 50:23).
J.D. The passage says, "And Job died, old and full of days". This reminds us of David's death: "And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour" (@1 Chronicles 29:28).
T.K. There is a great difference also in the way his friends come to see him in this chapter from the beginning of the book. "And all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house, and they condoled with him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him; and every one gave him a piece of money, and every one a golden ring". There is real sympathy now.
J.T. It is most beautiful -- I suppose pointing to the recovery of the Jews in the millennial day. The whole history comes up, and the work of God is manifest in the activity of love. It marks all those who had known him -- "all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been his acquaintance before". The rings would show the abiding interest of love. And
{315}
then, "Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses. And he had seven sons and three daughters. And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch. And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren". As we have said, we are reminded of the book of Numbers in what is said of the daughters. In both Numbers and Joshua, the daughters of Zelophehad find an inheritance "among their brethren".
L.E.S. There is a wonderful touch in @Genesis 50:19-21, as to God's end in discipline, corresponding with what is before us; "Joseph said to them, Fear not: am I then in the place of God? Ye indeed meant evil against me: God meant it for good, in order that he might do as it is this day, to save a great people alive. And now, fear not: I will maintain you and your little ones. And he ... spoke consolingly to them". Would that fit in here? Also Paul says in @Ephesians 3:13,14, "Wherefore I beseech you not to faint through my tribulations for you, which is your glory. For this reason I bow my knees to the Father".
J.T. There are remarkable links there, indicating that the work of God is really the same throughout. God co-ordinates His work universally. That is what will appear in the end, when it will be said, "What hath God wrought!" (@Numbers 23:23).
D.R. These brethren and acquaintances would be brought fully into sympathy with Job.
J.T. Yes. That marks his recovery. It is not simply that one is allowed to break bread again, but all your brethren are *with* you; you want that. So it is said, "they ate bread with him in his house". And further, "they condoled with him, and comforted him ... and every one gave him a piece of money, and every one a
{316}
golden ring". We do not know how many were there, but there is the evidence of *love* in the ring -- *eternal love*. The millennium is just a foretaste of eternity; but love goes right through. Love pervades all. They are all together vitally; as in christianity we are together in a living way. Anticipatively, we are seated *together* in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. A very wonderful position!
W.F.K. Unity in love marks the position.
J.T. Yes. There is true priesthood now; and sons and daughters set up in a living way in relation to their father; not doing what they like. Job *saw* four generations of his family. *Our* Father watches over us -- "The Father himself loveth you" (@John 16:27). The father's place in @Job 42 is very significant. In John's gospel, in chapters 14 to 17, the Lord urges the truth as to the Father; that He should be known, and have His place in the minds and hearts of the disciples. Here Job gave his daughters an inheritance among their brethren; Job as their father has his place now.
All this is to be reflected among the saints today. There may be ten thousand instructors, but only one father, Paul says, and he was that, for he represented God in fatherly qualities amongst the Corinthians. There is a great need amongst us of fatherhood; the representation of God in this sense, especially towards young people. "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God" (@1 John 3:1).
W.F.K. Job is like Jacob at the end. He has a *good finish*.
J.T. That is a most important point. We want to get in at the finish. "The end of the Lord" is in mind. The present time is the finishing time. God is going to establish *the second* publicly, and surely we all wish to be in it.
{317}
CONFESSORS OF THE SON OF GOD (1)
@Matthew 16:13-20; @Matthew 17:4,5,22-27
J.T. Our subject for these readings is *Confessors of the Son of God*. In considering it, we may see how the truth apprehended and confessed works out in practice and testimony. The first to be considered is Peter and then Paul; Peter in relation to the *assembly*, and Paul in relation to *preaching*. Paul is the first who is said to have *preached* the Son of God; in fact, his confession is in the form of preaching (@Acts 9:20). There is also John the baptist, whose testimony is related to the *sacrificial* side of the truth; and then Nathanael, Martha, the centurion, and others.
It was thought that we should begin with the *leading* features of our subject, for it appears that we get better results on occasions like this, in beginning at the top, thus seeing the full general thought of a subject, and then how it develops in detail. The passages read will enable us to do this. The Lord deliberately raises the question of who He was; what men were saying about Him. The Father had to do with the matter, as we see in Peter's answer. Peter is enlightened by revelation; not by teaching, but by a revelation by the Father. He says, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God". This is one of the most interesting sections of Scripture, because it is divinely arranged with a view to bringing out the great truth of Christ and the assembly. The assembly is seen in Matthew in an administrative sense, corresponding with what is in heaven for the maintenance of the truth -- the whole truth -- "and hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it". Whatever the attack, it will remain invulnerable.
The confession Peter makes constitutes him *material* for this great structure; chapter 17 shows how the truth is confirmed afterwards. When a divine thought comes into the soul, it is confirmed in later events,
{318}
as on the mount here, the Father's voice saying, "*This* is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him". Following this, at the end of the chapter, the Lord Himself takes up the matter, bringing it home in an effectual way, to bring out that the saints are to be sons too. He said to Peter, "Then are the sons free". The Authorised Version says *children*, but that is misleading; it is *sonship* that the Lord has in mind. They are maintained, too, in a world of misunderstanding, in uprightness, in paying tribute so as not to offend.
This part of our subject ought to help us today as to the general position, including government requirements and the like; for we are to maintain uprightness, and at the same time avoid any unnecessary feeling; as Christ said to Peter, "But that we may not be an offence to them". This brings out how the saints are brought into the particular truth before us. "And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him". Matthew usually connects all such instruction with the house, the place of affection.
Rem. This knowledge of the Son of God seems to furnish a basis for the assembly in our minds.
J.T. The great teaching of this phase of our subject is the assembly and the material for it, and how it stands the test of opposition. Whatever advantage Satan may have, the assembly can always stand the test; the gates of hades shall not prevail against it.
A.N.W. In asking this question the Lord speaks of Himself as the Son of man.
J.T. The Son of man is a title that He almost entirely uses Himself. It is not given such a place as the Son of God. Stephen uses it, and it appears in Hebrews, but there it is a quotation. The title Son of man would involve His universal rights; He is linked up with all men, but in His own way, not from their point of view. He would not admit of men taking on any special relations with Him. The title implies His relation to the whole race of man. He is the one Mediator
{319}
of God and men, the man Christ Jesus (@1 Timothy 2:5).
A.E.H. Does the title Son of man stand in contrast to the conditions prevailing in the end of chapter 17, where there are certain demands made that would bring in bondage?
J.T. Yes; the Son of man is the hope of mankind. Stephen sees Him thus at the right hand of God. He is on man's side and has taken up his cause. It is wider than the title Messiah.
A.R. Peter says, in chapter 16, "*Thou* art ... the Son of the living God". The Lord says in turn to him, "*Thou* art Peter". We might think the confession is objective, but it seems to bring out something subjective.
J.T. In the end of chapter 14 you might say it is an objective recognition of Christ as the Son of God, by the men in the boat; but in Peter's case, it suggests subjective conditions such as the Father could use. The men in the boat recognised the Son of God in an objective sense, although their feelings are evidently seen. Peter is affected by the Father; the Father was ready to impart the revelation when the time arrived. The Lord began the matter, inquiring from them what men were saying as to who He the Son of man was; then what *they* -- the disciples -- said; not what they thought, but what they *said*. Then the Father comes in and takes His part in the great matter, and Peter expresses the truth. The truth is placed in Peter's soul by the Father's revelation of the truth as to the great Person that was before them.
Ques. Would the title Son of man stand over against the name of the place -- Caesarea-Philippi, a place, the name of which would suggest the glory of man?
J.T. You are referring to the Greek and Roman world. When the Greeks came up and wanted to see Jesus, the disciples were pleased that such distinguished people should come, but the Lord says, "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified" (@John 12:23). How was this to be? Not by the Greeks as
{320}
such, but by the Son of man *dying*; by His bringing in a new race through death and resurrection. That is why it is Son of man; He is the hope of humanity. He falls into the ground and dies, otherwise He would abide alone.
C.A.M. As this subject, sonship, is brought out, the incident given from verse 14 of chapter 17 brings out the terrible power of evil against man.
J.T. Verse 14 brings out lunacy; the boy was a lunatic, under the power of Satan, which is one of the worst things you get in Scripture. It would tend to destroy everything of God.
Rem. These various opinions as to who the Son of man is, indicate the confusion that there is where the Father has not operated.
J.T. I think that is right. The Lord says, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?". The Son of man is an accredited title. He is saying that He is Son of man, but He is not inquiring as to whether men were owning Him by this title, but what they said as to *who* He was. They were speculating as to who Jesus was, having no certainty, for the Spirit of truth was not governing them. There is no evidence that they investigated thoroughly, or with genuine desire to know the truth. In our meetings, normally, as inquiry goes on, the Father comes in; we often notice this. This implies the truth of the temple. The Lord did not enlarge on, or combat, what men were saying about Him. He inquired if the disciples knew, but He did not enter into men's speculations. He does not allow the matter to get out of hand. In a meeting like this, if a matter gets out of hand we do not get anywhere; we could have a long meeting on speculations; but it is a question of getting at the truth. The Lord says, "But *ye*, who do ye say that I am?". The answer was not arrived at by each saying what he knew, but by letting the Father in. Let us always seek to make room for the spiritual side.
{321}
A.P.T. I notice the word *demanded* is used in verse 13. Is there some suggestion of intimate feeling in the request of the Lord?
J.T. That would fit into our meetings. The word *demand* here may refer to mutual feeling and liberty; as if one were to inquire, What do you say about that? Generally, it would suggest the spirit in which questions are asked at our readings; as distinct from a question asked by an inferior. I am thinking in this of the note to @John 14:16 in the New Translation.
S.J.H. Would you say that one is hardly known as material for the assembly until this point of confession is reached? The knowledge of the Son of God is essential to it.
J.T. The material comes into evidence by the confession, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God". "*Thou* art Peter", the Lord says. The whole matter, we may say, was arranged; divine Persons having to say to it. The Lord's raising questions with them leads up to the full thought. The Lord expects us to inquire about things. Even now, there is much confusion and darkness about the Lord's Person. I suppose all modernists and those influenced by them would say that the Lord came for the advantage and improvement of humanity. There is hardly one that would not allow that; but they are missing the whole point as to His Person. The Father operates, as we see in @Matthew 16, at an opportune time to bring the whole truth out.
Our present meetings are of little use unless there is a divine touch. These are spiritual matters, and we shall get nothing definitely unless God comes in. What this one says, and that one says, the Lord brings to an issue, and the Father takes advantage of that, and then someone says something that conveys the whole truth -- that which spiritually should be understood at the time.
G.F. You were distinguishing between what they said, and what they thought. What had you in mind?
{322}
J.T. You may think a great deal, and not say a word to your neighbour about the truth. We should be on the alert for evidences of the work of God; because God *is* working, and having priestly sensibilities we should be able to discern what is of God in a soul and further it. There was no evidence of God's work in what the disciples heard from other men, though some seemed to have more respect than others; apparently none of them showed disrespect. That is pretty much the situation today in christendom, but where God is working, there will be a spiritual touch and this should be fostered.
What is before us now is a great spiritual matter. In His own time the Father would speak as He has someone to whom He can say it. Can the Father use me to say the needed thing definitely at a given moment? These are exercises which everyone should have. In @Matthew 16 the answer to the Lord's question came directly from the Father; it was an ordered matter, the Father knowing all beforehand.
J.W.D. Do you look at the Father's action as connected with what is essentially spiritual, the Lord's service being preparatory to that?
J.T. "God is a spirit" (@John 4:24); this thought distinguishes Him as over against flesh and blood. Here, it is not exactly His speaking, but spiritual impressions received from the Father; it is revelation.
C.H.H. In chapter 14:34 the men in the boat say, "Truly thou art God's Son". Did that involve a revelation from God?
J.T. I would not connect revelation with them. There was something seen that enabled them to connect with Christ the sonship prophesied in the Old Testament. Nebuchadnezzar said, "The appearance of the fourth is like a son of God" (@Daniel 3:25); that was also an objective idea. Today, the sonship of Christ is an orthodox doctrine, owned by unconverted people, but
{323}
the point for us is to have a spiritual apprehension of it.
R.W.S. This revelation affected Peter inwardly.
J.T. That is what we should see. You could hardly say that of those in the boat. There was something, as they saw the miracle, that caused them to say, "Truly thou art God's Son". Peter is to be viewed by himself, and *the men in the boat* have to be taken by themselves, and the facts mentioned would indicate that God had wrought in them. What they said, however, was the result of *what they saw* in Christ -- His works, not a revelation. What they said is recorded by the Spirit as fitting into the course of the truth *there*, but Peter's confession is the result of a revelation from the Father, having in view the foundation of the assembly, and the material for the building.
C.A.M. These schools of opinion are around us today, but none of them have the full truth of the Son of God; but the Father is still ready to give us thoughts of the greatness of Christ, which cannot be found in any circles where the opinions of men prevail.
J.T. Quite so: it is an arranged matter. The Father makes arrangements, too. The Lord, at a suitable time and place, raised this great issue; conditions were suitable, and Peter was available, so that the Father came in in His own time to afford the needed light -- "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God". Those in the boat did not say that, nor did Matthew, nor any others. Peter, alone, in chapter 16, got the revelation. It is fundamental, and it is from the Father. It is a wholly spiritual matter, and to be material for the great heavenly structure, we must come into this.
A.E.H. It was between the Father and Peter.
J.T. Peter was honoured in this way, but the revelation is for all; the truth of the body involves that what one gets is for all. @1 Corinthians 14 shows that one sitting in the assembly, as convened for ministry, might get a revelation, and that being so, room was to be made for him to convey it.
{324}
C.M.Y. Would there be a link with chapter 10, where it is said the Lord chose Peter?
J.T. Yes; in naming the twelve apostles, it is said "first, Simon, who was called Peter". That indicates divinely given leadership, and clearly Peter was fitted for it. His leadership was nevertheless not merely official, but generally in the grace and power of the Spirit.
A.E.H. He guards definitely against officialism in exhorting elders against lording over God's heritage (@1 Peter 5).
W.R. Following this revelation, He enjoins on the disciples "that they should say to no man that he was the Christ".
J.T. Spreading it abroad is what has made christendom what it is. This section of Scripture contemplates revelation and spirituality, so as to shut out the human mind. Christ was presented to men as they were, and their estimate of Him is conveyed in their words which the disciples reported. The Lord would not present Himself to the natural man again; henceforth the truth is presented on the principle of "faith to faith".
J.W.D. This emphatic "thou" in verse 18 -- what do you think it conveys?
J.T. It would carry with it the recognition of all that Peter had apprehended through the revelation. The Lord would, in addressing him, think of Peter in a potential sense; he was marked out as a stone for the building. "This rock" refers to *what Peter confessed* -- "the Christ, the Son of the living God"; the confession -- involving his apprehension of it -- constituted him a stone. Thus Peter says later, "To whom coming, a living stone ... yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house" (@1 Peter 2:4,5).
A.N.W. Peter says, "*Thou* art the Christ", and the Lord says, "*Thou* art Peter". Both pronouns are emphatic.
{325}
J.T. Christ as known by the Father's revelation is before Peter's mind, and what Peter was spiritually is before the Lord's mind. The pronouns draw attention to the persons. As the testimony appeared among the Jews, Matthew enlarges on Peter, as representing what is foundational in christianity. This would be over against the flimsiness of Jewish traditional foundations. @Revelation 21 shows how the foundational thought seen here in Peter, extended to all the twelve apostles.
J.R.H. Does that bring out the spiritual affinity that existed between the Lord in manhood and Peter?
J.T. Yes. The first time Jesus saw him He said, "Thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone)" (@John 1:42). Here in @Matthew 16 He uses the Greek word for Peter; it is more formal. John records, "thou shalt be called"; here the Lord says, "*thou* art Peter". The whole position of real christianity is brought before our minds in this passage. Rome is built on a wholly false interpretation of the Lord's words, and spirituality does not enter into it; it is but a testimony to the ability of the human mind to wrest Scripture in order to build up a false system.
S.W.P. The heavens are introduced here, the Lord saying, "My Father who is in the heavens".
J.T. If we look carefully into Matthew we shall understand that. Heaven is greatly stressed, no doubt to lift us out of judaism and all that corresponds with it today.
S.McC. What would you say was in the Lord's mind when He says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona"?
J.T. It is to show the greatness of the revelation. Simon Bar-jona is the *responsible* person, but that is not all. God had blessed him in his responsibility. The Lord would no doubt ask him about Jonas, and the Lord fixes the person by bringing in his father's name. The Lord was three and one-half years or more
{326}
with his disciples, and, no doubt, many a subject came up in their conversations.
S.McC. This great matter of spirituality is not something in the air, but is seen in a responsible person.
J.T. Yes. Peter was a responsible person. The Lord had that in His mind. The Lord perhaps asked Peter about his father, and maybe like Solomon he said, I am a son unto my father. John had a father: Zebedee. He was, perhaps, better off circumstantially than Simon 's father. The Lord would know all about the antecedents of the apostles, and would refer to what was needed in teaching at any time. Paul speaks of serving God with pure conscience from his forefathers (@2 Timothy 1:3). Peter was Simon the son of Jonas. Solomon says, "I was a son unto my father" (@Proverbs 4:3). Maybe the Lord would make use of this in teaching His disciples. The Lord might inquire of John, What about your father, Zebedee? His wife wanted to push the two sons ahead; the Lord adjusted that; but they were working *with their father* in the boat; and the Lord would take notice of that; they were dutiful young men. Christianity recognises what people are ordinarily. Paul says God "set me apart even from my mother's womb" (@Galatians 1:15); what he was from the outset is thus mentioned in relation to his service.
A.P.T. Is David an example? As about to be anointed he was feeding his father's sheep (@1 Samuel 16:11).
J.T. Heaven took account of that; he was the dutiful son in that whole position. His father sent him into the camp with needed things for his brethren, and in executing this order he left the sheep with a keeper. "David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took his charge and went, as Jesse had commanded him" (@1 Samuel 17:20).
G.F. What is conveyed in the word "blessed" as applied to Peter here?
{327}
J.T. As used here, it would mean that Peter had great spiritual advantage; even as in the word to Mary, "Blessed art *thou* among women" (@Luke 1:28).
A.R. Peter's father, Jonas, was not telling him anything about Christ. The Father -- Christ's Father -- in heaven was doing the communicating now.
J.T. That is the point. The Lord was here about His Father's business. If one is faithful in a literal father's business, God respects that.
Ques. Why does the Lord say so emphatically in verse 18 -- "And *I* also, I say".
J.T. The Father gave the revelation to Peter, and now the Lord -- another divine Person -- says, "And *I* also, I say unto thee that *thou* art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly". That is the counterpart of what the Father had said to Peter. Divine Persons were there working together.
J.W.D. What part has the Holy Spirit -- a divine Person also -- in all this?
J.T. He is the medium of divine operation subjectively.
Rem. What you have said would show the importance of right arrangements that we might make, so as to give divine Persons the greatest liberty.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. Paul in 1 Corinthians had that specially in mind, that arrangements in the assembly should be suitable, especially as to the Lord's supper and the ministry (see chapters 11 and 14).
A.N.W. As a result of understanding this should we address the Son as Peter does here?
J.T. This is a very special instance; that the Son should be known and addressed in this way was needed at this juncture, to bring out the truth foundationally. Chapters 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 of John's gospel show that the Lord would have us address the Father more. In hymns and prayers, the Lord is much more addressed in our meetings than the Father; *adjustment is obviously needed*.
{328}
C.H.H. The apostle prays "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom" (@Ephesians 1:17). Would that be by the Spirit?
J.T. Yes. Through Christ "we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". Normally, the Spirit is the immediate medium of operations in and through the saints; it is in His power that we worship and speak to divine Persons.
Ques. Would you say that generally the Father should always have the greater part in the economy?
J.T. Yes; *the greater part* -- that is the way to put it. In the Lord's supper, of course, that is, in the *memorial*, the Lord Jesus is peculiarly before us, but as to the general position, the Lord says, "glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee" (@John 17:1). At Pentecost, Peter says "he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear" (@Acts 2:33). The Holy Spirit was operating, and the saints were all filled, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them to speak forth. They spoke of "the great things of God" (@Acts 2:11).
A.R. What I notice is, that those who speak to the Father seem to have more power in addressing Him.
C.H.H. In @John 14, 15, and 16, there are about seven allusions to prayer.
J.T. There are very few prayers to the Son; yet we should be very wrong if we did not pray to Him. He is equal with the Father. He says, "ye believe on God, believe also on me"; also, "If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it". It is right and necessary, therefore, to pray to the Lord; but it should be with intelligence; the order in which divine Persons are seen in the divine economy should always be kept in mind.
Returning to our Scripture, the Lord proceeds and indicates now that Peter is not only material for the assembly, but that He is also a reliable person; he is
{329}
trustworthy; "I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens". He is commissioned to administer the kingdom of the heavens.
A.N.W. Is Peter's being constituted material for the assembly a distinct thing outside his apostleship?
J.T. Assembly material is not apostleship; it is what he is by the revelation of the Father, and the confession of what was revealed to him; he is material in that sense. All true christians are material for the building; we are this as having the Spirit, and as *coming into*, by the Spirit, what was revealed to Peter.
{330}
CONFESSORS OF THE SON OF GOD (2)
@Galatians 1:15-19; @Acts 9:17-21; @2 Corinthians 1:18-22
J.T. I think the brethren will see the rightness of the remark that Paul's confession of Christ as Son of God, is in relation to preaching. He makes a great deal of the preaching, saying at the end of his ministry, "that by me the preaching might be fully known"; he also says he is an architect and builder (@1 Corinthians 3:10; @2 Corinthians 10:8; @2 Corinthians 13:10). Our subject now is connected with the preaching in his ministry. "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations".
Ques. Would it seem from @Ephesians 4 that the preaching was part of the divine arrangement that you spoke of, as the gifts show? "*He* has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (@Ephesians 4:11-13).
J.T. Yes. The preaching would stand in relation to the gift of the evangelist; that the preaching should be fully done, not merely in an ordinary way, but in a full way, resulting in full or clear knowledge. The preaching helps to the full knowledge of the Son of God.
You can understand that in referring to the preaching the apostle had his evangelical power in mind. So that he begins the epistle to the Romans in saying, "the gospel of God ... concerning his Son". It is the gospel of God. Then he goes on to say that the Son of God is declared or marked off in power by resurrection of the dead. What is in Paul's mind is the preaching and that Christ's sonship is attested in power. That is dynamic power: not simply authority, but actual power; that is what is needed in the gospel. There are several ways
{331}
in which Christ is known as Son. In Luke the angel announced that He shall be called Son of God; then there is the Father's announcement at His baptism; but Paul's thought is not these, but that He was declared to be Son of God as exercising actual power. There could be no gospel unless there was actual power. The preposition in @Romans 1 indicates that power characterised the Son of God -- "in power" -- active power; expressed by "resurrection of the dead". It is a plural thought; we have many evidences of it testifying that to the utmost extremity of man's dire helplessness, the Lord could meet him, and had the power to raise him up. The Lord sent a message to John -- the "dead are raised" (@Matthew 11:5).
C.A.M. Referring to his commission (@Acts 26:22), Paul says, "Having therefore met with the help which is from God, I have stood firm unto this day, witnessing both to small and great". The idea of witnessing or confessing is what is before us.
J.T. Paul was to bear the Lord's name before "nations and kings and the sons of Israel". The steady way, against all opposition, in which Paul went on, keeping the Son of God in mind, is stressed. He preached the Son of God. The Son of God is on God's side as exercising power on the behalf of man.
A.N.W. Paul preached the Son of God among the nations. Is that in keeping with his particular line of ministry? Peter preached Christ.
J.T. Yes, he makes a distinction between his ministry and Peter's in Galatians. His mission was to the nations, and I think he had Titus at Jerusalem at that time, as an evidence of the power of his ministry. Was there anywhere a better product of the work of God than Titus?
A.R. Would it be right to say that Paul, conscious that "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", would have power in what he was saying?
{332}
J.T. Yes; and the same may be said of the revelation to Peter. The Father had made it. It is a foundational thought to Peter. The Father selected him from among the others for this. It is not, however, presented as a subject of special ministry by Peter. Peter never presents the Son of God in his ministry; though in his last letter, when speaking of the mount of transfiguration, and what happened there, he uses the title "my beloved Son". In his true levitical way, Peter refrains from the use of the appellation Son of God in his ministry. But the revelation to Paul had his ministry in view. Paul begins with this before he was actually commissioned, according to what we read in @Acts 9:20. "And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus that *he* is the Son of God." Christ was revealed to him as the Son of God; He had acquired control of his heart. Later he speaks of the Son of God as having loved him and given Himself for him. The Son of God expresses the love of God. Love is the leading feature as marking the relationship of Father and Son. The Son is peculiarly an object of faith and affection. This is seen beautifully in Paul.
A.E.H. Is this revelation of the Son of God in Paul to provide matter for testimony? I was thinking of Elihu in @Job 32:17-19. He says, "I will answer, I also in my turn, I also will shew what I know: for I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new flasks, it is ready to burst".
J.T. Yes. That bears on what we are saying. Paul is not fully commissioned in @Acts 9, as far as Scripture records, but nevertheless he preached in the synagogues, one after another, saying that Jesus is the Son of God. He must have been full of the great fact "that *he* is the Son of God". God was speaking in Him; no longer in the prophets; God was now speaking in the Son (@Hebrews 1). He was here in power, so that He raises the dead.
{333}
W.G.T. @Acts 9:22 supports what you are saying. "Saul increased the more in power". God was helping him in the matter of power.
J.T. It was a question of power -- what would be the use of preaching without power? The Lord Jesus came in power. The greatest evidence of it was that He raised dead people; not just one person, but dead persons.
A.R. That is very interesting. John says "the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that have heard shall live" (@John 5:25). Preaching the Son of God should effect that morally now.
J.T. The Lord sent the word to John the baptist in prison, saying "that dead are raised". We have to wait, of course, for actual resurrection, but that the Son of God raises the dead is the fact that is apparent. How many the Lord raised, we cannot say. We have examples. Paul alludes to it, as the Lord does. The Lord says, the "dead are raised" (@Matthew 11:5). Paul says, "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" (@Romans 1:4).
Ques. Would the Lord have that in mind in @John 9 in regard to the blind man? "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?". He reached that point very quickly.
J.T. I think the Lord had in mind the full thought of divine works. The man needed this divine touch. He had believed a good deal already; the chapter shows that he was a believing man. As the conversation of the people proceeded, he was ready for everything that came up. Every incident brought out fresh light from him, but this was one thing the Lord was concerned about in him after he was cast out -- an outcast, without any protection or support from man or man's religion. "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? And Jesus said to him, Thou hast
{334}
both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage" (@John 9:35-38). The man is finished now and ready for further service.
S.McC. Was this revelation of God's Son in Paul initial in God's taking him up, or was it subsequent?
J.T. I would say he must have got light at the start. I think that he includes all that happened, because he says in Galatians, giving an account of it, "But when God, who set me apart even from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations, immediately I took not counsel with flesh and blood, nor went I up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus". He went into Arabia, which, I think, would mean he was not seeking man's help. He was going to work out the truth in his own soul in the desert.
A.N.W. Did not Paul have a revelation inwardly? and is not the objective side of the truth seen in the expression of the centurion, "Truly this was the Son of God"? The centurion's confession looks like an historical matter. Paul preached "Jesus that *he* is the Son of God".
J.T. "Truly this was the Son of God" (@Matthew 27:54), would mean that He was that as alive here on earth. I suppose the centurion did not have the full idea of the resurrection in mind, for the resurrection was subsequent to that confession. The centurion alluded to what Christ was as a man here on earth; that He was the Son of God historically. Clearly he had light and no doubt would come to the full truth. The resurrection of Christ brings out the full truth of who He *is*. The earthquake and the things that took place immediately affected the centurion and those with him. Those that had fallen asleep coming out of their tombs would be subsequent to that; the scripture says, "going
{335}
out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many" (@Matthew 27:53). I suppose the centurion, as continuing in the light he had, would learn that the Lord not only *was*, but *is* the Son of God.
Rem. Paul "preached Jesus that *he* is the Son of God" -- he proclaimed it as a herald.
J.T. The centurion only *said* it. He referred to the fact that the Person there was the Son of God. Paul's point is that He is alive, and He raises the dead; "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead".
J.R.H. Is there any distinction between the *Father's* revelation to Peter and the revelation by *God* to Paul as stated in Galatians?
J.T. Well, to Peter it is the Christ, the Son of the living God. It is foundational, as we have said. The revelation to Paul is the Son only, and that He might be announced as glad tidings among the nations. The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. The most formal and, we may say, official presentation, of the Son is in @Romans 1:1-4: "the gospel of God ... concerning his Son ... ".
A.B. Would it be right to say that the revelation in connection with Peter is more the idea of impression, but with Paul it is rather in view of expression, in the sense of preaching and announcing?
J.T. Yes, and in power. Preaching would be in power, in keeping with the statement in Romans, declared, or marked out, Son of God in power. There is something in preaching beyond just saying things.
A.R. Some of us in preaching might convert sinners from their sins, but Paul would link them on with another world.
J.T. Yes; and in the epistle to Corinth he links up two other brothers with him in the preaching of the Son of God -- "he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus)". It is not simply that he would say things about the
{336}
Lord Jesus, but he would *preach* them. When the Lord Himself announces His own commission in @Luke 4:18, He says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me to preach to captives deliverance, and to the blind sight ...". There is power in the preaching.
Ques. In @Romans 1:9 he says, "God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son".
J.T. In that same connection he says, "I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God's power to salvation, to every one that believes" (@Romans 1:16). He is again stressing the idea of power.
A.E.H. Why does he say in @1 Corinthians 1:21, "the foolishness of the preaching"? Is that what it is in the minds of those who are unaffected by it?
J.T. It is to bring out the wisdom of God in the manner of the thing He ordained to be preached, and man's folly in refusing it. At Athens, on Mars¬ Hill, they said of Paul, "What would this chatterer say?" (@Acts 17:18). Had they ever heard him? Never could a Greek orator speak as he did; but they called it chattering, hence he says that it was "unto the Greeks foolishness" (@1 Corinthians 1:23). The preaching was such that it affected men, and converted them. Although certain ones might say his speech was contemptible, yet there was something in it that did not attach to ordinary men.
Ques. Is establishment in mind: "to him that is able to establish you, according to my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ" (@Romans 16:25)?
J.T. Yes; as hearing a brother speak in power, you are affected by it. It is not only what he says, but the power of it.
S.McC. From the preaching at Areopagus there were results, believers were secured, among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite. That was a testimony to the power there was to overcome all the objections men had been raising.
{337}
J.T. I suppose Dionysius before his conversion would represent the spirit of the place, specially linked with the institution.
Ques. What is the secret of preaching the Son of God in power?
J.T. To be full of the Son of God. As our brother was saying, like Elihu he was full, he wanted to give vent to his inward feelings -- I believe that is the idea. The Spirit of God is upon you as the anointing; that is involved in the gift of preaching. In @Acts 14:1 they so spoke that a great multitude believed. It was the way Paul and Barnabas spoke. So the lame man heard Paul *speak*, as if stress is on the speaking.
C.A.M. In reference to Paul's line, do you think this expression, "separated me from my mother's womb" is the kind of thing referred to in Jeremiah, that the vessel is sanctified by God before there is any history at all?
J.T. I think so. All his faculties would be in the divine mind in his very creation, as we might say, or before he was brought into existence; a man not only has to be born again to be for God, but his vessel has to be prepared. His physical and mental qualities are prepared beforehand. In Paul's case they were prepared in view of the great service he was called to. The Lord says Paul was an elect vessel to Him. The vessel was there before he was called. That is, God made the vessel, so he was fitted for the wonderful gifts that he received. Of course the spiritual work of God in him, and the Spirit Himself in him, would affect all this.
C.A.M. That settles a number of things. We might think we form the vessel in some sort of a way, but it is really God's creation.
J.T. I think that is important to keep in mind. If God is going to take up a man, He had him in mind before the world was, and He acts in his antecedents, so that he will be suitable for the work He gives him to do.
{338}
J.R.H. In the three accounts given of Paul's conversion, there is nothing recorded as happening between the Lord and Paul to bring His sonship into evidence. Would the word in Galatians show that it was a deep inward matter personally in the vessel?
J.T. I think so. The Lord had His part in it. He said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?". Paul says, He spoke in the Hebrew tongue. Why was that? That marked the Lord's part, showing sympathy with Saul. He says, "*I* am Jesus". But then God was there too; divine Persons were operating together. Whatever there was would become enlarged, of course. The Spirit as received, would confirm and enlarge what impressions he had. Ananias told Paul that the Lord had sent him to him, that he might see and be filled with the Holy Spirit; and in the accounts he gives of the Lord's appearing to him there is increase. That would indicate that there was increase in his apprehension of Christ as he went on.
Ques. Would you look for this power to be in evidence today in the preaching, as we speak of it? We have to humbly own there is not much.
J.T. I suppose your exercise, when you go to preach the gospel, is to go into your closet and ask the Lord for a word. You not only want a general idea as to what you should say, but you want power. The two things are distinct. In ministry there must be preparation. The angels, (@Revelation 8:6), "prepared themselves that they might sound". Paul says of himself in @1 Corinthians 9:16,23,26,27 "It is woe to me if I should not announce the glad tidings"; and again, "*I* do all things for the sake of the glad tidings, that I may be fellow-partaker with them ... *I* therefore thus run, as not uncertainly; so I combat, as not beating the air. But I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest after having preached to others I should be myself rejected". He furnishes instruction from his own attitude of mind and experiences in the service to show how the preaching of Christ is accompanied
{339}
by divine power. You do not trust in natural things, and moreover, you do not indulge your body; it is to be marked as a vessel of the Spirit. I believe the secret of power is largely in disallowing nature. I have to make room for the Spirit; so that, not only do I get an inkling from the Lord as to what I should say in the preaching, but I am dealing with myself all the time so there is power when I stand up. There is something that is not natural.
C.H.H. Is that the idea in @2 Corinthians 5:20, "We are ambassadors therefore for Christ, God as it were beseeching by us, we entreat for Christ, be reconciled to God"? And he says God had put in him the word of reconciliation.
J.T. A very real thing too. The thing was in him. That goes with what we are saying. God, he says, "was pleased to reveal his Son in me"; so that God was there. The vessel is another matter, and is needed in order that the holy matter that you have, may find an outlet in your vocal powers, and in other bodily features -- so that you convey the things fully. It is said that they marvelled at the words of grace that came out of the Lord's mouth. It is not only what is inside, but how it comes out, the latter implying the anointing.
C.A.M. What do you understand by a castaway?
J.T. One might preach and not be a true believer. The apostle stresses the need of self-judgment in the preacher, that he should control his body, holding it wholly for God and His service; that he should be equal to the work he had taken on.
A.McD. Did Jonah have to go through that -- according to what he records in the second chapter of his book? The Lord says to him afterwards, "Go to Nineveh, the great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I shall bid thee" (chapter 3:2).
J.T. Yes; typically, he was to go as a risen man. But he needed more discipline, for the element of complaint continued with him. No doubt he wrote the
{340}
book and hence we may decide that he learnt his lesson, for he records evidences of his complaining spirit. His preaching had its full effect, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!". A lone foreigner going through that great city, announcing only judgment and effecting such universal results testifies clearly to the power that was with the preacher. That his service was so successful, notwithstanding that he complained against God, is a remarkable testimony to God's patience with His servants. The sequel shows that Jonah judged himself and was adjusted.
R.W.S. Paul at Ephesus laboured daily for two years, "and God wrought no ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, so that even napkins or aprons were brought from his body and put upon the sick, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits went out" (@Acts 19:11,12). Is that an evidence of power resulting from separation, and holding the body for God in His service?
J.T. The napkins from his body effecting cures would show this. It was a sanctified body. It was kept under control.
A.N.W. Among the Corinthians, the power was manifested in outward weakness, fear and much trembling (@1 Corinthians 2:3).
J.T. The preaching was thus in demonstration of the Spirit and power.
Rem. Philip "preached the Christ" (@Acts 8), and Paul "preached Jesus that *he* is the Son of God" (@Acts 9).
J.T. There is a difference. Philip preached the Christ, who was the Anointed, the great Operator of God; that is implied in the meaning of "the Christ". The preaching of the Christ was specially suitable for the Samaritans. They were rivals of what was at Jerusalem. The Lord had said, "salvation is of the Jews"; He had made known to the woman of Samaria that He is the Christ. Then the testimony of the woman herself was, "Is not he the Christ?" (@John 4:22,29). Why should she say that? It was not simply that He had told her He was
{341}
Christ, but because He had told her all things that ever she did. She was a true preacher in that sense. She said, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done" -- that was her message. It was a question of *what He could do*; so Philip follows on with that. He preached the Christ, implying, What will He not do for you? He can do everything, as Job said of God. As distinct from this the Son of God involves *attraction*, He is the object of the affections of the believers. He is the Beloved of the Father and becomes the Beloved of the saints. He draws us out of this world into another. He stabilises us, for in Him all the promises of God are Yea and Amen.
J.B. Would Ecclesiastes help us? It speaks of "The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem" @Ecclesiastes 1:1).
J.T. Yes, there is a meaning to that word that is worth looking at. It is ' a former, or a caller together, of assemblies '. In chapter 12:11 we have a further word, "The words of the wise are as goads, and the collections of them as nails fastened in: they are given from one shepherd". If you are converted, you want to come to the assembly; you are not to be an isolated person, like some of those converted through popular preachers; they have no idea of material for an assembly, whereas the writer of this book did. To form assemblies is rightly added to the thought of preaching.
F.S. What is the difference between the lines of ministry of Peter and Paul?
J.T. We were remarking that Peter hardly uses the title *Son of God* in his ministry. You might think he would be the first to use it. In his first great sermon, why does he not? Because he is under the Lord, and is a true levite. In preaching you do not say everything you know. A man who stands up to preach is governed by the sense that he has something from the Lord for the time. Peter as a true levite knew what to say; he spoke in the power of the Spirit -- as he says in his
{342}
epistle, "by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven" (@1 Peter 1:12). He would turn to the Lord undoubtedly before he preached, and the Lord would indicate to him what to say -- through the Spirit. As he had a revelation from the Father, that Christ was the Son of God, he must have been practically under the Lord in what he was preaching, so that he did not simply say what he knew. On this same principle Paul said to those at Corinth, "I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified" (@1 Corinthians 2:2).
J.B. In @Acts 6, Stephen spoke not only with power, but with wisdom.
Rem. In regard to our brother's remark that we have such poor returns, we have to remember that the best fish are caught by a line, and that we cannot look for such large results as obtained years ago at so-called revivals.
J.T. We have to be content with outwardly small things now, nevertheless we must preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season (@2 Timothy 4:1,2). Peter was a net fisherman; and his first preaching brought in a great haul of converts; three thousand. That corresponds pretty much with what you get where his name is first mentioned in Luke. The haul was very great. In mentioning it the Spirit of God has in His mind the great truth of fellowship (@Luke 5:1-11). Two words for *partners* occur there, indicating thoughts which enter into the forming of assemblies. So in his first preaching Peter got three thousand into fellowship. "And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" (@Acts 2:42).
A.E.H. While Peter was capable of speaking to a large number as at that time, still he refers to "eight souls" being saved through water (@1 Peter 3:20).
J.T. Quite so. One of the first things we have to learn in seeking to preach, is to speak to small numbers. Many of us have had to learn that, but the small number
{343}
should not make us feel that we can get along with just anything in the way of an address. The Lord wishes us to be as earnest about six as we would be if we were preaching to a thousand. Peter speaks of Christ in Spirit preaching in the days of Noah: "In which also going he preached to the spirits which are in prison, heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water". I only refer to that because we all have to learn that if we are to speak successfully to few or many we must have power. We must not misrepresent the Lord in preaching. If we stand up to preach let us get the word and the power.
M.B. In localities where numbers are small we are tested, especially if all are saints breaking bread. I was wondering if the absence of the strangers in our room should make any difference in the power of the preaching.
J.T. What we are saying is just to meet that. We must go on with small things. It is a day of small things. The word to Zerubbabel was -- "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts" (@Zechariah 4:6). That is the thing. Even if you have no outsiders, the saints ought to be the best listeners. Get your word and your power; and you cannot get the power without keeping the body under as already remarked.
E.F. You have previously remarked that the children of the saints are the great reservoir from which we draw the material for the assembly.
J.T. Well, they are now, but we cannot say they were when Peter preached. I am sure we ought to have in mind to get others, and what we had this morning ought to help in that way. What are men saying about the Son of man? Well, the disciples knew. How did they know? They must have talked to them. They talked to other people.
{344}
A.R. If you were in a small meeting, say one having five brothers, would you say they each should take a turn in the preaching?
J.T. No one should preach unless he is sent. The fact that one is a brother is in itself no reason why he should preach. Of course, any christian may speak to people, but preaching is on the ground of being sent.
A.R. Would that be Philip's line?
J.T. That is right. He went down to Samaria and preached the Christ to them. If I do not preach well, Christ can, and the oftener I preach Him, the better preacher I become.
Rem. So there is not only the question of the buffeting of the body to secure power, but there must be the idea of *commission*.
J.T. The Lord was the *Sent One*. You must represent Him. He says, "He who receives whomsoever I shall send receives me" (@John 13:20).
W.G.T. So in @Romans 10:15 it is, "How shall they preach unless they have been sent?", and further, "How beautiful the feet of them that announce glad tidings of peace, of them that announce glad tidings of good things!". The *walk* of the preacher enters into his service.
J.T. That is right. See how the woman of @Luke 7 regarded the Lord's feet!
A.R. Paul says, "We will not boast out of measure". Does that refer to persons going where God does not send them?
J.T. Yes. As to this, the apostle could say that the Lord said to him at the outset of the work in Corinth, "I have much people in this city". It was his obligation to get those people. Hence he says to the Corinthians that he and those with him had a measure apportioned by God to "reach to you also" (@2 Corinthians 10:13). That is, he reached them spiritually. Each one proves his measure in this way. I must see what effect I have on
{345}
those to whom I preach. The preaching may not reach to them.
M.B. It says of the eunuch that he went on his way rejoicing. Is that the result of power being with Philip?
J.T. It was evidence of effective preaching. Philip preached to large numbers at a time and had results, but he is carried away by the Spirit, to go to another place. He is a subject man, a very excellent example for all in service. @Acts 8:39 shows how a real preacher is subject, ready to be sent anywhere, and finally the Spirit of God raptures him. Clearly he was pleasing to God in his service. I think facts given of the eunuch's conversion are largely to bring out the effectiveness of Philip's work.
W. Do you preach to believers as to unbelievers?
J.T. Well, discernment is needed and we must calculate, as Paul at Corinth, as to what feature of the truth is to be presented. At Lystra (@Acts 14), Paul and Barnabas so spoke that a great multitude believed. That is one thing. Now there is one man that the Spirit of God has in His mind, and that man, we are told, heard Paul speak. That is important. Thousands heard him in the ordinary sense, but that man heard him, as the sequel shows, spiritually. He discerned something in that speaking and Paul saw that he had faith. Now something for God is going to be effected. Paul has an eye on the man, and he on Paul. He has an eye on Paul, because Paul is speaking, and Paul has an eye on him because he has faith. "Rise up straight upon thy feet", Paul says, "and he sprang up and walked". We have a striking instance there of the preacher discerning his audience.
{346}
CONFESSORS OF THE SON OF GOD (3)
@John 1:19-34; @John 3:26-34
J.T. Our subject is not exactly the Son of God, but *confessors of the Son of God*, those who confess Him; alluding to the necessity of presenting in words what we hold. We may know what we believe, but we are obligated to make known what we believe. The disciples say, "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God" (@John 6:69). We previously enlarged on Peter who received the revelation from the Father, which he, no doubt, could have kept to himself, meditated upon it, and worked it out in detail in later days, but he *confessed* it. He spoke immediately, saying, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (@Matthew 16:16). The Lord had been inquiring from the disciples as to what men were *saying* about Him. The disciples knew and could tell Him, which was a point of importance. True disciples can answer such questions, which bear on the testimony. We do not need to look into worldly matters aside from the testimony; but, generally speaking, governmental matters, in the history of the world, bear on the testimony of God. The disciples could tell the Lord what men were saying about Him, then He challenges them as to what *they* themselves said.
Peter answers, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God". A plain statement of the truth, which no one else had said before. It was not his own conclusion, from what he had seen, as in the case of others, but what he received from the Father. It is a great spiritual matter. God is a spirit, and the foundation of His things must be spiritual. So that the Lord says immediately, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" (@Matthew 16:17. The
{347}
Lord immediately confirmed what He knew the Father's revelation meant, and that the assembly would be on that foundation. So that the position is clear. There is a structure here that is impregnable. The enemy at times may *seem* to go a long way, even threatening to overwhelm everything, but the Lord's word is sure, " ... hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16:18). There may be *apparent* success against it, but it will not prevail. The Lord says earlier, "Be not afraid of those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul" (@Matthew 10:28). There is a point beyond which the enemy cannot go; he may go a great way, but he cannot prevail against the assembly. It is a structure that remains, and will remain, and come out triumphantly! We have also considered Paul, to bring out that the confession of the Son of God involved the preaching. Thus the assembly and the preaching have entered into our inquiry so far -- two great ideas which run together. The structure, which is impregnable, and the preaching which is to be fully known, and marked by power. In speaking of the gospel that he preached, the apostle says of the Lord, "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" (@Romans 1:4).
John the baptist is now before us, and it was thought we should select John the evangelist's gospel, to bring out the truth confessed by John the baptist, as to the Son of God, as bearing on the last days. We shall see, I think, that John the baptist's ministry runs into christianity. The great divine testimony of the moment is christianity. There is ministry that has Israel in view, Matthew enlarges on that; it runs on beyond christianity, but John the baptist -- who is representative of Jewish ministry -- runs into christianity. That is why the passage in chapter 3 was read. John the evangelist brings out John the baptist in a very peculiar way, as bearing on his own line, namely, the Person of Christ, and eternal life. John the baptist says, "He
{348}
*was* before me". That was not a mere historic matter with John the baptist. John had a history -- a beginning -- but Jesus, as to His Person abstractly, did not. John said, "He *was* before me". The great statement in the first verse in John's gospel is, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".
A.R. John the baptist came in on the principle of witness.
J.T. The first thing recorded about John the baptist in this gospel is in chapter 1:6,7: "There was a man sent from God, his name John. He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him". That is our introduction to John the baptist here. It is a very important one, that he was sent from God, sent as on God's part. Verse 15 ought to be noted in this matter, "John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he *was* before me". The Spirit of God greatly stresses the testimony of John in this chapter.
A.R. He speaks of it definitely himself; "And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God".
J.T. Yes; he makes clear how he arrives at it, saying, "He who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit". He who sent John does not say that Jesus is the Son of God, but John's conclusion is that the One who baptises with the Holy Spirit "is the Son of God".
J.R.H. Does verse 34 show that he is conscious of the great service that had been entrusted to him?
J.T. It was not a revelation as Peter had, but the result of what John *saw*. There was a divine communication made to him, as he said, "He who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou
{349}
shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit". Why did He not say further that He was the Son of God? The Spirit of God wants us to understand that John was intelligent as to what he was doing; he does not say ' I have seen and borne witness that this is He who baptises with the Holy Spirit ', but that this One "is the Son of God". That is important as to divine things; showing that we must use our understanding, so as to arrive at a right conclusion.
F.N.W. In verses 26 and 27 we learn that John said to the messengers from the Pharisees, "In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose". Would those addressed be like the followers of the creeds today?
J.T. In the creeds, conclusions are reached *for* you, and not always right ones. True christian knowledge is what we arrive at as taught of God. The Holy Spirit helps us to reach the truth through the Scriptures. The creed has not been arrived at by the Spirit of God, who is here to guide us into all the truth (@John 16:13).
C.H.H. Is progress in the truth seen in the man in @John 9?
J.T. Yes, the man arrives at right conclusions all through. The Lord finally tells him that He is the Son of God.
A.E.H. The witness by the baptist is according to what is known in his soul.
J.T. Yes. He sees Jesus coming to him, and says, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world". As remarked, the scripture does not say that John was told that the Lord Jesus was the Son of God. When he saw Him coming to him, John can name the *movement*; which is a very important thing.
J.B. The first chapter of John commences with witness, and the last chapter finishes with it. In the
{350}
last chapter we read, "This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his witness is true" (@John 21:24).
J.T. One of the most important features of the book is the idea of competent, trustworthy witness.
A.N.W. This seems to flow out from the question put to him, "Thou, who art thou?". He emphasises the *I* as a witness all through but to deny that he was the Christ, and to bring out positively the One to whom he witnesses.
J.T. Yes, the paragraph from verse 19 to 28 tells us how John witnessed to himself. We may be called upon to witness to ourselves. No one, if he is humble in spirit, wishes to talk about himself in ministry; but if people ask you, you may be forced to give an account of yourself. What marks John the baptist as thus questioned shows that he can take *second* place.
J.R.H. It would show how much he was in the good of his own baptism.
J.T. John, the writer of the gospel, was also one who knew how to take second place; one thus ready is a very important man.
S.W.P. Is that the reason behind verse 6, "There was a man sent from God, his name John", he could fall in line with the divine arrangements?
J.T. Quite so; falling in with what there is. To take second place is specially an evidence of grace, when it is to someone ahead of you, who is not as old as you, or as long in the truth. That spirit will annihilate all rivalry among the saints.
A.R. As actuated by that spirit, I will talk of others rather than of myself. John the evangelist here talks about John the baptist.
J.T. Yes. The Jews sent from Jerusalem to inquire of the baptist as to himself. What an appeal to spiritual pride -- the greatest religious leaders recognising me!
{351}
It is striking, in ecclesiastical writings, how little recognition there is of the last one hundred years, and of the most spiritual men that have appeared throughout the whole period.
Well, here we are told that the most distinguished leaders are recognising John the baptist. He is only about thirty-three years of age, or maybe less -- quite a young man; he never reached forty. He was at an age when, ordinarily, men are impressionable to any appeals to pride. In the years from thirty to forty, servants of the Lord are very susceptible to appeals of this kind. John the baptist is proof against this; and his answers are most conclusive. First, they inquire, "Thou, who art thou?" Who said this? The priests and Levites sent from Jerusalem! They are stressing the man to himself -- you are an important man! But the passage says, "And he acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am not the Christ". That is the first answer he gives, "And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of the Lord, as said Esaias the prophet". He simply quotes the prophet and says, I am just that. It is not very much; just *voice*. Then we are told, "And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?. That is another matter. Why are you working as you are, if you are not the Christ or Elias? "John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose". That is John's witness to his questioners, who were persons ready to honour him, if he would honour them as from Jerusalem. The outward profession will take you on if you have anything
{352}
from God, provided they can use you for themselves.
W.R. The *voice* was witnessing to the Son of God?
J.T. He is belittling himself, putting himself out of sight, making everything of the Lord.
J.H -- t. Chapter 2 says, "But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man" (verses 24,25). Man as he is useless for God's testimony, so that trustworthy witness is needed.
J.T. John the baptist is thus presented in this gospel, and sets out what is needed in these last days. It is a question of putting oneself out of sight. It is not, however, saying, I am nothing, for even a *voice* is something, but it is used to bear testimony to Christ; to One who is greater; One of whom John says here, "the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose".
R.W.S. John's service is across the Jordan. He had been with God and came from God. "These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising". Is that a spiritual spot from which to serve, away from a religious centre?
A.P.T. He is a good water man.
J.T. Yes; the article he is handling speaks for itself. The Lord Jesus "came by water and blood" (@1 John 5:6).
A.R. A good water man goes down himself with the person to be baptised, as Philip went down with the eunuch.
J.B. "In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me". The Jews were blind and did not know the Lord as in their midst.
J.T. Yes, John the baptist was standing himself, you might say; he was active. "In the midst of you stands ... he who comes after me". That is an attitude ready for service, whatever God requires. He was not sitting down, or lazily occupying the time, but *standing*. John had light in his soul as to Christ. He says, "And I knew
{353}
him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit". He was divinely acquainted with the fact that something would happen to a certain Person, and he knew He was before him, but He was standing. I think the Lord was awaiting His time, the divinely appointed time, before He entered upon the levitical service. It is a question of spiritual time. The other gospels show the Lord waited until John was cast into prison, but that is not found in this gospel.
S.W.P. Do you see this power to stand in the two witnesses in @Revelation 11?
J.T. Yes, and this gospel gives us a better idea of witness than any. It is a question of what one is, and what one says, how one belittles himself, and makes much of Christ.
T.K. The Lord says," But I say unto you that Elias has already come, and they have not known him, but have done unto him whatever they would. Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer from them. Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the baptist" (@Matthew 17:12,13). The witness was seen there.
J.T. John is not saying that, though in truth, he was Elias in the character of his testimony, but literally, Elias was yet to come. The Lord may say much of you that you could not say of yourself.
Our subject, as we pursue it, ought to be accumulative. The principle established in this gospel is that however much later Christ came in, He was before all. You must begin with Him. So Peter precedes Paul in the matter of revelation, in the matter of structure and administration, but as to preaching, Paul is the ideal of the Lord; he comes first in this sense. His preaching was a confession of the Son of God. He preached in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. It is of the utmost importance in our gospel meetings that the Son of God should be stressed in them. The knowledge of the Son
{354}
of God is imperative, and the preaching is to continue according to divine appointment. Paul says, "The Lord stood with me, and gave me power, that through me the proclamation might be fully made" (@2 Timothy 4:17).
C.A.M. The ministry of the baptist would be analogous to prophetic ministry at the present time in connection with assembly matters. John comes on the scene, bringing God in, then bringing Christ in.
J.T. I think John's ministry, including what he records of the baptist, bears on the last days, and shows how things are to go on until the end, and go on in a living way. He says in chapter 20:31, "These are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name." It is *in* His name; a living, operative name. God intends that we are to go out in a living way. John the baptist is a striking figure in this gospel, and the Spirit of God brings him in as a model for christians.
Luke presents John in a remarkable way, recording that he moved at the voice of the mother of Jesus before he was born. Then his father speaks about Christ as soon as his mouth is opened. His mouth was shut for nine months because of unbelief, but as soon as it is opened he speaks about Jesus, not about John. He speaks about John at the last, "And *thou*, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways" (@Luke 1:76). John was in the deserts, we are told, until the day of his shewing to Israel (@Luke 1:80). He was shut off from natural resources, but clearly found his resource in God. John the evangelist takes that point up, saying that he was "a man sent from God"; he had been with God.
Rem. If a witness is true as sent from God souls will gravitate towards him, as towards John here.
J.T. Normally he would be recognised according to his measure, but we do not want to make any servant a centre of gravity; Christ is that.
{355}
In verse 29 John the baptist bears testimony to Jesus in a sacrificial character. He sees Jesus coming to him, and says, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world"; he sees Him coming to *him*. John the baptist was carrying on his service, but that service was baptism, figuratively the administration of death. Here is One coming to him and he names Him. The name he gives Him is a sacrificial one. It is not a diminutive thought, as in the Revelation, but the full thought. @Exodus 12 does not necessarily require a little lamb. It is a year old. A lamb a year old is, we may say, a sheep.
R.W.S. Why does he speak of Jesus as the Lamb of God? Is there something in His coming that indicates this?
J.T. It is *walk*; the movement that is named. The thought goes back to @Genesis 2 and also @Proverbs 30:29-31. In @Genesis 2 the animals were named by Adam; he would name them as he saw their movements. @Proverbs 30:29-31 speaks about the comely *going* of certain creatures. John sees the Lord Jesus coming to him. I think that is to be noted very particularly, because John, in his remarks here, is alluding to what he himself was doing; he was baptising, and that meant death, and the Lord Jesus comes to him facing all this. It is not yet actual death, but it signified it. "This is he that came by water," John tells us in his first epistle. It is suggestive of cleansing. John the baptist sees something in the Lord's movements, or visage, or His attitude as coming, that indicated this, and he was able to name it. This should be a desire with ourselves to be something spiritually that people can name.
W.G.T. Adam was tested in @Genesis 2, so here, John the baptist was being tested as to his discernment of the Lord.
J.T. Yes. Jehovah Elohim "formed every animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens, and brought them
{356}
to Man, to see what he would call them" (@Genesis 2:19). That is the test to Adam, to see if he was equal to the position; he was, and God did not alter one name that Adam gave.
E.A.L. As in God's service, John is a faithful witness.
J.T. John's speaking is of Christ, but then his service was a witness too. It was God's word for the moment to Israel. John was used of God to bring Israel outwardly into accord with the mind of God. It is a great thing to bring people into accord with the mind of God to any extent; that is what he was doing; preparing a way for the Lord. The Lord came into that. He did not inaugurate it, for He was one of the last to be baptised, and He did not come out publicly until then. Now He comes into evidence in testimony. "Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples. And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God" (verses 35,36). John *stood*. He had said, "I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God"; and now he says, "Behold the Lamb of God". Where was He going? John had nothing to do with that. It is a new thing, but John's heart is in it. The Lord had gone into baptism with the Jewish remnant. John had to do with that, and in his service he bears witness that Jesus is the Son of God.
John now *stood* and, looking on Jesus as He walked, says, "Behold the Lamb of God" (@John 1:36). John is carrying on the sacrificial thought, but it was not because Jesus is coming to him, as in verse 29. He is taking another course -- He *walked*. Where is He going? John has nothing to do with that, but he calls attention to it with the deepest interest. He is not baptising when he notices this; in principle, he is finished -- he stood. Christ is on the scene now. It is the end of John's ministry, and his disciples begin to leave him; they are attaching themselves to the One he called attention to.
Ques. How far do you think the sacrificial thought extends?
{357}
J.T. It is the complete removal of sin from the world, but it is on the basis of sacrifice. It does not take the military form here. God is not arbitrary in removing what is offensive; He has come in Himself sacrificially, and consequently everything out of accord with Him must go. Henceforth all shall stand in relation to God on the immutable basis of the finished work of Christ.
A.E.H. The sin of the world seems to be the dominance of *I* in the race; man's will and its consequences. The Lamb of God removes all that.
J.T. Think of the magnitude of the thing; what sin is in the history of the race! It is not sin in Satan that is in mind; it will never be removed from him; he will be put into the lake of fire. The history of the human race and its sin is in mind -- what a history! The Lord Jesus, viewed as the Lamb of God, comes in relation to that. In the use of the word *lamb*, the Spirit goes back to @Exodus 12; but it is in view of removing sin from the world, not only sheltering believers from judgment.
S.McC. Does the *taking away* here include His subjugating power as seen in the book of the Revelation, bringing in a world according to God?
J.T. I would say that the word ' Lamb ' in Revelation being a diminutive indicates a suffering attitude. Of course, Christ is also seen in Revelation in judicial and military aspects, actively and finally, but I am speaking of Him in His Lamb character. The baptist does not go beyond stating that He takes away the sin of the world; it is the greatness of the Person viewed sacrificially; He does *such* a work.
W.G.T. The thought of the Lamb of God begins before He was on the cross.
J.T. It began as He took a body. "Wherefore coming into the world he says, Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared me a body" (@Hebrews 10:5). He *came* by water and blood, (@1 John 5:6).
{358}
He came into the world sacrificially, and John is intelligent enough to see that by His movements.
C.H.H. What is the force of *taking away* the sin of the world?
J.T. Sacrifice is the basis, but the whole thing must go, for it is intolerable to God.
Ques. Does it not imply that sin is removed out of the way so that divine love can now move actively and freely?
J.T. That is what has followed the work of redemption, as the book of Acts shows, but this would go to the limit of the *removal of sin from the world*. The Spirit of God says, "He was in the world, and the world had its being through him, and the world knew him not" (@John 1:10. What it must have been to Jesus to find that condition there! The world of @Genesis 1-2 involved His creative glory, and hence as sin had come in, there was need of redemption; this enters into John's statement. This is greater even than the glory He acquired in creation. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal" (@John 3:16). I would say that *world* there is abstract. The word in @John 1:29 and 3:16 signifies what is ordered and ornamental, and although it has become defiled by sin, it retains its place in the mind of God: He would have that restored. It will be set up again on the basis of redemption.
A.N.W. Would it be connected with "*he* is the propitiation for our sins; but not for ours alone, but also for the whole world"? (@1 John 2:2).
J.T. That is the basis, of course, but the taking away of the sin of the world means its entire removal from its place in the world. It has universal application, and is not limited to what is presented in the gospel for the individual now on the principle of faith. Clearance of sin entirely out of the world is in view.
{359}
J.R.H. Is the taking away of the sin of the world the negative side and the positive in the baptising of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. The baptising of the Holy Spirit is displacement. The final millennial idea is worked out now in the christian. Sin is steadily displaced. According to the teaching of @Romans 8:23, we are awaiting adoption, that is the redemption of the body. The body will be relieved finally, so that every trace of sin will be gone. As a believer is raised from the dead, there is no sin left. That is in principle what the world is coming to -- no sin left.
A.R. The earth came under the curse as the result of sin. The Lord removes that in His death.
J.T. It is blessed on the basis of sacrifice. This is the One who is to do it. He is not coming here militarily, as He is in @Revelation 19. He is coming in sacrificially. The military side must come in eventually, but not now.
Rem. Does it correspond with @Isaiah 53:7-12, "He was led as a lamb to the slaughter ... he bore the sin of many"?
J.T. Yes. What our brother was saying is very important. The Lamb *stands* as slain, (@Revelation 5:6); that is, He is raised! In @Revelation 19:11-16 He comes in militarily; He comes out of heaven riding on a white horse; "his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which are in the heaven followed him upon white horses, clad in white, pure, fine linen". Then later John says, "I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and the false prophet that was with him, who wrought the signs before him by which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast, and those that worship his image. Alive were both cast into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone; and the rest were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which goes out of his mouth; and all the birds were filled with their flesh" (verses 19-21). That speaks of the actual

carrying out in a military way of what is set forth in the Lamb of God, the Taker-away of the sin of the world. The Lamb is the great, precious thought of God and sets forth the lowly place the Lord took to be a sacrifice, to settle the sin question -- to take away the sin of the world -- "once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for the putting away of sin by his sacrifice" (@Hebrews 9:26).

CONFESSORS OF THE SON OF GOD (4)
@John 1:44-51; @John 11:20-27
J.T. Some further remarks as to John the baptist are needed to complete our subject as seen in him. In chapter 3:26-28 we read, "They came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, *he* baptises, and all come to him. John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven. Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him". John had changed his place of service, being now at Aenon, but the Lord, as rejected by the Jews, in chapter 10:39-42, went back to the place where John baptised at first. "They sought therefore again to take him; and he went away from out of their hand and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptized at the first; and he abode there. And many came to him, and said, John did no sign; but all things which John said of this man were true. And many believed on him there". The Lord seems to have ignored Aenon in going to the place where John had been baptising at first, and the truth comes out clearly; "John did no sign, but all things which John said of this man were true". What is said in John 3:25,26 suggests deterioration in the Baptist's disciples, but chapter 10 shows that his position is perfectly clear. He was a true witness, "And many believed ... there". It is to show that, in our day, when there is decline in public service, as we return to first principles the testimony becomes clear, and persons believing are of quality; many believed on him *there*.
R.W.S. So that nothing is really lost.
J.T. John's position is clear. In the end of chapter 3, he renders a most striking testimony to Christ. "*He* must increase, but *I* must decrease. He who comes
{362}
from above is above all. He who has his origin in the earth is of the earth, and speaks as of the earth. He who comes out of heaven is above all, and what he has seen and has heard, this he testifies; and no one receives his testimony. He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true; for he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives not the Spirit by measure" (verses 30-34). John there is on the platform of christianity, and sees the Spirit given without measure. He had seen the Spirit coming on Christ in the form of a dove: it was the Spirit, not in part, but *wholly*. It was by this sign that he was to apprehend the Lord's Person (chapter 1:33).
A.N.W. Verses 35 and 36 of @John 3 would be said by John the evangelist himself.
J.T. I think so. The verses state what is infinitely suitable at this point. They present the blessed economy into which the divine Persons have come in this wonderful dispensation.
R.W.S. In spite of deterioration in John's disciples, when Paul came to Ephesus there were some there who had been affected by John's words, even though a long time had elapsed (@Acts 19).
J.T. John's baptism continued, but it became a source of weakness, I think. These men believed in the baptism of John, but then they did not have the Holy Spirit. How can we get on in christianity without the Holy Spirit? One great feature of John's ministry was that there is One who baptises with the Holy Spirit. John saw the Spirit come on Jesus, and he had been divinely told beforehand that the One on whom the Spirit descended and abode is the One who baptises with the Holy Spirit. Thus the men at Ephesus were defective even as to John's testimony.
W.G.T. The baptism with the Holy Spirit seems to be loosely allied with the Spirit descending upon Christ as a dove, "he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".
{363}
J.T. The Spirit came upon Him in Its own distinctiveness, but seen as a dove. The baptism of believers is not by the Spirit seen as a dove, but according to @Acts 2 there appeared cloven tongues of fire, and the Spirit sat on each of them; there is fire connected with it. The twelve men at Ephesus had not gone the whole length of John's baptism, because John spoke of One who would not only take away the sin of the world, but who baptises with the Holy Spirit. There is no christianity without the Holy Spirit, and in full measure. The Spirit is given without measure, He is here. No one should be without Him. If one is a follower of John, he should go that length.
A.R. The Holy Spirit is received in view of our being merged into the body of Christ.
J.T. That would be the thing nearest the heart of Christ -- the bride. John was the friend of the Bridegroom; his ministry was not to secure her for Christ, but he certainly would not come short in entering into the Lord's desire as to the bride. Paul took this up, and he had it in mind when speaking to the twelve men, in that very place where the truth of the assembly in a special way was to be developed -- Ephesus. Paul asked them, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" (@Acts 19:2) That was a needed question. The possession of the Spirit is absolutely essential to the truth of christianity and of the assembly.
J.H. Did John's baptism have something to do with the quality of the work there at Ephesus?
J.T. I should say so. John's baptism bore in the right direction. The men were good material, as not sectarian, and they were ready for the whole truth, and came into it as presented to them by Paul. They became part of the assembly, the bride of Christ. Apollos did not seem to miss the Holy Spirit. He was able to speak in great power to the Jews, but there was something in what he was saying that was not just accurate. Aquila and Priscilla saw that. There is no question raised as
{364}
to Apollos having the Holy Spirit, because he represents an independent work of God, not simply John's ministry. It was a work in which Paul had no part, and yet Apollos was a great contribution to the ministry. John's baptism certainly worked well there, but, as remarked, Apollos had gone further.
Now what is to be observed in regard of Nathanael in @John 1, is that in this section the Lord introduces the request, "Come and see". He says first, "What seek ye?" and they say, "Rabbi, where abidest thou?" He says, "Come and see". Later when Nathanael says, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth, Philip says to him, Come and see". This feature in John raises the question, from a practical point of view, as to what there is in each of us to see, and in the localities in which we are. It is what is to be *seen* that leads to this confession of Nathanael.
A.E.H. What you have been saying implies a sort of environment into which Nathanael and Martha come. It is very apparent if we look at the world as it is, that we must have a new world in the Son of God, involving an environment provided for us.
J.T. Yes. The new world is in the baptism of the Holy Spirit and in Jesus walking still sacrificially. His sacrificial service is now considered. "Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples. And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God" (verses 35,36). The Lord has the assembly in mind, and He is walking without saying where He is going, but He is very attractive. The two disciples heard John speak of Him evidently with admiration.
A.R. We are able to understand a brother's ministry more readily if he admires Christ.
J.T. It comes out in the way he speaks of the Lord. John must have been full when he said, "Behold the Lamb of God. And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus". A new world had opened up, and the Person who is the centre of it is very attractive.
{365}
The person who calls attention to Him is not following; he is standing in his own position, not intended for christianity. The Lord is walking; John is standing; and these two disciples move, and they say to the Lord, "Rabbi", and the Spirit of God says, that means *teacher*. It is not merely a term of respect, it means *teacher*. It means that in this new world we need to be taught. Christians generally are suffering from want of teaching.
W.G.T. These persons followed the Lord instinctively. They were not told by the Lord to follow Him.
J.T. The word of John directed them to Him and they moved toward Him. The gathering of the assembly is indicated in what immediately follows; and then the gathering of the Jewish remnant in the section we read; but the same principle governs: it is not only that Christ is attractive, but He has people directing others to Him.
S.McC. As to those forming the assembly is not the Lord's attitude testing? "Jesus looking at him" -- the word literally meaning "looking carefully".
J.T. It is searching, because He looks at each of us. I suppose He would look at Peter affectionately. Peter alludes to this later, using the word for objective knowledge in @John 21:17, thus indicating that there was something in him *manifestly* that showed he loved the Lord. Here the Lord names him as looking carefully at him. "Thou shalt be called Cephas". He does not call him that, but says, "Thou shalt be called". It is prophetic, but evidently based on what the Lord saw. The stone or stable character would be fully seen later.
C.H.H. These circumstances and persons in @John 1 serve to bring out the various glories of Christ. There are thirteen titles of Christ in this chapter. I wondered if these would form a basis for developments in the subsequent part of John.
J.T. They do. There is no chapter so rich in titles of Christ as @John 1. The Lord is seen working by the
{366}
day, and we may say the greatest result of this day was Cephas. The first two were directed to Him by John's word; Andrew finds Simon and led him to Jesus, and the Lord names him Cephas, meaning that the assembly is in His mind.
C.A.M. Do the results of the Lord's movements here go on to chapter 11, and after that you have an objective reached?
J.T. Chapter 12 is the result. The "sons of light" are in mind throughout the book. "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light" (@John 12:36). That finishes one section of the book. The allusion would be to the stars, and in the beginning of chapter 12 we have in Bethany a constellation; from there we go on to chapter 20, which is the full heavenly position. Bethany does not go on to the heavenly side, it is what is effected down here in the way of light. It was a practical testimony in Israel. This paragraph in @John 1, verses 35-42, brings out Cephas, implying that the assembly is in the Lord's mind, as I said. The invitation, "Come and see", enters into it.
Then again in verse 43, we have, "On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee, and Jesus finds Philip, and says to him, Follow me". The Lord finds him, and Philip finds Nathanael, so that movement is on. Firstly, gathering for the assembly; secondly, the Jewish position in Nathanael.
F.C. There are two sections to the first day, "On the morrow" (verse 29), and "again, on the morrow" (verse 35). On the second day and the third day, there is only one incident recorded on each.
J.T. "Again, on the morrow" (verse 35), would link John the baptist sympathetically with the new thing, the assembly, which is also seen at the end of chapter 3, to which we have referred. Verses 35-42 are very full. You can understand how much glory enters into the assembly position; the time being lengthened out for
{367}
1900 years. As to the days here, they run on to "the third day" (chapter 2:1). The first, the assembly -- Cephas; the second, Israel seen in the Jewish remnant; the third, the millennium. The record from verse 35 to verse 42 is regarded as a second part of the first day. John in a sense had a day of his own, but it entered into Christ's day. Verse 35 seems to begin the three days viewed in relation to testimony and gathering. Verses 29 to 34 are preliminary and foundational to all this, hence the record is separate.
J.B. In Luke's gospel, he appeared to Simon (chapter 24:34), but Paul says He appeared to Cephas (@1 Corinthians 15:5).
J.T. Luke in that instance has reference to *grace*; Peter had recently denied the Lord. Paul is not thinking of that in referring to Cephas; he is not referring to grace, it is simply the number of appearings. The fact that He appeared to Cephas, meaning stone, in Paul's mind, would mean that the Lord was thinking of the assembly.
Now we must go on to Nathanael; he is our subject. Philip finds him and says to him, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth". Who are the "we"? Nathanael does not enquire; he is not yet interested enough to do so. He says, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" He was a neighbour, he must have had some local feeling about Nazareth; Cana of Galilee was not far away.
W.G.T. Philip linked on with the others the Lord had already secured, in using the plural pronoun, "we".
J.T. No doubt. He says, "We have found him". The Lord found *him*; he must have turned the matter around and said, It is wonderful, the Lord found me, but I have found Him.
S.W.P. Have we to find Him, before we can find a brother?
{368}
J.T. I think so. If you do not find the Lord first, what have you to call attention to? That is the point, "Come and see" -- what have I in myself, in my house, in the meeting I attend? That is how the truth works out.
W.R. How do you account for the qualities already in Nathanael; qualities such as were found in the Lord Jesus Himself? "Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile".
J.T. The Lord does not say that until He sees him coming to Him. He says later, "Before ... when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee". There was no movement then, but now there is movement toward Christ; that attests the work, and gives distinction. As moving spiritually, one is divinely designated.
R.W.S. In our own case, does it work out as informally as this? Does it involve inviting persons to the reading meetings or the preachings?
J.T. Well, quite: All that is a test for us. What is there to see in oneself, in one's family, or in the local meeting?
R.W.S. Sometimes we hesitate to invite strangers when a certain brother preaches. The incentive to ask your neighbours and friends is when there is a good preacher.
J.T. It is not only the preacher, but the people there listening -- the saints of the place; whatever results there may be present of the work of God. Philip's use of the word *found* is to be noted: "We have found", he said; whereas, *really*, the Lord found him; but he is using the word *found* from his own side, which means that he had found something in Christ worth looking at.
C.A.M. Every true Israelite is looking for something of Christ.
J.T. God had been working with him; although he was but little exercised at first, the germ of the thing was there. The Lord had seen him before Philip called him.
{369}
C.A.M. It almost looks as if he had been reading @Psalm 2.
J.T. It is evident that he *had* read it.
A.R. Coming to a meeting like this, it is not only what you hear, but what you *see* in the faces of those present.
J.T. If the Lord has His place, you see something of profound interest -- the results of the work of God.
A.R. That helps you to understand what you hear.
Rem. Nathanael does not respond to what Philip said at first: "Of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets"; but later he says, "Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel".
J.T. The Lord had spoken to him in the meantime. "Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel". On what is he basing his remarks? That the Lord saw him when he was under the fig tree, before Philip called him. What went on in his mind? We have to search that out. What was in his mind when he said to the Lord, "Thou art the Son of God"; it was not very much for the Lord to say, "When thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee". Did He see him in the distance, or only as a divine Person could see him? Why was he so affected by the Lord seeing him before? Did it imply his inward power of contemplation and thought? Is it not a great matter to be able to take in things and look over them quickly, deducing something from them? Take the present moment, several are speaking in this meeting, something comes into my soul. I come to a conclusion at once; that is, if I am spiritually energetic; and God helps me to lay hold of the truth that is coming out. I do not take a long time to understand a point.
{370}
W.G.T. The spiritual would therefore be greater than the historical. Nathanael's impressions as hearing Christ speak to him were more spiritual than those formed by Philip's historical references.
J.T. The Spirit of God is bringing before us his remarkable formation. He could come to a conclusion quickly, and convey what he had arrived at quickly: "Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel". Whether he had just read @Psalm 2, or some time since, we do not know; perhaps he had read it many times, and was waiting for the Person of whom the Spirit of God spoke; this is to be considered. It is a wonderful psalm, it speaks of personal, rather than moral qualities. "Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee: ... Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, though his anger burn but a little. Blessed are all who have their trust in him" (verses 7,12). The Lord says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these". "Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man." It is the first time you get this great characteristic of John, "Verily, verily". This man is to be assured that these things are so, and there are great things to follow. Our minds are very small, our motives are small. One knows that in oneself, whereas, as having the Spirit, we should be equal for great things. Christians at the outset were speaking "the great things of God" (@Acts 2:11).
A.R. The *ye* includes not only Nathanael, but others.
J.T. Yes; he is associated with others now. Philip had said *we*, now the Lord says *ye*, as if Nathanael is not to be alone any more. Every lover of Christ does not want to be alone, but sees things with the brethren, he wishes to be with the brethren; that enters into these meetings. We get more in the meetings than in our own private rooms.
J.R.H. Merging with the brethren, Nathanael is
{371}
thus out of sight.
J.T. Christianity is a great collective idea.
S.W.P. Why does the Lord speak about the *heaven opened*. "Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man."
J.T. He refers to @Genesis 28. It is not Jacob now, it is the Son of man and the angels of God ascending and descending on Him. It is now a great Person and "greater things".
A.R. He is the centre really, it is the universal matter.
J.T. Think of the connection here and compare with @Genesis 28! God stood above in the heavens, the ladder reaching thither. The angels were ascending and descending on a ladder in Genesis; now they are ascending and descending on the Son of man. The angels began with *Him*.
R.W.S. Nathanael in his reference to the Lord Jesus had distinctive features of the Son of God in his mind.
J.T. The rapidity with which the truth comes into his mind is to be noticed. We are living in strenuous times, how many of us have much time to meditate? Many of us have to learn the great things of God standing up in a crowded underground train. You marvel at some men whose spiritual education and service were great. Take Moses, writing books and governing Israel, sitting all day answering questions! Think of David, a great king, subduer of many nations, who wrote many psalms! Solomon, another great king, ruled an empire, built the temple and many other great structures; he spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spoke of all trees, cattle also, fowls, creeping things and fishes. And there came of all peoples of the earth to hear his wisdom. In the light of these great lives, of men of like passions as ourselves, we have no reason to complain
{372}
of the work we may have to do.
A.N.W. The Lord remarks on Nathanael's belief: "Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou?" His confession was the result of belief.
J.T. That is the point. The Spirit of God in John's gospel lays great emphasis on *faith*, that is, on those marked by it.
J.H.Jr. The matter of seeing is much emphasised here. The Lord says, "Thou shalt *see* greater things".
J.T. Then the Lord widens out in His remarks to Nathanael and says, "ye shall see" -- it is the plural now. "Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man". That must enter into christianity as well as the future, as we are to understand it. We must not be too specific as to how this happens; manifestly it is Christ everything and in all. Stephen saw the heavens opened, and the epistle to the Hebrews shows the heavens are open to faith; we see Jesus there (chapter 2:9).
{373}
CONFESSORS OF THE SON OF GOD (5)
@John 11:1-6, 17-27; @John 9:1-12, 24-31
J.T. It is thought that Martha's confession of Christ as the Son of God links with Nathanael's who was designated by the Lord as an *Israelite indeed*. The group at Bethany, composed of Mary, Martha and Lazarus, are to be viewed in relation to Israel -- the remnant, and thus they link with Nathanael. Those at Bethany, however, are in the relation of a family -- a brother and two sisters, loved of Jesus. It is thought that we should bear in mind that love dominates this particular phase of our subject. The Lord says, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it". It is *for the glory of God*. Notice it is said *that the Son*, not *and* that the Son of God may be glorified by it, and then the Spirit adds, "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus"; the glory of the Son of God is the point, and that necessitates love. The scene brings out the love of Christ, the love of the Son of God; we should keep this in mind.
A.P.T. Persons who have been brought before us so far are masculine, but we now have what is feminine.
Rem. The brother has to die in order to bring this light into the sister's soul.
J.T. He goes through the actual experience of death in order to bring out the glory of the Son of God. In the interim between his death and his resurrection in which the glory is seen, the truth is confessed by Martha. She says, "I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world". She speaks of Him, not simply as one who is able to raise the dead, or who can do things, but He who came into the world. Jacob said, "I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah" (@Genesis 49:18). The promised Seed spoken of in @Genesis 3 is referred to in various
{374}
ways throughout the Scriptures. Evidently Martha had this particularly in mind, that He "should come". Evidently she had light; she said to the Lord, "If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died", meaning that He would keep him from dying. Then she says, "But even now I know, that whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee". She had in mind that God would do things for Jesus, and that He could have kept her brother from dying. Probably, in her mind, she would be assured that, if Jesus were to pray to God to keep Lazarus from dying, he could not have died. This does not place the Lord on a very high level, because creatures may do that. We may, by prayer, save a man, as James says, "and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up" (@James 5:15). The Lord says, "Thy brother shall rise again. Martha says to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day". Apparently, she knew something about Scripture; she was orthodox. The Lord immediately said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he that believes on me, though he have died, shall live". She then makes a confession of faith, showing that she must have taken in the truth and believed very quickly.
A.N.W. She makes the confession before receiving her brother back, showing that it resulted from what the Lord said to her.
J.T. She received the truth in her soul through His word. She received His testimony (@John 3:33). The Lord challenged her, "Believest thou this?" It is all He says. She says, "Yea, Lord". That is very definite. "I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God". Clearly, she has taken in the truth.
A.E.H. The death of the brother seems to help her to clearly apprehend the glory of the Son of God.
J.T. The Lord remaining two days in the place where He was allowed for Lazarus to die. The sisters sent to Jesus saying, "He whom thou lovest is sick".
{375}
The Lord had in mind that he should die; saying, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When therefore he heard, He is sick, he remained two days then in the place where he was". Lazarus¬ death must be regarded as taking place in the ordinary course of God's dealings; the Lord did not hinder it, He remained away, it was deliberate.
A.P.T. According to the note, the word used for *lovest* in verse 4 is "the love of friendship", but when the Spirit says, "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus", the word is said to convey the settled disposition of the person (necessarily resulting in activity), rather than as an emotion.
J.T. What was said at the beginning should be kept in mind, that this is a love matter. "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it". This involves the working out of love. The whole passage shows how love actuated the Lord. It was an established, continuous love, not one that had just sprung up; He had loved them. It is to bring out, I think, the durability and reliability of love in the Lord's relations with us as a family, and this enters into all that we are suffering now, both in this country and elsewhere. The Lord's love will go through to the end -- to the utmost limit in relieving us.
A.P.T. It is His settled disposition toward us. We are the Lord's loved ones.
J.T. That is what it means. There is no change in Him. If there is any change, it would be in us and this may call for discipline. "*I* rebuke and discipline as many as I love" (@Revelation 3:19).
A.N.W. That "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand", is not exactly apparent today.
{376}
J.T. It may not look like it publicly, but it will come out incontestably, and even the results of the present sorrow will prove it. It is a love matter in regard of the family of God, and it will develop into the glory of the Son of God; "that the Son of God may be glorified by it".
A.P.T. What He is, as He says, "I am the resurrection", enters into His love.
J.T. Everything that He is and has is subservient to His love. He exercises His power in love to us. The testimony here is, "Behold how he loved him!"
A.R. The Lord says in verse 11, "Lazarus, our friend, is fallen asleep". Is that the way to look upon the saints who have died -- as fallen asleep?
J.T. That is the tenderest way to refer to death. A common expression used is very objectionable to me -- *So and so passed away*. There is no affection in that. Scriptural expressions are "fallen asleep", "fallen asleep through Jesus", "died in the Lord", "dead in Christ".
R.W.S. The disciples seemed not to understand the Lord when He said "Lazarus ... is fallen asleep". He is obliged to speak plainly to them.
J.T. You get that in John. He has to come down to their level of understanding. He says to them plainly, "Lazarus has died". It is clear that Martha is a learner. She shows that she is capable of learning and learning quickly, and confessing what she is learning. Luke leaves her as complaining of her sister, but John would bring out what was there. John would make much of the work of God, however small. See how he leaves Nicodemus; and how he records Thomas¬ profession in our chapter (verse 16).
J.W.D. Do you say that Martha's quick apprehension of the truth and confession of the Son of God is connected with the durability of Christ's love?
J.T. That is the teaching. The fact that He loved them is stated at the outset. Jesus said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the
{377}
Son of God may be glorified by it. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus".
A.N.W. How did she come to make her confession before the glorification of Christ?
J.T. Because she is a learner; in this gospel the saints are said to be all taught of God. Martha learns quickly and directly from the Lord; and then she stated what she apprehended. He drew it out of her. "Believest thou this? She says to him, Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world".
J.W.D. It is a sister speaking; I was thinking that sisters might develop more in spirituality if they *spoke* more of the actual truth learned.
J.T. Your exercise is, of course, that they should speak of divine things. Anna spoke of Him "to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem".
J.W.D. Brothers speak and preach. A great deal comes into our souls in this way. Here is a sister who is actually using words to express her apprehension of the Son of God.
J.T. The Spirit of God teaches us on that point. Luke is concerned about public order, and he records, in chapter 7, the incident at Nain. A dead man was carried out and the Lord says, "Youth, I say to thee, Wake up. And the dead sat up and began to speak". Luke would show us that he is to be a true brother in the meeting, a priest. The silent brother is in the way really. The Spirit of God does not contemplate that brothers should be permanently in the assembly and not speak to God, or to the saints. The daughter of Jairus, also raised up by the Lord, *walked* -- "immediately the damsel arose and walked, for she was twelve years old" (Mark 5:42). So that walk is the point with the sisters, and speaking with the brothers; but then the sisters are to *learn* in the assembly. They are to be in the assembly, but not to
{378}
say anything in it; if they have to say anything, let them say it to their husbands at home.
Rem. You would encourage sisters when together themselves to speak about the things of God.
J.T. Yes. Look at the group at Joppa. The *Dorcas* meetings, so called, are the outcome of that situation; and what do they say at such meetings? It is most unlikely that they bring up spiritual subjects. They would be speaking about the garments; the cut, and the pattern, the material. They showed Peter the garments, but he put them all out; this indicates that they were not spiritual.
W.G.T. Philip had four daughters, who are said to have prophesied.
J.T. They did service in that they prophesied; but it would not be in the assembly.
S.McC. The opening chapters of Luke give us a good example of godly conversation between sisters in the house of Zacharias.
J.T. Mary went to the hill country of Judah. She got her communication from Gabriel and went to the hill country to Elizabeth, and when the salutation of Mary sounded in the ears of her kinswoman, the unborn babe of the latter leaped with joy. It was a highly spiritual matter, and their conversation was spiritual. Why should sisters not speak on a spiritual level? It is their disadvantage if they do not.
S.W.P. One has heard it said that if one does not understand the conversation and the spiritual communications, one must leave it. Martha is not content to leave this matter; she goes to meet Jesus.
J.T. That is to her credit. The Lord is ready for her. He had foreseen, of course, all this. Mary sits still in the house, and we have to tax our spirituality to understand this. Why did Mary stay in the house? Why did Martha leave the house? She went outside the town to meet Him. I think the Lord honoured
{379}
Martha in that He remained *where she met Him*; He did not *yet* go into the town. Mary came *there* (verse 30).
A.E.H. Did I understand you to say that as we advance in spirituality we are able to go on further in cases of difficulty than if we were merely occupied with public order?
J.T. Yes. I think we should be prepared to go on with persons to secure them for eternity. If there is a work of God we want to nurture it, because what God has done is done forever.
A.R. In chapter 12, Martha is serving. "There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served" (@John 12:2).
J.T. Martha is our concern now, as to how she came to make this confession in verse 27, and what part it occupies in the glory of the Son of God. What we are speaking about is most important. She is learning. She is a sister with not a very good history; she had complained about the Lord Himself when He was in her house, and also about her sister. That is how Luke leaves her, but John would say this sister has continued learning; so that we must not be impatient. Martha is a very unlikely sister according to Luke's presentation, but according to John, she is able to make a good confession of the truth of the Son of God.
Let us look at the instruction Martha got. First, the Lord says to her, "Thy brother shall rise again", and then, "I am the resurrection and the life: he that believes on me, though he have died, shall live". *That covers all the dead in Christ*. He is "marked out Son of God in power ... by resurrection of the dead" (@Romans 1:4). Although they have died, they shall live. Then He says to her, "and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die". That includes ourselves. That is, if we are alive at the coming of the Lord, we shall be changed and never enter into death at all. What He says to Martha really involves the whole truth of resurrection.
{380}
A.T. Would you say that Lazarus was secured for the testimony, and Mary, and perhaps not Martha?
J.T. She *is*. She is making a good confession now. Luke does not credit her with that, but, as we were remarking, we must never abandon a sister or brother. We see her at the end of @Luke 10, and in the beginning of chapter 11, the Lord is seen praying. May we not say that He is praying for Martha? He had just been to her house and had to rebuke her. He is praying at a certain place and a disciple says, "Lord, teach us to pray" (@Luke 11:1). Then He says, "When ye pray, say, Father", and He says finally in verse 13, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" The whole teaching there is morally connected with Martha and her house. He had just had to do with her; hence the passage may be linked with what is before us now in @John 11. It says of her that she came out of the town to meet Him.
S.McC. After Martha's confession of the Son of God she went away and called her sister Mary secretly.
J.T. She is a true sister here. At first, in Luke, she is seen as owning a house and receiving the Lord into it, but she criticised Him, and she was unfair to Mary. Now she is a learner; there is interest in the Lord and assurance with her that if He had been there before the death of her brother, it would not have taken place, and that even now God might act in answer to His prayer. Now, after receiving light from Christ, and expressing it, she goes off to her sister secretly, saying to her, "The teacher is come and calls thee". There is no secret boasting, or saying, I had the honour of seeing the Lord first. No. "The teacher ... calls thee" -- a very beautiful link is now manifest between these two sisters.
J.H. It is the working of love, as she had learned it from Christ.
{381}
J.T. Exactly. She is making much of the sister now.
Rem. Luke shows us Mary as a learner, but John shows us, Martha thus.
J.T. They both have the features of a sister; and are on good terms.
J.H. Do you think the apostle's word to Euodia and Syntyche would bear on what is before us (@Philippians 4:2)?
J.T. It does. They were to be of the same mind in the Lord. We should not give up abruptly a failing one. John's ministry is largely a question of life, and life begins down in the ground, speaking agriculturally; it is a question of roots -- getting at things secretly. People do not always come out openly and say that they are wrong, but presently, whilst they do not say much, you see that they are in principle right; their instincts are right, and if they are, then make the most of them. Martha has confidence now in the Lord and moves in love toward her sister; and although she later calls attention to the time Lazarus had been in the tomb, she is subject. In chapter 10:24, we read that "The Jews ... surrounded him, and said to him, Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense?". Martha is not of that mind. The Lord did not say to her that He was the Christ, but she deduced it from what He was saying. That shows a true learner, one who can express in words the impressions received.
The whole position is becoming clearer; and as we go on to the Lord's act of raising the dead, we see how Martha will learn from that. "Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he stinks already, for he is four days there" (verse 39). She still needs to learn: although she had made the confession as to Christ she did not *fully* enter into it in her soul. This is evident in her suggestion that her brother has been dead too long to be raised. Though he were dead a thousand years, the Lord could raise him. The Lord says, "Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou
{382}
shouldest see the glory of God?" (verse 40). We often make confessions, but are not equal to what they mean. The Lord would bring Martha into it; saying to her, "If thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God". We must go on with our confessions and let them work out fully.
C.H.H. Would that suggest that our light may be ahead of our state, as it was with Peter?
J.T. Yes. So that if we make a confession, the next thing is the exercise needed to maintain ourselves in it.
A.R. Time tests us as to the truth we profess to hold. The Thessalonians were tested by time.
J.T. They were wrong on two points: the resurrection; that is, as to whether those who had fallen asleep have part in it; and also as to the day of the Lord. Whilst we may make a good start, we may have difficulties later on. Martha comes, however, into this scene of glory. The Lord had started the idea in love, and it finishes gloriously. He brings the Father into it in a striking way, so that they may not miss anything. "They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifted up his eyes on high and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me; but I knew that thou always hearest me; but on account of the crowd who stand around I have said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me" (verses 41,42). The Lord has in mind that there should be *faith*; and He speaks for the gain of those standing around. The Lord said earlier, in verse 15, "I rejoice on your account that I was not there, in order that ye may believe." The point now is *believing*, coming into the realm of glory through faith.
R.W.S. Mere orthodoxy has no place in it.
J.T. Not at all. The need is of *believing*. The Lord says to His disciples in @John 16:31, "Do ye now believe?" Without faith, we must remain outside all this. Martha stands out here as the believer. She is the one the Lord selects to bring out this principle
{383}
in the scene of glory. The principle of laying hold of the truth through faith and confessing it.
A.E.H. Is she an illustration of "God's dispensation, which is in faith" (@1 Timothy 1:4)?
J.T. Yes; and it is a sister's faith. It is a leading part of the faith once delivered to the saints. She gets the truth immediately and confesses immediately; and in the next chapter she is seen at table, serving.
A.R. Would the man in @John 9 having his eyes opened, also illustrate faith?
J.T. Yes. That is the final thought we have in mind. Chapter 9 brings out the idea that everyone of us is taken up, not in relation to governmental difficulties in us, but *sovereignly*. Every believer is taken up sovereignly. "Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him". Whatever I may be, if I am a believer I am taken up sovereignly, because God is going to display His works in me.
Rem. This is a marvellous action of God -- to disregard for the moment the man's sinful history and deal with him in a primary way to manifest His works in him.
J.T. It is very instructive to thus see the bearing of this chapter.
W.R. It would be what the Lord saw in him inwardly.
J.T. Yes. It is that the works of God may be manifested in him -- operating so that they can be seen. God is doing something with him.
F.C. Is that why Paul says in @Ephesians 2:10, "For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God has before prepared that we should walk in them"?
J.T. It is quite in keeping with Ephesians.
A.R. The disciples say, "Rabbi", which means "teacher". There was a new lesson to learn; that
{384}
God operates sovereignly and we have no right to question it.
J.T. The Lord evidently saw the man first. They did not bring the man to Him. He saw him. It is a question of the sovereignty of God. That is the whole position really.
J.W.D. Why is it plural -- "works"?
J.T. In our readings here, every confessor of the Son of God has been seen as setting forth some feature of the truth, but God has in mind to set out the whole of the truth in this man. The Lord made His own selection of this man, who was capable of great things.
Rem. The Lord has rights in the assembly. Ananias has to come into that in relation to Paul.
J.T. The Lord selected Saul, and said of him, "This man is an elect vessel to me" (@Acts 9:15).
F.C. "He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle." How do you understand that?
J.T. Well, "Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him. I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes". This is the preface of the chapter. It is a very extraordinary case. "Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes". Surely you might say that the inner being of the blessed Lord is brought into this matter. It is a question of God, and what He is doing. It is God, in His infinite essence, entering into the matter of meeting the dire condition man was in.
A.E.H. What was done would seem to make him more blind.
J.T. So it would, if possible. That is what the natural mind would say. Is there something underneath
{385}
that is not yet visible? Well, let us see; verse 7 reads, "He said to him, Go wash in the pool of Siloam, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed, and came seeing". *Sent* is the keyword. Is he a man that would go against natural senses? Will he say, How can I go to Siloam, being more blind than before? There is no such question in his mind. He would be a spectacle bumping against obstacles and walls, you might think. It is a question of what is in the man. He is entirely subject, and we are told that "he went therefore and washed, and came seeing". It is a question of God, and the man selected to manifest His works. This is the result.
A.R. Would you say that he corresponds with the One that sent him? The Lord says, "I must work the works of him that has sent me".
J.T. Yes. We are dealing with the deepest things here, spiritually deep matters. The work of God goes down deeply. There is not a question in the man's mind when the Lord says, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam". Siloam means *sent*. The man goes and washes and comes back seeing. He says to the neighbours, I *saw*, and to the Pharisees he says, I *see*. The first is historical, the second moral -- his *present* state. The work of God is manifest in him.
A.P.T. The man could speak of himself with regard to the work of God. "The neighbours therefore, and those who used to see him before, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that was sitting and begging? Some said, It is he; others said, No, but he is like him; *he* said, It is I".
J.T. You might link it on with @Romans 7, "I, myself". It is a real person, conscious of what God has done for him. The chapter is most interesting in detail. One thought is that the man, in his own progress, as a believer in Christ, *is cast out by the religious people*. Verse 34 says, "Thou hast been wholly born in sins, and thou teachest us? And they cast him out". It is
{386}
the very opposite to what the Lord said of him. He is an outcast, and is now ready for the fellowship. "Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord; and he did him homage". He is the first one of all those we have spoken of who is said to do the Lord homage. This man is therefore a suitable one to finish with, because the Lord Jesus is to be worshipped as the Son of God. It is a part of our service to worship Him. The man confesses his belief. He says, I believe, Lord; and he worshipped Him. Martha says, I believe, and told the Lord what she believed, but this man believed the Lord and worshipped Him.
A.N.W. The apostle John says, "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God" (@1 John 4:15).
J.T. I am glad you brought that in. "God abides in him, and he in God." What a scripture that is! I think we ought to have the worshipping of the Son of God before us. The Magi from the East came a long way to worship Him; they had that in their minds all the way to Jerusalem. They came to worship Him; not simply to see Him, like the Greeks, but to worship Him. Of course, the Father is to be worshipped as we have said; the Lord teaches us that. The Lord also says, "That all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father" (@John 5:23). According to John the Lord made a selection of signs and He did them *before His disciples*. It is said after the first one, that they believed on Him. They were disciples before, but not fully. We want to go the whole way in the idea of believing. Finally John tells us that "Many other signs therefore also Jesus did before his disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that
{387}
ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name" (@John 20:30,31). As having life in His name, we are His witnesses.
J.H. Who are in mind in the "ye"?
J.T. I would take it to be you and I; that is, every christian. It is a book that is written for the last days, as we often remark. The true idea of life is pretty well lost in christendom. Creeds, forms and ceremonies have been taken on, whereas John would bring out life. It is not held in great ecclesiastical names, but "in His name" -- Christ's name.
C.H.H. Then we are at no disadvantage. The disciples had things done before them, but these things are written to put us on the same platform.
J.T. That is so. John writes *in this book* before us, with all the power of inspiration, that we may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing we may have life in His name. All other names are put out of the way.
A.R. We have life in His name, holding it in His name. The sonship of Christ produces generally in the hearts of the saints stimulation and enjoyment. The tendency in us is to drop from that level, and hence, we need ministry to maintain us.
J.T. The very acme of things in christianity stands connected with the precious thoughts of the Son of God.
A.P.T. Is "in his name" characteristic of christianity?
J.T. Yes. His name implies all that He is.
{388}
TWO OR THREE OF THE ASSEMBLY
@Ecclesiastes 4:9-12; @2 Kings 2:6-8,11,12; @Matthew 18:19,20
It is because of the use of the word "two" that I have read these scriptures. The passage in Ecclesiastes is in keeping with the teaching of that book. It is one of Solomon's productions. He is the preacher, which term would imply that he had the formation of assemblies in mind. In these days God has helped in forming assemblies, or as we call them meetings of the saints; and the enemy has retained the idea of the word "assembly" and attached it to imitations formed by those who, contrary to the truth, have separated themselves; but what is according to light stands, and this book contemplates assemblies formed according to God.
This passage is characteristic of the book: "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour". Their labour is not wasted. Indeed the result of their labour is "a good reward". We cannot say at any time that toil is lost, because there are profitable results. The principle of the numeral "two" lies at the root of all assemblies formed according to God, and it is a golden thread running through the Scriptures; an illustration is in what we get here, that two are better than one. God Himself is the first to remark that. He refers to Adam as alone. The interval between the creation of Adam and Eve is not exactly stated. She is said to have been built as formed alone, but taken together both she and Adam are spoken of as having been created; "male and female created he them" (@Genesis 1:27). Under the term *Man* God created them; for that term covers both. There is a dual formation. The idea of *Man* is seen in that dual sense. In the purpose of God it was not intended that man should by himself represent the idea of humanity. The history of creation shows that God had the dual idea in His mind, and they
{389}
are under the same head. The second thought is the woman, for Adam was not made for her; she was made for him. The time between the two formations is not given, as I said, but it certainly was measured by God. Adam was clearly to have experience *alone*. In a moral sense each has to understand the thought of being solitary. The man in @John 9 was cast out; he was alone. He was like a sparrow on the housetop; as the Lord likened Himself. He was alone, but not long alone. The Lord knows each one's experience and how long he can stand; most cannot stand very long. If anyone thinks he can, he is mistaken and only exposes himself to the enemy. The Lord knew how to stand alone, and He felt for the man who had been cast out. We are told, "they cast him out". It was not accidental; "they cast him out". The Lord heard that they had cast him out and He found him. He was not left alone, as I said; for danger ever attaches to that. The Lord would keep him from falling; "able to keep you from falling" (Jude 24).
In referring to Adam's loneliness God seems to base it on observation. I take it that He *saw* it was not good for man to be alone, but He did not remedy the condition at once. God speaks, and it follows that so it shall be. What is said stands authoritatively. We have it exemplified right down through the Scriptures after that. It is remarkable how God, after making that statement, caused Adam to name the creatures. In them Adam had not one his like. Even though he was left to himself he could determine that there was not one his like. God did not indicate the kind of person he needed. The voice that said, "It is not good that Man should be alone" immediately said, "I will make him a helpmate, his like" (chapter 2:18). When speaking of Adam and Eve I speak of Christ and the assembly, as the apostle says. He does not speak literally of Adam and Eve. They will never stand in eternity as Adam and Eve, as husband and wife; that relationship is terminated. The Lord Jesus
{390}
says to the Sadducees, "Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven" (@Matthew 22:29). So that marriage in a literal sense ceases; but Paul says, "This mystery is great, but I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly" (@Ephesians 5:32). If we bring in Christ and the assembly we are on sure ground; ground that is eternal, which is the divine thought, but it is Christ and the assembly, and so we have to look at two; a divine thought in @Genesis 2. What comes out is that they shall be one flesh. That refers to Christ and the assembly; not that it has no application in a literal sense, but it is rather what is put together under the head of "One", -- "Two", saith He, "shall be one flesh" (verse 31).
That beginning which is highly typical runs right through. Conditions arose which verified it constantly. We get such as Moses and Aaron, together a type of one Person; that is, Christ the Apostle and High Priest of our profession in one Person; in the old economy there were two, Moses and Aaron. There are many others we might cite. The idea that we should keep before us comes down to the formation of assemblies. Some of us like to have a large company, but in truth unless each of us learns to walk in unity with another we will not be of much use in a large company. We have to learn how to love the brother next to us; how to walk with him. That is how the principle is laid down in @Exodus 12. The Spirit of God thinks of the neighbour *next* to you. You are to love him as yourself, Scripture says. The neighbour next to you shares the inheritance next to you; that is the bond; we share the land together. Another and I can meet together and the Lord will be with us. And two of us can pray together and what we ask shall be done unto us of our Father who is in heaven. These facts rob us of excuses for ceasing to meet together -- of "forsaking the assembling of ourselves together" (@Hebrews 10:25).
{391}
Now we see in this passage in Ecclesiastes how the thought works out. There is no loss of labour, no loss of time. Those who love one another will seek to be together, work together, and they will have a good reward, even though the meeting is very small; for according to the principle involved here, they have a good reward for their labour. For God never ceases to furnish recompense to those who suffer in this sense.
The next is, "For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and who hath not another to lift him up!" Thus we can help one another as falls take place. In this connection I would stress the thought of walking with God, as Enoch did. There is no failure in him recorded. He would be wonderfully supported as walking with God, who is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless in the presence of His glory. Enoch's testimony was that he pleased God, and God translated him. David said of himself, God liked me and made me king over all Israel (@1 Chronicles 28:4). How beautiful to have that experience -- to have it said that God likes you! It is said, "Enoch walked with God" (@Genesis 5:24). The Lord Jesus says, "Lo, I am with you alway" (@Matthew 28:20). And then the balancing scripture is, "The Lord is with you, while ye be with him" (@2 Chronicles 15:2). Each one can take that up with the utmost confidence, no matter what happens universally, nationally, in business, or in the family. If you are with God, He will never fail you. In the light of this if one with whom you walk fall, you will raise him up. This enters into care for one another in our local settings.
The passage in @Ecclesiastes 4:11, goes on, "If two lie together, then they have warmth". Here it is a question of getting heat. This is an allusion to radiation, to heat emitting from one body to another. This in a spiritual sense enters into the body of Christ. Spiritual persons afford heat to one another; and it multiplies. It is very comforting to find the radiation of heat among
{392}
the saints; the cold north wind blowing without. The passage says, "how can one alone be warm?" This is spiritual, for one can be warm alone naturally, though two cause more heat proportionately than one. God would not think it worth while to write thus of mere natural things. He is teaching here the gain of living in relation to one another; how it affords the comfort of heat in a spiritual sense. Many young people are not comfortable, but this passage suggests the comfort of heat among those with whom we can walk -- which you cannot have alone. We can work this out numerically; two can radiate heat, it is not scorching; it is for comfort. Let us therefore not get discouraged because of fewness; two are enough to give comfort.
If there are three all the better, for it goes on to say, "and a threefold cord is not quickly broken". He extends it to three in connection with warfare, which is another contingency. It says, "if a man overpower the one, the two shall withstand him, and a threefold cord is not quickly broken". Remember the basis of all this is "two". "Two are better than one". If conflict arises the same principle applies; but we must not be partisan. It is threefold; a third one in the bond is of especial value. They are all of one mind. The attack is not from one of them; it is from an outside person, and two would stand out, and a threefold cord is not easily broken. That is the crowning thought. It is unified strength; it is of supreme value in the gatherings of the saints. Three is an advance on two; it is *full* testimony, and what is stated of it as to unity would therefore govern any number. Unity according to God is in mind here. There is no idea of party feelings. Translated into New Testament language it is "two of you", or "two or three", as in @Matthew 18. Two can withstand an attack; and then the threefold cord is an allusion to what is spun, a cord of three small strands which are put so tightly together as one whole, a figure of strong unity, and it "is not quickly broken". It is
{393}
like Rahab's cord, it is to be trusted. It can be safely used to let a brother down "through the window" (@Joshua 2:15).
The passage in Kings which I read is remarkable. It is a question of Elijah and Elisha coming on to more definite ground; coming on to spiritual ground. The two began at Gilgal, which is a fine starting point. There is more than one Gilgal, but the meaning is in the name. Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal; it would imply, We are judging ourselves. I suppose Elijah would take the lead in that. It is the place of circumcision, really of putting off of the *body* of the flesh; the whole of it. Of course both would act separately in self-judgment; for always in self-judgment each acts by himself. "The house of David apart and their wives apart." That is a very good word. Wives are not to trust to their husbands in self-judgment. They must learn to judge themselves. Even Elijah needed to judge himself, he was a man of like passions as we. It is not simply that I judge something wrong in my conduct; but keep sin from acting; we should maintain that *all the time*. You have with you the element of self-judgment always; always judging sin in the flesh. God "sent his own Son ... and ... has condemned sin in the flesh" (@Romans 8:3). Elijah did that; Elisha did it too. That is what I understand by Gilgal. Each is to maintain the mind of God about the flesh which was sacrificially dealt with in Christ on the cross. It is a very touching thing that God should send *His own Son* in the likeness of flesh of sin, to condemn sin in the flesh. This should be a great incentive to us to judge it. It has been entirely dealt with and condemned. It is never allowed to lift its head in the believer who has acquired the light and understanding of self-judgment. I can never consistently judge evil in the assembly, until I maintain self-judgment in myself. The passage says Elijah went with Elisha. He says in effect, Elisha, I know you have judged yourself, but you are to maintain
{394}
self-judgment. That is the point for young people. We are to *maintain* it. What is our conversation today? Are we maintaining self-judgment? The Lord's word is "one *repenting* sinner"; it is one who repents all the time. So Elijah went with Elisha. After that he speaks of going on by himself, but Elisha says, I want to go too, I want the companionship of the man who insists on self-judgment. A fine wholesome state! Many find excuses to get away, because they want to indulge in the flesh; not so Elisha. He says, "As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee". Circumcision really took place where sin was dealt with, where the power of Satan was dealt with. They now come to the Jordan. On the other side you see a fine sight for heaven; these two, having crossed the Jordan together, are now on the other side; not on the bank, they have finished the journey. Risen from the dead (@Colossians 2:12), "raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead. And you ... he has quickened together with him". You go over in the power that raised Christ from among the dead. @Ephesians 2:5 says, "quickened us with the Christ ... and has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus". It is a wider thought than *two* -- thank God! For if we love the saints we want them *all* up there. We shall all go together.
In this remarkable passage the word is: first, "they two went on"; Elijah wanted Elisha to stay at Jericho, for he was going to Jordan. Elisha says, "As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee". Then it says, "they two went on". Not simply Elijah and Elisha, but "they two" *verily together* on resurrection ground. Elijah, we may be sure, would not wish it otherwise, but would bring out the desire and wish of the young servant to be with him. Elisha is gaining ground, he is now one of two, the other a great and experienced servant. It is not now Elijah and
{395}
Elisha, but "they two". Elijah had great experience compared with Elisha, but when you come to "two" as seen here, they are morally on the same level. We can understand how the Lord loves us, as each takes the ground of Himself being one and I another. He says to Peter, as to the tribute money, "Give it to them for me and thee" (@Matthew 17:27). The Lord graciously takes the ground of being one of two persons, that is, Christ the Son of God, Creator of the universe, and Peter. He regards Peter as another with Himself. They are both represented in one piece of money -- what was needed for the tax for two, the One Jesus, the other Peter. What a sight for heaven! Peter and John going to the temple to pray. Peter said to the man, "Look on us". There you have two together again -- another pleasing sight for heaven. That is the way the truth is worked out; not Christ Himself and another now, but two special subjects of the work of God.
Continuing with Elisha, we read in verse 7, "they two stood by the Jordan". Evident moral power in the presence of death! Do the two act against the Jordan? No. Elijah acts alone. Elijah is greater than Elisha. Christ is greater than any of us. He alone can wrap His mantle together and smite the waters of death. It is a question of the inherent power of Christ. The mantle represented what Christ was personally in His life down here. It stood for Himself. Elisha uses it afterwards and says, "Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?" and smites the waters. Typically he recognises the power is of Christ and not in himself.
Elijah took his mantle and smote the waters and they were divided, and *they two went over on dry ground*. "Risen with Christ." The true believer can say, I am risen with Christ -- according to @Colossians 3:1. That epistle says we are "raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead" (chapter 2:12). The power of God is irresistible. I have faith in *that*. The same power that raised Christ raises me.
{396}
It is as good as done. Nothing can withstand that power. "Through faith", implies that it is not yet literal, but it is morally true, having a present bearing, for nothing can hinder it. The power that worketh in us is that which raised Christ, and goes on to our resurrection.
Then the passage, having said, "they two went over on dry ground", verse 11 says "as they went on, and talked". Very beautiful! The bank of the Jordan is not the terminus. Heaven is the terminus for christians: "raised us up together, and made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" (@Ephesians 2:6) is the full thought. It is Ephesian teaching. Colossians is that we are *raised* by the power of God, our minds are to be set on "things above". Ephesians is ourselves set down in heaven: all according to the sovereign purpose and power of God, -- because of His great love wherewith He loved us.
Now just a word about @Matthew 18. *Two* is characteristic of Matthew. This time it is "two of you". Verses 18-19, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven ... " is a finished thought. Verse 19, the word "again" implies an extension, and applies to different circumstances. "Again I say to you that if two of you shall agree on the earth ... " It is a question of two of you, two sisters, husband and wife, or brothers. "Two of you" is the dominant thought. *You* implies those of the assembly. The Lord had said much about the assembly. He had already linked Peter with Himself, and now He says, "Two of you". It is two of the assembly. Notice it is on the earth. We shall not need this when we go to heaven; we shall not be asking for things bearing on this scene. We are regarded here as on the earth, connected with Christ's interests. This has to do with the reduced circumstances in which we are today. The passage will help us. Young people are apt to deplore the small circumstances; they become lonely; have no warmth; but here we are told of infinite resource,
{397}
so that we need not be afraid of being pushed to the wall. "Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens". Heaven takes account of those two. They are known in heaven as Peter and John were known; as the Lord Jesus and Peter were known. These things are very precious. It is "two of you"; two of the assembly, which is universal. Two of us on earth, ask the Father in heaven. See the distinction between earth and heaven. Elijah was taken to heaven, but those who are of the assembly are here below where evil is; we are in the wilderness. What things come up in the wilderness! Yet our unfailing resource is our Father who is in the heavens. In the place of difficulty on earth we are to ask, and it shall come to us, the Lord says, "from my Father who is in the heavens".
Then there is the word "three". "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name there am I in the midst of them." We gather unto that Name. It is a question of outwardly small circumstances, but as gathered together unto Christ's Name we have Him "in the midst". The position is thus invulnerable. He is here where two or three are gathered together unto His Name. It is not possible to overthrow that position.
May God bless His word!
{398}
THE DOUBLE PORTION
@2 Kings 2:9-11,19-22; @Ezekiel 47:6-9; @Revelation 18:4-6
I am thinking of the word "double" in these scriptures we have read and my remarks will stand in relation to this word; to what it suggests in the connection indicated, namely, the Holy Spirit. The verses alluded to in 2 Kings refer to the portion of the first-born (see @Deuteronomy 21:17).
The servants of God in the Old Testament times profited by what preceded them and of course the same should be true of those of us who belong to the present dispensation. We find, in the Old Testament, constant allusions by the servants of God to what preceded them; the ministries are thus accumulative. This is seen in the Bible itself; the books usually begin with "And". Genesis does not, for it is the beginning, and there are other exceptions, but generally there is the cumulative idea; the conjunction links the books together. In Exodus the Spirit of God continues from the book of Genesis; it is not isolated, but linked together by the Spirit of God and intended to be so read. We may thank God for the order that the Bible was *Appointed to be read in churches*; that was made against the prohibition of its general use, which earlier had been in force. It certainly is read today among God's people who understand the assembly, and we may be thankful for its wide use even by those who do not understand much of its true spiritual meaning.
And in reading we must remember that "no prophecy of scripture is had from its own particular interpretation ... but holy men of God spake under the power of the Holy Spirit" (@2 Peter 1:20). The one divine Author indited all the books of the Old Testament as well as of the New; so that every scripture is inspired of God and is profitable for doctrine, etc. (@2 Timothy 3:16). We must thus read the divine book to understand it. The
{399}
word often comes as it did to the eunuch, "Understandest thou what thou readest?" (@Acts 8:30). The reading itself is not enough; you must understand, and the Lord gives understanding in all things, so that one may run that reads (@Habakkuk 2:2). The Lord gives understanding; we are not to cut knots, so to speak, but let the Holy Spirit undo them. In the process He unfolds things we had not yet thought of.
We began in 2 Kings with the thought of speaking about this word "double". It is used in Scripture many times more than in the passages I have read. What I am seeking to bring forward is the portion that belongs to the first-born. Elisha did not claim to be first-born, in fact he was last-born in his own estimation; last of all. When Elijah called him there were twelve yoke of oxen and he with the *twelfth*. He is not seeking to be first. So it was with the greatest of servants, Paul; his name meaning *little*; in his own estimation, "less than the least of all saints". It is the Holy Spirit speaking in @Acts 13:9. Elisha is not claiming anything from his birthright; whatever place he came in in the family, he took the last place. In @1 Kings 19 we learn that Elijah cast his mantle on him, indicating his spiritual influence. Influence may be imparted without words, but when we come under spiritual influence, we shall ask questions. So here in @2 Kings 2, Elisha is under the influence of Elijah through his mantle. Elijah did not *fold* his mantle when he cast it upon Elisha, as he did at the Jordan. In wrapping it together at the Jordan, it was a question of power meeting the condensed power of the enemy; meeting it with the power of God. The ark of the covenant implies that too. The ark held back the waters, although Jordan was in all its power; although overflowing its banks, it was held back by the ark. There was no water in sight. As I was saying, the mantle of Elijah affected Elisha, so that he followed him. Elijah says to him, "What have I done to thee?". Influence is there. It remained with Elisha.
{400}
I urge this matter of influence. Elisha never lost it; he clung to Elijah. He says, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And they two went on". Again, "they two stood by the Jordan", "they two went over" -- "they went on and talked". Now Elijah has in mind to honour and benefit his attendant. He was a young servant attached to an older servant. He poured water on the hands of Elijah; he would enhance his service. He did not wish Elijah to be removed to make room for himself. Some young men may consider older ones are in the way, and it must be admitted that if they are not spiritual, they can be obstructers of the work; they may be a hindrance by undue activities. Elisha would keep Elijah going. When in danger, on one occasion, Elijah imposed restrictions on himself, taking himself out of God's hands. To support a man who imposes restrictions on himself in this sense is not right. Elijah stood before hundreds of false prophets and gained the day, but fled from Jezebel and asked God to kill him; it was self-imposed. If God gives me liberty, gives me a commission, and I impose restrictions on myself which would frustrate it, I am lawless. That is what Elijah did, but he recovered himself, and later he is a type of Christ going up into heaven. We have dwelt on these matters in our meetings. It is most precious to see how, though this great servant turns aside, in the strength of the food that God supplied he journeyed forty days to mount Horeb. God meets him at the end of it. He says to him, "What doest thou here, Elijah?"; as much as to say, This is not *your* place.
I proceed now to speak of what Elisha obtained from Elijah. Elijah says to him, "Ask what I shall do for thee". Elisha said, "I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. And he said, "Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so". What I am speaking of, the double portion,
{401}
is the first-born's portion. It is not claimed on that ground here. Elisha does not claim it at all. It is Elijah's suggestion. The Lord Jesus in @Luke 24:49 says, "but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high". That is from the divine side. The Spirit as a gift is available to all who believe. It is the double portion, because the christian is in the first-born place before God; belonging to "the assembly of the first-born ... registered in heaven" (@Hebrews 12:23). Every true christian is in that. The double portion of the Holy Spirit is the greatest thing you can have. In view of obtaining it, we are to see the One who gives it. "If thou see me when I am taken from thee", Elijah says to Elisha. The ascension is one of the great features. It is not only that the Lord went up, but *how* He went up. It is how He ascended. "Having said these things he was taken up, they beholding him" (@Acts 1:9). It is the One you see go up who sends the Spirit. The Holy Spirit came down at Pentecost in full measure.
This is the most wonderful of all dispensations. Those of us in it are favoured. Do we value it? The Lord would have us to understand His ascension. "If thou see me when I am taken from thee". There is nothing said about seeing Enoch go up, or of how he went, but *that* he went up; before that he had the testimony that he pleased God. In his translation he would have the sense of this, and so he would be in liberty with God. The Lord is working with us all that we may go up happily in the sense that we please God, as having that testimony. It is attested to us that we please God. Who does it is not the point; some one will do it. The Lord in speaking to Philadelphia does it Himself. In His letter to that assembly He indicates that she pleased God, and He says that those who say they are Jews, and are not, "shall know that *I* have loved thee". John too was one whom Jesus loved; the Lord was pleased with him. So that, as we please God, testimony will be rendered to us. In accord with
{402}
Elijah's remark to Elisha that the reception of the double portion of his spirit depended on his seeing him as he went up, as I said, enlarges on the manner of Christ's ascension (@Acts 1). The two men in white say, "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven" (verse 11). Notice the word *manner*. It is He Himself. It is the Jesus whom we have known, who now comes among us spiritually, whose traits have affected our hearts; we shall see Him descending; we shall ascend with Him. It is the descent of love, the Bridegroom coming for His bride, coming down for her, to take her to be with Himself, to present her to Himself, all-glorious, without spot or wrinkle. We need to be in His hand so that we may be prepared morally for all this. The assembly herself when He is pleased to display her, comes down "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (@Revelation 21:2). For Him! Think of the display of glory in that adornment! All this is because of the double portion. Elisha had received the double portion; the sons of the prophets knew enough to say, "The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha". The assembly has the Spirit of Christ.
Now as to the later verses read in @2 Kings 2, the great matter is how to adjust the local company. This comes in as the Spirit has His place. The men of Jericho said to Elisha, "Behold now, the situation of the city is good, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren". It is a local condition. What can I do with a local company where defective conditions exist? The men of the city described the state. Elisha says, "Bring me a new cruse". They evidently had it, or could conveniently procure it: they brought it to him. The prophet had asked them to "put salt in it", that is to say, what is preservative. There is no hope at all for the local company if the new cruse and salt -- what they typify -- do not exist there; nothing can be done. There must be something in the locality besides what
{403}
the visiting servant may have. There must be the new cruse; that is, a *vessel* having the character of *newness*. The Spirit can use this for the recovery of a local position; salt is put into the cruse and then cast into the source of the waters; Elisha saying, "Thus saith Jehovah, I have healed these waters". God works with us, as we move with Him, and recognise defects in a locality. See if the new cruse is there; not worn-out religious or other customs, but what is new. This is always available if the Spirit is recognised, and the salt in the cruse would imply that we are to live in incorruption, not in personal preferences, partisanship or other corrupting elements. Thus God can and does act. He causes the locality to be adjusted, and there is no more barrenness. These are our resources; every one is a first-born, registered in heaven. We are called upon to serve, and it is in that dignity. God is working something out in a locality. The assembly there is dear to Him, and it must be preserved. There are many places in this continent in which the saints need adjustment, but it is to be in the dignity of the first-born and newness of life. Such adjustment taking place, we get great things. One knows pretty well what there is in this continent -- sometimes paralysis -- and every one seeking to help is tested. What can he do? It is a question of finding there what is spiritually new and what is preservative. It is to be noted well that the new cruse and the salt are provided by the men in the place.
I link all this with @Ezekiel 47, with the "double river". That is to say, it is what it becomes as the believer or exercised person pursues the river. It has often been spoken of as flowing from the house of God. It flows out in a definite direction, toward the east. The Holy Spirit from the geographical standpoint moves definitely. In christianity He moved toward the west. Here the river flowed toward the east; in our dispensation it has come toward the west, as I said.
{404}
At this moment we are all sitting in the uttermost west. That is a testimony to the extension of the activities of the Spirit. We read of the uttermost north; it is hostile to God's people in the last days (@Ezekiel 38). We are now in the uttermost west. Think of the distance this city is from Jerusalem! We should think of the extension of the activities of the Spirit of God. Peter says of the sheet which came down from heaven, "It came even to me" (@Acts 11:5). The Spirit came even to us in this western part of the earth.
Then we have the measurement of the river. It is measure experienced by Ezekiel. He says, "He measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters; the waters were to the ankles" -- and so on until the prophet reaches "waters to swim in (verses 3-5). The river is an *experienced* matter, a real matter. This river flowed toward the east, and Ezekiel comes to the part "that could not be passed through". It is an infinite thing. It is typically no less than the Holy Spirit, a divine Person. We are brought into the fulness of the Spirit in His ever deepening activities in testifying of Christ. He "searches all things, even the depths of God" (@1 Corinthians 2:10). Hence Ezekiel is brought back to the bank of the river. He finds trees which allude to the precious product of the Spirit, whether in the coming day or our day, Ezekiel sees this on his second visit. We cannot take in everything at once. It is here a little, and there a little, but all cumulative, involving steady increase.
Then we come to the use of the word ' double '. The river is greater to him now than at the beginning; he says, "When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. And he said unto me ... every living thing which moveth, whithersoever the double river shall come, shall live". This river has increased in his apprehension; that is, through experience. Ezekiel did not begin with these dimensions. I want to speak
{405}
particularly of the effect of it. "And it shall come to pass that every living thing which moveth, whithersoever the double river shall come, shall live. And there shall be a very great multitude of fish". That is how we get increase. There is dignity attached to the first-born ones, as we have seen; here it is the effect of the power supporting them. It is life overcoming every difficulty. Wherever there is life, whatever is living is made to live fully; is kept living; the river preserves life. Joseph said, "God sent me before you to preserve life" (@Genesis 45:5). His new name is said to signify this. It is a question of the Holy Spirit's indication of the new world in which everything is in life and energy. This is linked here with the double river. Let us not be content with a little measure, because a large measure is available. It is a question of moving with the man who had the measuring line. I do not want to be poor spiritually; to be ineffective, or to be in the way, but to be *contributory*; and the double river which enables us to be this is available. This river has come down to where the need is, and not only is the need met, but by the Spirit we praise God, giving thanks for His unspeakable gift. Why be poor? The Lord Jesus became poor that we might become rich and give satisfaction to the heart of God, who is the source of all, "of whom are all things and we for him".
I come now to the passage read in @Revelation 18. It is a most solemn word; it is a matter of judgment. The Revelation is full of it, for it is the time of judgment. The Spirit of divine judgment is abroad. We are addressed here in chapter 18, "And I heard another voice out of the heaven saying, Come out of her, my people". That voice has been heard for many years. "Come out of her." No christian is worthy of the name who has not learned to judge the religious system referred to here. In order to know her we have to cast our eyes across christendom as it is, also to look at it historically. It is said "her sins have been heaped on one another
{406}
up to the heaven, and God has remembered her unrighteousnesses". *Heaped on one another*, all linked together as unrighteousnesses. Of the true bride it is said, "it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure, for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints". There is no pretension; it is not taken on, but *granted* to her to wear it; fine linen clean and bright; it is a fabric possessed of sheen, of brightness, made into a garment. But in chapter 18 it is a system of wickedness which has been built up for centuries, extending back to the fourth at least; and strange to say, men with the Bible in their possession built it up. The very terms of Scripture are used, yet it is a system in its constitution and practice contrary to God. But its judgment is on God's calendar. So we have the word, "God hath remembered her iniquities". "Remembered" implies that there has been delay in the judgment, but it will be executed in God's time; the Reformation brought it up in a storm. It was not a question of remembrance then, it was public, but lately it seems to be employed in God's providential ways. God can use such things. He uses waters, sun, rain and what He will. He may use this system for the moment, but the time is coming when He is going to remember her sins, and in a merciless way too. He puts it in the heart of the beast and the false prophet to do His will to it. He may be using her now against other features of apostasy, but later He will use them against her. Her destruction will be complete. The smoke of her burning will go up.
In order to bring her guilt home to ourselves it is said, "Come out of her ... that ye have not fellowship in her sins". And it further says, "God has remembered her unrighteousnesses. Recompense her even as she has recompensed; and double to her double according to her works. In the cup which she has mixed, mix to her double". It is not the time for us to execute judgment; but we can do it *morally*, and that is implied as
{407}
we come out of her. The beast and the false prophet will do it literally; she shall be burned with fire; the saints, as I said, do it morally now. In separating from evil we judge it. We execute the judgment of God, taking into account the history of the system as well as its present state. Scripture affords us evidence of her whole history. And this is confirmed by reliable facts recorded since. It is important for every brother and sister to read all this evidence and have a judgment. Be separate from this woman who sits on the beast; whether herself or her daughters, all ought to separate from them. Verse 20 says, "God has judged your judgment upon her". It is what real christians have judged. As I said, He will use the beast and the false prophet to do it here on earth, and God's eternal judgment is added, for her "smoke goes up to the ages of ages". We are called upon to form a double judgment in keeping with the guilt. We need the Holy Spirit in order to form a judgment of it, so much has been forgotten -- fifteen centuries or more of the work of Satan's hands. Only those who have the Holy Spirit can form a true judgment of this system and abandon it, root and branch. God judges our judgment upon her. That gives deliverance to us, and as free, the Holy Spirit enables us to find the true assembly; and to have part in the production of the fabric -- the righteousnesses of the saints -- in which the Lamb's wife will be clothed; the "fine linen, bright and pure -- the righteousnesses of the saints".
{408}
THE SERVICE OF GOD IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (1)
@Matthew 2:1-12
I had before me the introduction of the service of God in the four gospels, each having its own distinctiveness. The feature of the gospel as seen in Matthew is the worship of the Son, an important feature indeed. This gospel has more in it bearing on this than any other has, particularly as seen in the magi. They not only come to worship, but they come bringing something in their hands. "Homage" is the word for worship here; it indicates personal reverence. This supreme reverence is seen peculiarly in this chapter and in this book. So in chapter 4, we see that the devil breaks in on this particular service, seeking to get the Lord to worship him. Again in chapter 9, there is Jairus, who worshipped Him, and there are several other instances, particularly at the end of the gospel, where He is worshipped; we are to keep in mind that this is a feature of the divine service. We know God is the supreme Object of worship. Yet the Lord is God, so in this gospel He is presented as the Object of our worship. He is presented to us for our reverence in @Micah 5:2 which speaks of Him as "Ruler in Israel: whose goings forth are from of old, from the days of eternity", and also in @Matthew 2:6: "A leader who shall shepherd my people Israel".
There are other instances of man as such being worshipped, as in chapter 18:26; "the bondman therefore falling down did him homage". The creditor here in this instance is not a divine Person, of course, but we must consider the context. J.N.D. in translating this word for worship says, "did him homage", not "worshipped". In @Revelation 19:10, the same word is used; the apostle John was forbidden by the angel who said, "See thou do it not. I am thy fellow-bondman ... Do homage to God".
{409}
Here in Matthew, we are to have in mind that the Lord Jesus is to be an Object of worship to man. The magi say, "Where is the king of the Jews that has been born? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to do him homage". This is to emphasise that He is the Son of God, a divine Person, and is to be worshipped. The use of the word "worship" is an important matter. The man in @John 9 had gone a long way in his soul, and they had already cast him out when he meets the Lord, and in answer to His question, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" he says, "I believe, Lord", and he did Him homage. The woman at the well in @John 4 used the word ' worship ' in relation to public worship in a general way; that is the usual idea of worship, which has reference to a place, whether here or there, in a public sense. What is before us is not that, but whether the Lord Himself is apprehended by us, so that we are brought to worship from our hearts.
"They shall call his name Emmanuel" which means "God with us" is a presentation of the Lord which would enter into what we are considering. So here, these magi may not have been able to say much, but they apprehended in their souls who He was. The Lord Himself deals with these impressions of the soul, impressions that get expressed in time. Take David, for instance, as a young man he was a thoughtful person and had gained right impressions which came out later in his life. Indeed the Spirit of God could say to Samuel, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he". Then later on the time came for the expression of all these precious impressions, and the Psalms testify what this man, David, had. He could say, "My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king; my tongue is the pen of a ready writer" (@Psalm 45:1). He spoke thus of the impressions of his soul, of that One. So these magi had a definite impression and they say that this One
{410}
was King of the Jews. ' We have seen His star ... where is He? Where is the actual Object of these, our impressions of Him? ' These magi had impressions and God was helping them, for they moved towards the Object of those impressions. The Lord Himself taught the woman in @John 4 that those who worship in the spirit are marked off from merely religious persons.
The west is the territory of the assembly, that is, the spreading of Japheth, while the east is Shem, or heathendom, which, no doubt, will be evangelised later (@Revelation 14:6) by the "angel flying in mid-heaven, having the everlasting glad tidings". It no doubt refers to that day when ten men will take hold of the skirt of one Jew. The Jew will then be honoured.
Now in @Matthew 1:21, "Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for *he* shall save his people from their sins". In the prophet Isaiah it is "Call his name Immanuel", God with us. "Jesus" is another title for ' Jehovah, the Saviour ', and both titles point to His deity, all to bring us to worship. Our impressions of Him are to be formed by how He is presented to us.
In Matthew Joseph is made much of, he is called a righteous man, -- it is the male side no doubt raised up by God to protect "the little child and his mother." Joseph is thus a righteous man raised up for this purpose, to protect God's interests. The purpose of God must stand, so in Matthew all things must go through. In Matthew an angel rolls away the stone at the tomb of the Lord Jesus; it is not left to anyone, but a mighty angel does it. Again at the end, we have the word, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them" (chapter 28:19). The idea is that all *will* be done in spite of all opposition.
The Lord would here bring home to us that we have the means of worship; the wise men opened up their treasures; they *had* these things. So we in the assembly service of God do not come empty handed.
{411}
Herod's influence here was a little unusual, it must be that the enemy was working through Herod. If we enquire of any of the denominations we would get answers, some good answers, but then we are dealing with a spiritual matter here. These men from the east were guided by heaven, and it is another matter, not like Herod's inquiry. He said "Go, search out accurately concerning the child ... so that *I* also may come and do him homage", but he doesn't mean that; he has another thing in mind, as is plainly seen later on in his wicked act of killing the little children. The star for us today is heavenly light. ' Heavenly light makes all things bright ', as the hymn says. Matthew makes much of heaven and heavenly activity; he brings in the dominance of heaven in the ways of God. There must have been a work of God in these wise men for them to be able to say, "Where is the king of the Jews ...? for we have seen his star". Nathanael was told to "come and see" (@John 1:47), that is his message, and he *came* and when he came the Lord remarks about him. These wise men are the leading worshippers here in Matthew and show how God is starting that worship by men. These men in going to Jerusalem were on dangerous ground, and were warned by a dream to go back another way. It says, "they ... went their way"; that just means that they followed the star -- "until it came and stood over the place where the little child was". The point is that following the guidance of heaven, they found Him. The star was leading them now, (they had lost that guidance while in Jerusalem), the same leading they had had in the east now leads them again, and they arrive at the place. When they saw the star "they rejoiced with exceeding great joy" -- and falling down they did Him homage. How ready they were to open their treasures! -- largeness of heart was theirs. When we are full of joy is the time to give.
In Matthew it is "little child", not babe, which suggests the idea of growth. A more distinctive personality
{412}
is indicated by the term "little child", than by the word "babe". This repudiates all thought of Mary being worshipped as is held by the Romish system. She is not viewed as an object of veneration; these men apparently ignore her altogether. But it is the Person of the "little child" they are engrossed with, He is the One to be worshipped; there was a real Person there, not just a babe in swaddling clothes, but a definite Person as the Object of worship of these men. This is set forth to us in Matthew as God's thought.
The renewed mind spoken of later on by Paul, is a trained mind. So our remembrance of the Lord Jesus in the breaking of bread is an act of mind with us, a mind trained to remember Him. It is the apprehension of Him as *thy Lord*, that is with us, so it is by a renewed mind. You come into the house to see Christ, in the circle where He is cared for. Our meetings here would plainly indicate that we are caring for what is of God. The child was possibly in Mary's arms, but they did not worship her, only Him. However near they may be, we do not worship the saints -- *Him* only; here they fell down and worshipped Him.
They brought the right things, for they had the idea of worship in their minds all the time -- they came prepared and had gold, frankincense and myrrh. A certain attitude of mind is indicated here in their falling prostrate before Him -- all included in our idea of worship; only it is well to keep in mind the personal worth of this *Person*, The Person of Christ is to be kept in mind all through Matthew, as the Object of veneration and worship of our souls. The heavenly light of the star led these men to Christ, and with the further command to return "another way", the instruction to them is finished. They returned, they were good assembly men. The gold they brought represents what is of God, supreme among metals. The frankincense is fragrance; the myrrh, suffering, coming with the idea of excellence, lifting us out of
{413}
the smallness of things here. The principle is that I must bring, not come empty. The point today is the quality and order of our service; we are to have the things these stand for in our souls. Mary "kept all these things in her heart". She never forgot these things. We see that Mary of Bethany also had this treasure, and she herself was the vessel -- it says she *kept* the nard. The Lord says of her, "Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial" (@John 12:7) -- it was treasure for the Lord personally. So if we are brought to *Him* in our service, we are come to finality. This all indicates how we come to Christ, nothing further is said to the wise men -- the star led them to Christ and that was all that was needed, -- so we are brought to *Him* in our service.
{414}
THE SERVICE OF GOD IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (2)
@Luke 1:5-23, 57-75
We have before us Zacharias and Elizabeth, both being of the priestly family. What is in mind is that, whilst the service of God is carried on in outward order -- Zacharias serving as priest in his order -- yet we are to see that he was not actuated by faith. Nor was the service, although carried out in normal outward order, in the power of the Spirit. Yet, later on, in verse 67 -- he is said to be filled with the Holy Spirit and addresses God. This is characteristic of Luke, -- Luke, as ever full of grace providing us with the thought that while Zacharias was not acting in faith, he was one who *could* be recovered or secured through discipline, that is, there was hope there. According to Malachi, who speaks of the state of things to which the Lord came in Israel, there was a state of unbelief, not hopeless, for the work of God was there, only needing rebuke and adjustment.
Luke always recognises the powers that be, the state of humility that enters into a recognition of his position. He begins by saying, "in the days of Herod the king", -- and again, "in those days ... a decree went out", and "when Cyrenius had the government of Syria". It is a principle of Luke's writings that God has set up provisional government, and that in whosesoever hands it be, it is to be recognised. So we are to recognise that the testimony requires that -- nothing more is in mind than that. Herod was not favoured by the Jews. The Spirit of God recognises public order with those in authority, whether it be Caesar, Pilate, or any other; God recognises them, and so should we. Peter who recognises the government of God much in his writing and experience, enjoins us to be subject to the king and to governors. The great highways of Rome are in mind in Paul's travels; "walk to and fro through
{415}
the earth" -- that involves highways, which were an advantage to him. No doubt certain features are being set forth in governments, yet God is working behind the scenes, in regard to the Lord Himself, this glorious Person. We belong to those who have a heavenly calling, and bear no sword, yet government does bear the sword, and "not in vain". Governments are a provision of God and to be held by us as that. Think of the apostle Paul before King Agrippa, and such things recorded as "Caesar's household" and "chief man of the island", it is simply seeing things as they are, and upheld of God, and left as they are. The authority of government was used against Christ yet He recognised that they were of God. God used indirect government for His ends there, as well as direct government as with Zacharias. He was unbelieving. Clearly he had prayed for a son and had given it up, but God is not pleased with that and disciplines Zacharias while He answers the prayer he had given up in unbelief. There are so many things we do not observe, but God observes them.
Abraham and Sarah had asked, and because they were old and things did not come as expected, they gave up. So do we, and it is because we have lost faith and it displeases God. It may be noted that in general the Old Testament is on the principle of demand, asking and expectation, while the principle of the New Testament is *supply*. The name of John is thus significant: "Thy supplication has been heard" and "Thou shalt call his name John", or Jehovah is gracious. That is the principle of God's testimony in the New Testament. The idea is grace, and John denotes grace to prepare us for Christ -- his ministry is preparatory for Christ. In each incident recorded here we recognise that God has been working in us to prepare us for Christ -- "And *thou*, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways; to give knowledge of deliverance
{416}
to his people by the remission of their sins on account of the bowels of mercy of our God". All is getting ready for the time of the receiving of Christ.
Luke begins with these two persons, Zacharias and Elizabeth. They had been real in their prayers, and though there was unbelief, there was hope there too. Often if we would just be patient, we would see that there is hope there. They represent the gracious operation of God in a hopeful case. With Simeon and Anna, there is no delinquency shown in their case, so they are not rebuked. On the other hand we need to see that Zacharias was carrying on with what God had set up, and externally was supported by God. The angel appears at the *right* side of the altar, which would speak of all the power of heaven on their side. But the answer to him when he says, "How shall I know this?" is, "*I* am Gabriel, who stand before God, and I have been sent to speak to thee". We see he is gracious but severe; what follows is very severe: "because thou hast not believed my words, the which shall be fulfilled in their time". There are hopeful cases, and such a case is proved in Zacharias himself. If God is working at all, He works in hopeful ones. God recognises piety with these two, as in verse 6, "both just before God". Gabriel does not reprove Zacharias until Zacharias expresses unbelief. Zacharias had been praying for a son, and if you pray for a son you are praying for the continuance of the testimony in good hands. So it is that Gabriel appears in the temple, not Zacharias¬ house, but in connection with God's interests. It is very gracious of God to go on with him in this way, hence the seriousness of Zacharias¬ doubting -- it is unbelief in God's power to do what He promises. We can see in @Zechariah 3 that the angel of the Lord stood by; that is God's support of what He is going to do. In other places we are told what the angels are, all ministers sent out to minister to those who are heirs of salvation.
{417}
Gabriel says the thing is about to be fulfilled, hence the rebuke for Zacharias¬ unbelief. It says Abraham hesitated not in spite of his great age. The present age here now may cause doubt and unbelief in us, but if we are going on with God, though not fully intelligent, we can be corrected and adjusted to the mind of God. There was a state with Zacharias that was not right, although he was positionally right, hence the unbelief comes out and the necessary rebuke.
The idea of the priesthood in Luke is linked on with Malachi, where we get a thought of priesthood not elsewhere set out, as Phinehas represents the idea of priesthood. So here Zacharias is seen praying for the continuing of the family priesthood, and he is a case of genuine recovery. He is a *real* priest now; his mouth is opened and tongue loosed and he speaks. That is true priesthood. Then he goes on to prophesy, bringing in the priest and prophet as one, being God's thought. So with us, if we accept the discipline, blessing will follow. It is remarkable, first he is a priest then he is a prophet. His priestly words are, "Blessed be the Lord", and the other is prophetic indeed. His discipline had been very severe, for the first thing a priest should be able to do is to speak, "the priest's lips should keep knowledge" (@Malachi 2:7). But Zacharias accepted it and he departed to his house. His house is involved, he went through peculiar exercise those nine months, and we may measure the depth to which he had gone, by the fruit of his lips afterwards. His is a great recovery, and if we are *really* restored, we shall add to what there is. It is a restored Jonah who writes the book of Jonah. These are hopeful cases, but we have examples also of certain hopeless cases, Simon Magus, King Agrippa, Pilate and others. Nicodemus and Nathanael were hopeful ones; with the latter, the Lord says, "before that Philip called thee" (@John 1:48), indicating that the Lord saw something hopeful about him. Then the man in @John 9 was most hopeful, he was *sent*, and *went* and *came* seeing. When the Lord
{418}
says, "Go, and sin no more", as in @John 5, it indicates that there is always the possibility of a worse state coming in. Again the two going to Emmaus were hopeful, they are restored and give testimony.
Sarah laughed in unbelief first, but later she laughed, and all who hear her laugh with her, showing that recovery was on the same line as the failure. Recovery in the power of God is sometimes so rapid, so complete that we are not ready for it in our faith. It was so in Corinth. Those speaking against the truth and taking up opposition to it are rarely restored, such as Jannes and Jambres. It is a question of discernment. The question of our leaders is clearly seen in those who opposed the truth and fell. It is noted that Matthew is more severe in cases of discipline than is Luke; in @Matthew 18:13 it is "*if* he find it" and in @Luke 15:4 it is, "*until* he find it", in the case of the lost sheep.
The family and neighbours were on natural lines here; they named the child Zacharias after his father, But Elizabeth says, "No; but he shall be called John". Then Zacharias *writes*, "John is his name". It is the writing of a dispensation. Then his mouth is opened and fear was upon all around. The idea of the writing is that there is a fixity, it is from God and cannot be altered. He is supported by God, his mouth is opened and the Holy Spirit comes upon him and he blesses God. It is the direct coming in of the Holy Spirit in the new dispensation. We can thus get the support of the Holy Spirit now as we adhere to right principles. The word is "An horn of salvation ... in the house of ... David" (not Aaron), that was of Christ and hence a prophetic word. Then Zacharias turns to the child and says, "And *thou*, child ... " and there follows a beautiful tribute to Christ. So Zacharias in his prophetic word shows how clearly he is on spiritual lines, (John himself recognised the greatness of what God was doing by leaping before he was born) and showing the greatness of all that this word of God referred to.
{419}
THE SERVICE OF GOD IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (3)
@Luke 2:8-38
J.T. It has been thought necessary to consider Luke in two meetings as affording moral instruction as to our subject. In considering chapter 1 we see that the service of God was carried on by the true priest of the house of Aaron. The Spirit of God dwells on him, but it became evident by the incoming of an angel when he was serving, that he was unbelieving as to his own prayers. But he was a hopeful case. He was restored, and in his recovery he had more than he ever had before. He was not only a priest of the house of Aaron, but the Holy Spirit came upon him so that he could prophesy. All this points to the door of another dispensation; God coming in in grace, and John the baptist was to prepare the way of the Lord.
It is thought that chapter 2 represents a perfect state of things in those who are brought into the service. There were no discrepancies in the shepherds, Simeon or Anna. The shepherds were abiding without, keeping watch over their flock by night. "An angel of the Lord was there by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them". Then when we come to Simeon, he is already a priest in the true sense, but he is not said to be a priest after the order of Aaron. He was a characteristic man of Jerusalem, "just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him". So that we are now at the door of a new dispensation. Zacharias comes into the real priesthood and authentic ministry by the Spirit, and now Simeon, although not said to be a priest after the order of Aaron, is really a priest as the Holy Spirit is upon him. "It was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ". So that we have a man now in the power of the Spirit.
{420}
H.H. Is all that connected with the service of God, each one taking a right place in relation to this service?
J.T. I think it is for our encouragement. This gospel, as remarked yesterday, is hopeful. We have a subject of the work of God. The Lord would encourage us as to hopeful cases. It may be that some have perhaps been under discipline, but it is hopeful as we make the most of any evidence of the work of the Lord.
-.H. There is a distinction in service. You see the difference between Simeon and Zacharias. Simeon was not inside in the holy place but Zacharias was.
J.T. Simeon is a priest of the new order. Anna is of the tribe of Asher, not of Aaron, but a priest of the new order. She departed not from the temple. She is there serving God night and day with fastings and prayers. What is of the old is being brought into the new. They are both on spiritual lines.
Ques. Do you think that moral features that might be at the beginning of the dispensation are to be found at the end?
J.T. I think Luke would encourage us on the line of grace. The name John means ' Jehovah is gracious ', or ' Jehovah has graciously given '. He comes in from the old order. John the evangelist brings in the new order in chapter 3:30,31 of his gospel, "He must increase, but I must decrease. He who comes from above is above all". Then what the Spirit of God goes on to say indicates that John was in the new order of things in his soul, but not officially. It was remarkable; he was slain at about thirty-five years of age in the full height of his ministry. He could not continue on in christianity any more than Moses could enter into the land, but in his spirit he was beyond the old order.
The service is to reflect the mind of heaven. Zacharias¬ position is in the holy place. He comes in ostensibly to support what is going on. We make the most of what has come down from the Old Testament. Zacharias is doing what is right ostensibly but underneath there
{421}
is difficulty; but not to discourage at all, it is hopeful. The angel does not say, You are wanting in faith; he begins to speak about John the baptist. It is encouraging, hopeful, stimulating. Then Zacharias comes in with his unbelief. But Zacharias and Elizabeth are brought over, you might say, to the new order of things. She goes to the hill country. Zacharias goes to his house, meaning it was a household matter, but Elizabeth goes to the hill country. It is a new order of things, and these two women, Mary and Elizabeth, are on that line. It is one of the most remarkable things in Scripture, but that is the way Luke would encourage us.
J.D. The thing before God would be the assembly service in discipline; "*I* am Gabriel, who stand before God".
J.T. If one would not hear the assembly, let him be as a heathen. "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" (@Matthew 18:18-20). The assembly's position in discipline is here as the authority of heaven, and it represents the mind of heaven. "Whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father." So that it is most serious.
H.H. The two or three might be one brother and two sisters or two brothers and one sister.
J.T. Yes, quite, Simeon and Anna. It would include sisters as well as brothers. We have this remarkable sister, Anna. I would rely on her judgment. If she and Simeon agreed touching anything it would be heard in heaven. Yes, should it not be so? Sisters are enjoined not to speak in the assembly, but as to their weight,
{422}
they would be worth as much as each brother. They do not speak in the assembly nor attend the care meetings.
Ques. Could sisters hold the ground for the breaking of bread for a visiting brother who might come along?
J.T. A local company is composed of that which is there. If there was only one brother there and he was unfit for fellowship, they could withdraw from him. They cannot function audibly, that is, they cannot assemble to function characteristically. Women are not to speak in the assembly. They cannot carry on in the service of God, but they can carry on discipline.
Ques. Is it proper to give a resume of the care meeting at the next prayer meeting for the benefit of those sisters who would not otherwise know what was done?
J.T. They are to ask at home.
Ques. Would the tribe from which Anna came indicate the spiritual power of the sister?
J.T. I think the name of the tribe would show that the new order of things is coming in. It says in @Hebrews 7:14, "For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda." But here this is speaking of another tribe. Melchisedec suggests a priesthood that is not of the tribe of Levi. "For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda."
Rem. What I had in mind was that Anna was of the tribe of Asher and she did not depart from the temple. In spiritual power she maintained a knowledge of the mind of God. Would she indicate that there was spiritual power?
J.T. That is true also. She did not belong to the daughters of Aaron like Elizabeth, yet there is moral power. It is a new order of things. She was one to whom you could go with full confidence. I do not know of one like her. Paul and Silas went to Lydia and saw the brethren. Why did they go to Lydia? She was a leader in spiritual power there.
Rem. Asher would dip his foot in oil.
J.T. Think of a woman like Phoebe! I believe she would be as reliable as any brother there, and we have
{423}
another sister, Priscilla. I am sure she would be as reliable as any brother there. Think of the way Phoebe is spoken of, "Phoebe, our sister" (@Romans 16:1), showing that she really had a place among the brethren. She lived seven miles from Corinth in a town called Cenchrea. Paul says, "She hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also".
It may not be right that a local brother should give a letter of commendation; it is a question of whether the local brother is of value. The letter is only of the same value as the writer. @2 John begins, "The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom *I* love in truth, and not *I* only but also all who have known the truth, for the truth's sake which abides in us and shall be with us to eternity. Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ". John says to her that many deceivers have gone out into the world. "If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not receive him into the house, and greet him not" (verse 10). She could exercise discipline in view of that man.
Rem. You might have in a meeting a disorderly brother and an indifferent brother, and the disorderly brother might get a letter of commendation from the indifferent brother.
J.T. The letter is only worth as much as its writer. God can support what is outwardly right but He never fails to expose their unbelief. But then as here the case is not hopeless. God has given a son in grace. We are in the dispensation of grace, so that Zacharias prophesies, not about his own son, but about Christ. In our present chapter there is no discrepancy in those who are carrying on. The shepherds are caring for their flock by night, and the angel is there. We are not on the outskirts of divine things; we are right in the midst of them. It is no question of geography; it is where you are in your soul. Then there is this wonderful announcement by the angel, "I announce to you glad tidings of
{424}
great joy, which shall be to all the people; for today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord".
Ques. Do you think the saints on the west coast might be in the very centre of things the same as those in London?
H.H. They are getting on very well on the Pacific coast.
J.T. It is a matter of spiritual power. They are in the very centre of things; they are watching the sheep by night. It is without; they are exposed to things. But the angel is there. It is important, that word, abiding without; they are not running in and taking shelter; they are abiding in exposure. They are abiding by things, carrying on the service of God and the angel of the Lord is there. It does not say he came there. How approved they are by heaven! The angel of the Lord is there by them. In @Luke 24 the Lord stood in the midst. He was there. The angel says, "Fear not", and "suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men." It is from glory to glory in Luke. "Fear not, for behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy".
Ques. Would you say a word as to the difference between the service of the angel and the service of the Lord among us?
J.T. Here in this chapter we have not got the service of the Lord yet, but we are dealing here with transitional things. It is Gabriel. It is really a priestly angel and he is ready to help in the service. Then in chapter 2 the angel is with them. It is the very centre of things, "Behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people; for today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord". It is like a word from the Lord in the meeting. What glory! The same was in the temple; the glory of
{425}
the Lord was there. Zacharias needed adjustment and the shepherds were filled with fear. But the angel says to them, "Fear not, for behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy". It is the glory of the Lord. It is transitional here; the glory of the Lord shone around. He would have our minds set at rest. How can we have the service of God if our minds are full of fear? "Behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people ... ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger". They did go and found it even so.
Elizabeth goes to the hill country. Mary is subject. She accepts the position and joins her sister in the hill country. It is spiritual elevation and finally Zacharias comes into the service as a priest and as a prophet. Mary is here and what is said about her is that she kept all these things in her mind, pondering them in her heart. She is a treasury of divine things. She is going through into christianity. We hear of her again in the upper room. She was a treasury, she pondered things. If we do, in due course we will have wealth. We do not hear of Simeon and Anna again, but we do hear of Mary.
Simeon was in the centre of divine thoughts. Jerusalem is the centre of divine things, so that Simeon is a man in Jerusalem. That is his character. That is how he is to be known. He is characteristically a man in Jerusalem. It says, "This man was just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ". He came in the Spirit into the temple. Neither Simeon nor Anna were of the tribe of Levi but Simeon was a priest in a spiritual sense. The conditions were such as to justify the coming in of Christ.
These shepherds are looking after the sheep. They are exposing themselves by night. Mary has kept things in her heart. We value everything that is said that is
{426}
right. Then there is a man in Jerusalem, characteristically a man of Jerusalem, and Anna is a characteristic sister in Jerusalem. So the assembly today is in the centre of divine thoughts.
In Ezekiel we have the highest thought of unity symbolized in the two sticks becoming one. There should be one king and that king should be David. There was writing on the stick for Joseph and then the stick for Judah. If I *am* right, God can take me up sovereignly so that there is one stick in the hand of God.
Ques. Is not that the thought in regard to Anna?
J.T. She represents the ten tribes. Simeon is the principal thought. Simeon is a characteristic man of Jerusalem. "This man was born there" (@Psalm 87:6). Anna lived with her husband seven years. She would be about one hundred and five so that she carries forward much. She carries down Old Testament qualities.
Ques. Would you help us a little on the thought of dwelling in the temple and fasting?
J.T. It is introduced into the new order of things. Think of these two people, Simeon and Anna! What you are doing may seem to be very little. We are enjoying the blessing, you know. It is a positive thing if you come into blessing. "This child is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel". This is crowning the whole position. There is a man able to talk. He is going into the new order of things of placing the gentiles first. It would take away the veil of the gentiles. The position is as clear today as it was at Pentecost. Anna comes in. She is a prophetess. The assembly is composed of brothers and sisters. We are as sure of our position as Peter and John were at Pentecost. The position is clear. God has established it. Is it not underlying Luke's writings that he is really supporting Paul's ministry? Really it is just as certain as at the beginning. There is the establishment of the anointing so that it is just as certain as at the beginning.
{427}
THE SERVICE OF GOD IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (4)
@John 4:15-26
J.T. The subject of the service of God, coming before us from the four evangelists, should be regarded as bearing on ourselves, bearing on the service of God as known now and carried on in a measure. In Matthew we have the idea of worship in a personal sense. The magi had in mind to worship the King of the Jews. They were evidently genuine as bringing with them what was required for the service. The priesthood does not arise simply from the house of Aaron but worshippers were coming in from among the gentiles. They were to worship the King of the Jews. In Luke the worship of God among the Jews is being carried on, only the service is conducted by one who is the true priest according to the Jewish economy, but defective in faith. But nevertheless, the service is being carried on according to the principles governing it and heaven intervenes to help. It is another phase of our position. So that we reach in Luke the principle of recovery, divine help coming in, the thought of worship according to God, the service of God as we have it. Persons who are not seen as Levites or priests are really the true priests. This is a point that ought to be taken into account. Their qualifications are seen in their spiritual ability. That is Simeon and Anna.
Now, we have to consider John; how he is introduced into the service of God bears on the present position. It is hardly touched upon until we come to this chapter, and the subject is introduced by a Samaritan. It was one of mongrel race, not only conventionally but religiously, for we are told in the second book of Kings when the ten tribes were taken captive by the Assyrians, five nations were transplanted into Samaria, each having its own religion, but nominally fearing Jehovah.
{428}
Now it is out of that that we get the introduction of worship, this woman being of that mongrel condition. There were five nations and she had had five husbands. John also introduces five porches in Bethesda. But the moving of the water was only "at a certain season".
It is important to notice here the setting of this phase of our subject. The end with the woman is reached in connection with prophecy, the prophetic word, and then the woman speaks about worship. He said to her, "Thou hast had five husbands", and according to her own report, He told her all things that she had ever done. It brings in self-judgment. Prophetic ministry exposes your condition. The subject of worship is introduced by this woman, but the Lord does not spurn the introduction by her of this deep truth; He speaks about it.
J.D. The desire of the woman would be the water apart from this question of self-judgment, would it not? But the desire of the Lord is to hear all that is in her heart.
J.T. The conversation is remarkable. The Lord as seen at the end of chapter 3 has received all things from the Father, as the Son that is loved. So that it is between the Father and the Son; "the Father loves the Son and has given all things to be in His hand." The Lord is seen in this chapter as on that line, the way of love; He possessing all things from the Father. So that now it is a question of whether we have arrived in the history of the testimony in this dispensation at this basic setting. I think the Lord has helped us greatly as to Sonship and Fatherhood. This chapter brings out the working of it; not simply the family thought but the administrative thought. The two Persons, the Father and the Son operate -- the Father, the Source of all and the Giver of all, and the Son, the Blesser and the Administrator. Love between Them operates. He sat just as He was at the well as if to take up the attitude of bringing out something; which happened. We are told that, "Jesus therefore, being wearied with the way he had come,
{429}
sat just as he was at the fountain". And then the question of living water is raised; and she says to Him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw". Jesus said to her, "Go, call thy husband and come here", and she said, "I have not a husband". Then Jesus said, "Thou hast had five husbands, and he whom now thou hast is not thy husband; this thou hast spoken truly". She says, "I see that thou art a prophet." That is the position. She comes to see something. That is the first time she sees anything spiritual. She sees something, that the Lord Jesus, the Person who is speaking to her, is a Prophet.
J.D. But the Lord says, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water". Do you judge that what was in the mind of the Lord was that He is the Son who is loved by the Father? "Who it is" would be what is entirely personal. "If thou knewest". No one knows the Son but the Father, but if she had known who it was that was speaking to her, she would have asked of Him. He puts things on the basis of knowledge of a divine Person. What knowledge have I of divine Persons? That is the question.
E.McA. Do you connect this with the statement you made in regard to the third chapter? All things are committed into the hands of the Son. He puts things on that basis; He was giving, He could give her living water: "If thou knewest ... who it is."
J.D. The suggestion would be, from your remarks, that we ought to take into our souls that the One who ministers is, in His person, God.
J.T. Yes, I would say that. "Who it is", John tells us later that "He is the true God and eternal life" (@1 John 5:20).
L.S. Would that set us at liberty from the spirit of apostasy that is rampant in the world today? It is
{430}
evidently the apostate circumstances coming forward from 2 Kings.
J.T. Yet it does not hinder the Lord coming there, nor does it hinder light coming into the Samaritan souls. There were the five nations, five different systems of religion, but nevertheless all of them worshipped Jehovah. It was an apostate state of things, but it is not yet the apostasy which God turns away from. The apostle Paul says that the day of the Lord will not come until the apostasy comes first. That is the total turning away from the truth. God abandons it and allows it to develop into the man of sin. That is the development of sin. The man of sin will exalt himself above all called God or that is worshipped. That is, he is the supreme object of worship. He exalts himself above all that is called God. That settles the matter, that is the finish. God deals with that immediately. The Lord will consume him with the sword of His mouth. That is apostasy in the complete thought of it. But this is apostasy according to 2 Kings because they carried forward their own systems of worship, these five nations, but they also recognized Jehovah, so that it is not apostasy in the ultimate sense. The man of sin will set himself up as a rival of God, showing himself to be God. That is total apostasy, but this is not that. For although they worshipped God according to their own systems of worship, Jehovah is recognized, and God is acting in grace toward it. When we say that apostasy marks christendom, it is not the real apostasy because God is still owned. This woman is an example of the kind of person that we may get. She had the idea of worship. How would it come into her mind? Evidently because she was convicted of her sin. The power of conviction was there in the prophetic ministry.
J.D. What was official was being slighted in that it was a Samaritan woman, but what He is bringing in is something new in this woman.
{431}
J.T. In the 27th verse it says, "And upon this came his disciples, and wondered that he spoke with a woman; yet no one said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?" That is the official side. They had gone into the city to buy bread. They are not helping at all. The official side is not helping. They are not exactly opposed here but they are in a dangerous position. They are questioning what He is doing. But the woman left her waterpot and came into the city. She is really sincere in this matter. Whatever the disciples think about her, she knows what she is doing. She has light in her soul. The Lord did not tell her to go into the city, but she did it, and it was successful.
"But meanwhile the disciples asked him saying, Rabbi, eat. But he said to them, I have food to eat which ye do not know. The disciples therefore said to one another, Has any one brought him anything to eat?" (verses 32,33). That is, the disciples were ignorant. They did not understand the position. So that the woman represents the service.
H.H. Do you regard that on the line of need? The woman said, "Give me to drink". Eternal life is connected with our need, while sonship is connected with God's need.
J.T. Eternal life is the subject of promise; sonship is the subject of counsel. Eternal life is our need; sonship ministers to God's need. It is worth saying again. That would come out, but the position of this woman here as in relation to the disciples is worthy of note. They are questioning what happened. She leaves her waterpot behind her. Why did she do that? The light is that she has discovered that she is a vessel for divine use. Now then the whole question of their position is discussed. The Lord says, "My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work. Do not ye say, that there are yet four months and the harvest comes? Behold I say to you, Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest. He that reaps receives
{432}
wages and gathers fruit unto life eternal, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together. For in this is verified the true saying, It is one who sows and another who reaps. I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured; others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours" (verses 34-38). That defines their position. He is telling them they are not inaugurators. The woman is inaugurating something and what they have done is to enter into another's labours.
B.H. He is in a position of administration and this passage shows how He is operating. If you have light in your soul, He says, ' Come into it '. She has learned something.
J.D. I think I see the importance of what you say. This conversation with the woman is not allowed to be broken into until it is finished. "I who speak to thee am he." Then the disciples come into the scene. The Lord will not allow any official interference as to who He is.
J.T. She does not stand around to see what these men are going to say to the Lord. She leaves them and she left her waterpot. Why is that waterpot left there? Why did she not use it? She had learned something; that she was a waterpot.
C.T. There is no movement until her conscience is reached through the prophetic ministry. This is the power that she sees that causes her to move forward. When He told her that she had had five husbands, she says, "I see that thou art a prophet". John says, "Come and see".
J.D. Spiritual vision is tested in John, beginning with "Come and see". They would respond to the woman's invitation if there was any spiritual vision at all. But now she says, "I see."
R.W.S. Does she still define the whole position? She says, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship". She is ready to learn.
{433}
J.T. We have often remarked that it was unsuitable for her to bring up this question of worship, but I do not think that it was. The conscience of a man who comes into the meeting and hears a prophetic word is convicted. He is convicted of all. He falls down and worships God (@1 Corinthians 14:25).
L.S. It is an interesting matter that in all the prophets the outcome is worship at the close of their prophetic service.
J.T. It is very interesting; the principle is addition in the prophets. Take Habakkuk; see what he left in his book; see what a contribution he made to the service of God, and Isaiah too!
H.H. Do you think the prophetic word exposes the moral condition in view of opening up what is spiritual? This woman says, "I see that thou art a prophet." She had not viewed the Lord as being greater than all that. I thought the application might be the prophetic word dealing with the moral side of things in order that she might be made free for the worship of God as He is revealed in Christ.
J.T. That is what the prophetic word is for. The law was the assertion of the rights of God at Sinai. That is for "those who love Me". Therefore the Mosaic ritual was immediately in strength. The service of God was begun. They were there to serve Him. "Let my people go, that they may serve me" (@Exodus 8:1). It was a beginning there. The law is given in @Exodus 20. @Exodus 6 gives the genealogy of the priesthood down to Phinehas. Phinehas has secured for God the priesthood in a living way and Moses and Aaron are reached, the vessels God used to establish His service. "This is that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts" (@Exodus 6:26). They are introduced in connection with the service. We know how in the history it broke down and the prophets begin there, all the prophets from Samuel. Samuel is really the beginning
{434}
of the prophets, and the idea is to call the people back to the service of God so that the law and prophets are until John. Now here the thought is a prophet. She says, "I see that thou art a prophet". It is to bring in the service of God; the whole point is the service of God. "Let my people go that they may serve me". The prophetic word here is the point to get at. She sees that He is a prophet.
J.D. In your address last night you spoke about the Lord having received gifts in Man so that Jehovah might dwell among men. The Lord was making room for a dwelling place for God in the worship of God.
J.T. The final thought is His service. We shall serve Him eternally, not in apostasy or defection. The true way to secure worship is through the prophetic ministry.
L.B. Would the example of the ten lepers fit in here? They show what we have already had. The nine go to the priest and show themselves according to the law of Moses, but the tenth man did not go. He sees that the real Priest is the One who cleansed him. He came back to Him.
J.McK. He found the fountain of water springing up in him, and the result is that God is glorified.
J.T. Our becoming a vessel of living water precedes the idea of worship.
L.S. Why did she bring up the question, "Art thou greater?". She had something before her of greatness.
J.T. You understand how she would have these thoughts. "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain", she says; "Art thou greater than our father Jacob?" The Lord did not discuss that with her that He was greater than Jacob. He got at her soul. He could see the dissatisfaction.
R.W.S. "Our fathers worshipped". There is public worship and personal worship. The word here is the same as in @Matthew 2 where it is a personal matter, but I think it is used in a wide sense here. "Our fathers
{435}
worshipped", it is a collective idea, "in this mountain".
J.T. I think she had in mind the public worship of God. She said, "Ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship". It is pretty much the sense in which the other word for public worship is used. It is changeable under certain circumstances. "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father". I think it is a question of what they had in the Samaritan mountain largely, and what the Jews had in Jerusalem largely. It was the magi in the east who came to worship the Son, It is the service of God in mind.
H.H. Following up this line, the system of worship in reference to the fathers would include other features that come out later in the gospel of John. Then we have to take account of these other thoughts. Peter corresponds to the woman here. She is a vessel. That is the point the Lord is stressing; living water springing up into everlasting life. That must enter into the worship of the service of God. The Lord says in chapter 12, "While ye have the light believe in the light". I think that she becomes a son of light in that she left her waterpot. She is a vessel to honour that is usable. Peter has the light in chapter 6 and he says, "To whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". Peter represents experience. It is instantaneous with the woman. The Lord is now the Minister of the sanctuary.
J.D. The Lord here seems to make eternal life the result of something, the result of "the water that I shall give him"; a well of water springing up. What connection would there be between this and @Romans 6:21: "What fruit therefore had ye *then* in the things of which ye are *now* ashamed? For the end of *them* is death. But *now*, having got your freedom from sin, and having become bondmen to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life". What would be the relation between the two passages?
{436}
J.T. The point here is the actual water of life whereas @Romans 6 is the moral side, that is, the question of righteousness, but you reach it on the line of life, through righteousness. "Ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life". It is by the principle of righteousness.
H.H. Whatever the ecclesiastical order, this that is living asserts itself and reaches the proper level in relation to divine worship.
J.T. Worship came to light in this way. Peter is the continuation of this thought. She is a son of light. Peter is a son of light in that he recognizes the Minister of the sanctuary, the holy One of God.
L.S. How would you fit @John 9 into this?
J.T. We have already touched on that, and of course, it fits in; the Lord finding one who was a son of light. You can see one after another appearing as sons of light. I believe the man in @John 9 is a son of light just when he says, "Lord, I believe," and he worshipped Him. The Lord says, "I must work ... while it is day. The night is coming." It is while it is day. Well, the end is that he believes on the Son of God and he worships. The Lord would bring him to that point to make a way for the one flock and one Shepherd.
H.H. The word *son* is used in John. Where it is used as to believers, we are not called sons of God, but sons of light. Is it not of outstanding moral importance, to have this living water that rises to its proper level so that the thing is held in a spiritual way?
J.T. That underlies the worship of God in our own times. It marks the worship as living. John again is told to measure the worshippers in Revelation. Well, it is not simply those who worship in terms but in a living way. The worship in the systems is largely a question of terms borrowed from the five nations and many more than five, but five is the principle, each with its own profession. Over against that you have the Jews here. Who are these Jews? We want to understand that
{437}
in the abstract. They are really those who are so in spirit and in heart. Salvation is of them. What have you got? You do not know what you are worshipping. Salvation is of the Jews. Therefore we are dealing with reality from the Lord's point of view. In Athens they worshipped they knew not what; the unknown God.
H.H. The woman would be professedly satisfied that salvation was of the Jews. She was looking for the Messiah. The work goes on through this woman. Whatever people think about her, the work goes on through her.
Rem. The woman speaks of our father Jacob and she speaks of our fathers worshipping in this mountain. The Lord speaks to her and says that the Father seeks such as worshippers, and having taken this into her soul and responded to the Lord as a Prophet speaking to her, she immediately goes about to seek those to worship the Father.
J.T. What God has done is to bring in the Father and the Son. The Lord brings her immediately to the one Father and He has need, a very touching matter. God has greatly helped the brethren in regard of the Father and the Son. The Lord has in His mind one Father. That is what He brings out here. We get instruction we do not get anywhere else. He does not say that God is seeking worshippers, but the Father is seeking worshippers. Why should the Lord bring such a wonderful fact before a woman like this? The secret is that she is convicted. She is worthy of it.
Here it is the christian economy that is in mind, but it is the Father that is seeking worshippers. You understand how He tells John to measure the worshippers. The Lord is not here seen as the Minister of the sanctuary. He is in chapter 6. They are all carried forward to chapter 20, "My Father and your Father," but here we are dealing with the economy, that is the Father and the Son.
{438}
E.McA. Would the Lord reach as to this woman's soul the other things she was occupied with? Now God uses what is of the Lord to bring her in touch with what is spiritual.
J.T. The secret of the uplifting in power is that the water springs up. I need, not only light to worship God, but I need power.
E.McA. In your remarks this afternoon, it is in order to allow us to move out of the sphere of the official more, and see that God is moving on the line of what is spiritual. I am to love God with all my heart, all my soul and all my strength.
J.T. The fountain became a fountain of living water springing up. We need power to reach God. "I have borne you on eagles¬ wings" (@Exodus 19:4), not simply by light but by power. By making the living water mine, I not only see that I have living water, but power. The Spirit is the power. Christ is the official Minister of the sanctuary but the Spirit is the power. We begin, not only with light, but with the Spirit. So that I say, "Lord Jesus", by the Holy Spirit. That gives a touch to the meeting.
J.D. Not only have we the Holy Spirit given us by Christ but we make room in our hearts for the Spirit.
J.T. He is seen as the Spirit of adoption, you might say the Spirit of the Father. He is here to serve us. That is collateral with the Lord's own service in chapter 6. In chapter 7 the Lord contemplated personal drinking. "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink. He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive". It is one thing to look upon the Spirit of God as a gift and another thing as having received Him. So that it is the Spirit of the glorified Christ that I have received and that Spirit carries me to the full height, to God in His service, in heavenly
{439}
places. Hence we are raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.
L.S. "God is a spirit; and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth". Would you say a word on that verse!
J.T. That is one of the greatest statements in our subject. We are told that angels are spirits too. We must make greater room in our souls for God as a Spirit. It is the nearest thought you can get to absoluteness in God. The point here is that if we are to worship Him, it cannot be merely in forms or by queries, but it must be on the principle of spirit, not the Holy Spirit, but the word spirit as meaning vital principle; the spirit of the covenant.
J.D. When the Lord says here, "God is a spirit", has He in mind the Deity or has He in mind the Father in the Deity?
J.T. We have to keep in mind that the Father is God. It is a question of the economy into which He has come. There is something introduced that is in keeping with God, so that the truth would govern us, that is the truth of the economy; that truth governs us in our approach to God in worship. The thought of praise is eliminated. It is a question of the state of the saints. Jerusalem is being exposed by the candles.
H.H. "The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly" (@Proverbs 20:27). God would search Jerusalem with candles. God was searching Jerusalem and found nothing for God.
J.T. The Lord stressed that He is the light of the world. He is dealing with one who is to be a vessel in the new system. The candle of the Lord is the spirit. God has access to you through it. God's counsel is full of that thought to bring out the sons of light. His desire is that I may be a fully developed person in regard of light. The light is sweet. John is giving you light. This woman got light in her soul. Her movement was in relation to the great movements of the luminaries.
{440}
All the way through they are sons of light like the stars moving in relation to the great Centre, so this question of worship is set down in connection with this person.
J.D. If you live, you are luminous. The life is the light. It is a reciprocal proposition all the way through. If I have got that life, it becomes light in me. At Bethany there were Martha, Mary and Lazarus. They were all in their places in relation to the great Luminary. That would stand connected with love.
J.T. This woman says, "Is not this the Christ?". Is that the shining showing that she had the light? He had just told her. But it was not that she believed what He told her, but it was a question of how the light affected her inwardly. The men of the city are affected by her words and they become luminaries. The prophetic ministry produces the living state. She is in the system. Room is made for the Lord in Samaria. He stayed there two days. You would like to know what house He stayed in there. It would be one suitable to Him.
You have a raised man at Bethany. The three of them, Mary, Martha and Lazarus were sitting around the Lord as the Luminary, worshipping Him. "Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment". The ministry at Bethany comes before chapter 20 which rises to the full height of christianity.
J.McK. "The hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father". The woman goes into the city in testimony, but the Lord is leading them outside of the world altogether. Is that our position now? Her testimony set them in movement so that you come to the great thought of the Saviour of the world; not the light of the Jews, but the light of the world. "But many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman who bore witness, He told me all things that I had ever done".
{441}
R.W.S. This is very stimulating that God can operate in such difficult circumstances in making us luminaries. "Among whom ye shine as lights in the world" (@Philippians 2:15).
-.H. This would form a moral basis for the heavenly city. It came down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God.
C.T. Would you say there are many small lights? "And more a great deal believed on account of his word."
J.T. Anyone who gets light will see Christ; he will seek after the Lord. She did not say, ' Come here ', but, "Come, see a man".
{442}
THE SERVICE OF GOD IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (5)
@Mark 1:1-11, 29-31
J.T. This gospel affords much less material for our subject than the other three. The introduction of the service of God in this gospel relates rather to those who serve God. Those who serve God need service too. So that we have Mark himself, the writer of this gospel, spoken of as ministering to two great servants, that is, Paul and Barnabas. He failed indeed, but he was restored, because the apostle Paul says of him in later years that he was profitable to him for ministry. It can be understood, therefore, how this gospel would bring forward this feature.
So John the baptist is immediately introduced in this gospel and the prophet Isaiah who speaks of him, says, "Behold, *I* send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way". His ministry was preparatory to Christ.
In order that what is before us may be clearly understood, I would say that Matthew has been regarded as bringing in worshippers of Christ, an important phase of the truth. Magi from the east came to worship the King of the Jews. They expressly came to do that. Then Luke gives us much more for our subject than any of the others. He introduces a son of Aaron and a daughter of Aaron as if to call attention to the service of God as coming down from the old economy, and God still ready to help, so that the angel appears to Zacharias on the right of the altar of incense in the holy place as he serves. He shows that there was, underneath that service, unbelief, and discipline comes in. But Zacharias is restored so that he is not only a priest, but a prophet by the Spirit of God. In @Luke 2 the priesthood is seen, not carried on by the sons of Aaron but by persons manifestly
{443}
qualified according to the new order of priesthood. Of course, Christ is the great high Priest, stated to be of the tribe of Juda. A change in priesthood is taking place. It is not merely legal, but it is in power. Simeon and Anna come in in that way, but having no connection with the sons of Aaron. In the fourth reading, the gospel of John introduces worship from the lips of a Samaritan woman. She introduces the subject and the Lord Jesus takes it up and gives us wonderful instruction, telling us that God is a Spirit and must be worshipped in spirit and in truth, and that the Father seeks worshippers. Now we have come to Mark, and it was remarked that he furnishes less material than any of the other evangelists. But he commences with "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ", and there is this preparatory ministry which is immediately introduced. "Behold *I* send my messenger before thy face".
So that John the baptist should be before us now in order to bring out this ministry. This principle runs down in the service of God. There are those who serve in a secondary way, but it is all the service of God. The Gibeonites were brought in in a remarkable way; they were hewers of wood and drawers of water but they belonged to the service. So that, however we come into the congregation, we are under divine protection. However menial our service it belongs to the service.
H.H. I wondered if it had any relation to the present day.
J.T. John the baptist deserves consideration as he is presented in each of the gospels. John the evangelist gives us a more spiritual view of his service than any of the others do. It shows how entirely unselfish he was. He was so unjealous that when the Jews sent from Jerusalem to make much of him he denied not, but said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness". Although John was older than the Lord Jesus he was morally after Him. He said, "The latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose" (@John 1:23,27).
{444}
E.McA. Would you connect the presentation of John with what you brought out in regard to Zacharias? He had been adjusted. Now you get John appearing on the scene as a result of that exercise and he immediately speaks of Christ rather than of himself.
J.T. I think that is the principle that governs our subject this morning; what this service is. Who is ready to carry it on? I have got to take a second place, secondary but essential. John is outstanding as representing this principle. Luke gives what is seen in John the baptist. His name was to be John. John means grace; gracious, ready to serve others. Elisha poured water on the hands of Elijah. That was secondary service but it was a very important one. It enabled Elijah to serve better. He was the leading man at the time. It is to promote what there is and make it as good as possible.
L.S. The great remark from this section of Isaiah is, "Behold your God!" and it is in regard of serving (@Isaiah 40:9), so that it brings out the deity of Christ. We are impressed with that here. "Behold *I* send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way".
J.T. We are to serve a great Servant. Mark is prepared to serve Jesus, Son of God. Our position is to serve a great Person to begin with. We are subsidiary. It is in the wilderness, as not calling you to anything in the flesh. You are not going to be made any distinctive person. It is to be subsidiary to a great idea. It is the Son of God, carrying the thought of His Person. "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ."
E.McA. Is there an indication in the food and clothing of John the baptist of his subsidiary spirit? It is that by which he is sustained and maintained.
J.T. It is remarkable that we get his clothing and food. You are at once reminded that you do not need to expect gratification for your flesh if you are to be with Him because the idea is that we are to be prepared, and John is to be preparatory, to prepare His way, to present Him. Luke says that he was in the deserts until the
{445}
time came for his showing unto Israel. He has removed all thought of natural gratification in the service of God. He is making His ways straight.
Ques. Would making His ways straight involve ministry in a prophetic sense and working among the saints with that in view?
J.T. The prophet is working with souls to make room for Christ. The way is not physical in the sense of making roadways. John is baptising in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. There must be the dealing with sins. There is so much lawlessness today: persons who have turned away from the truth and great systems that have been built up around us. The baptism of John brought into our own times is that there should be the acknowledgment of that. In dealing with the present situation there must be the acknowledgment of guilt. If I am building up that system I am committing sin.
J.D. That would be the first preparatory service, making room for Christ on the basis of repentance.
J.T. So that in the next chapter we get a man who was a paralytic, a man that had no power. He could not carry his circumstances; his circumstances carried him. He had no power, but four persons carried him to Christ and let him down on his bed, through the roof to where Jesus was. The whole circumstances of the man are brought and let down through the roof before the Lord, and the first thing the Lord says to him is, "Thy sins are forgiven thee."
L.S. Do you think that Peter in his epistle would have this in mind when he says, "This is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you" (@1 Peter 1:25)? I was thinking of the connection in the soul of the word that is preached in the glad tidings and what it effects in regard of the moral sin question.
J.T. Peter says, Let none of you suffer for sins. If I am disciplined for sin what glory is it? "Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that
{446}
he might bring us to God" (@1 Peter 3:18). The Lord says, "Child, thy sins are forgiven thee". This man is brought into the new order of things. He goes out carrying his bed. Evidently he had been at the meeting, a religious man. "Begin not to say in yourselves, We have Abraham for our father". That will not do. "The axe is applied to the root of the trees" (@Luke 3:8,9).
H.H. The servant needs to know what sin is, otherwise sins may be dealt with lightly.
J.T. This is an important point in relation to service. How can he deal with a soul to help him to bring him to repentance? One has gone there himself. It is the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. I am going into the water but I am going to repent, but it is for the remission of sins. So we get all Jerusalem going out to him. They had no place there otherwise. That is his ministry. That is the way he is preparing for the Lord.
R.W.S. Is it now the thought of another world and is that why there should be such clearness in regard to the repentance?
J.T. Quite so. It is connected with the gospel here; it is the "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God".
H.H. Would "Jesus Christ" refer to the order of man, so that repentance is necessary so as to change over to that order of man from the sinful order with which I have been connected?
J.T. Paul, in @Romans 1:1 says, "Paul, bondman of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated to God's glad tidings". Paul enlarges on things to this point. That is the order of man. It is a question of the gospel here, the beginning of it. It is a very abrupt introduction, but it is the sort of thing needed in dealing with a supreme matter of this kind. It is the beginning of it, and now we are to have to do with the entering in of it.
H.H. Do you think in a certain sense you get suggestions in this chapter and the one that follows of the
{447}
recovery of Mark, the adjustment of himself, by bringing before us One who is perfect in service?
J.T. I think that is the thought. The book of Jonah was written by Jonah and he had judged everything. Repentance must be present. Here it is in the wilderness and the baptism is said to be of repentance for remission of sins. It is characterized by repentance and it is for, and in view of, the remission of sins. And remission of sins requires, not only repentance, but confession.
E.McA. You mean to say that the reason I might not be getting on in these great truths of God is because I have not recognized the height of the glories of God on account of not having a moral foundation in my soul? That helps me in the progress upward.
J.T. The foundation has to be laid. Luke says there is joy in heaven over a repenting sinner. I never cease to be a repenting sinner down here. That is the word used in @Luke 15.
H.H. A man does not forgive himself. If I have done what is wrong, I must remember it.
J.T. Repenting sinners are remarkable in Luke and cause joy in heaven every day. "There shall be joy in heaven for one repenting sinner, more than for ninety and nine righteous who have no need of repentance" (chapter 15:7). The men of Ephesus knew only the baptism of John. They stood for all the doctrine that was introduced by John's ministry. In @Acts 19:1-3), it says, "Paul ... finding certain disciples ... said to them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed? And they said to him, We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come. And he said, To what then were ye baptised? And they said, To the baptism of John". In the previous chapter it is said of Apollos that he "taught exactly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John" (chapter 18:25). But John taught, saying that they should believe on Him that was coming after him. Now, as soon as Paul states the truth, it says that these twelve men were baptised
{448}
to the name of the Lord Jesus. Fine men those are to begin with in Ephesus, and they get the christian position in baptism. Peter refers to the ark and says, "Into which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: which figure also now saves you, even baptism" (@1 Peter 3:20,21). So that we have in Peter the idea of salvation by water, by baptism, and Paul says we are saved by power -- two important points in the truth.
J.D. I like your remark in regard to going into the water of baptism. You go in as a repentant one.
E.McA. Is that why it says they were baptised unto the name of the Lord Jesus in @Acts 19:5 rather than just Jesus? "When they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus". Is that a recognition of our sinful condition and acceptance of the authority of the Lord?
J.T. Quite so. It is to the name of the Lord Jesus. That is, you are moving that way. You are committing yourself in that way in being baptised to that name. In @Acts 10:47,48, Peter directs that they should baptise Cornelius in the name of the Lord: "Can anyone forbid water that these should not be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as *we* also did?" This is another thing. The first is I am committed to that and I am willing to be committed to it, but Peter's thought is you are in it in power. The presentation is different. Baptism is not only a form. Paul would have you understand that there is power attached to it. There is power connected with it.
L.S. Would you say a word as to the last chapter of Matthew, baptism to the name of the Father ...?
J.T. @In Matthew 28:19, the disciples were to baptise to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. It is the same presentation as @Acts 19. Your baptism introduces you into all the blessed rights of the divine economy represented in the Father and the Spirit. In the name of the Lord Jesus is power and protection. Baptism to the name of the Lord is committal;
{449}
baptism in the name is power and protection. He that believes and is baptised shall be saved. It is a current thing.
Ques. You are speaking of the power being in the name. "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth" (@Matthew 28:18). It is in that name. Would you say the principle of baptism remains?
A.McN. Do you say that the principles of baptism are maintained on the principle of repentance, making room for the Lord to come in and work with them at the end of the book?
J.T. It works out at the end of the book. The first nine verses of @Mark 16 leave us with a very uncertain state of things, even amongst the women. The Lord takes the matter up and brings out steadfastness. He takes up the eleven and deals with them in a disciplinary way and rebukes them for their unbelief. Having adjusted them He says to them, "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation". The message is to preach to the creation, those with whom we have been linked. That is how the matter stands. "He that disbelieves shall be condemned" (@Mark 16:16).
J.D. What is the relation between John's clothing and food and the levitical service that might mark one today? Would you say something about it?
J.T. We would certainly wish that all those here, the young people, might have it before them, this matter of repentance. How is the way of the Lord to be made? What happened here was that there went out to him all the district of Judaea and they were baptised by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. We are not secondary in this matter. We are preparing the way for the great Minister, the Servant of God. How much way have I made for Christ? You have not made any unless you have produced repentance. That is the great point in ministry, to lead to self-judgment.
H.H. Would going out to John and to the Jordan and being baptised, mean that you renounced everything
{450}
in self-judgment? In this way there is opportunity for a new start.
J.T. What is presented here very briefly is a result of John's ministry. Mark gives you the results immediately. Think of the result here. There went out to him all the district of Judaea and they were baptised by him, confessing their sins.
Ques. This is the great, broad principle of confession of sins. To whom is the confession made, to God or to the brethren?
J.T. I would say to confess to God. The evangelist says, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins" (@1 John 1:9). There is joy in heaven every time you move in this direction.
L.S. That would be the point in the book of Jonah; the greatness of the sackcloth and the city of Nineveh in repentance.
J.T. God hears Jonah and he is vomited and sent to Nineveh a recovered man. Then there is the wonderful result. That is to say they repented, from the king down, in sackcloth and ashes. They covered the cattle as well as the people. How general the idea was. Where did they get the sackcloth?
J.K. Do I understand that as this baptism is really entered into, the result of it will be seen in the change in food and clothing and then speaking of the greatness of the Person?
J.T. Before the food and clothing of John the baptist is mentioned, you get the success of his ministry. Mark gives you the facts of his success to show that he was entirely successful. He moved the whole of Judaea and Jerusalem. They came out confessing their sins; all the people having been baptized. Luke gives you much more but Mark confines himself to the success of the servant. Now he tells you the kind of clothing he wore.
-.L. Would you say something about the confession of our sins?
{451}
J.T. Sometimes the enemy would say that is just an accident; that is not God speaking to you. I think John the baptist's ministry is intended for that. It is the baptism of repentance and we are able to say, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins". Well, if that is so you might say, ' I do not need to confess to the brethren '. But there are matters that must be brought to the assembly and judged there.
Rem. You are laying a pretty serious task before one who preaches the gospel. There must be a thoroughness in his own soul before he can stir another one. The work of the confession of their sins stood. It is the thoroughness of the work so that the Spirit of God may endorse the thing. It is not just a question of counting the numbers that have confessed the Lord.
J.T. We are so apt to be shallow.
R.W.S. Are there not certain things that spiritual persons can restore when a person is taken in a fault?
J.T. There are certain things that must be brought to the assembly.
G.H. Would you make the distinction between confessing before the person individually and confessing before the assembly?
J.T. In regard to confessing to one another, it might be nothing more than that you might get help from the one you confess to. There can be no forgiveness except by God. Even if I forgive you that does not settle the matter. You are to settle it with God.
Rem. What would the fruits worthy of repentance be?
J.T. They would show that you really judged the matter. Your sin is not really judged unless you forsake it. It is the forsaking of it that shows that you are judging it.
L.B. Is repentance connected with one's state and the thought of confessing with the acts committed?
J.T. You have got to make confession.
{452}
-.B. Would you help us a little more as to coming to the door of the tabernacle; that is coming to the assembly?
J.T. If something is a public matter that causes disgrace to the testimony, the matter should be settled before that person takes public part.
In regard to his clothing, it says, "And John was clothed in camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey". They had already confessed their sins and here is John's garb, as if to say it is no wonder that God uses him. His circumstances are in keeping with the truth. What do you say, Mr. D.?
J.D. I think that is the idea. There was nothing about him that would appeal to the social side, or would exalt the flesh, and it is a witness to the power of the ministry. He was in full keeping with what he was saying. So the servant today should be in full keeping with what he is setting forth.
J.T. If I am an evangelist, what kind of clothing do I wear? What is my food? We know well enough what goes on abroad but what about the clothing of the people of God and their food and living associations? John dwelt in the deserts. He was clothed with camel's hair and a leathern girdle about his loins. He was entirely in keeping with the superiority of his ministry.
E.McA. His father was told that he was not to drink wine. The camel's hair would indicate that he was in full keeping with the committal to God.
J.T. In the camel is external simplicity setting forth what is internal.
J.McK. Is there an allusion in the thought of the camel's hair to what is characteristic of John? What would mark John would be what the camel's hair suggests.
J.T. Matthew's account is remarkable. John is speaking of the Lord here. But in Matthew the Lord is speaking of John to the crowds and He says, "What went
{453}
ye out ... to see?" I am professedly in fellowship, what have I come out to see? A reed shaken by the wind? (@Matthew 11:7). The Lord is going over this matter with those who were professedly affected by John's ministry. That is a fine tribute. That is the Lord speaking of him. "John has come neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon. The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and they say, "Behold, a man that is eating and wine-drinking, a friend of tax-gathers, and of sinners". The Lord is now pointing out the difference between Himself and John. That is what they say of John and that is what they say of Jesus. No matter how you come, if from God, they will speak against you. John is wearing the clothing that is suitable to his ministry, showing that he is a successful servant. They are confessing their sins. His clothing was of camel's hair. That was what marked John in the desert. "And he preached, saying, There comes he that is mightier than I after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to stoop down and unloose. *I* indeed have baptised you with water, but *he* shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit."
J.B. The conditions would be very different in Mark and Luke.
J.T. The camel's hair is undoubtedly suitable to the wilderness. He maintains his wilderness character; he paves the way for Christ. "*He* shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit".
-.L. Is there significance in the fact that the camel can drink and hold a greater amount of water than any other creature?
J.T. That brings in another matter. Think of Rebecca drawing water for Abraham's servant and his ten camels until they had drunk enough.
Then verse 9, "And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptised by John at the Jordan. And straightway going up from the water, he saw the heavens parting asunder, and the
{454}
Spirit, as a dove, descending upon him". We have now the Lord Jehovah coming in, the way has been made for Him. It is Jehovah coming in in this lowly way. Have I made way for the Lord, is the great question for the servants.
J.D. Do you think there is an allusion to the thought of the Deity, "There comes he that is mightier than I after me"?
J.T. John has made a way for Jesus in the heart of souls. "And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptised by John at the Jordan. And straightway going up from the water, he saw the heavens parting asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descending upon him. And there came a voice out of the heavens: *Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight". The way is made for Him and He is here in His glory. It was a most wonderful scene and John had made a way for this. John had made a public way for the Lord to come in among a repenting people.
"But after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh; repent and believe in the glad tidings" (verses 14,15). The service is now begun.
J.McK. I would like to ask if you could help in connection with, "Straightway going up from the water". What is involved in that, from the water, not out of the water?
J.T. The Lord was going in the way made for Him and now heaven is waiting for this. He goes up from the water. Straightway going up from the water, he saw the heavens parted and the Spirit descending upon Him. Mark only gives you the word from heaven to the Lord Himself. Jehovah has come in this way and heaven owns it, so the position is now set for the service of the Lord to go on.
{455}
J.D. What was your point in the last scripture; Simon's wife's mother being raised up and she ministering to them?
J.T. In Simon's mother-in-law we have an instance of how a sister may serve those who are in service. Persons in service need to be served. This evangelist says of the mother-in-law of Peter when she was restored, "Straightway the fever left her, and she served them", that is, the Lord and those who were with Him. Those who are serving need service and it is a great matter to see that there is provided what they need. We get illustrations of this throughout the epistles, how the servants of God were provided for; received in peoples¬ houses. All this is very important.
C.T. "In thee I have found my delight," is that the sanction for service?
J.T. Heaven approves you to yourself, not with others, to encourage you. So that here heaven says, "*Thou* art my beloved Son." It is for the Lord Himself in this position. Immediately after that the Spirit drives Him out into the wilderness.
{456}
MAN AS IN THE MIND OF GOD
@1 Timothy 2:5; @Psalm 68:18; @John 17:6,7; @1 Corinthians 14:20
I wish to speak about man, that is man as God had him in His mind before he existed. Man had the chief place in the thoughts of God.
Sonship existed before man existed, in the angels, who historically were prior to man. It is the family relationship idea in which man stands with God that was in mind. So it is, "let us make man" (not sons) in our image, after our likeness" (@Genesis 1:26). The term man includes male and female, an idea which is not dropped, but culminates in the assembly. It is a final thought, so the tabernacle of God will be with men. Then the idea of sex will be confined to Christ and the assembly.
I began with Paul's letter to Timothy -- we too begin with Paul -- and he brings Christ in here in a race or order of being, that is, man. Verse 1 says prayers are to "be made for all men". Those of us who form the assembly, have the nearest place in the economy. So as we come into the variety and gradations, it is seen that we of the assembly have the leading place. Man is taken up, and placed higher than the angels, in sonship. Christ was made a little lower than the angels to suffer death, and bring about God's thought for man. God is *One*, but calling Him Lord is addressing Him as "God our Saviour". So it is "supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men", for all men are included and our Saviour God desires "that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth". What a being a man is in that way, to come into truth! It is a verity in His mind, a divine thought for man. The Deity is now expressed in the Father, but not exclusively. God is *One*, in the sense of infinite unity, as if it were one Person; and one Mediator, the Man Christ Jesus, -- refers to the Lord Jesus in manhood, that is, in babyhood,
{457}
in boyhood, and manhood -- manhood here when He began to be about thirty years of age. We see that heaven expresses its delight in Him as *Man*, -- the Man, Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all, not one human being is left out. The apostle here says that he lies not, but speaks the truth, and he became the means of drawing attention to Him.
A real believer always speaks of the Man. The Lord challenges the disciples with the question, "Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?" There are great men of the earth and they command our attention, but the Lord questions His own as to what men were saying about the Lord Himself. So we need to be able to give an answer as to Him, for we cannot give an account of the hope that is in us without speaking of the Lord Jesus. So "if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved" (@Romans 10:9).
The woman of Samaria is the best example of a believer calling the Lord Jesus Christ a Man. He said to her, "If thou knewest ... " It was intended to impress her mind; no doubt it did. If any one asked her, she could say what He said to her, for she got this from His own lips. She had had to do with men, yet she says, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done" (@John 4:10,29). She was learning to be a levite. She was not a parrot; she knew in her own soul about this Man, who had told her all things that she had ever done. If she had been asked what she thought of Him, she would say, I think He is the Christ! "Come, see a man"; she saw the Man, and knew Him and she says, "Is not he the Christ". The apostle John's leading thought is, "Come and see". Do not be an unbeliever; come and see.
Now look at another man, Pilate, just an unconverted man, though no doubt his wife was converted. He was a capable man of judgment, and he saw no cause of death in the Man before him -- Christ; but he was a thorough politician. The Lord said nothing to Herod,
{458}
but He spoke quite freely to Pilate. Yet think of it! Pilate scourged the Lord. Think of that body scourged by Pilate! After that they mocked Him, and Pilate allowed the soldiers to mock and spit upon Him, and then he brought Him forth, with the marks of the scourging and blows on the face, with the purple robe and crown of thorns, and said: "Behold the man"! How do we look at Him? "Behold your king!" He is falsely clothed. Just note what a marked difference between this wicked unconverted governor, and a believer's thought of the Lord Jesus. Behold the Man!
David was a fit vessel to write the Psalms, in that sense all believers should be men. The assembly is not composed of boys and girls but men; not that babes will not be saved. Fellowship in the assembly involves being a man. If a child of twelve comes forward to break bread and acts like a man of twenty, all right, it is suitable. But it is not suitable for children, running about and playing as twelve year-olds, to come up to take a man's place in the assembly. The thought is to put on manhood. Look at David, when but a youth he took a lamb from the mouth of the lion, and so proved himself a man. There was power in the spirituality of Samuel when he said, "We will not sit down till he come" (@1 Samuel 16:11). You say this will inflate the youth, but no -- he is a man, he will not be inflated. David was a sober man of strength. David slew Goliath, indeed he did, and took the head to Jerusalem. It is like Christ, he "led captivity captive". Jacob also was identified with all that speaks of manhood; he dwelt in tents with his father Isaac and his grandfather, Abraham.
The manhood of Christ is in mind of course. "He that descended is the same also that ascended" (@Ephesians 4:10). It is to glorify God, for man was made for the glory of God. Christ was Man, and He goes in ascension beyond all heavens! He goes into the uncreated sphere, -- so great is He. Only *He* could do that, yet He is Man! When God brings His First-begotten into
{459}
the world, He says, "Let all the angels of God worship him!" (@Hebrews 1:6). That is the Man, so christianity is manhood.
Everyone has received grace, "He has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers"; -- these are men. The gifts are here, but in men; the gifts are here that *we* should be men, -- for the work of the ministry -- "until we all arrive ... at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (@Ephesians 4:13). That is the thought for man, babes indeed in the knowledge of the world and malice, but men in the things of God.
Now take Peter, a good example of a man. Cornelius sent for him, and when Peter came he fell down to worship him, but that would not do. Peter was a man as Cornelius was, so he lifted him up, and they went together into the house. Peter was an apostle too -- he had been told he would be a fisher of men, he was to catch men. A gift is only provisional, only to serve men, and when they are all served, the gifts will be laid down. In @John 17 the Lord turns to the Father for His disciples, saying, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world ... thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word". It is manhood that keeps the word. The apostle Peter says, "Desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation" (@1 Peter 2:2). In your minds be men, not babes. There is need of manhood among us, manhood that takes its share in suffering; manhood is truly needed in the testimony. May God bless His word!
{460}
THE FOUR SIMONS
@Luke 7:36-43; @Luke 5:4-8; @Mark 15:21; @Mark 14:3
In thinking on this meeting, I decided to present the gospel if I am enabled to do so, in connection with the four Simons; Simon the Pharisee, Simon Peter, Simon the Cyrenian and Simon the leper. Another Simon is mentioned in Scripture, but it would make the address too cumbersome to include him. One too might say that one likes to go on the principle of four. Scripture largely recognizes the numeral and uses it, and so I have selected these four men. I believe they are types usable and intended to be usable in God's service. For instance, the Pharisee represents our religious affiliations. Fishing represents employment which has to be taken account of in the gospel. The Cyrenian was coming up from the country, which is properly a field. He was a farmer of which there are many here in this room. The fourth does not seem to have any special calling. If he has, the Spirit of God does not mention it at all, but it does say that he is a leper. He is known to be that.
Simon the Pharisee comes up first and the mention of him challenges every pharisaical heart. You are in very bad company if you belong to the class this man belongs to. That which is represented by the Pharisee is in each one of our hearts. It is religious pride and greatly hinders the gospel. Maybe there is someone here who can say that he is born in some distinction that is good enough for him. The question is, Is it good enough for God? It is with Him we have to do in this matter, eventually, if not now. So that one has to challenge one's religious affiliations, or challenge himself in regard of them. Even though they may be good enough for us, what does God think about them? Are you trusting in them as some do, saying, ' It is good enough for a certain great man, why not for me? '
The word Pharisee is used to designate this man four times. You get his outward name, you get the statement
{461}
that he is a Pharisee four times. You say that that is merely to identify him, but there are no sects in Scripture. You get his name. You say, ' Why do we get his name at all? ' There are many persons mentioned in Scripture whose names are not mentioned at all. This man's name is. If you die in your sins your name will be called out at the great white throne. It will indeed. The works attached to each person and his whole history will be there.
Simon did not just invite the Lord to a meal. That is not condemned. But in his supercilious way, he "spoke with himself, saying, This person if he were a prophet would have known who and what the woman is who touches him, for she is a sinner". The Lord calls him by name; He does not say, ' Pharisee ', no, He says, "Simon". It is his personal name; it is not the name of his religious affiliation. That word Pharisee is not his name in the books of God; the word Simon is his name. And so the Lord said, "Simon", not ' Pharisee '. The Lord uses his given name, that in the books of God and in the books of men.
Now if there is one like him trusting in some religious denomination, hoping that things will be all right, saying, ' The denomination is good enough for some great man, my parents and my grandparents, it is good enough for me, I will take a chance ', I wish to tell you that there is no chance about it. You will be laid in a Christless grave if you die, and have part in a Christless resurrection too. There are two resurrections; the one is a thousand years after the other. "Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection". Most of us here will have part in that, thank God! "Over these the second death has no power" (@Revelation 20:6), those trusting in the blood for their salvation. It is as certain as anything that those who trust in a bloodless religion will perish. There is no other ground of salvation than that. "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin" (@1 John 1:7).
{462}
This man has no fault whatever. When this woman comes into his house, he would think, How dare she come in! He did not say it, but he felt it. How dare she come in! That is the religious attitude. He criticised the believer who trusted in the blood of Jesus. Such a one as that would be criticised, and in criticising her, he would be criticising Jesus. Pharisees have a way of speaking to themselves. The Lord gives a sample of a pharisee in this same gospel. A pharisee went to the temple to pray and he prayed to himself, we are told. It looks as though this type of a man has only himself as an object; he speaks to himself; he prays to himself; he thanks God he is not as bad as others; he gives the list. ' I am not as bad as this tax-gatherer. ' He says that to himself. And so this man speaks to himself. He criticises Jesus within himself. "If he were a prophet," he says, as though he thought He was not even that. So the Lord says, "Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee". That is the point. The Lord has something to say to someone here. He does not want to expose you unnecessarily, or disgrace you. Allow the Lord to say a word! Religious people, you who are trusting in your religious associations, let the Lord say a word to you tonight! He does not criticise Simon, He does not turn the tables on him. He says, "There was a certain creditor". Simon, what do you say to that? "Which of them will love him most?" The Lord raised the question of love. What about your love? Have you any love for Christ? If you have you will not criticise Him to yourself or to anyone else. "If he were a prophet", he says, ' He would know that this woman is a sinner '.
Speaking about love, with all the religion that you have, do you love the Lord Jesus? That is the point He is making. The apostle Paul, years later, says, "If anyone love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha," (@1 Corinthians 16:22). It means, Let him be cursed when the Lord Jesus comes. Perhaps ninety
{463}
per cent here will be with Him for ever. Is there anyone here who does not love Jesus? Simon says, "I suppose that he to whom he forgave the most". The Lord says, "Thou hast rightly judged". What about you, Simon? What about you religionists here, do you love the Lord Jesus? You say, ' What could Simon say? He was a highly respected man '. He invited the Lord, not because he loved Him, but because he would have a distinguished man at his table. I have no hesitation in saying that that man is not saved. The harvest is past for him and the summer is ended and he is not saved. On the other hand, Jesus makes it plain as far as He is concerned, He is here to save that man. He puts him alongside of the woman. Forgiveness was for Simon as much as for the woman. There may be somebody like that here tonight. But she is saved. You might despise her, but she loved Jesus. She loved much because she was forgiven much. Yet the Lord frankly forgave them both. That is the attitude of God here tonight. If there is a Pharisee here, God would say to you through me, ' As far as I am concerned, I will not raise the question of your sins; they are all dealt with as far as I am concerned, in the death of My Son '. It is for you to accept forgiveness. It is for you. What is the difference between these two persons? The woman came and the man did not. The gospel is on the principle of faith to faith. It is not insulting you, but it tells you that your sins are dealt with. If you are burdened with guilt, it is dealt with to the complete satisfaction of God. There is "One mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all" (@1 Timothy 2:5,6), for this man Simon, as well as this woman.
But then you say that there is not only the death of Christ necessary for salvation, but there is the necessity of faith for forgiveness. ' But ', you say, ' I have not got it '. You are in a bad way, and as soon as you begin to think that you are in a bad way, you are in a good way. Faith comes by hearing. Let it into your soul. It is the
{464}
simple question of believing God. The death of Christ is of no avail save as someone has faith. Faith comes by hearing; hence the great value of these gospel preachings, because you get faith through them. The Lord turns to her, "Thy faith", He says. Why did not the pharisee get it? Because he did not want it. His affiliations blinded him and hardened him. If there is someone here trusting in the religion that you have been born into, wake up to the fact that with all your religion you will enter a Christless grave. It will be a question then, not of forgiveness, but of penalty. When the Lord Jesus comes in a flame of fire to execute judgment, you will be punished with everlasting destruction. It is most serious to think of; hence the value of a meeting like this. It is an opportunity for you to let faith in. It comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, so that you are benefited by the grace. Forgiveness is there, but the faith is the difference. It was not in Simon but it was in the woman.
With the next man it is a question of his occupation -- Simon Peter. I do not know what occupation Simon, the pharisee had -- probably he was a man of means -- but Simon Peter was a fisherman. You might say Simon the fisherman in that way, and that is not to be overlooked in this matter of the gospel, what one's calling is. For instance, it may be a tax-gatherer, and you have to take account of that. If it is a fisherman, the Lord takes account of the calling, and so in this gospel, the Lord evidently is very desirous of securing Peter through the gospel.
John does not tell us anything about this matter. He informs us that when the Lord first met Peter he changed his name at once, but Matthew tells us that he is a fisherman and the Lord meets him, and so does Mark. But Luke tells us that the Lord entered into Simon's house. Surely he is going to be saved now. Well, the Lord had entered Simon the pharisee's house and he was not saved. Even by having the Lord and serving
{465}
Him in your house, you cannot be sure of any result. If the greatest preacher came into your house, you cannot be sure of anything from that. Peter's mother-in-law was sick with a fever. Simon is surely in the way of salvation. It does not say he invited the Lord. He went in. He doubtless had Peter in His mind, and so it is with many a soul here. The Lord has you in mind. Alas, we do not see much. We are looking for happenings, trees falling, etc., but alas, we do not see much; persons collapsing in the presence of God in their sense of guilt. The Lord went into Simon's house. Nothing happened to Simon, but a great deal happened to his mother-in-law. Some of you here have had mothers converted and fathers converted, and nothing has happened to you yet. Alas, the devil is working with you all the time. It is appalling how he works. He turns a tide sometimes.
As I said, nothing happens to Peter, he goes on in his own way, in his own secret doings. Satan works with him. And so the Lord enters Simon's house and his mother-in-law was sick of a fever. The Lord stands over her. He did not stand over Simon although Simon needed Him as much as the mother-in-law. No doubt Simon was very thankful for his mother-in-law being relieved of the fever. The Lord stands over her. There was need of authority in the house. Simon would never have any influence over her. But the Lord Jesus came from heaven and He stood over her and rebuked the fever and the fever left her, and she arises and serves them.
Let not this meeting pass without something happening to you! It will be most solemn if you go out of the door as you came in. Nothing happened in Peter's house as far as you can see. Well, the Lord says, ' I will go to his business. I will go to his office tomorrow, or his workshop, and see if I can get him there '. What diligent working, what diligent seeking! He goes after the lost one. He is a fisherman. The Lord has more than Peter in mind. He enters Peter's boat. He entered his house and nothing happened. It may be your
{466}
business will be smashed. He isolated Peter's boat. He had a very prosperous business that day from the business point of view, but Peter's business dropped out of his mind. It dropped out completely, because after this event he left everything and followed Jesus. He is going to be a fisher of men, he is going to catch men. How much greater is that occupation! But before you can catch men you have got to be caught yourself.
Is there anyone here who is hanging in the balance? It is a matter between your soul and God. The Lord Jesus entered Peter's boat and told Peter what to do. They enclosed a great multitude of fishes so that the boats were sinking, but what I am speaking about now is this man in relation to his business. He learns in relation to his business, the workshop, or office or whatever it might be, he learns that he is a sinful man. God is speaking here to someone as to his sins. Peter was a man who could swear, you know, very different from Simon the pharisee, a man who could drink as we say nowadays, and use profane words, but now in the presence of the Lord Jesus he discovers, "I am a sinful man". Peter says, "I am a sinful man, O Lord"; "Depart from me". He did not mean that really. The Lord only could be his helper. If there is one here tonight like that, the Lord alone can help you, and He is here. The gospel enters into this whole matter because he got forgiveness. It is a condition that you cannot overcome. You have not been able to overcome it, but you have judged it, and the matter is settled. We have been praying for you before we came to this meeting, and we have been praying since we came. Is there one convicted here tonight? Peter fell down at His knees, he left everything. He was a delivered man. They did not let the boat sink, they had beckoned to their partners to help them and after all that is done they follow Jesus.
In the next scripture Simon, a Cyrenian, is coming up out of a field. He is a farmer. It is probably a field
{467}
he has not been working in so often, but he is coming up from the field at night. There is just one verse said about him. God is no respecter of persons. Simon is not interested in the crucifixion of Christ. This most wonderful thing was just about to happen, and he was passing by. This man was a shallow sort of man, but he is compelled to do something, one of the greatest things, to carry the cross of Jesus. It is remarkable that the Spirit of God would tell us that. Perhaps there is someone here like that tonight. You have come in here under stress of circumstances, may be. They had to compel him to do it. He does it. If he was converted after that we are not told, but if he was, he had two sons in the testimony, Alexander and Rufus. So it may be you came in here under stress of circumstances. You may have been asked by a christian friend and you did not like to refuse, so you came in through stress of circumstances. How solemn is this matter! You have been compelled to come through circumstances. He did not want to refuse. His heart is not in it. But then see where you are, and thank God that it may be the means of your son's conversion later on. You may say that Simon did. Your influence and the influence of your wife may result in your son's conversion. We do not look at these things as accidents. But through stress of circumstances you are here tonight. You may tell something to someone and that something may convert someone. The word of God goes on and we get Alexander and Rufus.
Now the last, Simon the leper. Does he need cleansing now? The Lord Jesus is in his house. There is a great love of Jesus in his house. But do we accept this reputation of being a leper? You say, ' I was converted in such and such a year. My sins were forgiven me then '. But what reputation did you have among your neighbours? Was it a sinful one? Do you like to hide your history, every sin that Jesus bore? The leprosy of Simon is typical of sin. We do not hide the fact of our
{468}
guilt; it keeps us humble. Paul says, "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief" (@1 Timothy 1:15). He was preaching the gospel, and there were those converted by him and yet he is the chief of sinners. I have no doubt Paul would tell his hearers on many occasions what his guilt had been. So he says that his greatest sin was that he persecuted the assembly of God. My experience is that those of us who are in touch with the assembly, have almost invariably persecuted the assembly as we came in contact with it. Paul dragged them from their houses. He persecuted the assembly. He said that he was not worthy to be called an apostle because of it. The Lord would lay it upon the saints to accept the reputation, but think of what it cost Jesus to save us! What Paul was is what I am, but you see that the leprosy is not operative. That is the point in Simon the leper. It had ceased to operate. It is not infectious. Who is there who has not been cleansed with the water as well as the blood which flowed from the side of Jesus? Simon the leper's reputation was that he was a leper, but Jesus is in his house. That is all I have to say, dear friends, about these four men, Simon the Pharisee, Simon the fisherman, Simon the farmer, and Simon the leper who was no longer infectious but free to entertain the Lord Jesus and the lovers of the Lord in his house.
{469}
LIGHT
@Exodus 10:23; @Genesis 37:9-11
I have been thinking, dear brethren, about light. It is one of the greatest suggestions that enters into this moment. Indeed, it is one of the greatest facts connected with our position here on earth, that we have light, and that light peculiarly enters into our convocations; and as it shines in the assembly, it shines in those who form it in their dwellings. So that we are told here in Exodus that whilst there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days, so that they saw not one another, yet all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. And Joseph's dream serves to show that light radiates in family connections. When God commanded light to shine out of darkness, there is no allusion to households. There were none. There were none, save as we may regard the universe as God's house. There is good ground for saying so, for it is said in connection with the house of God that He who built all things is God. "All things" is the universe. We have, indeed, in that epistle that I am alluding to, Hebrews, the fact that the worlds were framed by the word of God; "the worlds". That alludes to the universe too. "All things" would imply more detail than "the worlds". There are not as many worlds as there are things. But "all things" would point to the universe, and "the worlds" would point to subdivisions of the universe; each centred doubtless in a system, a stellar system, with a centre of attraction; suns and moons and stars. We are only acquainted, as I may say, in a physical sense with one of these systems, knowing, however, that there are others.
But we have the one great thought as to this -- the Father of lights. James, in his epistle, speaks of the Father of lights. There would be some allusion to the heavens, in a limited sense, no doubt, to our own sun, but in a wider sense to the Source of all light, which God
{470}
is. He is the Father of lights; He dwells Himself in light unapproachable, we are told. So that we are impressed with this thought of light; it becomes very expanded as we meditate upon it. But it comes down to each of our dwellings. How each of Israel's households had light as connected with each other is a matter of interest, but it must have been spiritual. And what one is thinking of now is, as to the household just started, as it takes its place in a dwelling, inclusive of a building, a dwelling-place, that there should be indeed light in it. And so the wide allusion that I have made connects the household of each believer with a great central thought of light. There is only one Source of light, and that is God. He is the Father of lights. In @Genesis 1, as I was saying, there are no households in the sense in which we are speaking of them now, save the universe; and that is illuminated by God. But the urgency of it is seen in the use of the word "command". In @Genesis 1:3 it says, "And God said, Let there be light". For the stress is laid on the divine word in @Genesis 1, but the divine word becomes a command when brought into the New Testament. Everything was regulated by the word of God. Peter stresses that as regards even the flood; "having its subsistence out of water and in water, by the word of God" (@2 Peter 3:5). Everything in @Genesis 1 has a fixity by the divine word, which carries with it more than command, because it carries wisdom. The mind of God is in it. "And God said, Let there be light. And there was light". He *said* it; a word that has to be carried down to our circumstances, because whilst the command is imperative, the word of God carries, as I said, wisdom and carries the mind of God. So that if I am in a given position, or a heavenly body is in a given position, it is not simply the divine fiat, but that the divine mind required that. And that makes everything more interesting, because each position occupied implies the skill of God; He said, and what came about from His word was good. Everything was good.
{471}
I referred to Exodus, because the idea comes down to the house; to the believer's house. The Israelites, we are told, had light in *all* their dwellings. We find in the early part of this book of Exodus that God made houses for certain women. God was honouring them because they were saving the males in Israel, which the enemy would destroy. There can be no doubt that God intended to suggest in the making of houses (for the word is "made") that they should be a pattern in Egypt. God was honouring these persons; for certainly it was a great honour that He should make houses for women; and it is clear that the suggestion carried with it distinctiveness as to dwellings. They would not be mere coverings, mere shelters. They had the dignified word of "house". He made them *houses*. And whether these houses became patterns for the Israelites is not stated, but certainly one may assume that faith, as in persons like the mother of Moses and the father of Moses, would lead them to think of the houses God had made. They would be models of architecture for Israelites; not for Egyptians, but for Israelites.
And these houses, if the thought may be carried into this verse, were suitable to God; and that is what one had in one's mind, that our dear brother and sister to whom we have already alluded with full commendation -- for they carry with them, I am sure, the full commendation of their brethren in this departure, in this new relationship into which they have entered -- that their household may be a household of light. @Psalm 87:2 distinguishes between the gates of Zion -- that is, where judicial services were carried on among the saints, assembly service, the gates involving authority -- it distinguishes between the gates of Zion and the dwellings of Jacob. "Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the habitations of Jacob". But that infers that He did also love the dwellings of Jacob.
If you will allow me to turn to Isaiah just to point out what many of us know, in chapter 4, it is said, "when the
{472}
Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have scoured out the blood of Jerusalem from its midst, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. And Jehovah will create over every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and over its convocations, a cloud by day and a smoke, and the brightness of a flame of fire by night: for over all the glory shall be a covering. And there shall be a tabernacle for shade by day from the heat, and for a shelter and for a covert from storm and from rain" (verses 4-6). I was thinking of that, dear brethren, as entering into what is before us; that is, the covering -- "a cloud by day and a smoke, and the brightness of a flame of fire by night: for over all the glory shall be a covering". How God regards the households; that is, after the purging, the cleansing. And we must apply the idea of purging and cleansing to the present time. We know that marriages are going on, current all the time, with no regard for this matter of purging or cleansing. We are living in dreadful times. Pollution is all around us, and young people come under the power of it in their offices, and schools, and work places. "And as it took place in the days of Noe, thus also shall it be in the days of the Son of man:" the Lord Jesus says, "they ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage" (@Luke 17:26,27). It went on regularly, but there was no purging. It went on until the flood came upon them and drowned them all. How dreadful that was! But it was due to God, because an institution that He had Himself made, that is marriage, as we have said in our prayer, was carried on, but in a state of corruption; "for all flesh had corrupted its way on the earth" (@Genesis 6:12). And that is what has come about at the present time. The world has returned to that. But the Lord Jesus said that went on until the day that Noah entered into the ark. That is, a certain thing happened: Noah entered into the ark. God had begun all over again. There were four married couples in the ark; they were not drowned. The flood
{473}
came and drowned them all, we are told, but these four couples were not drowned; they were saved so as by water. They would not ignore the need of water; water was not only judgment there, overwhelming judgment, but it was purging; it was cleansing. And Noah and his family were saved as through or by water. That is our position.
There were no marriages, of course, in the ark; they were married couples -- four of them. No doubt their marriages would have been different from the ordinary corrupt marriages of the day, and their father had faith; Noah had faith, and God found pleasure in Noah and in his family. He prepared an ark for the saving of his house, and that saving implied cleansing; the washing of regeneration. Marriages before God can have no moral value save as these conditions exist -- the principle of purging as we get in @Isaiah 4. But it is here now with us, through grace, and the light of cleansing is with us; and this light is to enter into houses. So that Israel had light in all their dwellings, and that light involved the exclusion of impurities which marked the Egyptians. The darkness was all around; the darkness could be felt, but the Israelites had light in all their dwellings. And that light (as I was saying, for us it is purging) -- that light is connected by Joseph in his second dream with the sun, moon, and stars. I mean to say, not that he is making a point of light, but he is making a point of the sun, moon and eleven stars, meaning the household of his father. Incidentally, the point in the dream is that the household -- "the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me". That is the point he is making, for he is a type of Christ, and whatever authority is in the husband must be subservient to Christ's authority. Marriage is to be "in the Lord". That word "in" is power. It is a question of the power that is in Christ; the authority that is in Christ; marriage is "in the Lord".
{474}
And so Joseph's dream connects the idea of the family with the sun, moon and eleven stars; he was the twelfth, of course. But he was speaking actually of the family of his father, and he is exempted because he is a type of Christ. He must have pre-eminence in everything. If He went to a marriage feast in Cana of Galilee, He was not an ordinary guest. His mother thought to make Him that, thinking that He ought to be subservient to her because she was His natural mother; but He says, "What have I to do with thee, woman?" (@John 2:4). He was on a higher level. He never comes down to our level in that sense, and faith always recognizes the supremacy of Christ. So Joseph is here exempted in his dream. There are eleven stars, and his father and mother are subject to him. That is what I was thinking as to this matter of our dear brother and sister. Our brother is the sun, and she is the moon; it is a question of Christ and the assembly; the household -- the light radiates in that connection. As I was saying, James says the Father of lights is God. That would be a type of God, a suggestion of God Himself; the Father is the Source of light, and the sun and the moon are what I was thinking about. On the fourth day of the creation the sun and the moon are set up. On the first day we get light, but it is as commanded, or issuing forth by the divine word; but on the fourth day we have the sun and the moon, Christ and the assembly. That is what I was thinking of, how they illustrate the assembly, I mean the relationship of Christ and the saints. It is love radiating, but love in the sense of light. So in the believer's household it is the sun and the moon; that is, the sun is greater light. It says in @Ephesians 5:24, "But even as the assembly is subjected to the Christ, so also wives to their own husbands in everything". Not only subject, but subjected. It is a question of the divine mind. We can never gain, but lose, by disregarding the divine mind. It is not only a question of subjection, that is, her whole attitude; but God's mind is that she is subjected to her
{475}
husband as the assembly is subjected to the Christ; and it is in that connection that we have radiation of light, light such as God approves, such as is a testimony to our neighbours, and such as promotes assembly material; light in the dwellings of the people of God, the dwellings of Jacob, all contributory to the gates of Zion.
{476}
CIRCUITS
@Psalm 19: 4-6; @Romans 15:19; @1 Samuel 7:15-17
I read these scriptures because they contain the word "circuit". I wish to show from them how the testimony of God proceeds, how it occasions felicitation, not dolefulness, as the greatest of servants said, "always rejoicing" (@2 Corinthians 6:10). It is a feature of christianity that those who have part in it should rejoice, even in tribulation, "also boast in tribulations" (@Romans 5:3). @Psalm 19 serves to bring out how the creation itself was intended to reflect this holy, felicitous state of things. You will all remember how that in the book of Job Jehovah undertook to finish the service rendered to Job, and how He began with matters relating to the founding of the earth, heavy work, of course, but Jehovah said to Job that it was a happy occasion. It was marked by a happy state of things. In laying foundations, of course, builders know how heavy the work is, how difficult, too, how irritating ofttimes; for soil, the earth, sometimes, and more often than not, hardly yields itself to such operations. The foundations of some of the buildings in this great city go very deep, so that we may well say, "the height and the depth", for the reason that the earth is not solid. Sometimes we find rock, but not always, and builders have to circumvent the difficulties, and they are not always joyous, but painful, calling for patience. I have no doubt that Paul's work on the foundations at Corinth was similar. The soil was not too good. He does not refer to sonship as the foundation laid there, he refers to Jesus Christ, meaning the kind of Man that was here, in all weathers, amid all difficulties and trials and tears. The Lord knew what it was to shed tears, Paul knew what it was to shed tears. So did Timothy. So that Jesus Christ laid as foundation was such as would overcome difficulties, and sorrows would be turned into joy in the laying of such a foundation
{477}
because it was simply a question of presenting Christ to the Corinthians in such a way, in such power, that He was received into their souls. So the apostle says that his foundational work was not in human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power that our "faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God". It was arduous work and trying work, but nevertheless the foundation was laid, and many a happy hymn was sung in the course of the operations. Many a good meeting they had indeed in Corinth, for Paul knew how to raise a tune in the greatest sorrow, as did Silas, in the prison at Philippi. We may be sure the music was good for at midnight they sang praises to God in prayer. They felt the need of divine help, but the help went beyond the need and enabled them to sing. The shaky, uncertain foundations of the prison were loosened, but alongside of that a sure foundation was laid at least in one man and that was the jailor.
So Jehovah intimated to Job that they had a good time in laying the foundations of the earth. He said, Were you there? It is well to have questions like that put to us. Where were you, He said to Job, then? You did not participate in any of that joy. I suppose He could have said to Job, You have not sung a note for a long time; since Satan came to Me and moved Me against you you have been in great misery; you have not been joining in in the work of God in your songs. But He says to him in effect, At the laying of the foundations of the earth we had good times. "The morning stars sang together", it is said. Beautiful harmony! They sang *together*, not one by one. "The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy" (@Job 38:7). Had he had a bright morning in his soul for years, for months? The book would indicate that misery had been his portion, for he had been shutting God out. That is how the matter stands in adversity, dear brethren. We shut God out, whereas adversity should be the door for Him
{478}
to come in. Job's wife did not help him. A wife may be a great help to her husband in times of distress if she is pious, if she is joyful, if she is spiritual. One man, called Manoah, said, We have seen an angel of the Lord, we are going to die. Well, that was a doleful note. His wife had no such note as that. She said, If the Lord were going to kill us He would not have accepted a burnt-offering from us. Job's wife said to him, "Curse God and die" (@Job 2:9). What awful advice that was to give her husband! A poor, wretched man as he was then, suffering beyond words. "Curse God and die". She is hardly ever mentioned after. She disappears in gloom, telling her husband to curse God. Could she give him any worse advice? She could not! Did he take it? He did not, thank God! Had he taken it, he would hardly have heard of the foundations of the world, as first-hand knowledge. The very hands that laid the foundations of the earth were there and Jehovah says to him, "When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy" (@Job 38:7). He said in effect, Job, you have never had such a time as this, but He wished that he should have it, and that is why I read this first scripture.
It is a psalm of the heavens, not of the earth, but I read it because it has a note of joy in it. It indicates really what christianity is, how it was inaugurated. And God intends what is inaugural to be finished. The finish is to be in accord with it. We are living in very, very distressing times, but God would speak to us about joyous times. The Lord Jesus in the parable says, "there is joy before the angels of God for one repenting sinner" (@Luke 15:10). How many have repented since Pentecost! Has heaven ever been without a joy of that kind? But it is not simply one sinner that repents once, but he continues to do so, and every time he repents he affords joy in heaven. So that there is no dolefulness up there, and how much more so, dear brethren, as we think of the Lord Jesus sitting up there, the Father's delight,
{479}
"received up in glory" (@1 Timothy 3:16). Not received up *to* glory, although that is true too, but He was received up *in* it. In fact, He was met in the tomb by the Father's glory. The Father raised Him out of the tomb by His glory. The Lord was enveloped in glory as He came out of the tomb, and that was continued. He was received up in glory, the same glory, others added to it. All the features of glory of which heaven is capable enveloped or surrounded the entrance of the Saviour into heaven, the Lord Jesus. And heaven has not altered its mind about Him, there are no doleful days or hours there. And so, dear brethren, one would seek to show how this psalm points to the inaugural day of christianity. The Holy Spirit came down, as we say, as the day of Pentecost was running its course. It is a remarkable thing that there is no limit to the day of Pentecost in the types. It is as long as you can sustain it. God will not tell you to stop the joy. The Holy Spirit has brought in joy, "joy in the Holy Spirit", "for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking", however good the meat, however good the drink, it is not that, but "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit", a constitutional joy (@Romans 14:17). Heaven is always sharing it, and it would have us to share with it in that joy. And so this psalm is very striking in that way. It speaks of a tabernacle for the sun. Now one has often thought that the things that testify to God are not simply passive witnesses. The testimony really lies in how God calls attention to the thing that witnesses. Even Jesus Himself God called attention to. Heaven opens and calls attention to Him. Well, you say, He did not need that. Quite so. In Himself He was a witness; He was a glorious, living Person, but yet His ministry began with heaven calling attention to Him. Heaven's attention, heaven's remarks will convey the impression that is to remain with us. It is how heaven speaks of a thing or a person. "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (@Luke 3:22). You say, You did not
{480}
quote it all. Yes, I did. It does not say, "hear him" there. It does on the Mount of Transfiguration, but at the Jordan it is just the Person. "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight"; it is to fix our eyes on a Person Who delights heaven, as if to say that He is sufficient to delight you, to cause joy in your heart. Not what He says, but what He *is* now. He is the beloved Son. Presently it is what He says as well.
The account of the sun here in @Psalm 19 is an account that no astronomer would ever attempt to give. He would never think of giving it. You will never find it in any book on astronomy, not that I have read any exhaustively, but you will never find the tabernacle alluded to. @Genesis 1 does not allude to it. But then you must allow God to have His way. If He has made the sun and the other heavenly bodies you must allow Him to say things about them as He sees them. He is saying to us, I am seeing more in the sun than you can see, or the astronomer can see. I see My Son in that sun, and I want you to understand I have abundantly provided for Him in heaven. I have made a tabernacle for Him up there. One would like to understand the special place the Lord Jesus has in heaven. What has God provided for Him? He says, "for I go to prepare you a place" (@John 14:2). Everyone of us will have a place. But what kind of a place has He? When we see the accommodation, as I may say, the living surroundings, the accommodation accorded to the glorious Son of God in heaven, then we shall understand how He is honoured, how He is glorified. "In them hath he set a tent for the sun". God is speaking about the Son by His Spirit here through David, and He is saying that the Lord Jesus has gone up into heaven and He is honoured up there. He is received up in glory. What kind of apartments, to use a figure, what kind of attendants? How is He being received? Think of the angels, how they stand about! Think of the Father's glories beaming all around on the Object, the supreme Object of His
{481}
affections! Think of the arrangements made, so to say, for Him! "In them has He set a tent for the sun". Well, who is that sun? It is the Son. And we read in Matthew that the father, the king, the great king, made a marriage for his son. He made a marriage for him. Think of the preparations! The idea of Christ's marriage is heavenly. The bride is not mentioned here. It is the Bridegroom. He comes out of His chamber. Think of that! Not now a tent, but a chamber. He comes out of it and He makes the circuit. That is to say, the idea is that love returns to the starting point. That is the idea of the circuit. So He comes out of His chamber as a Bridegroom and rejoices as a strong man to run a race. Now that is, dear brethren, what I want to impress on us first of all, this supreme thought of felicitation, of joy in the inauguration of christianity. And the idea is, in the Spirit's presence here, that it should be maintained. @Matthew 22 contemplates that it runs right through the dispensation. It is maintained by the Spirit. So that the Lord beams as He moves as the strong Man to run a race. There is no idea of fatigue. There is no idea of any cause of sorrow. The matter is so great and glorious, so unending in its results, that it is enough to keep the joy going. It is a question really of divine Persons. But the Lord Jesus in all these centuries has been making these circuits, not to judge as in Samuel's case as I shall show, not to execute judgment, but to cause joy in what is called the Glad Tidings, for that is the meaning of the gospel. What seasons there have been through the centuries in this constant circuiting in what is typified here, or symbolized, I should say, in this description of this glorious Person coming out of His chamber as a strong man to run a race, rejoicing as a bridegroom! The joy of His heart is in it. In the middle of the night, in the middle of this dispensation, in the darkness, there was a cry, "Behold, the bridegroom". Not simply Christ, not the Saviour, it is, "Behold, the bridegroom". Are we able to see Him? "Go ye forth to meet Him" (@Matthew 25:6). That is the

finish. It is the movement of the Bridegroom causing joy in every heart that loves Christ. And so the psalmist says, "His going forth is from the end of the heavens, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof". It is the heat. It is heat but not in the sense in which they have it down in the tropics now. The sun is sometimes said to be an enemy down there when it is right overhead. For the last few days we felt the heat here in these parts, causing discomfort, but that is not the idea here. Heat here is not to cause discomfort. It is for comfort. As we get elsewhere, the south wind blows and your clothes begin to be warm. How often we have experienced that! The south wind is from sunny quarters. It is a symbol of the warmth of Christ, companionship with Christ. "Did not our heart burn within us?" (@Luke 24:32), said two people, one to the other. Did not our heart burn within us? Not with pain. No. It was the consciousness of something that was favourable. Love was there. The love of recovery. The Lord was seeking to recover those two, and He succeeded in it and He would cause their heart to burn. There is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
And now going on to Romans which is the great gospel epistle, we have the reflection of this verse, the continuance of this in the apostle Paul, the evangelist, the greatest, I suppose, although he is not exactly called one; but he is, I suppose, the greatest of the evangelists. In fact, in any sense he was not a whit behind the greatest apostles. And certainly in preaching the gospel, it is the preaching of Paul. The Lord would not allow any to supersede Paul, that "By me the preaching might be fully known" (@2 Timothy 4:17). It was the kind of preaching. His heart burned in affection for Christ. He heard the voice of the Bridegroom and he was seeking the bride for the Bridegroom. He was full of the affections of Christ. That was the idea. So that he says, "in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to
{483}
Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ". A very wide idea, a very, very wide idea, from Jerusalem to Illyricum. It was not a straight line. That is the point. Not that straight lines are not right in their place, but the universe, as far as we can see, is not on the principle of straight lines. The universe that we can see is circular. And the sun indicates that; the circuit of the sun. And so it is, dear brethren, that we belong to a circle. The word circle is a very good one, as indicating links of affection. It is carried through, and whilst the heavens seem to be circular, and the earth is a globe, it is carried through, so that we have the word "ends". The ends of the earth, and the ends of the heavens, because they are finite, they are not infinite. But still there it is, the circuit of the sun. It makes its circuit every day, that is, as the eye sees it. And so it is that love is circular. Love will ever come back to where it has found satisfaction. We are told the Lord Jesus went out to Bethany and spent the night. The suggestion is, He had the night on hand. He did not have anything else on hand. If I have not got anything else on hand I want to go where love is, where there is a known love. The residence of love, beloved, let me tell you today, is the assembly. The assembly is the residence of love. Divine Persons dwell in it. And so the Lord indicates that when He had a night on hand, He went out to Bethany and spent it there. Elsewhere we are told He went at the night time, not on one night particularly, but by night He went out to the mount of Olives. Was love there? Yes. He met the Father there. You might say it was the Father's trysting place. What seasons the Lord had with His Father on the Mount of Olives! Others went to their own abodes; He went to the mount of Olives. On one occasion He had a night to spare, as we might say, and He went to Bethany and spent it there. Did He have a good time? Undoubtedly. He spent it there. And so we may be sure that if the Lord comes to this city and has a good time with the
{484}
brethren, He will come back. Not that I would restrict Him to that. He may come back to rebuke us. But if it is a love question, He knows where love is. If we want the Lord, then cultivate love. The assembly is the home of love and the Lord finds His way there. Normally He finds His way there. It is a circuit. We read of the winds in Ecclesiastes. They go to the north, they go to the south, they turn around at the points of the compass, but it says they return to their circuits. That is what they do. What God has done in the creation is symbolical and everything falls into its place. And so we take Paul. He knew the love of Christ. He says, "For the love of the Christ constrains us" (@2 Corinthians 5:14). No one else says that that I know of. The love of the Christ constrains us. And so he took this long journey from Jerusalem in a circuit to Illyricum. He was under the constraint of the love of Christ. The Corinthians became refractory but he says, "if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved" (@2 Corinthians 12:15). That is, your lack of love is not hindering my love. In all this circuit inclusive of Corinth he was constrained by the love of Christ. A visit from Paul, therefore, would not be doleful. He said you have made me glad, and I want to make you glad. It is a poor minister who cannot make the saints glad, even by his very presence among them. "The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord" (@John 20:20). How glad the lovers of Christ would be to see Paul! Take @Acts 20; it is a love chapter from beginning to end, reciprocal affections between Paul and the saints. Wherever he went, it was just as the sun coming out of his chamber, reflecting the affections of the Bridegroom, reflecting the affections of Jesus for the saints. I am saying all this, dear brethren, because we all love to serve the Lord, and if we serve the Lord or attempt to do it and do not make the saints glad, we hardly have the credentials. No one should serve without credentials and the power to make the saints glad is the best credentials any minister can have. Paul spoke of it.
{485}
If he did not make the Corinthians glad, who could make them glad? And if they did not make him glad, who could make him glad? He had a wonderful time there for eighteen months, and found himself with links with all the dear brethren who resided in Corinth. His epistles are full of affection. There were those who did not care for his return, but those who loved the Lord would look for Paul's return. How glad they would be to see him! I cannot, of course, quote the scriptures in which the apostle expresses his affection to the saints, but they will be known to most of us and one would urge that they be looked into. There is plenty of occasion for joy, the present occasion is one of joy, and above all the Lord's supper is a great occasion for joy. Even in the ministry there should be occasions of joy in the presentation of Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit. In fact we have the expression, "by the love of the Spirit" (@Romans 15:30). The Spirit Himself is full of affection for the saints.
Well now, my point is to show that Paul in this circuit from Jerusalem round about to Illyricum reflects the circuit the sun made, typical of Christ as the Bridegroom. That is to say, the dispensation has to be filled out with bridegroom affections as it were. Every minister in some little degree at least should be able to reflect some of these affections, causing the hearts of the saints to be gladdened.
Well now, to go to the third scripture, the point is not to bring in joy, but the sobering effect of judgment. We are told that Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. Well, I say Amen to that. It was a sad day when he died. All Israel mourned after Samuel. They mourned a great servant, they mourned a man that said to them, "Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you" (@1 Samuel 12:23). He loved the people of God, and he judged them all the days of his life. Well, you say, judgment does not cause joy. Well, if it does not cause joy, directly, it will
{486}
indirectly, because it will bring about the removal of what hinders joy. Fleshly feelings and doings among us hinder spiritual joy and the care-meetings and the assembly discipline meetings help to remove what hinders the joy. And hence Samuel, we are told, judged Israel all the days of his life. He went from year to year from Bethel to Gilgal in a circuit, all those places. You will remember that when Samuel proposed to go to Jesse's house it says that the people of Bethlehem were afraid, they were greatly afraid. No wonder! He represented the authority of God in judgment. It is not that he was like a circuit judge, putting men in prison and the like, sending them to the chair or the gallows. It was not just that. It is not physical, but more judgment for the maintenance of good conditions, good relations. We are told, "God ... has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed, giving the proof of it to all in having raised him from among the dead" (@Acts 17:31). Who is that Man? That is Jesus. What a time they will have, dear brethren, in the coming day when the judgment will be taken on by Jesus! All matters will be taken on by Him and He will remove causes of sorrow. What hinders the joy He will remove in judgment. And so Samuel went around to create better conditions, to see that good conditions were maintained. How much need there is for this! It requires eldership, it requires fatherhood, it requires experience to deal with conditions that hinder the joy. There is a great deal of that, dear brethren, heaviness in our meetings, and the cause of the heaviness has to be dealt with. Hence the necessity for a circuit. That is to say, the Lord comes round through the minister, and deals with conditions that hinder the joy. If the dispensation is to be maintained at the proper level conditions that hinder the joy must be dealt with. Paul said to the Corinthians, I do not want to come to you in heaviness, but I will have to, for certain among you have been practising certain
{487}
things and have not repented. I will have to come in heaviness. I will have to come with the rod, but I do not wish to. I would rather come in love and have a joyous time with you.
This brings up the necessity for Samuel's circuit ministry. The circuit is specified here. It was a yearly matter beginning with Bethel, then Gilgal, then Mizpah, then he returns to his own house, that is, the return. The circuit must have a return. So that Samuel, as you can understand, would leave Ramah with his family and would not be indifferent to the state of the house he left. He would see to it that his own house is looked after. For how can I take care of the assembly of God if I do not see to my own house? So that he would leave his house in happy conditions. He would go to Bethel, he would judge Israel there. That is, Samuel would sit in judgment there and say, What is the history of Bethel? What are the facts relative to Bethel? If we go to the prophets we find that Bethel had come under the power of idolatry, but not in Samuel's day. Samuel precluded that. He carried judgment to Bethel. He must have inquired, What is the important feature in Bethel? Well, Jacob was in Bethel. It is the house of God, he says. Samuel would say to the merchants of Bethel, Do not forget that you are living in a place that suggests the house of God, and if it be so, then our behaviour must be in keeping with the house of God. As @1 Timothy 3:15 says, "In order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house". That is to say, you would bring to bear on them the facts relative to Bethel. Then he would come on to Gilgal. What is the history of Gilgal? Do you know the history of Gilgal, you young people here? Have your fathers told you about the twelve stones that were set up there? Have you made inquiry from your fathers about these twelve stones? Have you made inquiry? Well, some young people say, I never thought of it, I am out playing a ball game. Those suggestions
{488}
come out of the pit of Satan. What else? The circumcision. Samuel would say, Brethren, what about the circumcision? Are all circumcised here? Some would say, No, my children are not circumcised. I do not think much of it. I do not think much of things being done like that. The children do not know what is happening. But the word as to circumcision was for the whole household, household-wise. You are saying differently. What you say is contrary to the word of God. If a brother there was obstreperous, Samuel would not tolerate that. There can be no peace, no happiness in Gilgal unless we enforce circumcision, and unless we see the twelve tribes of Israel were a unit. You can see how sobering and beneficial and healthy this would be, this journeying in a circuit of the great prophet Samuel. Then he would come to Mizpah. It means ' a watch tower '. Brethren, he would say, are you watching? The Lord Jesus says, "But what I say to you, I say to all, Watch" (@Mark 13:37). "Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving" (@Colossians 4:2). If you do not, the enemy will come in on you unawares. "And it was on account of the false brethren brought in surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus", Paul says (@Galatians 2:4). We are to watch ourselves, judge ourselves unsparingly. Satan has his emissaries and they come in unawares unless we are watching. Samuel would enforce all these things. I do not know how many meetings he might have in each place, but he would challenge the brethren in each of those places as to the quality in the place and he would put out the truth that stands related to each place, and then he would go back home. Well, he would go to Ramah, happy indeed that he had been able to see the brethren and put things right among them, maintaining things suitable to the dispensation. Now, he says, I must return to my house. His wife, I may say, meets him at the door. Of course, his children had grown up, but I am speaking figuratively. How
{489}
about the wife? Has she looked well after the household in the absence of her husband? If not, her husband would say, My dear, do you not remember the thirty-first chapter of Proverbs? You say, they were not written then, but that is not the point. They are written now. Let the wife look into it, how a wife should behave herself in the absence of her husband. How about the children? Are they properly clothed? Not in the fashions of this world, no. She gets her life from another world. Typically, the virtuous woman of @Proverbs 31 is the church, the assembly, the bride of Christ, and she is looking after His interests while He is away and when He comes back He finds things as they should be, and happy, He sits down in His house. It says of him there, "And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house, and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to Jehovah". You see, he carries on the judgment of Israel there. He cannot judge Israel there if his house and children are not right. Samuel, what have you to say about my house? Look to your own house. Alas, we have to take that to heart! But he judged Israel from his house. Anyone that came to Samuel at Ramah would be received. His office was to judge Israel at all times. He did not return to his house to relax, to have an easy time. That was not the idea. Although one can relax in his own house better than anywhere, do not forget that the judgment of Israel goes on in your own house too. Your own house must be judged. It must be judged as I was saying, but then the head of any other household of Israel may go there and get counsel from Samuel. "And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life". A leading man of Israel would come to Samuel and Samuel would say, Well, my man, what is on your mind? Well, this and that has happened in my house and my business. I should like advice. I should like to know just what to do. Samuel would say, Well, I have anticipated your need, I have been praying for you. We have been speaking of that today. Peter fell down at
{490}
the knees of Jesus. Every truly spiritual man understands the necessity for the knees of Jesus, the intercession of Jesus. He says, I will continue to pray for you. Does Jesus continue to pray for us? He does. He also will make intercession for us, "always living to intercede for them" (@Hebrews 7:25). It is a continuous thing. How could we get on without it? So that Samuel would assure the man that he was prayed for. One of the greatest services we can render to the saints, brothers and sisters alike, is to pray night and day. Keep on. The sphere will widen as you go on. And like Samuel, you will not be sinning against the Lord. If we cease to pray for the saints, we sin against Jehovah. It is a very solemn thing because many of us do not think of it. You say a few words for yourself maybe, but do not forget you are sinning against the Lord if you do not pray for the saints. You say, you are putting me in Samuel's place. Why not? What are these things mentioned for? We are to pray for one another. We are enjoined to pray for one another, and we are to pray without ceasing, and if we do not do it we are sinning against the Lord. You say that is a very severe word. Well, I will give you one that is more severe. "Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently" (@Jeremiah 48:10). It is to dispel from our minds all looseness or idea that these things are optional. Things are imperative, things are not optional in the ways of the Lord. The Lord would bring us into the current of His own thoughts. The Holy Spirit is down here and makes intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered. The Holy Spirit enables us to pray for the saints and make intercession for the saints. Let us then continue in it! But then, I was speaking about Samuel, and it says, "And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house, and there he judged Israel". Well, it is the best word really in a way, "and there he built an altar to Jehovah". In this house there was always a means of sacrifice and worship. So that Samuel's house is a model for us and I would say that
{491}
everyone that serves the Lord has to be exemplary both in himself and in his house. And that, I believe, is what the Spirit of God would leave with us, that Samuel judged Israel in his house. He had an altar in his house which he built to Jehovah to offer sacrifices every day, the morning and evening lamb, I suppose, was something like it. What a holy, sanctified place was the home of Samuel! How an Israelite would be encouraged and stimulated as he went to see the prophet and sought counsel of him; the prophet, doubtless, would ask him to come and have a word of prayer together, the best service perhaps that he could render. And that was how the circuit of Samuel went on, year after year, and it went on all the days of his life.
{492}
RIGHTEOUSNESS
@Matthew 1:19-21; @Matthew 3:13-17; @Matthew 10:41
It is in my mind to speak about righteousness, one of the greatest subjects of Scripture. Matthew speaks of it more than all the other evangelists together, fifteen or sixteen times as compared with about twelve in the other three evangelists; obviously it is because he speaks of the assembly. Of course the others do also, but they do not name it formally, as Matthew does. Righteousness has a great place in relation to the assembly; of course it is a basic thought in the gospel and significantly Matthew stresses the sufferings of Christ on the cross by God. He deals with His extreme sufferings and with the sacrificial service of Christ. Matthew quotes the actual words which the Lord used on the cross: "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? ... My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?". Matthew indicates the reason. It was a question of sin. It was a question of God dealing with sin in Christ. It was there upon Him vicariously. He is "separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens" (@Hebrews 7:26). It is entirely a case of the forsaking. He is said to have cried twice at the cross, expressing the deep feeling of our blessed Saviour, the Son of God, blessed for ever, in that He should cry as forsaken, God dealing in His infinite holiness with sins in Him. That was vicarious, so that the apostle Paul says: He was "made sin for us, that *we* might become God's righteousness in him" (@2 Corinthians 5:21), not only to be accounted righteous, but to be made the righteousness of God, made that because He was made sin for us. So that this is fundamental; this proposition of the righteousness of God is all triumphant, it is manifest, not simply that it exists, it is manifested unto all, and upon all those that believe. It was said of Abraham that his faith was reckoned unto him as righteousness; it could only be
{493}
reckoned unto him as righteousness on the basis of the cross and the death of the Lord Jesus Christ there. So that these who believe are justified "through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for the showing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God; for the shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus" (@Romans 3:24-26). God is leading a great number out who will fit in with His purpose. It is said: "Whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified" (@Romans 8:30). All this is in accordance with His eternal purpose. He foreknows us and looking down then He predestinated those whom he foreknew, and then He justified them and glorified them. It is in principle the glorification of the saints, for it is divine Persons vindicating us. Righteousness is a great fundamental item as in relation to the assembly, because in saving us He has the assembly in mind. There are those who preach the gospel, but the assembly is the counterpart of the gospel. If I am saved, it is to be a member of the body of Christ, so that what I have to say is in relation to all those who are believers. Believers are better hearers of the gospel than any others, because they hear in relation to the assembly. Matthew speaks of righteousness more than all the other evangelists. We are given such expressions as "Righteous Abel" (chapter 23:35) and "Then will the righteous shine forth" (chapter 13:43). Daniel says that they that turn the many to righteousness shall be as the stars, but Matthew uses expressions such as: "The blood of righteous Abel", and "These shall go away into eternal punishment, and the righteous into life eternal" (chapter 25:46). That is a fine term. Maybe some of us have no idea of going into eternal life. We have the idea of having it, but going
{494}
into it is another feature of it. We realise going into it. Hence the greatness of the thought of righteousness. And it is written of Abraham specially that his faith was reckoned unto him as righteousness, and in his conversation about Sodom he speaks about righteous people. They are the determining factor in all towns. They are that now; not one of the righteous is overlooked. If we are not taken out of the world immediately, God will make a way for us in it so as to carry on in His testimony. These are the two alternatives. If the saints are to continue on for a little longer here, God will make a way for us. He can stop the war; that is a simple matter for Him. If we are to be taken away, the war may go on. The righteous will determine the matter, because God says: ' If there are only fifty righteous in the city, I will save the city because of them '. God did not stop until Abraham stopped. He went down to ten. If God does right, for righteousness is doing right, then you may be sure the righteous will be cared for in every way by God. Joseph is made more of in this chapter than Mary. It says: "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham". There are females, such as Rahab and others, named, but the thought is the male side, that is the legal position, and when we come to Mary, Jesus is called Christ, and Joseph is mentioned as the husband of Mary. That is, he is legally the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and it says that he was a righteous man. If ever there was a righteous man needed it was in this position. Not that he was spoken of as Mary was; "Blessed art thou", but it is said that he was righteous, and God could trust him with such a charge, a most delicate situation, a most holy situation, and he meets the position. He was a righteous man. He thought over the facts. He was not rich. I refer to it now because in a relative sense we have such situations arising maybe in this town in the issue of the testimony, that is, delicate matters that must be taken up in a holy way. Only righteous men have to say in such matters,
{495}
and Joseph was a righteous man. Respect for Mary his wife was active. Affection was active. In what we call care-meetings the elders should be in a spirit of fatherhood. It is most important in a holy subject, as well as contemplation, meditation, so as to deny all natural feelings. Do not be in a hurry, do not be in restlessness, but be restful and get into the presence of God, as in @Psalm 73 which tells us that Asaph was greatly distressed about public matters and wicked men; of course they do distress us, and so does their literature, never perhaps more so than at the present time. They that follow the national course have much to say, but God says: ' It is only a little while till the matter is solved. ' Asaph went into the sanctuaries of God, and the matter was settled. Then he could sleep peacefully. Who is there here that has not been distressed at the possibility of what is going on? Asaph went into the sanctuary of God and we may enter in. The holiest is open to us. We have "boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus, the new and living way, which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, and having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water" (@Hebrews 10:19-22). Let us draw near to God! It may not be altered outside, but it is in my heart. What is important is that God is not obliged to tell us all His secrets, but if we get into His presence we are restful there, so Asaph says: "Until I went into the sanctuaries of God; then understood I their end" (@Psalm 73:17). Of course our feelings remain, but God will have us maintain those balanced feelings in the current matter. So that Joseph here, we are told, thought over these things. The angel of God appeared to him. That is equivalent to his entering the holiest. God brought it to him to settle his mind, to make him restful, that God was doing this. Think of the magnitude of the matter!
{496}
and so the angel appears to him in a dream saying: "Joseph, son of David", that is the dignity, the royal line. The angel says: "Fear not to take to thee Mary, thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus". The angel had told Joseph to do this. The point is that it is a message. "Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for *he* shall save his people from their sins." That means that the Babe in Himself is God, and He is going to save His people. It is His people. Jesus means: ' Jehovah the Saviour '. What a wonderful thing to be said to a man like Joseph, who was a carpenter! But he was a righteous man. He was a greater man than Herod, or Pilate, or Caesar. Morally a righteous man is outstanding. The next chapter shows us how he was trusted with the Child and His mother to take them and go into the land of Egypt. God could have killed Herod, but certain things had to be worked out, and this man is trusted with the Lord Jesus, the little Child. And now, while extending this thought to our own times we can see that what is needed is righteousness. How can we face these days without righteousness? Righteousness will win the day and God will use and honour the righteous man. God will surely make the matter clear to us. There can be no solution of severe difficulties save on this line. God is looking for righteousness.
In the next passage we have the Lord Jesus Himself. He came from Galilee to be baptised of John. How He came from Galilee we do not know, but He came to be baptised by John. All the way from Galilee the Lord Jesus had in mind to be baptised of John, and when He came to John, John said: ' Oh no, that cannot be '. You can never be right in forbidding Christ, however honourable it may be. So the Lord says to him: "Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". "It becometh us", the Lord and John the baptist, the two of them. Jesus said: "It becometh us", not only Me. There could be nothing but righteousness in Jesus, but
{497}
the Lord brings in John the baptist to join Him in righteousness. "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I" (@Matthew 18:20); we would recognise one another -- unto His name. He would say: "It becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". What an undertaking was that to the Lord Jesus, and He would say it to us, and think of "All righteousness"! He was dealing with all sin, not a feature of it from Adam down was omitted in His holy mind. He was dealing with the whole matter, and He has dealt with it, and it never needs to be dealt with again, it is finished. Whatever the matter is, let us get around and see that everything is weighed. It is a question of all righteousness. One thing after another must be weighed before God and settled, if confession has to be made, for there is no forgiveness without confessing. If we confess our sins, He is just and forgives us. He has established a wonderful system in Christ above and the Holy Spirit here. Advocate is the same word as Comforter. The Advocate above will omit no items in any extreme difficulty. He will work with us until the work is accomplished, and the Holy Spirit operates to bring about a state of self-judgment. If any man sins, we have an Advocate, Jesus Christ the righteous. There is no passing over. We might as well face it. Every item has to be dealt with in the new system, so there is joy in the presence of the angels of God for every sinner that repenteth. No matters are left half finished. We must enter into the details, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. This of course extends to all difficulties, extending back however far, even from the blood of righteous Abel.
If things have not been dealt with before God in regard of matters in the past, the sin is there. God will never forgive it unless it is dealt with, nor will there be any deliverance before there is self-judgment. Time will never wipe it out.
{498}
We have this word in chapter 10: "He that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward". A righteous man will be received by a righteous man. A righteous man is mentioned three times in this matter. I think God keeps a special eye on the righteous men, and we must be amongst them. We have no part and right in the thing save as we are righteous, not only as being made righteous by God through faith, but righteous practically.
"There is then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit" (@Romans 8:1-4). That is a most wonderful chapter, and it begins just as I quoted. Not the legal, but the righteous side of the law shall be fulfilled in us by the Spirit, who walk not according to flesh but according to Spirit.
Abraham began with fifty. Exaggeration is a subtle thing which crops up in the best of us, but it has to be judged. Why did he not start at ten? If he knew there were fifty why did he not stick to it? He was concerned that Sodom should be saved, and that Lot should be saved. Was Lot a righteous man? That brings up another matter. If he is confessedly a man in the world, he is upright. Lot was called a righteous soul, because his soul was vexed every day by the unlawful conversation of Sodom, and there is not a man that has a soul like that who does not come under the notice of God. There are Lots, and men like Lot, in christendom. They do not join in with the corruption that they know of. They have a judgment of it. It was the most difficult matter to get Lot to leave Sodom. The angel had to take him by
{499}
the hand and lead him out. Why should you stay here? You are holding up the judgment of God by staying here. If you are judging what is in Sodom in some sense why not go the whole way with God? Abraham pleaded with Jehovah about Sodom. If there are men who are in the world but conscious of the sin, they should see the history of Lot. What a degrading history in his descendants! Lot suffered the consequences in the government of God of his entry into Sodom. He had taken up a political position and been slow to leave it. God says of Abraham: "I know him that he will command his children and his household after him" (@Genesis 18:19). The apostle says to the jailor: "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house" (@Acts 16:31). The jailor was baptised, he and all his. Twice over it is mentioned: he and his *house*, he and all his. So God says he knew Abraham. He knew Lot, He knows you. Jehovah said of Abraham: "For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice" (@Genesis 18:19). Abraham pleaded for his brother Lot, and God granted his request, although Lot's house, but not Abraham's, was disgraceful. He that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. God will reward a righteous man. Abraham has a wonderful place in Scripture. The Lord Jesus gives us a parable and says of a certain man that he died and he was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. Did Abraham remove Lazarus? What a reception Lazarus had! it was the reception of a righteous man. And the rich man also died and was buried. And lifting up his eyes he sees Abraham afar off. A great gulf is fixed between him and Abraham. It was a matter of righteousness. Abraham said to the rich man: ' In your life you have received good things, but now he is comforted '. How valued Abraham was in those days! There may be an
{500}
Abraham here and there may be the Lots needing adjustment.
God says: I am the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Abraham lives for Him. He is not God of the dead, but of the living. The Lord Jesus could picture Abraham as receiving a poor man as he died, carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. It is a parable bringing out what God thought about Abraham, that He should give him such distinction in the gospel. Abraham is mentioned constantly in the gospel. It is the honour God has put upon him as a righteous man. There are very few Abrahams. There may be the Lots that are righteous relatively. They are righteous souls, that are vexed every day. God takes notice of that, but He also takes notice of the fact that he was a hard man to save. Peter says: If the righteous are scarcely saved or difficult to save, where shall the impious and the sinner appear? So I am afraid most of us are just like Lot, righteous men in that sense; and God honoured him; but we want to think of Abraham and the blood of righteous Abel, how precious that blood is. It cries from the ground today. And so in this remarkable passage the Lord says: "He that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward". Every Abraham here tonight has got something in the way of reward. "He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me. He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward." And then the Lord Jesus says, "And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward" (@Matthew 10:42). A righteous man can give a reward. He is a representative of God, and those can give rewards. They have got something. It is a poor thing to be a liability on the world, because christians are supposed to be rich, not
{501}
financially, but rich spiritually, so that Paul is speaking about giving. It says the Lord Jesus was rich, and for our sakes He became poor, that we by His poverty might be rich or enriched.
Without righteous men we cannot function. Without righteousness we cannot be representatives of God.
{502}
JOY FROM RECEIVING THE GOSPEL
@Luke 15:7; @Acts 8:8; @Acts 13:52
In undertaking this service there has been much prayer, and may the result be joy from the gospel experienced! Luke is taken up by the Spirit of God to present the evangelical features of Christ's ministry. He was not an apostle but he was very affected by Paul's gospel, "God's glad tidings ... concerning his Son ... Jesus Christ our Lord" (@Romans 1:1-4). It is Paul who speaks of "the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God" (@Titus 3:4). These words might be hyphenated as conveying one great thought: God's kindness-and-love-to-man. Luke has man before him in his narrative, and he connects joy with it from the very beginning, telling us of the incident of shepherds in the days of Christ's birth keeping their flocks by night and that the angel of God was there by them. It does not say he came, he was there, that was the important matter, he "was there by them" (@Luke 2:9). And the glory of the Lord shone around them, which was a very remarkable incident, an incident that reminds us of heaven's attitude at that time. Many crises have arisen from Adam down which moved heaven. The windows of heaven were open in the days of the deluge. Very important days, too. Heaven was often interested, providentially interested, in occurrences on earth, but never as much as when Jesus was born. The angel said to the shepherds, "Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour". "Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy"; that is a fine expression. The very term "glad tidings" involves joy, but he says, great joy", and that is the key to the gospel, that it carries "great joy". It carries other things, but all occasion joy. The gospel carries with it grace, the tidings of grace, and grace involves that the person who is a great sinner may be relieved of his sins at once; if he is really judging them, if they are a burden upon him,
{503}
if they are weighing him down, causing him distress, there is relief from them and joy. Those of us who have not had this experience are very poor christians. So that what the angel said involved many things. "I bring you good tidings of great joy ... For unto you" not simply unto men, unto the nations, but to the persons *there*. That is the point of this meeting tonight, the persons that *are here*. Scripture always contemplates directly the persons who are reading it. And so the gospel always contemplates those who are listening to it and so one hopes there is a message for all in this audience.
Luke begins, according to the angel's word, with "great joy". The Lord takes up the golden thought in the verse I read in the fifteenth chapter. The man called his neighbours together, saying, "Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost". I went after it and I found it. Luke says, "I have found my sheep", but @Matthew 18:13 says, "And if so be that he find it". This latter is a very solemn and searching word, for it means that he might *not* find it. Matthew has someone in mind that should be at this meeting. Instead of being here he is away at a card party, or in bad company otherwise, and the Lord does not find him. So that Matthew says "if" he finds him. The sheep is lost and the shepherd goes after the sheep. If the sheep lives in San Francisco, the Lord sets out to find him in San Francisco. He ought to be where the Lord intends him to be. The young man or the young woman should be under his parents¬ control. Instead of this, when the Lord comes to the place he is not there, but in some bad company, the theatre, or some picture show, but he is not there. Thus the Lord does not find him. That is what Matthew says, Matthew implies that possibility. But Luke does not have that in mind.
Luke says in this chapter, "What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that
{504}
which is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it," (that is, he *does* find it) "he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing". That is his burden. The parable goes on; "And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost". It is a finished matter. It is a fine piece of work of the great Shepherd, that is the parable. The direct teaching of the parable is in the verse I have read: "I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance". That is the teaching of the parable and its teaching covers a wide field of persons who do not realize their need of a saviour, who do not realize that they are sinners, who do not admit the great statement of Scripture that, "all have sinned and come short of the glory of God" (@Romans 3:23). There are a large number of those in this town, a large number, and in the next town to them a large number, and in the town across the bay a very large number who have not come to the definite conclusion that the Scriptures are true, that "all have sinned and come short of the glory of God". And so the Lord, in order to enforce this great truth, furnishes later another parable: two men went up to the temple to pray, one a pharisee and the other a publican. The publican is a tax-gatherer, an odious kind of a man, for he is apt to exact more than is due. The word pharisee pertains to a sect, and the sadducees were another sect. These were the leading sects at the time our Lord was on the earth. The pharisees believed in the Bible. We thank God for those who believe in the Bible. The devil exercises a great effort to discredit the Bible. The schools and the colleges are much employed to this end; so that we are thankful for anyone who believes the Bible. The Ethiopian eunuch was of great account in his own kingdom, and on his way back from Jerusalem he read the Bible. This man was a great statesman in those days, and he had a Bible. I always
{505}
feel that taking out my Bible in the railway is like a flag. And this man was reading his Bible. I have known men coming out from the old country who put the Bibles their mothers gave them as far down in the trunk as possible and left them there, but this man did not do that, he read it and he read a good text too. "Who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed? ... He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and was as a sheep dumb before her shearers" (@Isaiah 53:1,7). The evangelist says to him, "Understandest thou what thou readest?" He answered, "How should I then be able unless some one guide me?" Philip sat by his side and announced the glad tidings of Jesus to him (@Acts 8:26-38).
Well, the pharisees believed in the Bible; they were orthodox. The sadducees were like many modernists that do not believe in angel or spirit, they do not believe in resurrection of the dead. It is a terrible thing that anyone should deny the resurrection from the dead. Everyone would be lost from Adam onward, if there is no resurrection. "If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins" (@1 Corinthians 15:17). This wicked doctrine makes man like the horse and the dog; the sadducees were among them. But the pharisees were hardly better for they placed themselves beyond the pale of salvation in refusing to own themselves sinners. They were the ninety-nine just persons who had no need of repentance; the opposing people that need no saviour to die for them. One of them says, "God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men" (@Luke 18:11). That prayer does not go above the ceiling. Well, the publican was ashamed to lift up his eyes even to heaven because he knew he was a sinner.
Heaven takes great interest in sinners. The greatest of sinners, Paul, said, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom *I* am chief" (@1 Timothy 1:15). A light shone round about Saul of Tarsus, and the Lord Jesus speaks to him. Such was the interest in a man
{506}
who confessed himself as the greatest sinner. He got converted, and on that very day his sins were all washed away. It was by the Son of God, "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree" (@1 Peter 2:24). And so this man that I have alluded to in @Luke 18 said, "O God, have compassion on me, the sinner." He is not talking of any other person in the universe but himself. He had learned his lesson.
It is the repenting sinner, the confessing sinner that is saved. "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners", the blackest and worst of them. The Lord Jesus with His own lips tells us that "this man went down to his house justified rather than the other". Is there not one here tonight that wants to be justified freely by God's grace that is in Christ Jesus? It is to all, and upon all those that believe. There is repentance, the acknowledgment of guilt, and consequently "being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood" (@Romans 3:24,25). Some opponents of the truth would say you are bringing us to the idea of a shambles; they wish to set aside the precious meaning of the blood of Jesus. There is no forgiveness and no justification without blood. Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. It is for us to appropriate it by faith. "Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood". It was the Lord Himself, having become a Man who bore our sins in His own body on the tree. And now the gospel is "towards all, and upon all those who believe" (@Romans 3:22).
Well, according to the Lord's own word: "likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth". One sitting in his seat listening to me, who turns to God as a sinner before God, will begin to make history in heaven. There are no newspapers published up there,
{507}
but history is made every day by repenting sinners. Heaven is aglow as sinners in their localities repent. The joy goes out as one in this town, or in the other towns confesses himself a sinner. Heaven is made joyful. The Lord's own words are: "joy shall be in heaven" and farther on "joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth". Is there not joy for everyone here who turns to the Saviour? There is joy in heaven, and the angels see it, they see it in the face of Jesus. Angels see the face of Jesus, and they know that someone has repented because of joy in that face. It is *very* precious. Every christian ought to recall the joy that was in heaven as he repented.
The next thing is joy in a city. @Acts 8:8 says: "And there was great joy in that city". That was the city of Samaria. There has never been such a time of cities as the present time. Cities are larger than they have ever been, but it cannot be said of any one of them that it is characteristically marked by great joy because of men turning to God through the gospel. It is a very remarkable fact that this city of Samaria was said to be full of joy, and the cause of that joy was the gospel; not that the circus had come to town, or any other such human event. This was not that. Philip preached Christ; there was no political address, no tirade on the war. It was the preaching of the Christ and the deliverance accompanying it that caused the joy, the effect of grace on those stricken by sin and Satan. Unclean spirits went out of many, crying with a loud voice; and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. All this happened in that town, and the town became joyous. No wonder! I do not suppose that for centuries it could be said that there had been great joy in Samaria. But now it is there because of the preaching of Christ, and its effect. The first effect was on "unclean spirits". They went out, "crying with a loud voice". People say there are no such things today as persons possessed with unclean, spirits. It is certain that there are such. Cities
{508}
are marked by this. The Lord Jesus in the days of His flesh came through Decapolis. Decapolis was a province of *ten cities*. In cities people may be seen waiting to get into a theatre even in the rain! Cities are centres of sin. No thought marks them of salvation or the need of it. The Lord had just been up near Tyre, the place of commerce, and He met a woman who said to Him that her daughter had an unclean spirit, and she was greatly distressed about it, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David". How many daughters are like that! They go out at night dishonouring their parents, and the devil gets into them. The gospel is nothing to them; their parents are nothing to them; the devil provides for them. And there was this girl with an unclean spirit, and the mother felt it; thank God for that mother! She said "Lord, help me." She was a Syrophenician having no claim on him naturally, and hence He said, "It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs". "And she said, Truth, Lord:" that is the point, dear friends, *the acknowledgment of the truth*. It is most difficult to get people to accept the truth. It is the truth as to God, the truth as to Christ, the truth as to yourself, the truth as to the devil, and the truth as to eternal punishment too. But this woman bowed to it saying, "Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters¬ table". She went the full length of the confession that was needed in referring to the dogs *under the table*. How humbly she accepted her place! The Lord said to her, "Because of this word, go thy way, the demon is gone out of thy daughter" (@Matthew 15:22-28). It is a question of *confession* of the truth. Repentance is a great thought.
And now the Lord is dealing with persons who are unclean in the city of Samaria. Unclean spirits went out of them. Besides that, paralysed people and lame people were healed. They appropriated what God made available to them, like the man who carried his bed (@Mark 2:10-12). Thus there was great joy in that city.
{509}
Now I pass on to show that there was joy in certain disciples. A christian characteristically is marked by joy. Of course we all know how to be sorrowful and weak, but christianity implies great joy, and in this case we are told that the apostles Paul and Barnabas were preaching, and as the Jews through envy opposed, they said, "It was necessary that the word of God should be first spoken to you; but, since ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the nations" (verse 46). "And those of the nations hearing it, rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord, and believed, as many as were ordained to eternal life" (verse 48). Being "ordained to eternal life" is a new thought in the history of the gospel in this book. Every christian knows, or should know, that he has been ordained to eternal life. Paul says, "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified" (@Romans 8:29,30). These are great and blessed christian truths, and we stand upon them as belonging to our sure Rock of salvation. Is there anybody here who has not come to the Lord and confessed? The point for you is to believe and repent. Repent, says the Lord Jesus, and believe in the gospel. It is for you, whoever you be. Thus you will accept the precious truth of ordination to eternal life as applying to you. The first point for you is to *believe*. The Spirit of God says here, repent, and believe the gospel. The Spirit says, "as many as were ordained to eternal life" believed. It is a feature of those that were ordained that they *believed*. So the word is to everyone here tonight, "Repent and believe in the glad tidings" (@Mark 1:15). Heaven will then put a label on you, as it were, "Ordained to eternal life". I would not give up that truth for anything, it is as a solid rock to my soul. The Lord
{510}
Jesus says, I give unto my sheep eternal life. Seventy, eighty, ninety years is not even like a drop in the ocean of eternity. Ninety years, and then you go where? Believers go into eternal life; but not only go into it then, but have it now, through faith realizing it by the Spirit. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal" (@John 3:16). What a gospel! Can anybody be without it? One hundred years is hardly like a drop in the ocean as regards time and eternity; and if you die in your sins you will be raised in your sins. There will then be no forgiveness, thence you will go away into eternal punishment (@Matthew 25:46). Do not therefore put the gospel away from you. It is for your own eternal welfare to accept it. It is for you to escape eternal fire. We read of "Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath" (@1 Thessalonians 1:10). In our scripture we read that the word of the Lord was carried through the whole country. "But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit". That is what one would hope to be the result in some little way here tonight. Notice the *disciples*. Every true christian is a disciple and we are to be filled with joy. This is the characteristic result of the reception of the gospel. They believed and were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit. This is no cheap or trivial matter. It is of the greatest importance, and it is supreme folly to ignore it. It has cost Christ infinitely, for He "died for us, that whether we may be watching or sleep, we may live together with him" (@1 Thessalonians 5:10). So that we are to be filled with joy now and throughout eternity with Christ.
{511}
GOD'S RELATIONS WITH HIS PEOPLE
@Genesis 17:22; @Genesis 18:33; @Genesis 35:13
I have a thought that came to me today as to God's way of maintaining personal relations with His people through visitations. I have selected Genesis because of the peculiar freshness it always affords to subjects of which it treats. It affords early facts, relative to God and men, that have peculiar freshness, simplicity and unofficialness, particularly in His personal relations with men. They began early, for we read of Him, heard as walking in the garden. Adam heard the voice of God, and the facts indicate plainly enough that He intended to commune with Adam, to be personally heard by His great creature, the creature and his help-meet that He had taken great pains to create and form, seen too as His own provision in the garden. He planted it eastward, we are told, in Eden.
Well, that is a very early instance of what I am speaking of; but it was a very sorrowful occasion, from one point of view. Very sorrowful, and to no one was it more sorrowful than to God. We are told later of conditions that grieved Him in His heart, conditions that had come about on earth after a lapse of many centuries, for the antediluvian age was more extensive than perhaps we are disposed to admit in our minds. I need not go into the details of that visit to Adam; whilst it was sorrowful it was eventful, and eventful of the very greatest things, the effect of which remain here to this very minute. Eve was there recognized as the mother of all living, and Adam so designated her. God seized the opportunity to establish and consolidate the light; that is what Adam would intimate. That is, if we get a little light and we are simple, God will come in to consolidate it, so that it remains as fixed. He clothed Adam and Eve just then. He made clothes for them; so that the idea would synchronize with the idea of life; it was life out of
{512}
death. If there was to be any life of which Eve was the mother, it must be on the principle of death; for the animals from which the skins or skin clothes were made clearly died. We just get hints in those early chapters. We do not get great unfoldings of doctrine such as the book of Romans. We get hints to faith for the believer to lay hold of, and it is a very precious hint that as Adam named his wife Eve, meaning the mother of all living, or really the word ' living ' is enough, God stabilized that in bringing in the skins, or the clothes, for Adam and his wife. So that great results had accrued from that visitation; it was not for nothing. God did not come into the scene and become defeated, and go out defeated. Before He left He drove the man out, but He drove him out as clothed. Satan was shut out too. He could get no advantage out of the introduction of sin into the garden. God already sealed the matter in the making of the clothes. And it is left there clothed, as you might say, and comes down to us in the One of whom it is said, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (@John 1:4).
And so we get God coming down or coming in to walk with another; that is, Enoch. It is spread over a period of three hundred years, one of the most remarkable incidents in the whole history of man is that walk between God and Enoch, year in and year out for three hundred years. We can understand what familiarity would rise from God's experience as I might say reverentially, for God has experience. What that was for three hundred years! What conversation, what communion, dear brethren, must there have been between God and Enoch. Finally God liked him well, and he grew greatly in His estimation. He was more to God in the three hundredth year than he had been in the first; there is no question about that. As one might paraphrase the facts, God might say, You are a great creature; I like you so well I wish to have you forever. And He did. He took him up to heaven, a remarkable
{513}
bringing out of what one has in mind in God coming in here in a personal way. It is no mere hour or hours or even days, but three hundred years in personal contact with the man, and the man in personal contact with his Creator. How the conversation was carried on, I cannot say. What form the communion took, we are not told. But what is stressed is the walk. Enoch *walked* with God three hundred years. The way it is put would indicate that others might be in that walk too, but he was one. I do not say there were others, but I should not deny it if anybody brought it forward. I do not believe for one moment that Enoch was the only one on earth in the antediluvian world in which he lived who could walk with God. He seized the opportunity, whether others did is not stated. But Noah did, and of course, Abraham. But I just wish to bring these facts forward initially, dear brethren, so that we might see what God is in that connection; how He can come down to His creatures, as it is said, "Who humbleth himself to look on the heavens and on the earth" (@Psalm 113:6).
And now I take up Abraham here. This short verse says that Jehovah "left off talking with him" (@Genesis 17:22). It was a conversation covering several points, but on one theme, namely, the heir, the seed to whom, and concerning whom, the promises were made. God said, It is I. Abraham could say, Well, it is I. Abraham and God; God and Abraham. What was going on in the vicinity? Who knows? Men went on, of course; their affairs went on; items of news, marriages, deaths etc. But here was a wonderful fact. God was down here conversing with Abraham, talking with him, listening to what Abraham has to say. You might say, what about Ishmael? Let him live before Thee: that was in Abraham's mind. God did not come down to talk to Abraham about Ishmael. When Abraham brought up the matter, God says, Well, he is thy seed; that is what interests Me about him. He does not interest Me himself; his ways do not suit Me, but he is thy seed.
{514}
And what an encouragement that is to all parents! Some of us have an Ishmael, alas! It is well to face these matters, a wild ass of a man, a persecutor of Christ when he was thirteen years of age. He began early. But Jehovah says, He is thy seed. Abraham introduces the subject, and God met him in His grace. He is thy seed, He says. Well, that is a comfort to every parent who has a wild ass of a boy, who does as he wishes, whose heart is toward Egypt. He does not go all the way. He dwells before his brethren. He is not ready to go all the way into Egypt. His mother took him a wife out of Egypt, but he has an eye on his brethren, and would like them to pay attention to him, too, when it suits him. He dwelt before his brethren. That means he has little or no conscience about his course. He has no shame attached to him. But then Jehovah says to Abraham, He is thy seed, and I bless him because of that. Well, that is a comfort. It is on low ground, but who is the father that does not take what he can get as regards his Ishmael? He is thy seed. How God honours godly fathers and godly mothers, even comforting them as regards their wayward boys and girls! He is thy seed, He says, "twelve princes shall he beget" (verse 20). He is going to have administrative powers on the earth. He is going to be over against his brethren and say he is as good as they are, ' You have twelve tribes; I have twelve princes '.
Well, I refer to that by the way, because it is part of the conversation, but the great theme was Isaac; "for in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee" (@Genesis 21:12). Paul says that, too; that is, Christ. And the Lord Jesus says, "Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced" (@John 8:56). He saw Isaac honoured in his house; he also saw Ishmael mocking, but he saw Isaac. Isaac, dear brethren, fills the chapter. He illumines the chapter. He is the great theme of the conversation. God has come into this. It is a household matter, and the time came when enough was said for the moment. The matter was not finished;
{515}
God broke off the conversation and went up. That is what is stated in the verse: "And he left off talking with him; and God went up from Abraham". It is not a finished matter; it is to be resumed. Think of the familiarity God had introduced and maintained with His great child, as I might call him, Abraham. He was great enough to be called a father; high father; father of a multitude. He was the most interesting man in all the earth to Jehovah at that time, and hence this conversation full of holy matters, the effect of which reaches down to us, as I was saying, the Lord said about Isaac, about Himself, "Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced". It is a question of Isaac, and hence the "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham" (@Matthew 1:1). And the closing words before the ascension were, "Sarah thy wife shall indeed bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him, for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him" (verse 19). Then He introduces Ishmael according to what I have been saying, and then He says further, "But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this appointed time in the next year" (verse 21). God is dealing with life. And He breaks off the conversation. He is to be visited again, of course. He is not to be forgotten. Isaac is to be looked after, too. But the conversation is ended, and, dear brethren, is there not a word as to our communion with God? It is one of the greatest things we could have before us. What intercourse have we with God? He comes in. One has been thinking much of it of late. The burden of the universe is on His shoulder. Of course it is seen in detail, but I am speaking now of God; worlds that we cannot compass are under His hand. "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (@Hebrews 11:3). He framed them by His word. He has not left them to wear themselves out. He has looked after them ever
{516}
since. We have to look after our watches, and in spite of that they run out and need repairs. There is not a world in the universe that is not looked after by God, in all His grace, and it never lapses. There is no lack of repairs. The system goes on; the number, the untold number of systems go on; the worlds go on. Think of that, dear brethren, what God is engaged with every day! Think of it, dear brethren! He has affairs that He is going on with that we have no idea of. We cannot touch them. He is occupied with them every day, and then He comes into our affairs, our families, and our agriculture or our businesses. Businesses of the men of faith are matters of concern to God. Even the grain of wheat God gives a body as it pleases Him. Think of God's feelings being brought in in a body given to a grain of wheat! Well, one could say much about that, but I think the dear brethren might do well to think over these matters and become enlarged; that God might come in to our families and talk to us about our children. The word of God is what He would say to us, and our prayers are what we would say to Him. Every creature of God is good, being sanctified by the word of God and freely addressing Him. That is, He is speaking to us, and prayer is our speaking to Him. That is how the matter goes on day and night in this world. If we laid hold of this it would have the effect of delivering us from what man is doing -- what God is doing day and night; He shuts it off if necessary; He left off speaking with Abraham and went up.
And then in the next chapter it tells us that He appears again in company with two others. Now it is not a question of regulating Abraham's house. Chapter 17 is a question of Abraham's house, and its regulation and what is the great theme of the regulation? Circumcision. That is, the putting off of the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ; the totality of it. That is the lesson of chapter 17, and now God comes back. What does He find? Will He be greeted by some fleshly
{517}
person in the house? Will it be like Martha who opened the door to the Lord and let Him in to her house and criticized Him as soon as He came in? No. Circumcision is a real feature in Abraham's house, and that, dear brethren, is the point in our houses. There is no question of criticizing anyone in the family, but the real point is the circumcision. If the children are to be kept, the application of circumcision in principle in the house is necessary. Baptism cannot be excluded from the idea of circumcision. Circumcision is a greater thought. Circumcision is the putting off of the body of the flesh -- the totality of it in the household; in the individual, of course, in the man himself. It applied to Abraham as it did to his youngest child; and to every servant in his house. The whole house is circumcised, and then God comes back. He had broken off the conversation, but He comes back, not now to adjust Abraham's house, but to accept hospitality in Abraham's house. You cannot expect godly people, spiritual people, to accept your hospitality except there be the principle at least applied of circumcision; baptism, of course, but circumcision as well. And according to the next chapter He comes in company. It is going to be a larger meeting. Chapter 17 is God and Abraham, but there are Three now, and Abraham and Sarah are called into it, and the servant, a young man. It is remarkable. Jehovah says to Abraham, We will wait here for you until you prepare what is needed. Think of that! That He, upon whose shoulders everything rests, the maintenance of the world, would come and just take it quietly under the tree until Abraham prepared His repast. God says, "So do as thou hast said" (chapter 18:5). He accepted his hospitality, and They waited until the meal was set before Them.
Well, many things were said and done; the time came for Them to move, for the moment, and Abraham said, "after that ye shall pass on; for therefore have ye passed on towards your servant (verse 5). He implied They were going on further; Abraham is not the objective this time.
{518}
He was so in chapter 17, but this time he is incidental, as it were, but of great importance. But God is going further; He passed on. Abraham understands Jehovah was on an errand. He was on a great mission, a mission of wrath. In principle, God is on His way to final adjustment of things in this world. Abraham was not the terminus, but He called in on His way; that is very beautiful. It is a wayside place for God. He comes in with two others. And Abraham ran. It is one of the remarkable things in Scripture, like Mary Magdalene and the father of the prodigal. What agility will arise when God comes in! Abraham ran. They all moved quickly. Now, the time is passing on and there is no running now, because God is very sure and steady and quiet. There is no hurrying at all in divine movements. All is according to perfect measurement, according to plan, according to the way devised. They are going to pass on, and Abraham says, I will go along with You. It is very beautiful; just like going with a friend down to the corner, or to the station. Pardon my simplicity, but I want to bring home to you what God is, coming down to Abraham, with utter disregard of, and supremely above, what men are doing. God is going His way; Abraham says, I will go along with You. And he did, and he plainly enough intimated, I would like a little word with You, Jehovah, and he had. The two men passed on. Where did they go? Down to Sodom. We are told in chapter 19 what happened there. There were only the two of them; Jehovah and Abraham had a wonderful time. I cannot go into the details of it. We have often heard about this wonderful word about the righteous, ten righteous. He comes down to ten righteous. Fifty righteous, forty, thirty, twenty, right down to ten righteous. God says, I will save the city for ten. That is God -- for ten righteous. One can understand the undercurrent in the mind of the blessed God. It would be wonderful if there were ten. He knew there were not. He knows the number of the righteous. They
{519}
are carefully marked off on this earth; they are so precious, so valuable. God knew the number that were in Sodom. That anyone in Sodom should be called a righteous man is grace. Lot should not be called a righteous man if he is in Sodom, but he is called a righteous man in the New Testament. God will save the city for ten -- ten righteous men, notice. Righteous men are most valuable, as I said.
Well, I come to verse 33. Jehovah went away on the line He was on, He had something in His mind; and Abraham, it says, returned to his place. The word ' place ' is to be noticed there. Abraham had a place. It is true enough he was a pilgrim and a stranger, but he had a place. There is much importance attached to that, Abraham's place. Jacob said, as we had this afternoon, that he would return to his country and his place. Paul says, "with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours" (@1 Corinthians 1:2). Do not forget that. Corinthians has the idea of place, but do not forget it is the place in which we call on the name of the Lord Jesus. It is known that we call on that name. There really can be no assembly in the locality save on that principle. The name is the thing. That is, we are not trusting the government to support us; we are not calling on them for their support. We pray for them, of course; we are glad to support them, but I was thinking of it lately in the mid-hours of the night. I wonder why it is that God allows the continuation of the conditions that are so intolerable abroad; still the trains are running; the sun rises every day; the rain falls; the moon rises, and the stars are there, and the laws are respected in every country. Who is at the back of all this? God is. Take His hand away and all would go to pieces. There is not a question about that. The christian would be conscious of it. If the divine hand were withdrawn, the whole thing would go to pieces. But it does not. God is in it, and so it is calling upon the name of the Lord -- that name has power in it and there is not a local
{520}
assembly there that could be without it. There is the protection not only of the government -- we pray for external government -- but the power of the Lord; the Lord Jesus in whose hand is all power in heaven and on earth; and in hundreds of places there are those that call on the name of the Lord Jesus. He is both theirs and ours. We are bound up in that in one unit. There are hundreds of localities on earth. Abraham went to his place, where he had servants, his wife, his tents, and his cattle, and where he administered things, entertaining his friends, entertaining God in his place. Each of us is to understand what is his place, and how he is holding himself in regard of others, similarly engaged in their place, calling upon the name of the Lord.
Well, Abraham went to his place. I have shown you, I think, that in chapter 17 it is a question of Abraham's house. And God settled that matter; He left off speaking and went up. In chapter 18 it is not a question of Abraham's house but of the judgment of Sodom, and Abraham was visited on the way. He would not be visited if he had not his house circumcised. If he failed in that God would not visit him on social lines. Pardon my using the word ' social ', but that is just what it is. It was the taking of a meal, taking lunch and then, when lunch was provided, going on in the way He had been going. It is a question of judgment, the Judge of all the earth is mentioned in chapter 18, and Abraham went back to his place in all the light of what God had said to him. Abraham would say, I wish there were more righteous persons. There are very few. But he is one himself. God had accounted him righteous. He was righteous.
Now in chapter 35 it is a question of the house of God; God coming into His own house. It is not Jacob's house; it is God's house, and how is He to find Jacob in it? He is coming in just to where Jacob is. He had had to do with Him there before, only He was in heaven and Jacob was on the earth, and now God comes down and
{521}
He converses with Jacob. It is a question of His house. And that brings up the question, dear brethren, of place, as to how each of us is behaving himself in the house of God, in his own place, where he calls upon the name of the Lord. That is one thing. Another thing is how you behave yourself in the house of God. So we are told here, "And God went up from him in the place where he had talked with him". Now it is not simply Jacob's place; it is the house of God, but in the place where the conversation was held. God is signalizing that place by going up from him. He does not go off from Jacob and then go up; He goes up from the very spot where the conversation was held. Is that a Bible reading? Or a ministry meeting? It is a question of Beth-el; El-Beth-el. That is the point. It is the house of God, and God speaks with us in the house. We are told, "But the Spirit speaks expressly, that in latter times some shall apostatise from the faith" (@1 Timothy 4:1). That is how it happens. God comes in and speaks with us, and then goes up. He is only here a short time. These seasons are not long. They are not intended to be long. The one in chapter 17 was not long, and certainly the one in chapter 18 was not long, and this one is not long. God has wonderful business matters to attend to, and if then He comes down to earth and visits us in His house, well, every minute counts. Who can afford to be absent? But then, we are speaking now about this man here; see what he says! What happened? "And God appeared to Jacob again after he had come from Padan-Aram, and blessed him. And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he called his name Israel. And God said to him, I am the Almighty God: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee; and kings shall come out of thy loins. And the land that I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land" (verses 9-12). Think of that! Well,
{522}
you say, that doesn't take long to say, but think of what is contained in it. Think of how much God can put into a few words, a few sentences. Do we understand, dear brethren, what the house is? Jacob did. We had something about it today. He was on his way to this very place; what happened on the way? how God was with him in the way! This very chapter tells us that God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there" (verse 1). And he did; and he buried the idols by the way. And now God appears. It is a question of a visitation. It is not only an appearing, but it is actually the standing of the feet of Jehovah there. Let nobody attempt to explain how this took place; what feet they were. They were human feet, be sure of that. It is a question of God in Man coming in. That is how He came in. He came in intelligibly to Abraham, and His feet trod on the spot where Jacob was, and He spoke to him, and He went up from that spot. I am seeking, dear brethren, to impress us all with what God is; the familiarity we have with God come in in Jesus; for Jesus is God. We get all this perfectly set out in Jesus -- the familiarity with which He is with His people, "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us" (@Acts 1:21). So, the passage I read says, "And God went up from him in the place where he had talked with him". That spot will never be forgotten. "And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had talked with him" (verse 14). It is never to be forgotten. And moreover, it says, "a pillar of stone, and poured on it a drink-offering, and poured oil on it. And Jacob called the name of the place where God had talked with him, Beth-el" (verses 14,15). Note that. It is a question of place every time, as if God says, Well, men claim this and that and the other, but I have got one place, however small physically; however circumscribed; I can take that; I can stand there and talk to you. And think of the speaking! What was conveyed to
{523}
Jacob in this conversation, and now the Spirit of God says, It is not only what was said, but where it was said, and it is to be signalized for ever. So that this earth, you know, is remarkable in that way. How heaven looks at different places! I have often thought of Asia Minor, the spread of christianity, outside of Judaea. See what places there are there, and in this continent too, that heaven knows well, the spots where divine Visitors came and spoke and left and went back again into heaven. How God has followed up mankind with His light and testimony; so the places there are well-marked in heaven, and well-marked too by those who love the Lord and His people, and where His Name is dear. For He says, Wherever I place My Name there I will come to you -- whatever place, there I will come to you and there I will bless you.
Well now, the point I would finish with is how did Jacob behave? What was his behaviour compared with chapter 28? Well, his behaviour here is that he pours a drink-offering on the pillar. Now, that pillar refers to my experience, and I was conscious when God was speaking to me that God loved me, that I pleased Him. That is the idea -- Jacob is now a lovable man and he is in the right place, a place where he was directed to go; that is Beth-el. Well, he would say, God would have me there; there He wrestled with me, and there He changed my name. Not to be boastful -- but see what a man he was! God made him what he was in Beth-el. He anointed the pillar, so that he could say at all times -- That is the spot. He was conscious that God loved him, and that he was pleasing to Him. He would say, If I have done anything out of the way since, I am ashamed of myself. I always want to get back to the joy of that occasion at the spot where Jehovah spoke to me.
