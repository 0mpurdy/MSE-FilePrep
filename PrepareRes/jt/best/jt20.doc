THE MORE EXCELLENT WAY (1)
@John 11:1 - 46
J.T. My thought was that we might see in these chapters 11 to 20, what corresponds with the movements of the ark, as having the passage of the Jordan in view. The ark had moved from the outset (after it had been constructed) in leading the way in the wilderness, and in finding resting places for the people. It had moved to indicate the way for the people through the wilderness, as we learn from @Numbers 10. But as we are brought to the end of the journey towards the passage of the Jordan there are peculiar stipulations; particularly that the people were to follow about 2,000 cubits behind. They remained three days at the Jordan before passing over, preparing victuals and sanctifying themselves. It was said, "For ye have not passed this way heretofore". @Joshua 3:4. It was on my mind that the consideration of the later chapters in John's gospel with that in view would enable us to follow the movements of the Lord as actuated by love for His people, so that we might be brought into correspondence with Him as following at a distance of 2,000 cubits behind; for the instruction that He gives had in view that the disciples should be brought into correspondence with Him. It is only thus that the glory is a known thing amongst us, and shines amongst us. There is really no testimony according to God apart from that -- the shining of the glory. We cannot but be impressed with the prominence given to glory in this connection. The Person who was about to move was Himself glorious, and the movements, and all that accompanied the movements, involved the shining out of His glory.
{2}
In chapter 10 we see that His service to the nation is ended. He is definitely rejected, not only by the leaders of the people but by the Jews. You will observe the recurrence of the word "Jews" in chapter 10. The Jews surrounded Him in Solomon's porch; they had taken definite account of what He was amongst them and what He had done; then they challenged Him, and He meets their challenge by calling attention to His works and what He was amongst them, with the result that they took up stones to stone Him. The Jews as such thus committed themselves to His definite rejection, so at the close of that chapter He goes over the Jordan to the place where John baptised at the first and abode there -- not yet with His disciples, as He did later (@John 11:54), but He abode there; He is alone. It is from that point that He proposes to go back into Judaea, which had already declared itself in murderous opposition, so that He is now definitely facing death. Jerusalem and Judaea were to be the scene of it, and hence this movement has a known murderous hostility in view. He is going to meet death, but He is not here entering as a victim. He is entering it by way of challenge. He is not the Victim here at all; chapter 10 shows that He is free. He says, "I lay down my life that I may take it again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again". @John 10:17. He had received this commandment of His Father. It was a movement of His own, a movement involving His meeting death and His disposing of it. But in moving to meet death to dispose of it, what comes up first is a loved one. He says, "Let us go to *him*". He thinks of the saints. He goes in His personal dignity and power, for the point was that God should be glorified, and that the Son of God should be glorified. He was entering the domain of death. He does it of Himself,
{3}
but in doing it He has the loved one first before Him.
H.D'A.C. It is really a divine Person walking through death.
E.M. Do you connect every movement with the outshining of His glory?
J.T. That is what is in view.
L.M. You said that it was not the victim side so much here.
J.T. The ark going into Jordan does not present the victim. It is not a type of the victim, but of the power of God and the glory of God. John presents a divine Person dealing with death, and that is not the thought of a victim, and hence it is --"What ailed thee, O sea, that thou fleddest, and thou Jordan that thou wast driven back?" @Psalm 114:5. It is the presence of the Lord as the power of God. Chapter 10 shows that all that power is available for the sheep; that power is supreme right through. "No one shall seize them out of my hand". @John 10:28. But now, there is one in death; that is what we get in this chapter. There was a certain man sick, Lazarus of Bethany. Death was about to lay claim to this loved one, and hence the Lord enters the field to overthrow this power. We get His feelings in regard of death in John more than we get elsewhere.
P.L. He groans in spirit at the grave.
J.T. Yes. 'Groan' is a strong word; it is He is deeply moved. The words "deeply moved in spirit, and was troubled", might be rendered, "He groaned and shuddered".
J.McI. You were saying that they had not gone that way before. Is that the thought here also?
J.T. They had not gone this way. Peter said to the Lord, "Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee". That was a mistake. He would do it later; but he could not do it then. We all have to learn what the 2,000 cubits mean. Thomas also says here -- "Let us also go that we
{4}
may die with him". The Lord says nothing about that, but it is quite obvious from what comes out later about Thomas that he was not prepared for it.
Ques. Is Lazarus a sample case of one who is relieved to follow Him?
J.T. Well, Lazarus was in death himself. I think it is as knowing Christ risen -- knowing the truth of Colossians -- that we follow. Lazarus is *let go*; as risen, he represents the liberty and dignity of the saints viewed as risen.
Ques. Is that headship?
J.T. It is more that you see you are risen with Christ. "In which ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead", @Colossians. 2:12. It is in the light of that that you accept death.
F.W. What is your thought as to the three days in which they were to prepare victuals at this point?
J.T. I think it indicates an exercise befitting this great movement. You need support for it; you need food for it. They were also to hallow themselves.
H.E.F. Do you mean that the considering of the Lord in His movements in these chapters would prepare us for following; hence the thought of following in chapter 12?
J.T. That is what they are intended for.
H.E.F. So that Peter does follow Him at the end.
J.T. Quite.
A.N. Where would you put this chapter in the epistles?
J.T. It really comes in with the first chapter of Romans. He is "marked out Son of God in power ... by resurrection of the dead". @Romans 1:4.
A.N. I thought that you had in your mind "risen with Christ", and that you connected it with Colossians.
J.T. I was going to say that the germ of it is introduced in the gospel. The gospel is the power of
{5}
God; it involves the power of God; God's Son marked out in power by resurrection of the dead. The gospel is concerning His Son, and it brings into the soul the knowledge of God -- the knowledge of God in power; but the Son is the power of God, and so the gospel is about Him. In the working out of the details in Romans there must be righteousness as a basis, but nevertheless it is the gospel of God concerning His Son, which, as received into the soul, carries with it the germ of all that follows; so that in Colossians one has come to it -- "in which ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead", @Colossians 2:12. It is a faith position, and it is only in the light of the power of God seen thus that we can undertake to follow.
J.McI. I suppose it would be spirit-wise in @Colossians 1 But here it seems spirit, soul, and body.
J.T. It is faith in Colossians, faith in the working of God. We are not raised literally; it is a question of the light we have got. It is in the faith of the operation of God that one follows. We have to remain 2,000 cubits behind, but we see what has happened. As the priests¬ feet touched the waters they receded -- they disappeared; that is what Colossians means. It is not what is done in me; it is what Christ has effected in His death. Risen with Christ is a question of faith -- what God has effected.
E.M. Would you say it is not only what He was going to effect, but His feelings in presence of the death of a loved one?
J.T. That is it. He is going to deal with something that affects the saints in this dreadful way.
P.L. Do you get the follower in the glory way in Paul, when he says, "I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the assembly"? @Colossians 1:24. He is following behind.
{6}
J.T. Quite. I think these chapters give us what you might call the dying of Jesus; but it is the Son of God. Paul desired to bear about in his body the dying of Jesus. This chapter begins the movement which involved His death. It is not the *death* of Jesus, but the *dying* of Jesus. He is going to die, and it is how. With what feelings! With what sympathies! With what considerations!
J.M. Is it not His movements in that way that attract the affections of the saints?
J.T. That is so. We are taught how to move here. The saints are before us. He says, "Let us go to him". Whatever stands between us and Him has to be removed. Death in this instance stood between the Lord and the loved one, but He does not say, Let us go to the tomb; but, "Let us go to *him*". That is the exercise. Can you meet that? The Son of God met it. The question, therefore, is what power one has with regard to the saints.
J.F. Do you apply the dying of Jesus to the whole journey when He set His face as a flint to go to Jerusalem?
J.T. Quite. That is what I understand. It is not His death, but the dying. We read in the next chapter of His being lifted up, signifying by what death He was about to die; and then it is said of Peter "by what death *he* should glorify God", @John 21: 19. But in regard of Lazarus He says, "Let us go to him".
H.D'A.C. He would reach the dead -- His loved ones -- and to reach them He Himself must go through death. Is that your thought?
J.T. Quite. Whatever lay between Him and a loved one must go. There was a serious barrier. Abraham said to the rich man, "between us and you a great chasm is fixed". @Luke 16:26. That was impassable. The Lord arrived here at the tomb and He groaned. The thing was not ordinary. He measured divinely what
{7}
He had to deal with. What lay between Him and Lazarus was not impassable to Him.
A.G. As being the One who was superior to death, in what way did He become subject to death?
J.T. By laying down His life. He had to lay it down. But to what do you refer when you say *subject*?
A.G. When He Himself died.
J.T. It is "obedient unto death"; but He lay *dead* three days; the pangs of death were loosed, for He could not be holden of death, but He *died*.
A.G. "As the Father hath given me commandment, even so I do".
J.T. Yes, it was in the pathway of obedience. No one took His life from Him. Here you have the Son of God, and as such He is superior to every barrier. But He is going to meet death, and He knows what death meant. The groan here signifies His estimate of it. It lay between Him and Lazarus.
E.J.McB. Do you understand by that that death would have closed up the loved ones for ever?
J.T. It would.
E.J.McB. They could never have come to Him.
J.T. David says in reference to the death of his child, "I shall go to him; he will not return to me" @2 Samuel 12:23. But then the Lord in saying "Let us go to him" meant that whatever stood in the way must go. He was going to remove what lay between Him and Lazarus.
E.J.McB. So that as one understands the purport of this education we should be able to get near to one another whatever the barrier may be.
J.T. I think that is the desire one would have here.
A.N. The outstanding point would be that it is the assembly that is the objective. Whatever stands in the way to hinder our reaching the assembly the Lord removes it by His power.
{8}
J.T. Exactly; here it is those who form the assembly. Then if you want to reach a brother, you want to go to him and the question is what power have you? John's ministry is intended to bring in power into our souls, so that we move towards Christ and then towards the saints.
Rem. In that respect there will be power to stay away as well as power to go.
J.T. You see the deliberation here. Jesus stays two days in the place where He was. Everything is measured in John. It is remarkable the reference to the measure of time.
R.B. Is your thought that we have power, as we see what the ark has accomplished 2,000 cubits ahead?
J.T. Paul said to the Corinthians, Christ lives by the power of God; and then he adds, "we shall live with him by God's power towards you" @2 Corinthians 13:4; you will know He lives in me to you in that way. He was dealing with them in power. They would know that. His letter had in view to reach them. "I have power", he said, "when your obedience is fulfilled, to deal with those who are disobedient"; "and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled". @2 Corinthians 10:6.
P.L. "Ye are in our hearts to die and live with you". @2 Corinthians 7:3. Is that glory?
J.T. That is glory; exactly.
P.L. And Paul travailed, he agonised, for the Colossians. Would that be to get to them, removing everything that separated him from them?
J.T. That is the principle. The Lord goes in the dignity of being the Son; there is nothing to hinder Him going. It is His own determination. He is free, but He remained two days in the place where He was. He knew Lazarus was sick. He now says, "He is asleep, and I go to awake him out of sleep". Then
{9}
He says, "But let us go to him". The movement is one of glory -- a movement of love.
P.B. Is it not important that the Lord says, "Let us go to him" before they had to move?
J.T. Yes.
H.D'A.C. Why does it say, Let us go to him? Why is it not the singular number?
J.T. I think the Lord would bring us into it. It is a family matter.
R.G. Does this action on the part of the Lord involve His death?
J.T. It does. He says, I am the resurrection. *I am*.
R.G. What is in my mind is that He had power to remove death in the case of this loved one before He actually removed it before God for us. How does that come in?
J.T. I think that is what is referred to in Romans 1, "by resurrection of the dead". I think the dead there is plural. It is not simply His own resurrection; it is the resurrection of others. He is declared to be the Son of God -- that is the great testimony that comes out in this movement. He is declared to be the Son of God with power by resurrection of the dead.
R.G. That is a proof that He was the Son of God. Do all the miracles He wrought for the deliverance of man anticipate His death?
J.T. Well, they would have no meaning were it not that He was going to dispose of the whole question of righteousness, and that involved His death. But then there is the testimony clearly set out in this chapter as to His Person by the resurrection of Lazarus. Hence later God says, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again".
Ques. Are things in relation to the glory of God carried out by the Son of God?
{10}
J.T. Quite.
P.L. Would you get in the ark the power in which He deals with death, and then in the priests carrying it those sensibilities of love which He would form in our hearts?
J.T. I think the priests carrying it would represent the holiness in which the Lord definitely acted in going into death. As it says, "according to the Spirit of holiness".
W.S.L. Have you any thought as to why the Lord allowed death to supervene before He moved?
J.T. Is it not to bring out that He intended to become endeared to this family? He intended to have a place with them that He never had had before. It is a wonderful result. They knew Him in a new way. "Did I not say to thee that if thou shouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of God?" It is a movement in which the glory was manifested. It is a wonderful scene in Bethany, as one might say, "filled with the glory". @Numbers 14: 21.
W.S.L. Did He have in view chapter 12?
J.T. Yes; He had that in view. He came to Bethany. Chapter 11 begins with the wonderful result that had been reached. It says, "It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick". That was the result He had in view.
W.C.G. Would chapter 12 bring in Colossians?
J.T. I think it does. The Lord had that end before Him.
W.S.L. The opening of chapter 12 is a scene of glory, and every movement that led up to it manifests His glory.
J.T. If the glory is not seen in our circumstances, what is there? We are either filled with ourselves or with Christ. They made Him a supper, but He came there before they made the supper. He was before them.
{11}
H.E.F. Why does it say that "Jesus six days before the passover"?
J.T. He was on the way. These chapters indicate the way, hence His feet are anointed. His feet are carrying Him but it was six days before that that He had this refreshment. Mary's action is the result of chapter 11. He was refreshed; as it says in @Psalm 110:7, "He shall drink of the brook in the way". He was on the way to death, and Mary understood from the previous experience where He was going. She had discernment by spiritual intelligence that He was going to die. That was the way He was on.
J.J. Would the fact that Mary sat still in the house indicate that she understood the 2,000 cubits?
J.T. I think so. You see a certain spiritual state in her that is not in Martha. She stands out in that way. In chapter 11 she sat still in the house; then she gets the message, "The master has come and calleth for thee". He knows what is in Mary's soul.
It is the personal touches you get here. "He calleth *for thee*". And then she has the favour of walking with Him to the sepulchre. He remained where Martha met Him until Mary came. Martha did not lead Him to enquire for the grave.
J.B.C. Would the character of John 11 suggest the constraining love of Christ. I had in mind what you referred to earlier in regard to the way that every previous movement may be on the line of knowing Him after the flesh. While the thing they saw in Him was divine, still the Lord's position has to be changed. It is power but in such fashion and expression of His feelings that it becomes the constraining love of Christ.
J.T. Just so. I think it is most affecting to take account of the Lord's own feelings. It was an immense thing for them that He could raise Lazarus
{12}
from the dead, but that they should know what His, *feelings* were in the act is most affecting.
P.B. The Lord would lead them into the way of love
J.T. Yes. We ought to see that it is the way of love. Paul says, "Yet show I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence", @1 Corinthians 12:31 and this chapter I think outlines it. We have the Son of God dealing with this awful thing and dealing with it feelingly, knowing what it involved
A.G. Would His tears be a manifestation of His love? It says, "Behold, how he loved him".
J.T. "Jesus wept". He is affected by the scene. "Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews, who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit, and was troubled, and said, Where have ye put him? They say to him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept". That stands out in its own majesty. It is the Son of God, but nevertheless a real Man here with human feelings and sympathies. He saw her weeping, and saw the Jews weeping, and He was not indifferent to that. But then He took account of the occasion of all this and contemplated what it meant for Himself. He was deeply moved and He groaned.
H.D'A.C. The glory of His Person did not mitigate His suffering, would you say?
J.T. Quite.
E.P. The Lord expresses in this chapter the very soul of heaven in connection with a scene of death.
A.N. There would be two spiritual steps; on the one hand you might be acquainted with the power of Christ, which brings deliverance, but on the other hand if there be not the knowledge of what it cost Him and His feelings in connection with it, the affection, might he defective.
J.T. I think if there is anything the grace of Christ will produce in us it is right feelings and
{13}
sympathies. There are sympathies for those in sorrow and for those in joy; "rejoice with those that rejoice, weep with those that weep". @Romans 12:15. We are so little accustomed to spiritual emotions, emotions such as we see here. He was "deeply moved".
J.J. Would you say Mary was in sympathy with Him?
J.T. I think there was a link there that was special. She was the one He had specially in mind, because the passage begins with, "It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair". This is what He had specially at heart.
Rem. Holy affections moved the Lord at the death of Lazarus.
Rem. Would you say that when the Lord dies as the Victim, the result is that the waters become a wall on the right hand and on the left, but when it is to set a loved one free there is no water at all; it is annulled? The latter is what we have here.
J.T. Quite. That is what is in view here. So that the passage of the Jordan means that one is set free. There are no more barriers. "Loose him and let him go". I think it is characteristic of John that the man can be trusted. He is not delivered back to his mother -- he is let go; he is free. Death has dominion over him no longer.
E.P. Is all this education that we might be free from natural emotions like Martha, and get spiritual emotions like Mary?
J.T. That is the thing. I have no doubt she began to acquire the precious ointment here; she began to fill the box from this point.
W.S.L. You spoke of the sympathies that came out in the Lord in entering the scene of death and touching it. Is there any connection between that and the feet of the priests touching the water?
J.T. Yes, but I do not know that the priests
{14}
carrying the ark signifies anything beyond the holiness which characterised Christ in going into death. The Levites carried the ark, but in Joshua they are called priests, "the priests the Levites".
A.G. Was the grief of Mary the prospect of the loss of her brother? I was thinking of how it might affect us in relation to a brother.
J.T. She *had* lost him.
H.D'A.C. What about the loud voice? "He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth".
J.T. I think it denotes the power that He had as the Son. You have it referred to in chapter 5, "The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God". @John 5:25.
H.D'A.C. Is it the power of love -- very penetrating?
J.B.C-l. Is it in your mind that the feelings of the Lord are opened out in John's gospel in this peculiar way? They are spread out over certain incidents. If we think of Him as the Victim, His feelings would be concentrated, but in John's gospel we get the expression of them in various incidents. Would that bear out what you are saying as to the various exercises in which the question of His power is raised?
J.T. Yes, there is a peculiar fulness and finality in this gospel, and the place the saints have in His heart is prominent in John.
J.J. What about the corrupt state that had actually come in?
J.T. You mean as to what Martha said. Christ has brought to light life and incorruptibility. It was true that Lazarus was dead and that it had gone beyond the third day. Corruption no doubt had set in, but the Son of God had power to take him out of that state. The Lord had said, "Thy brother shall rise again". The family was composed of two sisters and one brother. There is no head in that family; the parents are not in evidence -- gone, I suppose.
{15}
And now the brother had gone, so that the desolation, as you might say, is complete. The Lord took account of that and said, "Thy brother shall rise again". The circle is set up again in the brother, so that He comes to Bethany in relation to him. "Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus whom Jesus raised from among the dead". @John 12:1. That is to say, the Lord recognises a circle of three -- one brother and two sisters.
R.B. Why do you think the Lord spoke of Lazarus as "our friend"?
J.T. It was the place he had with the Lord. I suppose the Lord was accustomed to open up His heart to them there. In His visits He would open up His mind to that circle in Bethany. It is an immense thing to have a friend in a *spiritual* way.
R.B. I wondered if he had some special place of trustworthiness with the Lord, and on that account he was specially dear.
J.McI. Do we not all come under that head in John? "I call you not servants, but friends".
J.T. You have the circle set out with the brother, and with a brother risen from the dead. It is, I think, how John indicates the way of recovery.
J.F. Were you connecting on our part the bearing about the dying of Jesus with the manifestation of the glory?
J.T. Yes; you are brought into correspondence with that. Paul was aiming at that.
P.L. Is this glory "increasing with the increase of God"?
J.T. Quite.
J.H. Is this in accordance with 2 Timothy where He has brought life and incorruptibility to light?
J.T. Quite. That refers to His own death; that is what is in view there, and the result is that life and incorruptibility are brought to light.
{16}
THE MORE EXCELLENT WAY (2)
@John 13
J.T. There are certain features entering into the pathway of the Lord in chapter 12 that should be noticed. A certain result is reached in the beginning of that chapter which affords a basis for chapters 13 and 14, indeed we may say for all the succeeding chapters till the end of chapter 17. The conditions among those at Bethany formed a basis, but the reception that the Lord received on entering Jerusalem and the presence of the Greeks desiring to see Him, brought into view His glory as the Messiah -- the King of Israel, and as the Son of man. These two incidents in principle suggest the testimony. If we are to be brought into accord with Christ in this way of love the testimony of God necessarily has its place. The Lord began by referring to a loved one; but then *all* the thoughts of God must have their place. Whilst the Lord reached results in Bethany which ministered to His own heart, and found a circle of affection there, there also enters into this way of love all the thoughts of God. The testimony to Him as the Messiah -- the King of Israel -- rendered on His way to Jerusalem, and then the presence of the Greeks desiring to see Him in Jerusalem, brought a wide range of things into view, representing in principle the testimony of God as regards the earth -- not yet the heavenly side, but what had reference to the earth. And this is an important feature in the way.
E.M. In what way do you connect this with what we had this morning?
J.T. Just in what I have been saying. The beginning of chapter 12 sets before us the results of chapter 11. The Lord has results for Himself. But then there are other things: God's thoughts as regards Israel, His thoughts as regards the whole
{17}
race of men -- these taken together afford a great expansion or enlargement of the testimony which must enter into this way of love; otherwise we should be narrow and limited.
H.D'A.C. Then you have the assembly, Jew, and Gentile?
J.T. Well, in the principle of it.
J.B. Would you say He waives His right to Messiahship and what is universal?
J.T. He not only waives His right for the moment, but He had to die. It is in the presence of these two testimonies to His earthly glory that He says -- "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone". @John 12:24. His death comes in immediately as a necessity.
W.S.L. That is the testimony connected with the thought of the ark of the Lord of all the earth.
J.T. Yes. The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is moving forward.
W.S.L. These testimonies would bear on that point?
J.T. They would. In this way of love you cannot omit these thoughts. They enter into the position. Every thought of God, every testimony of God necessarily enters into this position. The question is whether we have these thoughts; whether we cherish every testimony of God. They have a great place with Christ; He is "the faithful and true witness". @Revelation 3:14.
P.L. Is "part with me" having a place with Him in those thoughts?
J.T. Yes; certainly. He has all these things before Him; He cherishes them all.
A.N. The same principle would come in @Ephesians 3:15 where the apostle enlarges upon the administration of the mystery. He goes on to say, "of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named". The assembly would hardly be a suitable companion for Christ apart from being in sympathy
{18}
with Him in connection with Israel and with what is universally His in the kingdom.
J.T. That is good. The Father has all the families. It is a poor wife who does not enter into her husband's interests.
E.J.McB. Do you not think that the assembly, being the vessel of the glory, would essentially hold every interest of Christ?
J.T. That is what comes out in the heavenly city. We have all the previous agencies of government -- the twelve tribes of Israel and the angels -- connected with the city; they are all there. But then the assembly includes them all. What I think the Lord would do for us is to bring in now the glory that is to characterise the city. John does not relate the *actual* ascension. The Lord says, "I ascend", which is to be taken in spiritually; but he does relate the coming out or the coming down of the city. The going in or the going up is more a spiritual matter. The city when it comes down will be invested with the glory. That is really what the city is for -- "having the glory of God". @Revelation 21:10. But the Lord is really investing the assembly now with the glory in bringing in the love of God, so that she will come out with it. It is not that she gets it in heaven; I do not apprehend that at all. She is being invested with it here and now in the Holy Spirit's presence on earth under the administration of Christ; there is a wonderful service being carried on which involves that the city is to be invested with the glory. The glory is to reside there; it is to find its home in it, and I think that this is brought about by the vessels -- the persons who form the assembly being brought into the good of the covenant -- the love of God being shed abroad in our hearts. We are said to be "vessels of mercy which he had before prepared for glory" -- a wonderful statement. I think what the Lord is doing is that He is filling us with the glory; @1 Peter 1:8.
{19}
J.F. Would you say that the investiture is not future?
J.T. No, it is present; glory has come in. Glory came in with the Spirit being given.
E.J.McB. In that way the assembly, so to speak, "shall be received up in glory".
J.T. Yes, and so it shall be manifested in glory.
R.G. Is that the meaning of the scripture in Romans, "whom he has justified these also he has glorified"? @Romans 8:30.
J.T. That is what it means. It has been remarked that the gift of the Spirit, the reception of the Spirit, involves the glory -- that we are glorified in having received the Spirit.
J.J. It says, "The, spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you". @1 Peter 4:14.
J.T. Quite.
E.M. "The glory thou hast given me I have given them". Does that refer to the Spirit?
J.T. I suppose it would involve it.
R.G. Would it not include the future -- the glorified body?
J.T. I think it refers to the present time. Of course the Lord is speaking anticipatively. Unity, too, is brought in in that connection. "That they may be all one" is now. "And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one" -- one in glory. See @John 17:21,22. The difference between saints is the difference in glory. There are no two strictly alike. In one sense all are alike -- all are like Christ; but in another sense each has a distinctiveness, as the apostle says, "for star differs from another star in glory". @1 Corinthians 15:41. It is *in glory;* that is what we are being formed in now.
S.McA. Is your thought that the glory is discovered in the way of love?
J.T. That is where it is seen -- seen in the way of love, really the way of glory. Glory is moral now;
{20}
no doubt there will be the actual shining in the future which is difficult to define perhaps, but this is the way of it. We are brought into accord with the Lord; we cherish every testimony. I think that is why we have these two incidents brought together here.
J.B.C-l. You get Lazarus being invested with the glory in that way. The Spirit calls attention to the fact that he was a dead man whom Jesus had raised. Then you get the affections that centre in the Lord personally, and the anointing of His feet gives the kind of affection that takes up all the testimonies and carries them through for the pleasure of Christ and the glory of God. Is that your thought?
J.T. Yes; it was a circle of glory that ministered to the Lord. His thought was that the thing should be perpetuated. These chapters are largely to bring out the provisions by which that may be perpetuated in this world whilst He remains away. He had tasted it; it was a precious moment for Him. And the service of feet washing and the instruction that follows is to fortify us so that a circle of glory should be continued here. Lazarus was one of those that sat at the table with Him, meaning that he distinguished or gave character to the company, as seated with the Lord.
E.J.McB. It is rather interesting that the character of the scene around is declared by the prophecy of Isaiah and it is connected with his seeing the glory.
J.T. These things said Esaias because he saw His glory and spoke of Him. The combination of Isaiah 53 and 6 is very beautiful; see verses @John 12:38 - 41.
F.F. It also says there that "In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne ... and one cried unto another ... the whole earth is full of his glory", @Isaiah 6:1 - 3. Glory comes into the view of the prophet.
J.T. Yes. In John 12, Isaiah 53 is mentioned
{21}
first, "Lord who hath believed our report"; then chapter 6 is quoted, "he hath blinded their eyes". @John 12:38 - 41. The first glory is what you might call the moral glory of the humbled Jesus -- a path which affected the eunuch. It was Philip's theme too in preaching to the eunuch, "his life was taken from the earth". @Acts 8:33. The other refers to the judicial blinding of the nation, but what Isaiah saw was the glory. In the year that king Uzziah died he saw the Lord high and lifted up and his train filled the temple. By the seraphim there was the announcement as to His holiness, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts". @Isaiah 6:3. It is a wonderful combination of glory, fully qualifying Isaiah to speak; in fact, the suggestion I think is that no one can speak of Christ rightly who has not seen His glory.
H.D'A.C. Is chapter 53 hidden in chapter 6? The live coal taken from off the altar?
J.T. I should say so. The sixth chapter is really reached by chapter 53, the humbled Man here. The moral precedes the official.
P.B. Is not that glory set forth in John 11 and 12; the ointment suggesting, perhaps, His train filling the temple, but the Lord Himself the object of everything?
J.T. You mean the glory of Isaiah 6. I think the effect of what we are considering is that the saints come in as the Lord's train, filling the temple.
P.L. It is a question of God receiving glory from man, and man receiving glory from God.
J.T. Yes. He announces that He has to die to bring forth much fruit. Then He says, "He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour". @John 12:32. This is the way now to honour.
{22}
F.W. In chapter 11 we have the Son of God glorified. In this chapter it is the Son of man. How would you distinguish?
J.T. It does not say He is glorified here. The hour had come that He should be, that the Son of man should, meaning that the presence of the Greeks brought to His attention that He had right to humanity as the Son of man. But in chapter 13, "Now is the Son of man glorified" -- that is a different glory from the glory He spoke of in chapter 12. The latter is His place in relation to the habitable earth; He has got a right there -- the habitable earth to come; but the glory in chapter 13 is the glory that He has acquired in dying, and is present.
F.W. Are you connecting that with @Isaiah 53?
J.T. Yes; it is in keeping with @Isaiah 53; that is what Isaiah saw, he saw Him die.
J.J. "I, if I be lifted up from the earth". @John 12:32. Does that go beyond the earth in chapter 12?
J.T. The point there is that He dies an ignominious death. *What* a death! It was a spectacle to angels and to men. And in that way He becomes the gathering centre. You must come to Him there; not as the King of Israel or as the Son of man ruling in the habitable earth, but as the One lifted up on a gibbet ignominiously.
S.McA. "The Son of man which is in heaven". Is that what you mean?
J.T. No, not quite. In chapter 13 when Judas went out He said, "Now is the Son of man glorified", meaning that a halo of moral glory should surround Him as dying. As a matter of fact all moral glory centres there. It is what was there when Judas went out; his going out was the sign that the end had come and the Lord felt it. He says, "Now is the Son of man glorified".
H.D'A.C. Was it not the culmination of glory, the whole pathway ending in that way?
{23}
J.T. Quite. Instead of entering on the glory that was proper to Him as Heir of all things, He covered Himself as it were with moral glory in dying. He was not yet to enter on His Messianic glory, or His glory as the Son of man in relation to the habitable earth, but He was going into death for the glory of God, that God might be glorified in Him. Hence he says -- "And God is glorified in him". There again it is moral glory. And then -- "If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him". "Glorify him immediately". That is the thing. Before His official glories which are now secured are entered upon He has got an immediate glory in God Himself. It is not deferred; it is immediate.
H.E.F. Do you distinguish between those two glories you have just spoken of -- "Now is the Son of man glorified" and "God shall straightway glorify him"?
J.T. Oh yes. The one is moral and the other is actual. The glory into which He has entered immediately is the present glory He has in heaven, exalted to God's right hand. God does that immediately. It is a provisional position He gets, and it involves grace for us. But He was to be personally glorified forthwith.
H.E.F. So you have three glories in your mind. You have spoken of Messianic glory, then "now is the Son of man glorified", and again "God shall straightway glorify him".
J.T. Yes. The two former are still future. He has not entered upon them. But the moral has brought His present exaltation. God has delight in Him personally as having glorified Him in death, and has given Him a place in heaven. He is in it for the moment pending the time of His entering on His official glory.
J.B.C-l. You mean that it is essential for us to understand the present position of Christ as glorified.
{24}
Our connection with the testimony of God must result from the fact that we know the glory of the Lord; otherwise the position would be dark and uncertain for us.
J.T. Quite. I think we ought to dwell on the glory of the Son of man because it involves what man is to God in Christ; what God has found in Christ as Man. His glory as the Son of God is that He raises the dead, involving the question of affection bringing about the assembly, and serving it; but then there is the question between man and God, and as having become man He glorifies God.
A.A.T. What connection has that word 'now' with Judas going out?
J.T. Because Judas was the agent of the devil -- "That thou doest, do quickly". Judas going out meant that His death would be immediate, and so it was. "Now" means that it is not deferred. "Now is the Son of man glorified ... and shall glorify him immediately". Immediately is the point there.
P.B. Does "Now is the Son of man glorified" refer to the Lord's death?
J.T. Yes; it refers to His death -- His *moral* glory.
J.J. What does it mean -- "glorifying him in himself"?
J.T. It means that it was personal between the Father and the Son. It is not a question of inherited glory, or of the glory He had with Him before the world was. It is the glory He has as having glorified God in death as Man.
W.C.G. The effect of that is that He ministers the covenant to us? "We all with open face, beholding ... the glory of the Lord". @2 Corinthians 3:18.
J.T. I suppose that God glorifying Him in Himself may involve the assembly, and what He is and has in the assembly. But the point is that God does it in Himself, and does it at once.
{25}
A.G. The ultimate issue of the sickness of Lazarus was not death but the glory of God?
J.T. Quite. Not only the ultimate, but really the immediate result. Whatever the result for the creation or the universe the immediate result is the glory of God in that death.
A.G. Is it connected in any way with what is in the beginning of the chapter -- "Having loved his own"?
J.T. I think that has reference to His service to us. There are the two things in the chapter -- what He is to us, the service that He renders to His people; but then there is what He is to God, "God is glorified *in him*".
E.J.McB. Is there not the thought that He has secured in that small company that which has no element of Satan in it, in that Judas had gone out? The 'now' seems to be connected with the fact that Judas had gone out and that the dying of Jesus was going to take place immediately. The moral consequence of both was there in that company.
J.T. Quite.
A.N. It would be akin to Jordan overflowing all its banks -- the power of Satan now coming out. But it would only be an opportunity for the display of His glory. It was at that time the ark went through.
J.T. I think that is good. Judas represents the power of Satan that was being brought to bear upon Him now.
J.J. But Peter in the end of the chapter is an element of failure. What about that? Judas is a different feature?
J.T. Peter is not an instrument of the devil. He is not so regarded. Peter represents failure truly enough, but it is remediable; it comes within the range of love. There is that which is outside the pale of love, outside the range of it -- "Behold, I
{26}
will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds". @Revelation 2:22. I think that Judas is a type of that feature in the history of the assembly that would betray the Lord. It is outside the pale of the service of love. He waited on her in patience, and then He says -- "she repented not". @Revelation 2:21. And He knows that; we may accept that as final. But Peter is more a type of Protestantism as being a denial of the Lord, but not without remedy. There is hope in it, and I think that that ought to stimulate us in the way of recovery -- I do not say the recovery of every one, but there is in that domain, in that sphere, those who love the Lord; so let us hope. They may have denied Him by using other names, but there is remedy.
J.B. Judas goes out in the face of the very greatest service.
J.F. He goes out in the presence of the greatest possible light -- the light of love.
A.A.T. Was the glory that Stephen saw the same glory as is spoken of in this connection?
J.T. That was the glory of God, referring back to Abraham -- "the God of glory appeared" @Acts 7:2 to Abraham. God intended to work out things in taking up Abraham for His own glory, and they are all secured now. Stephen had that in mind. His address is the summing up of the whole testimony of God and He sees it all secured in heaven.
A.A.T. "He saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God". @Acts 7:55.
J.T. That is it. The glory is all secured there. The chapter begins with the God of glory. You cannot limit that. It is the God of glory. Whatever glory there is He is the God of it, and it is all secured in Jesus. I have no doubt the present dispensation is worked out from that. It is worked out from the glory, the special glory He has received from God.
{27}
J.B.C-I. Do you connect the service of feet washing with the dignity of the Lord in chapter 13? The chapter opens with the fact that everything is in the Lord's hands. He has the supremacy -- "knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands ...".
J.T. That is how the matter stands -- a very wonderful position. And he lays aside His garment, meaning that in the consciousness of all that dignity He becomes a servant. He was conscious of all the dignity involved in what is stated -- "knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God and went to God". In the consciousness of all that, He laid aside His garments, girded Himself with a linen towel (the word 'linen' should be noted) and having poured water into a basin He began to wash His disciples¬ feet. He does everything.
F.W. Is all that connected with His glory as the Son of man?
J.T. Well, it is the glory of a "Lord and Master". It is the glory of one in an official position to lay that aside and take a servant's place. It is descending love. There is ascending love, of which He speaks later, but this is descending love.
F.W. Would the glory of the Son of man be on that line?
J.T. It would, no doubt. He is Administrator. The Father has given all things into His hands; He was come from God and went to God. The reference is, I think, to the hierarchical and clerical system developed in the history of the assembly. The Holy Spirit foresaw all that, and He set this down as a model. All the official dignity in which the so-called servants of Christ carry on their service is incompatible with the example of the Lord. They talk about Him as their Lord and Master but what about these robes of office? The Holy Spirit in this chapter anticipates
{28}
that in the history of the assembly, and the Lord sets the example which undermines this whole hierarchical system that the people of God suffer from; it disposes of it. The principle is laying all that aside and girding yourself with a towel and getting down to the feet of the saints.
H.D'A.C. That hierarchical system simply means that I must have a place.
J.T. It is remarkable how quickly we get the cloth on -- an indication of official place in the service of God. The Lord's moral glory is the descending glory. It is the way of love. "Yet shew I unto you -- *shew I unto you* -- a way of more surpassing excellence". @1 Corinthians 12:31. The apostle could do it because he had the love; he could shew that way. The Lord is shewing that way.
A.N. In @Hebrews 2, while we get His glory as the Son of man, immediately after that we have the thought of many sons being brought to glory and the Captain of their salvation being made perfect through suffering. His coming down was to lead us into privilege.
J.T. That is the thing; it is the descending love. Presently the assembly will come down -- "I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God". @Revelation 21:10. It is the glory descending and that in liberty -- coming down. There is dignity inwardly, but it comes down in the grace of that dignity. The Lord washing the disciples¬ feet is the means by which He maintains us to have part with Him.
P.B. Part with Him in what?
J.T. Everything that He is going on with now -- *everything*. Whatever He is going on with you want to be with Him, and He lays down the rule here which is the principle of having part with Him. You cannot have it without it. The great thing that the glory may be resident among us is the example that
{29}
He sets for us. "Hereby shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another" -- "love among yourselves".
P.L. Would @2 Corinthians 8: 23 suggest the thought of glory being resident in the assembly?
J.T. I have often thought of that passage, "messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory".
Ques. How are we to deal with a brother like Peter? His opposition raised the question. He says, "Thou shalt never wash my feet". How are we to meet that condition of things?
J.T. It is a question of appealing to his affections. That is how the Lord met it. "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me". The only hope for a brother is, Has he got any love? If he has no love you can do nothing; you can have no part with the Lord unless this is dealt with. If he love the Lord then he will submit. He may raise a question as Peter did, but nevertheless He will submit.
F.W. I suppose it is the way of surpassing excellence -- the path available for us.
J.T. That is the thing. That is what the apostle brought to the Corinthians; he showed it to them. How he showed the way of surpassing excellence is worth considering. The Lord girded Himself with a linen towel and I think the apostle carefully thought over the fabric he would use in writing his second epistle to the Corinthians. There is a great use now of cotton and even paper, instead of linen, but they are very poor substitutes. I think the second epistle is his towel; the first epistle is the water. He was in much exercise as to what he would use, that which would be most absorbent, and would effectively remove what may have irritated in the first letter.
Ques. It is constraining love brought in?
J.T. That is what it was; that is the linen.
J.J. Linen was the fabric the priest had to wear.
J.T. The priest should know the meaning of it.
{30}
Rem. I suppose the hierarchical officials have not got that towel.
J.T. I do not think they have.
F.W.B. What do you say the linen is?
J.T. The linen is the second letter to the Corinthians. We have to understand the way. Paul says, "Yet *shew I unto you* a way of more surpassing excellence". @2 Corinthians 12:31. We must understand the way of love.
H.D'A.C. That shows that righteousness is connected with love. There is a tender way of dealing which is only right.
Rem. The apostle says, "Our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged". @2 Corinthians 6:11. Is that the thought of the linen?
J.T. That enters into it. Before the apostle wrote the second letter he had been to the gates of death himself. God had brought him down; he had had new experiences, experiences that drew out more tender compassions, so that he speaks about the God of *all* encouragement. He had had the sentence of death in himself and had had to do with the God who raiseth the dead and who delivered him from so great a death; so that he brings in the ministry of the covenant and the ministry of reconciliation. I think these two ministries set us down in ease. Whatever may have happened, as they are received into our souls they set us down in perfect liberty of spirit in the presence of God.
Ques. Would you help us as to His girding Himself?
J.T. It means that He took a servant's place; as has often been referred to in @Exodus 21, the servant there loved his master, his wife, and his children and would not go out free, but would remain a servant for ever.
J.B. Do you think the Lord intends that His own should take account of His movements here, that moral dignity may be produced in them?
{31}
J.T. That is the thing, to get into this way of surpassing excellence. Exercise of gift is, of course, undoubtedly of great value, especially as Paul says, the gift of prophecy; but this way of more surpassing excellence is the thing to follow after. "Follow after love". @1 Corinthians 14:1.
F.F. In @John 11 the Lord refers to the twelve hours of the day. Would that be the full day of glory? And this way is carried out in the light of that? He speaks of walking in the light, and stumbling if we walk in the night.
J.T. I think that the day -- twelve hours -- would be the day in which the glory shines; we are to walk in the light of that. Chapter 11 is the shining out of the glory, and chapter 12 sets before us the results of that. The light of the glory of Christ shines in the circle of the saints, as seen in principle in the company at Bethany.
F.F. I was thinking of the Corinthian epistle and the apostle bringing in the way of more surpassing excellence in the light of that glory.
J.T. Quite. The light of the glory had shone into his heart, and so it shone there for others. It is in the assembly, the Spirit dwelling there.
J.B.C-l. Is it not glory that influences the heart in taking up the attitude of feet-washing, not merely meeting conditions displeasing, but a sense of the valuation connected with the saints. The disciples¬ feet in His eyes had a definite glory apart from a human standpoint. It would be the investing of the saints with thoughts according to the divine pleasure.
J.T. Some of us were speaking the other evening on the last chapter of Leviticus. Every bit of the divine nature is to be taken account of in the saints. Everything of God is to be gathered up. The chapter provides for every little bit that is of God being valued. Even if a man were poorer than the valuation
{32}
placed upon him by Moses, his case was to be looked into. If there is something there, the priest discerns it. The spiritual discernment among the people of God discovers there is something of God there. Well then, you clothe the person with that something. You want to get that, and get it in relation to Christ.
P.L. "Every good thing", Paul says to @Philemon 1:6
J.T. Every good thing that is in the brother. It gives a wide range, for there is a good deal more in the people of God than we are apt to think. The last chapter of Leviticus shows every brother is to be taken account of. There is a wide range for service. What an opportunity there is to bring all into evidence for Christ!
H.D'A.C. A man might waste time. A man after sixty is not of the same value as the man of twenty. He cannot make up for the past.
J.T. That is true. After he is sixty he is only worth fifteen shekels, but nevertheless he is worth *that much*. Rem. Do you mean that John 13 is the way of entrance into all spiritual blessing in our day?
J.T. Quite. Entrance into things from our side.
J.J. Is that why it is connected with the Supper?
J.T. It is not the Lord's supper, it is the passover, but we know that the Lord's supper was instituted at that time. John, however, deals with the *spirit* of the thing, that which shines there, so that this chapter necessarily enters into our position at the Lord's supper. He gives the spirit that accompanied its institution; he enlarges on that so that we might be there in a right spirit.
W.S.L. Did you say John 13 was the passover supper?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. "There they made him a supper". @John 12:2. Would that answer to the Lord's supper?
J.T. I do not think so. We do not make the
{33}
Lord's supper; neither do we make it to Him. He has instituted the Supper. It is *His* institution.
W.S.L. The Lord's supper is what He has made for us.
J.T. Exactly.
J.J. We could not think of John leaving out the spirit of the Supper.
J.T. No; but he leaves the thought of the Lord's supper to the synoptic gospels, because it is connected with the previous testimony. It is connected with the public testimony.
Ques. Is it because the Lord is with them in John?
J.T. I think John in his gospel avoids official things. The Lord's supper, baptism, the word "assembly" --these are terms that belong to the candlestick, to the public position of the assembly. He does not deal with that; but deals with what supports it. He deals really with recovery. His is a ministry that brings us into accord with these public things. What is the use of knowing the public things if we are not secretly with God?
W.S.L. Would "part with him" involve our having part with Him in all His interests here in connection with the testimony?
J.T. That is what He has in view. It is not a question of our entering on heavenly privilege exactly; the Father had given all things into His hand, and He had come from God and was going to God, and thus the administration of everything is in His hands. That is the position rather.
W.S.L. I thought that from the fact of what you have mentioned in chapter 12, the glory of the kingdom, and of the Son of man.
J.T. Well, I think that enters into it, as we have said.
J.J. Where would you go for the heavenly side?
J.T. To chapter 20.
{34}
E.M. The spirit in which we carry out service -- would that be the leading thought?
J.T. Yes. I would connect this passage with the covenant more. While John does not mention it formally, it falls into accord with it. "He came out from God and was going to God". But in chapter 20 He says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". @John 20:17.
F.W. Is the passover connected with descending love and the Lord's supper with ascending love?
J.T. I think the Lord's supper is connected with His descending love.
F.W. "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer". @Luke 22:15.
J.T. But then He institutes His own Supper there, and says, "This is my body which is given for you". @Luke 22:19
F.W. The love in the Supper seems to carry us further than the passover.
J.T. But then it is a question of Him coming in that carries us further. It is His obtaining a place in the assembly that makes room for the ascent. It is His leadership; hence the memorial brings Him in.
L.M. Would it be that the Lord introduces His own Supper after Judas has gone out?
J.T. I do not know about that; according to Luke Judas was there.
F.F. At the close of this chapter the Lord refers to children and a new commandment.
J.T. Yes, that is the parental thought which is enlarged on in John's epistle. He was here representative of the Father; the parental idea was there. I think that is what is meant by "has been begotten of God". @1 John 2:29. In John's epistle it is "begotten of him", and you cannot always be sure if the reference is to the Father or the Son. The parental thought necessarily
{35}
entered into the Lord's position here, and I think that is where the idea begins of the children of God.
J.B. The Lord intends us to be here in correspondence with Himself in the service of love.
J.T. Yes; and in speaking to His disciples as children, He is bringing in a word that belongs to a parent. It tends to strengthen the position and the teaching if we take on His own character -- that of a parent -- in any part we may have in the service of love.
P.L. Would it embody the ideals of love in His parental love for them?
J.T. Yes; it would.
J.B.C-l. Do you think the fact that John wrote his epistle at the time of apostasy raises the question as to how far we have part with Him in these things?
J.T. Quite. I think that John's epistle somewhat grows out of the teaching of this chapter. "They went out from us". @1 John 2:19. There were those who had gone out. Judas went out. And then he brings out the features of the children of God. "Ye know that everyone that practises righteousness is begotten of him". @1 John 2:29. The knowledge that God is righteous has come out in Christ. The parental thought necessarily enters into the Lord's way here, for that is where God is known.
{36}
THE MORE EXCELLENT WAY (3)
@John 18:1 - 11
J.T. Our thought has been to connect these chapters with the movements of the ark, having the crossing of the Jordan in view and regarding the ark in the language of @Psalm 78 as "His glory" -- the glory of God; and also that we might, as recognising that 2,000 cubits were to separate the ark from the people, know how to follow, and in the following to take on the glory -- to be brought into correspondence with Christ. We referred to the apostle's desire that he might bear about in his body the dying of Jesus. The glory had already shone into his heart, "the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", @2 Corinthians 4:6 and it would work out in the bearing about in his body the dying of Jesus. We saw that the Lord had finished His service among the Jews, resulting in His definite rejection by them. It says that they surrounded Him in the temple in Solomon's porch, and challenged Him as to His being the Christ and His testimony that He was, and they took up stones to stone Him, so that, having His testimony they deliberately rejected Him. Then He goes, as it says, beyond Jordan to the place where John baptised at the first, and it is from that point that He moves back into Judaea, knowing now what awaited Him there; so that the movement has reference to the passage of the Jordan, that is, to His meeting death. But what comes into evidence first is a loved one, and He says, "Let us go to him". @John 11:15. John 11 brings out the first great feature of the movement, which had in view the saints, those who were loved. He would "go to him". Lazarus being raised, the Lord, six days before the passover, comes to Bethany where Lazarus was, and there He finds
{37}
a circle in which there is correspondence with the glory that had shone. It was thought that that circle formed the basis of the subsequent instruction, so that the varied testimonies of God come into view; first, in the reception He receives as He entered Jerusalem being recognised as the King of Israel, and second, in the Greeks desiring to see Him. The testimony of God regarding the earth comes into view. Necessarily it enters into the education of the saints in these chapters.
Then chapter 13 brings out His well-known service in washing the feet of His disciples. Thereafter it says when Judas was gone out the Lord said, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself, and shall glorify him immediately ..". @John 13:31,32. Then He tells them that where He was going they could not come; He indicates that the 2,000 cubits have to be recognised. The principle of following is recognised, but it is to be in the recognition of the "distance between". @Joshua 3:4. He says to Peter, "Thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me after", @John 13:36, which he did, and glorified God in his death. Peter indeed might be taken as an example of the education that there is for us, so that we might come into correspondence with Christ eventually, as we read in chapter 21: "But he said this, signifying by what death he should glorify God". @John 21:19. The Lord had spoken of His own death, "This he said signifying by what death he was about to die" -- that is, by lifting up. I think that the Lord is investing His people with the glory -- first, in the way of love in chapter 13; and then in chapter 14 by the Holy Spirit coming in. Christ is on high to be an Object of faith, and the chapter is to fill our minds with the advantages accruing to us from this during the period of His absence.
H.D'A.C. "Thou shalt follow me afterwards". @John 13:36.
{38}
Christ must go first, but later on we find in Joshua that the people were much nearer the ark in following than 2,000 cubits. In going round Jericho, for instance; it is not said that there was that space between the ark and the rest of the host then.
J.T. Oh no. It was only while the Jordan had to be crossed. "Ye have not passed this way heretofore". @Joshua 3:4. The reference is to the Lord going into death. We have to see how He went into death, and how He dealt with it.
J.M. The Lord said to Peter -- "Thou canst not follow me now". @John 13:36. Would that indicate the present teaching of the Lord in a moral way for us?
J.T. That is what we are at -- what there is now in the teaching. We have to contemplate the Lord in His divine dignity going into death. We know now that there is no water in the Jordan for faith, but nevertheless death has to be accepted.
J.F. What is the force of there being no water?
J.T. Well, the Lord has annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel. That is for faith. But crossing the Jordan is more for us than a matter of faith; one can only go over by the Spirit; it is the normal counterpart of the recognition of the Spirit in Numbers 21. The flesh does not go into Canaan.
C.A.P. Is it not significant that there is no mention of the crossing of the Jordan in Hebrews 11?
J.T. There is mention of the crossing of the Red Sea, but not of the Jordan.
C.A.P. It was not faith.
J.T. No; it is by the Spirit. "But by faith they passed through the Red Sea". @Hebrews 11:29.
J.B.C-l. Does the presentation of the truth connected with the Holy Spirit's coming, as in chapter 14 take the same place in a way as the transfiguration in the other gospels? What is in my mind is that in the other gospels their being in
{39}
the way with the Lord on the line of suffering follows the transfiguration. You seem to suggest that their being in the way according to John's gospel is dependent on the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
J.T. That is right. I think, however, that chapter 11 would correspond with the mount of transfiguration from John's point of view. The glory shone on the mount; He was declared to be the Son from heaven, but from John's point of view He is declared to be the Son by resurrection. That was for them. "Did I not say unto thee that if thou shouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of God?" @John 11:30. The movement, I think, begins with the glory.
J.B.C-I. That helps me. I was thinking whether the Spirit would be the seal of that to us, but I am glad you go back to chapter 11 and connect it with the glory.
J.T. Instead of Peter, James, and John -- the leading apostles -- being the witnesses, the testimony to the glory is maintained in a circle in which two women shine. John has a way of reflecting on those in an official position. In chapter 4 a woman shines when they who should have shone had gone into the city to buy meat. In chapter 12 Martha serves; Lazarus is there, but rather as the subject of His power in resurrection; it is not exactly the subjective side in Lazarus, but in the two women we have that. That is in keeping, I think, with John; the glory found a residence in the circle at Bethany. And in chapter 20 again a woman shines. Whatever the failure may be of those who have the official place, John secures a residence for the glory.
J.F. What is the point in connection with the prominence given to the women in John?
J.T. It is a feature with him. Instead of Peter and James and John on the mount of transfiguration with the Lord as in the synoptic gospels we have a
{40}
circle in Bethany affording a residence for the glory; and it is marked by the service of two women.
P.B. A circle brought together by love for the Lord.
J.T. That is the thing. Now these chapters bear on the close, they contemplate the failure of the official vessel, and they show that God secures a place for the glory notwithstanding. It was a question of those whom He loved and who loved Him.
P.B. Is that question raised again in regard of the coming of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. Yes; in chapter 14, "If ye love me". @John 14:15.
E.J.McB. I think your thought in emphasising the women is that the glory is secured on moral lines, not on official lines.
J.T. Quite. It aptly fits in with the present position. They were loved ones, but then the Lord did not have His place. He loved them, but Lazarus was more to the sisters than the Lord was. The Lord was a known friend of the family -- recognised to be a friend, but He would have a greater place than that. That is the point for the moment. There are many whom He loves, but He would have His own place in their hearts. He would come in Himself as head, and that is the proper result of chapter 11.
E.M. He could only be glorified in those who loved Him.
J.T. Quite. He was glorified at Bethany. In chapter 17 He refers to the men whom the Father had given Him out of the world. We have to come to that -- we have to come to the men. Although we begin with the women, they do not suggest the divine thought. God has *men* in His mind, and when the Lord prays, He prays about the *men*. "The men which thou gavest me". @John 17:6. We have to come to manhood. God does not surrender any thought. If He does recognise women, He has the masculine side before Him.
{41}
Rem. Where there is the spirit of appreciation of the true ark the glory is secured.
J.T. Yes.
S.McA. You referred to Him more as dying than as dead -- "the dying of Jesus". @2 Corinthians 4:10.
J.T. It goes on to His actual death. The principle is that He is dying from chapter 11 onwards. Mary recognised that. Her spiritual instinct enabled her to discern that He was going to die.
S.McA. So that it is a new departure from the point beyond Jordan where John baptised at the first.
J.T. That is right. It is an entirely new movement, having death immediately in view. In chapter 14 the Lord is going on high, and we learn there the provision made for us throughout the whole period of His absence. There is provision made for those who love Him and keep His commandments. That goes right on to the end, because chapter 14 not only provides for the saints as the Lord loved them here, as they appeared at Pentecost, but it provides also for the individual who loves Him and keeps His commandments. Then in the next chapter the position is collateral with that. There is that which is public, involving the failure of that which the apostles inaugurated -- a provisional position on earth into which the Gentiles have come. We have to know how we are to be sustained in these two relations; what He is to those who love Him viewed by themselves, and what we are to be in a state of things where unreality is contemplated.
J.F. Do we get the provisional public position in chapter 15?
J.T. Yes. That chapter is the history of the public thing inaugurated by the twelve, and then in chapter 16 we get the service of the Spirit -- the ministry of the Spirit in relation to the testimony. Chapter 14 is the Spirit as provision for those who love the Lord; chapter 16 is the Spirit come directly
{42}
from the Lord Himself in relation to the testimony -- the whole testimony.
J.B. Would chapter 16 in that way give us ability to take up the interests of the Lord intelligently and affectionately!
J.T. Yes, and *confidently* There is One here who is infinitely greater than the whole power of evil in the world. But chapter 14 is what the Lord is mediately; He is a Mediator there, and He shows what He would do in His love for us; He begs the Father for the Spirit; He solicits for us.
A.G. What position is the ark in there?
J.T. All this comes in anticipatively. Chapter 14 was spoken at the Supper -- during the passover It is all to bring in the place that they had in His heart. The lesson for you and for me is that we do all we can for the saints. He had done all possible on earth; He served them on earth; now, He says, I will be solicitous in heaven for you, and you can ask Me even there; you can reckon on Me; you can have every confidence in Me there; "believe also on me" @John 14:1.
Ques. Is the Spirit not given for the service of bringing us into the full knowledge of His mind for us?
J.T. He is here, in John, as the Spirit of truth "I am the way, the truth, and the life" @John 14:5 is a question of their knowing Him It enters into what we are considering.
J.J. There are three questions asked in chapter 14. Do they sum up the whole position? The first question is about the way -- Thomas says to Him, "and how can we know the way?" @John 14:5. Then Philip says to Him -- "Lord show us the Father and it sufficeth us" @John 14:8. Then Judas, not Iscariot says, "How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?" @John 14:22. Would that be the present movement?
J.T. It shows it is a good thing to ask questions.
{43}
The writer in @Proverbs 30 asks questions, and he observes, but he knows. It is a fine chapter as a model for questioning. The writer raises questions. He humbly admits his ignorance. Nevertheless he knows, but he raises questions.
H.D'A.C. Is not that the way to learn?
J.T. That is what I was thinking.
E.J.McB. How does our present chapter, John 18, stand in relation to the thoughts you have suggested?
J.T. I think it sets out the movement of the ark. The Lord is definitely moving again. The preceding chapters prepared the disciples for this move; they are with Him. "Jesus went out with his disciples". That is what we want to get at. In order to be with Him as seen here we have to understand the chapters
that precede.
R.B. Will you say a word on chapter 17, following on what you have said as to chapter 16?
J.T. I feel that we ought perhaps to consider a little more the bearing of chapters 14, 15, and 16, so that, having the thoughts of God before us as disclosed in these chapters, we might see the bearing of the prayer in chapter 17. The Lord prays for men, and I think the teaching of these chapters is to bring them in, for God's thought is men. In the eternal state the tabernacle of God will be with men. The thought in men is the intelligence that God intended to set forth in them; the idea is intelligence. A man is the image of God. "Quit yourselves like men". @1 Corinthians 16:13. I think the divine thought is brought about in the race as seen in Christ, but it is necessarily seen first in Christ personally.
Ques. Do you mean in contrast to babes?
J.T. More than that; involving the teaching of the chapters that precede.
J.J. In chapter 17 He says, "I have manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world". @John 17:6. Would that be something similar to
{44}
Paul in 2 Corinthians: "I know a man in Christ"? @2 Corinthians 12:2
J.T. Well; somewhat. The queen of Sheba referred to Solomon's men: "Happy are thy men". @1 Kings 10:8
Ques. Do you mean that the men are produced by the education of these chapters?
J.T. How could it be otherwise? We have to learn the divine thought in Christ; the thought of God is seen in Him. We have to learn what man is in the mind of God from Christ.
A.N. Would you get the two set forth in Proverbs? You come under the mother, "tender and only beloved", @Proverbs 4:3 and then you get the father. Is it in view of manhood? You enter into the father's intentions?
J.T. Yes. Solomon I think represents the thought. "I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother". @Proverbs 4:3. He came under the counsel of the mother, and grew up into manhood as in the knowledge and culture of his father. I think that typically Solomon is the man. Wisdom said, "My delights were with the sons of men". @Proverbs 8:31.
A.N. "In understanding be men".
J.T. Proverbs opens up what is becoming in men. I think Solomon is typically the man, beginning with the desire for wisdom, acknowledging his ignorance, and growing up by divine tuition into manhood.
J.McI. Is that the thought in @Ephesians 4? The gifts are to that end -- until we all arrive at manhood.
J.T. Yes, the full-grown man.
J.B.C-I. The situation of chapter 18 seems to correspond with the position of David when he went up by the brook Cedron. What came out at that time was great solicitude for the ark and for the people. Is there a similar thought here? We get what the Lord is as the ark, and in His feelings as expressed we see His great solicitude for every thought connected with the glory of God.
{45}
J.T. Quite. Now, His disciples are with Him. I think that their identification with Him in the garden, now that the closing moments have come, involves the teaching of the previous chapters.
W.S.L. Would you say that the disciples were brought at that time into correspondence with the ark?
J.T. That is what I thought. Then you have further disclosures. "If, therefore, ye seek me", He says, "let these go away".
W.S.L. What do you gather from that?
J.T. The Lord's consideration for us. He has to go before us, and He gives Himself up to the band who came with lanterns and torches and weapons; but He would not have the disciples arrested. The time had not come for that; they would be later, but that time was not yet. It involves the 2,000 cubits.
A.G. Would this be the movement of the ark in spite of any movement of the enemy? "Knowing that the hour had come".
J.T. Yes. They went backwards and fell to the ground.
P.L. We have the challenge here. You spoke of the challenge yesterday -- the Lord going into death in that character.
J.T. Quite. The people really had been accustomed to the power of the ark through the wilderness. "Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered". @Numbers 10:35. That was so when the ark moved at any time, but when it came to the Jordan we hear nothing of that. Moses was not there; it is the feet of the priests now. But the people had been accustomed -- and it was the divine intent that they should be -- to the effects of the movements of the ark. Now the enemies went backwards. This is for the disciples. We have to see the bearing that there is in the
{46}
movements. "Let these go their way". I think the service of prayer in chapter 17 is there as a model. One following the instruction would clothe the saints with divine thoughts, because it is a question of what is available to God. God has not given up any of His thoughts, and what is available to God now, you clothe in your prayers with the divine thoughts. You have nothing less in your heart for them. Chapter 18 is the enemy's power. Think of what there is here -- a band with Judas, and lanterns and torches and weapons! What are they after? They are avowedly against Christ. These conditions exist, and they have to be faced. Hence the importance of the instruction of the previous chapters and of the prayer of chapter 17. I am not now speaking of its value in detail as the prayer of the Lord Jesus, but as you might say, as the golden altar for us. You turn your eyes away for a moment from the saints and you look to God. He "lifted up his eyes to heaven". @John 17:1. You are engaged with God in prayer, clothing those that are available with the thoughts of God, and what He can make them.
W.C.G. Another desire of the Lord is that He would have them sanctified; He would build His sanctuary. Is not that the object in view when He says, "Let these go their way" -- that they might be a sanctuary?
J.T. No doubt. In the meantime He goes forward. But there is reserve. Isaiah had seen His glory. Well, what glory was it? He says, "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple". @Isaiah 6:1. I think "these" are His train; let these go their way, they would become that. The train is filled with glory. "In his temple doth everyone speak of his glory". @Psalm 29:9
W.C.G. Peter was not disposed to accept the public situation. He would have entered into conflict to set aside the activity of the enemy.
{47}
J.T. As was usual, the disciples never entered into His thoughts. All is anticipative. You get in John that when He was raised from the dead they understood, when He was glorified they remembered. These things are anticipating the resurrection and the glory of Jesus. *They* should become vessels in the temple, where everyone doth say glory. It says His train filled the temple and the seraphim, attending of themselves, helped to bring about that. I think John brings in the seraph service. Matthew is the cherubim. "Seraphim were standing above him", @Isaiah 6:2 it says; that is what the Lord is going on to. And one cried unto another (they each had six wings) and said, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory". @Isaiah 6:3. That is what they have in mind, and that is what these chapters bring about -- the holy character of the brethren, so that they are associated with the Lord in the temple. What God is aiming at now is to bring about the latter glory of the house -- all that which will culminate in the heavenly city. It is not that it is going to be filled with the glory up there -- that would not be victory. The glory is now; the assembly is invested *now* with it. The disciples did not understand; but the principle throughout John is that you will understand *later;* "thou shalt know hereafter". @John 13:7
H.D'A.C. It is an amazing sight for them. Judas does not draw near to kiss Him. It is too glorious for them to lay hold of Him at that moment.
J.T. The thing to lay hold of is the power of Christ for us now. Look at the combination of evil there is. In John Judas represents the power of Satan against Christ, beginning with betrayal. He is now coming back. "They went out from us". 1 John 2:19 Now they come back. Satan brought about a combination of evil that never existed before. They have the band and the lanterns and the torches and the weapons.
{48}
J.F. Have these their counterpart at the present time?
J.T. They have. They refer, I think, to the gropings of men, the darkness in which they are moving in opposition to Christ.
Ques. Does the being with God in chapter 17 show how they are to be met?
J.T. That is the thing. If we are to profit by way of example we go to God. If it be a question of what is available, it is no use referring back to what there has been, the point is what is available at the present time, and clothing what is available with the thoughts of God. What can God not do?
R.B. Does what the Lord secures here for the disciples answer to the opened door in Philadelphia?
J.T. That is exactly what it does.
P.L. Does that go with the last verse of the chapter you were referring to in Isaiah 6 -- the tenth part?
J.T. "Yet in it shall be a tenth". @Isaiah 6:13 Yes, quite.
A.N. Would chapter 18 answer to Numbers 10 -- the forward movement of the ark? "Rise up, Lord, let thine enemies be scattered". @Numbers 10:35
J.T. That is what you get here.
J.B.C-l. You spoke of the power of Christ as covering His own. Is that in view of their being free to follow? What comes out in Peter almost immediately after is the readiness to intercept the Lord's way. Do you not think at times there is that with us, we would get into the way of the Lord in regard to these movements?
J.T. I am sure that is so. These different ones whose names are given in John's gospel are intended, I think, to teach us the features that may come out. You get Andrew and Philip, and Thomas and Peter. All those are brothers -- disciples -- representing in one way or another the conditions that arise amongst us as the Lord is seeking to teach us, and I think the
{49}
Lord's way with them would help us as to how patient we are to be with one another.
W.C.G. In Psalm 68 already quoted, it shows how the enemies flee-"Kings of armies flee apace ... though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold". @Psalm 68:12,13
J.T. "The chariots of God are twenty thousand ... the Lord is among them". @Psalm 68:17 They went backwards. They have no power if the Lord is pleased to act against them.
J.J. What would you say about the disciples being with Him in the education of the previous chapter? Does that refer to our having part with Him.
J.T. I think so. In the garden it is not the victim character. The other gospels give us the Lord's feelings as regards the cup and the power of Satan, but here He is supreme. John has in view that we can move on; there is the power available to move on according to Christ in this glorious way, the way of glory.
J.B.C-l. It is very encouraging.
F.W. Do we get the glory of His holiness here? "The whole earth is filled with his glory", Isaiah 6:3
J.T. There is indication of it here.
F.W. Would you say a word as to the seraph?
J.T. I think John brings in the seraph feature of the truth. Matthew, as I have said, is the cherubim. The Lord says to the disciples, "Will ye also go away?" and Peter says, "Lord to whom shall we go; thou hast words of eternal life, and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". @John 6:67 - 69. -- the *Holy One*. That is what He was -- "The holy one of God". That was the conception of the Lord that got into Peter's soul, and John records that if you have got an ideal that ideal is sure to give
{50}
character to you later, and that is what is in view in John. He is the holy and the true.
F.W. Are the cherubim more connected with righteousness?
J.T. I think the enforcement of the will, of the government of God, begins in the garden -- the cherubim with the flaming sword, and it had a great place in the tabernacle and in the temple. But one can understand the force of the seraph feature in John, because we have to do with such evil in the Jews, among those who professedly were the people of God. Holiness is essential. Hence the Lord speaks to the assembly at Philadelphia as "the holy, the true". @Revelation 3:7
Rem. The live coal from off the altar touching the lips of Isaiah would correspond with John -- "Ye have the unction from the holy one"? @1 John 2:20
J.T. Quite. One called to the other and said, "Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts" @Isaiah 6:3 we see in that the kind of mutuality that John would bring about. The saints, as apprehending Christ in the gospel of John are, so to speak, occupied with this -- with His holiness.
P.L. So John says to the elect lady, "but hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth". @2 John 1:12
J.T. Exactly.
J.J. Do you mean that it was the work of the seraphim that the band and officers went backward and fell to the ground?
J.T. No. Not quite that, but the glory shone there. There was something there that forced them back. The power of God was there. See Psalm 114.
P.B. The moral glory of the ark at the crossing of the Jordan caused the waters to recede out of sight. This is the beginning of it.
J.T. What God is bringing about now is a state of holy love amongst His people answering to the seraphim calling one to another, saying, "Holy, holy,
{51}
holy ... the whole earth is full of his glory". @Isaiah 6:3 That is their converse. It is an immense result if God bring that about amongst His people.
J.F. As a present result.
J.T. That is the thought -- a present result.
H.D'A.C. "Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness".
J.B.C-l. Would this help us in bearing the reproach together? You remarked earlier as to the peculiar combination of evil that is brought about here, and one of the most solemn features of apostasy is that those who go out know the place and the persons and consequently of their failure and this adds a peculiar feature to the reproach, so that such a consideration as this would help us in bearing the reproach together.
J.T. I think that you will find that those who go out will come back with their band, lanterns, torches and weapons; one has seen it often. They are sure to come back.
H.D'A.C. But they are still powerless.
J.T. That is the thing to see.
J.B.C-l. I was thinking rather of the way in which they might affect the position of those from whom they have separated.
J.T. I think departure from the truth began with Judas, in his apostasy. Now, the only hope for those who move in that direction is to give up the band. The lanterns and torches denote the miserable darkness in which they move, as compared with the light there is in the circle in which Christ is.
G.F.M. What do you mean by 'they came back'?
J.T. They do come back. They go out; they move away out of feeling -- one natural feeling or another, influenced by Satan, but they will not let you alone. They are hostile to the truth and they are sure to come back. But they come back in this despicable way as a band with lanterns, etc. The
{52}
position in regard to the Lord, however, is magnificent. The Lord says, "I am he". It is like the ark. It is the testimony to His Person. They went backwards and fell to the ground; that is the position.
Rem. They come back to attack the position.
J.T. They do.
Rem. The Lord went out to meet them.
J.T. Yes; we can reckon on that now.
A.N. Syria was confederate with Israel, but the Lord comes in a special way. "God is with us". @Isaiah 8:10 There is combined opposition, but it only serves to bring out the glory as acting for the saints.
J.T. And Jehovah says to Ahaz, "Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth or in the height above". @Isaiah 7:11 You may go as high as ever you like for God has infinite resources. Whatever you ask it is all there. The combination would be easily shattered if Ahaz simply asked. That is the position. As we had it last night, the ultimate result is seen mainly in Hezekiah; in Isaiah he answers to the glory. What can the Assyrian do? "The daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn". @2 Kings 19:21 God was there. The Assyrian had come up reaching even to the neck, but only to be broken in pieces, for God is with us.
H.D'A.C. "They have slept their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands", @Psalm 76: 5
F.W. Do you think the close of Isaiah 6 comes out here -- the "holy seed"? @Isaiah 6:13
J.T. That is what our brother was remarking. It encourages us as to the day of small things. The tenth was there -- the holy seed. One was noticing in the book of Genesis what care there was in the selection of wives for the patriarchs to secure family equality, to ensure a wholly right seed. The principle begins in Genesis 1; "whose seed is in itself". @Genesis 1:12 The seed must be right, and I think John brings out the
{53}
right seed. "Everyone who practises righteousness is begotten of him". @1 John 2:29 The seed is marked by righteousness, and love, and holiness. John's epistle leads us up to Him that is holy and Him that is true.
J.J. What is the point in Peter's cutting off the servant's ear; what feature is that?
J.T. We are often disposed to do that, are we not? To cut off the right ear of a man means that you deprive him of the avenue for the thoughts of God to enter into his mind.
H.D'A.C. It shows that Peter was not under the influence of the glory at the moment.
J.M. "If ... ye seek me let these go their way". How does that apply at the moment?
J.T. It is that the Lord shows His interest, His unselfish care for us. He goes into the conflict before us; we can reckon on that. But I was thinking of the ear; in Psalm 40 we read "ears hast thou prepared me". @Psalm 40:6 John brings out the Lord as devoting Himself to the will of God. He came to carry out the will of God, and His ears were opened; He took the place of obedience. The mind of God enters through the ear, and to cut off a man's right ear is to run counter to the thought of the Lord for the moment. His thought is to bring about in us what is becoming in men, to hear what God has to say.
H.D'A.C. The first time we hear of Jesus doing anything is that He was hearing and asking questions. Swift to hear is an important word. It is a great point to hear today.
P.L. Do things at this point answer to the synagogue of Satan? The Lord will deal with that.
J.T. "I will make them to come and worship before thy feet". @Revelation 3:9 I think the address to Philadelphia corresponds with what we are speaking of -- the supremacy of Christ in the way He acts for the saints -- in what He does.
{54}
P.L. And as following the way of glory does He not assure us of a sphere of glory?
J.T. Quite. The overcomer is to be made a pillar in the temple of His God.
J.B.C-I. This would help us to discard the sword in this connection. It was an instrument neither a shepherd nor a fisherman needed.
{55}
THE MORE EXCELLENT WAY (4)
@John 20
J.T. It may be well to remark that the object in these readings is not to attempt to unfold the great truths that are conveyed in this gospel, but rather to seek to show the bearing of them as formative, having the last days in view, so that we should be in correspondence with Christ. I think that a clearer understanding of the bearing of chapters 14, 15, 16 and 17 is necessary, so as to understand this chapter, which is the crowning one. Those chapters are not rightly understood unless we see that the Lord has the whole history of the assembly in His mind, and that provision is made in them for His people to the end.
E.M. Do you view chapter 20 as the climax?
J.T. Yes; those we have considered culminate in it.
F.W. What is the outstanding glory in this chapter?
J.T. The ascension of Christ and our relationship with Him as His brethren; that gives the great moral elevation that is intended to characterise the saints of this period. There were in the pattern of the house given by the Spirit to David, upper chambers and inner chambers, treasuries, and the house of the mercy- seat; these accord with John's point of view. We have to look for these features, and I think that this chapter would correspond with the "upper" and "inner" chambers. To shine in the courts we have to understand the upper and inner chambers, and the house of the mercy-seat. The treasuries refer to the depositories of the precious dedicated things of God.
{56}
P.B. These privileges are what God intended them to have part with Him in?
J.T. Whatever the Lord is going on with now is in view in chapter 13. What He has to say in chapter 14 is peculiarly touching; it is what He is to be to us, not exactly what we are to Him; He speaks of the things that are available for us throughout the whole history of the saints in this dispensation. He is seen there more as a Mediator using all His influence, so to speak, on high for us. His name is established there in that God has glorified Him in Himself, and the Holy Spirit is here also, as sent in His name.
P.B. He knows all about the upper and inner chambers.
J.T. He does, and He searches into the depths of God. The Holy Spirit is here as begged for by Christ; He is here as sent by the Father in His name; so that all that He is is brought in to us, and all for us; that is chapter 14.
P.B. Then He has to wash our feet to bring us to that.
J.T. What a precious thing that is! There is too the presence of the Spirit as another Comforter, not as meeting our individual state exactly, but with us as a divine Person, so that the door is opened in a positive way from heaven to us; there is direct spiritual access from heaven for the Father and the Son to come in, and that at all times. Then chapter 15 is a mixed state of things where branches are supposed to exist that do not bear fruit, and the Father is dealing in that sphere in a disciplinary way to remove them. That phase also runs down to the end; we can reckon on the government of God in that connection; it has to say to that. Then in chapter 16 the Holy Spirit is known as bringing demonstration of certain things to the world -- a demonstration of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. All moral things
{57}
are adjusted in the testimony that the presence of the Holy Spirit here brings. There is the conviction present of sin, righteousness, and judgment; these moral things are all adjusted in the presence of the Spirit. The Spirit Himself is besides an immense moral support to the people of God.
H.D'A.C. How does He demonstrate these things?
J.T. Well, the Lord says, "of sin, because they do not believe on me; of righteousness, because I go away to my Father, and ye behold me no longer; of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged". @John 16:9 - 11. I understand that the presence of the Spirit in Jerusalem in the disciples of Jesus was God's answer to the judgment of the Jews.
H.D'A.C. Do you mean the very fact of the Spirit having come?
J.T. Having come to the followers of Jesus -- the Lord's disciples; they had been identified with Him. The superscription on the cross was: "Jesus the Nazaraean, the king of the Jews". @John 19:19 It was written in Hebrew, Greek and Latin. It was a public committal, we may say. It was written by the Roman governor as the crime for which He was put to death. I suppose, if there were criminal annals in Jerusalem that would be the record. There is no question about it, the world has committed itself to that. Now they professed to be acting for God in that. The matter, therefore, is in God's hands. What will the issue be? God raised Christ; that was private, the world did not see it, but when the Holy Spirit came to the followers of the Nazaraean (for that was the superscription) He was there undeniably and it was no private matter, it was a public thing. When the Spirit came down there had come from heaven a sound as of a rushing, mighty wind, and there appeared cloven tongues as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. It was undeniable that the Holy Spirit had come in to those Nazaraeans from Jesus in
{58}
heaven; God decided the matter. Jesus had said, "I go to the Father", @John 14:12 and the Holy Spirit had come in from the Father. The Father is supreme, and if Jesus went to the Father, then the Jews had committed a dreadful crime, and God made them to know it.
H.D'A.C. The Supreme Court of Appeal declared itself then!
J.T. Quite; that I think is just what it was, because it was a question of righteousness -- whether the courts were righteous or otherwise. God has decided it was a crime to put Him to death. Righteousness is in favour of Jesus, and the Holy Spirit has brought the testimony of that to this world.
H.E.F. "Of judgment", @John 16:11 what is your thought of that here?
J.T. The prince of this world is judged. It was he who brought all this about; he was the instigator of all, but God is the sovereign Ruler, Lord of the heaven and of the earth; Satan was only the prince of this world. God has jurisdiction over both. The prince of this world committed a crime; he is guilty, and he is judged.
H.E.F. Do you mean that the saints are brought to the apprehension of all these things?
J.T. That is what I understand. It is not a question of the world itself being convicted subjectively, but the thing is brought in here as a testimony.
Rem. So that the world is fully exposed to us.
J.T. That is it. The testimony is in those who have the Spirit.
A.N. The demonstration is in view of the position being clear to the disciples, is it not? It is not so much the effect toward the world.
J.T. No; we, as having the Spirit, understand how matters are; so that the testimony is here.
P.L. Does this go with the "witness" in John's first epistle?
{59}
J.T. I think so -- "God has given to us eternal life", @1 John 5:11. This (John 16) is the basis on which all punitive judgment will be administered. God's case is clear. He overcomes when in judgment. It is now out morally, for He establishes the thing morally before He acts.
H.E.F. We see, therefore, that God's judgment is morally right.
J.T. That is it, and all shall see it. He is bearing witness to it now, so that when He executes the judgment it is known to be right.
J.B.C-l. What is the object in the Lord's way in chapter 20? Is it to relieve the spirits of His own from the pressure of death? What came as pressure on the Lord's spirit and how He bore it, seems to have been set before us much in the other scriptures you have dealt with, but the Lord, free from all that pressure, seems to be solicitous as to the pressure upon the spirits of His own.
J.T. You mean that He is free now, and He would bring them into that liberty? In chapters 18 and 19 we have what may be regarded as the altar. Before coming to chapter 20 there must be something for us by way of pattern in those two chapters. I have noticed that in the anointing of the tabernacle, in @Leviticus 8:11, before the sacrifices are brought in, the altar was anointed seven times.
H.D'A.C. What do you gather from that?
J.T. Well, it seems as if the Holy Spirit would call special attention to the altar in the divine system. If it were anointed, as it is said to have been, seven times, special attention is called to it -- not the sacrifices as yet that were offered on it, but the thing itself. I believe it refers to the closing chapters of the Lord's life, that is, after He was arrested.
E.J.McB. Do you look upon the seven times as governing the whole period here outwardly?
J.T. It would seem that the Holy Spirit as the
{60}
anointing enters into that feature of our position in a peculiar way. Perhaps more has been made, and is being made, of the sacrifice than of the altar.
E.J.McB. Do you look then upon the altar as indicating the conditions of approach?
J.T. I think it refers to the moral power that marked the Lord, particularly when taken by the Jews in the garden. He has no support outwardly at all, He is alone, and the moral power that shines commands your attention. How dignified He was! Satan had designed all these circumstances to humiliate the Lord in the last degree. He had power in Himself to extricate Himself, but He was there in obedience to the will of God; He was laying down His life -- "I lay it down of myself" @John 10:18 -- and it had to be laid down in this way. So it is the moral dignity and power of the Lord that shine in these two chapters -- "who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God". @Hebrews 9:14
H.D'A.C. That is very fine, but I do not quite understand why you call that an altar.
J.T. Because I understand it is in that connection that sacrifice is actually made. The altar was three cubits high and five square; three indicates there was power, and five that there was weakness -- "He has been crucified in weakness". @2 Corinthians 13:4. I do not say that this is exclusively in these chapters, indeed it is included in the other gospels.
H.D'A.C. John would be more the "three" size, would it not?
J.T. That is what I thought.
P.L. Would the altar be more what He is in the sense of how He bore the suffering?
J.T. It is that which sustains the offering. Many might offer and be out of keeping with the offering. The second letter to the Corinthians is to bring about a state suitable to the offering -- "the Lord loveth a cheerful giver"; it is the spirit of the thing.
{61}
H.D'A.C. Then does the brass of the altar come out in this part?
J.T. The brass, I suppose, denoted God's thought of sin; that would come out in the other gospels more -- it became God. The metal of the altar represented what is suitable to God.
H.E.F. Do you mean that the appreciation of Christ as the altar would produce a moral element in us answering to it?
J.T. That is the reason why I mentioned it by way of analogy. In the second letter to Corinthians @2 Corinthians 9:5 the apostle speaks of their gift "not as got out of you". In your gift you are to have the spirit that becomes it. Whatever you do by way of sacrifice, the thing is to be in keeping with it; there is to be that moral dignity underneath.
Ques. Is that the thought in "the altar that sanctifieth the gift" -- "whether is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift"? @Matthew 23:19
J.T. Quite.
Ques. In the book of Numbers the altar was to be covered with a purple cloth when the camp set forward. Is there any connection between that and what you have in your mind?
J.T. There is; purple denoted royalty, but the answer to royalty now is suffering. The anointing oil indicated that; myrrh, which signifies suffering, was one of the principal ingredients in it.
P.L. So that "the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, it is more blessed to give than to receive", @Acts 20:35 would confirm what you are speaking of?
J.T. I think so, suffering is necessarily connected with the altar.
Ques. Does suffering produce this state in us, bringing us to cheerfulness in giving?
J.T. I think the principle of the altar is that in making sacrifices you are in keeping with them.
A.N. Abraham built an altar, but the burnt
{62}
offering was distinct from the altar. With Abraham there was the principle of surrender, and he bound Isaac upon the altar.
J.H. Would the principle be in the apostle when he says, "thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life"? @2 Timothy 3:10
J.T. Quite. As you look into these chapters, you are bound to admire the moral dignity and the majesty with which the Lord met the forces of evil. He is ever Himself, never ruffled, never a word out of place and His silence speaks.
J.B. Would it be preparatory in that way to what comes out in chapter 20; the saints taking their place with Christ as the ascended One giving them dignity to be associated with Him in the knowledge of His Father as their Father, His God as their God?
J.T. Suffering has a great effect on us; it is given to us to suffer for His sake.
E.J.McB. Your suggestion of connecting the peculiar dignity of Christ in these circumstances with the altar makes it very evident that no one could take His life from Him.
J.T. He was laying down His life of Himself, and He was supreme in it. The enemy was allowed to bring his most wicked devices to bear upon the Lord, for it became God "in bringing many sons to glory to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings". @Hebrews 2:10
J.F. Why do you get that in connection with bringing many sons to glory?
J.T. It is by way of suffering -- by way of the crucible.
H.E.F. "Bringing many sons to glory". @Hebrews 2:10 Is that the glory you have in your mind -- what the saints are being invested with now?
J.T. Yes, it does not say "bringing many sons to heaven", but "to glory". In the passage we had
{63}
yesterday, Proverbs 25, we read, "The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. Take away the dross from the silver, and there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner". @Proverbs 25:3,4. I think the consideration of this feature of suffering in regard of what we have before us has that effect -- you have a vessel, a vessel fitted for glory. We are vessels of mercy, fitted for glory, as it says. Well, the dross has to be removed. I do not say that that is all that is in the suffering, because if the dross is removed, the suffering may be still there, e.g., Paul says, "I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh". @Colossians 1:24. It is a divine design that we should go the way of suffering, and we do so as following our Leader.
J.J. So you regard these chapters more as a pattern?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. They are much more than that, but our thought now is to see the pattern there.
P.L. Stephen followed his great Leader in that way. "Having said this he fell asleep". @Acts 7:60
J.J. I suppose that explains the fact that the forsaking of the Lord is not found in John's gospel.
J.T. We do not get the actual fact, but this thought of suffering, and being in correspondence in the suffering with the sacrifice we make, is of immense value to us, as forming the vessel.
H.D'A.C. Solomon's altar was too small to receive the offerings, was it not? That is in great contrast with Christ.
Rem. Will you say a little more about correspondence in the suffering with the sacrifice?
J.T. That is what the chapter would help us in, for it all refers to the investiture with the glory. Peter says in chapter 1 of his first epistle: "Wherein ye exult for a little while at present, if needed, put to
{64}
grief by various trials, that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes, though it be proved by fire, be found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ; whom, having not seen, ye love; on whom, though not now looking but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with the glory". @1 Peter 1:6 - 8 Notice that: "filled with the glory"; that is a present thing, and it comes in in connection with present suffering.
W.H. Would that be seen in the fact that Solomon's altar was the same size as the oracle in length and breadth; @2 Chronicles 3:8; @2 Chronicles 4:1? There is a correspondence.
J.T. That is very suggestive. Our brother just remarked that Solomon's altar was not great enough to receive all the sacrifices, which would be another thought.
J.B.C-l. We read of the offering being bound to the altar, and I thought the sufferings of Christ really preserved the offering in keeping with the altar.
Ques. Would that be the altar sanctifying the gift?
J.B.C-l. I thought so. It is the manner of His exit we have in John's gospel. He has no helpers, He bore His own cross. It is the dignity of His Person in the accomplishment of His work for the glory of God.
Ques. Would suffering bring us nearer to the heart of Christ so that we might be formed in His love?
J.T. Well, you feel that you are with Him in a peculiar way in suffering, and you want to be in it in moral dignity, in power, so that you are not chafed or irritated, nor show resentment, nor seek relief from it. The principle is entire and unqualified submission to the will of God.
G.E. What does that verse mean: "Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not, but thou hast prepared me a body"? @Hebrews 10:5
{65}
J.T. I think that is what the Lord had in mind. The principle of the altar is, "Lo, I come to do thy will". @Hebrews 10:9 Whatever that will involved, He was prepared for it.
A.N. All suffering would not have this character, would it? It is special. Is it suffering at the hand of man?
J.T. Quite; so Peter says, "The Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you" @1 Peter 4:14 in that connection.
A.N. Is that what Peter speaks of as suffering for righteousness¬ sake? Or would it go further?
J.T. I do not think John goes beyond that; he does not bring in suffering from the hand of God.
A.N. It would be in direct relation to the testimony then.
P.L. "The disciple standing by whom he loved" @John 19:26 -- would there be any connection in that?
J.T. "By the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary, the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. Jesus, therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved" @John 19:25,26 -- they were there; they represented the extreme of affection.
Rem. If we do not learn to suffer there is misrepresentation. Peter misrepresented things; he had not learnt to suffer.
J.T. He misrepresented things by cutting off the ear of the bondman of the high priest; he missed the great feature of the moment.
R.B. God brings many sons to glory by allowing us to suffer.
J.T. I think suffering is a refining process; it gives you a lustre; you are in keeping with your Leader.
R.B. You have in mind the ultimate investiture of the glory.
J.D. Do we find at the close of chapter 19 two
{66}
timid ones prepared for the suffering in Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus? They are prepared to come out into the light now, and are ready for suffering.
J.T. Yes; John would bring in every little bit of the work of God. That is a point of importance.
J.B. Do you think that the teaching of the nineteenth chapter would in that way add dignity to the saints?
J.T. I think it does. Wisdom's house is built on seven pillars; it involves that every bit of the work of God is taken account of. You cannot build on one man. One man may lead, and may deliver a city; he may by laying down his life work out deliverance, but in building a house we must have "seven"; wisdom requires that, and therefore we cannot leave out Nicodemus. We have Mary Magdalene shining in lustre, but both Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus shine, too.
A.G. I was going to ask if, in chapter 19, we view the ark going down into the Jordan and we stand two thousand cubits off.
J.T. That is it. He is in the enemies¬ hands first. They do not know what they are dealing with, but it means their overthrow, like Dagon of the Philistines. He actually goes down into death. The article of death was touched, not here as a victim, but as invading the domain of Satan -- overthrowing him in his own stronghold. That is what is in view here. By observing the 2,000 cubits we may follow after Him. There were men in David's day who went over the Jordan when it overflowed its banks, and the waters were not dried up at all; @1 Chronicles 12:15. It is a question, as Jeremiah says, "how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?" @Jeremiah 12:5 That is what we might learn in these chapters. Stephen is an example of a man in the swelling of Jordan. The waters were dried up for him by faith: but then there were the
{67}
forces of Satan there with their weapons and stones, and it is the superiority which marks that man that enables us to see what it is to be here in correspondence with the altar.
F.W. The feet of the priests touched the water -- that was in the swelling of Jordan.
J.T. That was the Lord touching it -- the waters fled. The fame thereof was heard; it was the destruction of death. The Lord invaded that domain and overthrew Satan in it by his own weapons; He annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light. Psalm 114 brings that out more than any of the Old Testament scriptures: "The sea saw it and fled: the Jordan turned back .... What ailed thee, thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou turnedst back?" @Psalm 114:3,5 Well, it was the presence of the Lord; *God* was there. I think it agrees with the truth in John. He turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters. That is what He has done. The sea is overthrown, people are brought through it, and the Jordan is driven back. But there is more than that: there is the flint, and the rock, and John shows how you get the pool and fountain of water; "who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters". @Psalm 114:8 I think that is John's ministry.
J.B.C-I. Referring to the place that suffering has in this, does John 20 raise a question as to how far our suffering centres in Christ?
J.T. I think Mary Magdalene presents the result of all this. She was at the cross. John in his way brings out the subjective in the woman; the brightest things are seen in women in John; Mary was morally equal to be the messenger to carry the message; but in regard to the chapter itself, it involves the inlet into eternity. This gospel prepares us for eternal things, not simply things relating to the promises of God, or His purpose regarding the earth, but things
{68}
that existed before the world. By careful comparison, it will be noticed that there is no reference to the Sabbath in this chapter, whereas Matthew and Mark and Luke link on what is said about the resurrection with the Sabbath.
F.I. So being of an eternal character it is connected with the first day of the week.
J.T. Yes. "The first day of the week" is the new beginning -- there is nothing before it. The Lord by His remarks throughout this gospel had been preparing the disciples for this. He says, "No one has gone up to heaven save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven"; @John 3:13 and again, "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?" @John 6:62 He also says, "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"; @John 17:24 and, "Glorify thou me ... with the glory which I had with thee before the world was". @John 17:5 They heard all that and the way is now open for it. He is, as it were, a hind let loose, and He is now prepared to introduce His loved ones into what is eternal.
W.S.L. Does the first day of the week suggest the bringing in of a new order of things?
J.T. Not only a new order of things, but an order before which there was nothing; for Adam was only a figure of Him that was to come. It was no afterthought. The Word became flesh in John. "In the beginning was the Word". @John 1:1
E.J.McB. Morally there was no week before this.
J.T. Exactly.
W.S.L. It is an eternal order of things.
J.T. The Sabbath being referred to in the synoptic gospels means, as far as I can see, that the previous week is recognised.
J.F. Is that implied in His words, "I ascend"?
{69}
J.T. I think so, and His Father is ours, and His God is ours.
J.B.C-I. Would the eighth day suppose the gathering up of all the results of the Spirit's work, and the eternal union of the heavens and the earth for the divine pleasure?
J.T. No doubt. Thomas being there would, I suppose, represent the Jewish side.
L.D.M. Say a word as to the breaking of bread in that connection.
J.T. The breaking of bread is connected with the first day of the week, but the Lord's supper is more connected with the Lord's day, which would have reference to the testimony of God. The breaking of bread brings in the Lord as Head.
A.N. What is the distinct thought connected with each?
J.T. The breaking of bread is more often spoken of than the Lord's supper. The latter is mentioned only once, and where the expression is used, we read, "For as often as ye shall eat this bread and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord until he come". @1 Corinthians 11:26 It has reference to the public testimony of God. Anyone present could see us eating, but the memorial is another thing. The memorial of Christ is the breaking of bread: "This do in remembrance of me". @Luke 22:19, @1 Corinthians 11:24. That makes room for Him, and hence it is, in Acts 20, formally connected with the first day of the week, and what is more important still is that in that chapter you have the truth of the assembly in its heavenly -- I may say, its eternal -- relation; the whole counsel of God, which goes back before the foundation of the world, is involved in that.
J.J. Why does John omit the breaking of bread?
J.T. He does not refer to the Lord's supper at all; Luke does. The latter refers to it in his gospel,
{70}
supporting Paul, and he refers to it in Acts 2 and 20. In chapter 20 he formally connects it with the first day of the week.
F.I. What is the significance with regard to John in the Revelation when he speaks of being in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and not on the first day of the week?
J.T. The Lord's day there would have in view all that was about to be unfolded -- the rights of the Lord, His authority on earth.
F.W.B. Did you say that the Supper is connected with the Lord's day? What do you mean by the Lord's day in that connection?
J.T. It is the dominical day; He has got authority over your soul, therefore it fits in with the public testimony of God. In the synoptic gospels the resurrection is connected with the Sabbath, that is to say, there was a previous week in which God had been witnessing. The assembly comes into that as in the type of Rebekah; she comes into Sarah's tent. But Eve is the primary thought of the assembly, she does not come into any other tent, she is just the counterpart of Adam; all the others are provisional types. God reverts to the primary thought in the assembly.
J.M. The Supper is the public side, and the memorial would be more the inward.
J.T. So here you have the first day of the week.
P.L. Would the Supper suggest more what the assembly is *for* Him, and the memorial be more what the assembly is *to* Him?
J.T. Quite.
A.N. Is the memorial side connected with our entrance into privilege?
J.T. It is; He is called to mind and gets His place as Head.
Ques. Why do we so often refer to John's ministry when partaking of the Supper?
{71}
J.T. It is to bring in the spirit that is becoming to it.
J.J. Do you refer to the Lord's side as suggesting the rib taken out of Adam?
J.T. That is what we have here -- "He showed to them his hands and his side", what He had done for them and His love to them. I think the allusion is to Adam's rib.
J.B.C-I. Does John give us the love that lies behind the Supper more? That would explain why it is essential we should get over to John's side if the Lord is to manifest Himself to us.
H.E.F. Is the ark over Jordan here?
J.T. Yes. "The hind of the morning" suggests resurrection; the Lord is free now, that is the end in view in all this. Love sees Him coming in, as in the Canticles; "the voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills". @Song of Songs 2:8 It is the freedom with which the Lord moves about in His love visits, and He stands behind our wall, showing Himself through the lattice. All that means He is gathering up the loved ones.
W.S.L. Does the Supper bring the Lord in, in that way answering to chapter 14?
J.T. I think so. He comes in according to chapter 14 by way of manifestation; it is not there as Leader; chapter 14 does not go so far as that. The headship of Christ involves that He carries you to the highest place.
H.E.F. Say a word as to the "breathing", and "as the Father sent me forth, I also send you".
J.T. That is the great end of the testimony -- that we should correspond with Him. As He came out fully representative of the Father, so those who have His breath are to be like Him. I think that "the house of the mercy-seat" @1 Chronicles 28:12, understood would enable us to come out in the spirit of forgiveness. "Having said this, he breathed into
{72}
them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit", as if to qualify them for this service to forgive and to retain.
J.B.C-l. Would this be bound up with the thought in chapter 6: "He that eateth me even he shall live by me" @John 6:57 -- the affections of the saints centred in Christ personally? Their support in connection with the Lord Himself would be in the measure in which they fed on Him.
J.T. Quite; so there is representation. The thought of God is that the spirit of forgiveness as it shone in Christ should be in us: "Whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted to them".
H.D'A.C. He does not here send them forth to preach as He does in the other gospels; it is more that the spirit, the breath of Christ, is to characterise them.
J.T. It is largely a question now of remitting sins.
H.D'A.C. How would you help on that line?
J.T. My impression is that it is assembly sins we have to remit -- sins committed in the circle in which the Lord's name is nominally owned. This spirit must underlie the principle of gathering now. Believers mixed up with human organisations are ignorant of the evil they are guilty of; but they are sinning nevertheless, and when conviction of this is brought home, there is to be evidence that there is forgiveness.
R.G. Has the breathing reference to God breathing into Adam?
J.T. I think it has; it exalts Christ in that, instead of God breathing into Him, He breathes into them. The last Adam is a life-giving Spirit, and I think this is the proof of it.
R.G. Then it shows that there is a new generation with His life and His Spirit.
J.T. I think that is what God is bringing about now. That is the spirit you look for.
{73}
J.J. It supposes having followed Him all through, and gone up, and come out again.
J.T. That is it. Not only have you the life of a Man who has ascended, but you have it in this most intimate way. He breathed into them.
W.S.L. You referred to retention of sins.
J.T. That would refer to nominal Christians who refuse to bow to the truth and who take up an apostate attitude; for instance, Jezebel is outside the pale of forgiveness; she will not repent.
J.B. There would be a certain correspondence with Christ in the spirit of forgiveness in us.
J.T. That is the attitude you take up with all Christians.
F.I. Does the breathing come in as the result of the appreciation of the ascension glory you were speaking of?
J.T. I think the Lord is now regarding them as brought to this. Mary is the link subjectively. I do not think the disciples themselves were equal to it.
F.I. I wonder if they showed their appreciation, because it says the doors were shut for fear of the Jews.
J.B.C-l. In the Lord dealing with Peter in the last chapter, has that to do with the character of remission, since it follows the fact that he had gone fishing and the others with him?
J.T. The Lord probed him to the bottom, and apparently the others were present.
J.B.C-l. Had there been retention, there would have been a hindrance to their going together in the way of testimony.
J.T. John says, "It is the Lord". @John 21:7 They were not afraid of Him, they knew there was forgiveness with Him.
{74}
REPRESENTATION
@2 Timothy 2:19; @Revelation 3:7,8; @John 20:19 - 23
What I have before me is to speak of representation. It being God's thought to be represented, His thought can never be relinquished, even when, as in our own times, that in which He was represented here, now grossly misrepresents Him. There is the most gross misrepresentation possible of God and of Christ in that which claims the place of divine representation in this world; and my desire, dear brethren, is to show, with the Lord's help, how God would bring us to the divine thought in regard of this, fitting us for it and maintaining us in it. It was said, "If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?" @Psalm 11:3. But the foundation is not destroyed, and hence the way is open for the righteous. And not only so, but as the passage in 2 Timothy shows, the righteous has in his possession the seal of representation -- a most important provision for a day in which, as I said, God is grossly misrepresented, Christ is grossly misrepresented, and the truth concerning the vessel in which the representation should be seen, is wholly given up. We have in our possession a seal; it is not, as you will observe, that *we* are sealed, true as that is, for He who has anointed us and sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts, is God; @2 Corinthians 1:21. That is not what is alluded to here, but rather a mandate from God for the righteous. Behind it must lie the great truth of the vessel in which the divine mandate, as I may say, was primarily vested.
Now that leads one to think of the place the assembly was intended to fill in relation to Christ. He is Himself, as we read, the "image of the invisible God". @Colossians 1:15 Wonderful fact! -- that in a Man here in this
{75}
world, coming in in the lowliest, most unpretentious way, there should be the image of the invisible God!
He represented God, beloved, in His creation, and then, as it is said, He is the "Firstborn of all creation", @Colossians 1:15. But He is the image of God. Adam presents to us the first great feature of representation of God. "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and *let them* have dominion", @Genesis 1:26. In the representation of God here, it was His thought that Christ should have the assembly, and God has not relinquished that. All the service of Christ and of the Spirit in our day is to bring us back to the assembly's place and function in relation to Christ who is the image of God; for the full representation of God here, according to the early chapters of Genesis, involved the woman. "In the day when they were created", we are told, "He called *their* name Adam", @Genesis 5:2. It was not only that the man should not be alone, but in the day they were created, He called their name Adam. They represented one great divine thought; they were to be the representatives -- or jointly the representative -- of God in the creation. And God has not surrendered that thought. The assembly was here at the outset in that way. She stood out as in relation to Christ in the primary thought of God; she also stood out in relation to Him as meeting conditions that arose consequent on sin; but it is of all importance to recognise that she was here in the light of Ephesians as the companion of Christ, answering to the divine thought before the worlds. The first great type of the assembly has nothing to do with sin, and unless we understand what that is -- what the upper and inner chambers of the house represent @1 Chronicles 28:11 -- we shall not understand how to shine in the provisional relation to Christ.
But then in meeting the consequences of sin God develops typically His testimony; and so we have
{76}
to distinguish John's presentation of the resurrection and the ascension of Christ from that presented by the other evangelists. Matthew, Mark and Luke present the resurrection of Christ *in relation to previous dealings of God*; you will find the link with the Sabbath maintained, whereas John emphasises the first day of the week, signifying that Christ will have the assembly, or the saints who form it, first of all in relation to eternal thoughts. John begins, not with previous dates in the development of God's ways, but he goes back before the foundation of the world: "In the beginning". @John 1:1 We have to understand the assembly as belonging to eternity, and that is what John presents to us. We have access in that light to the eternal thoughts of God, where we see the glory that Christ had with the Father *before* the world began.
But then there were the subsequent things. And so Rebekah comes in in type as a companion for Christ in view of Israel's decease; for the moment Israel is gone, and dear brethren, the assembly is to be the companion of Christ for His comfort in the tent of Sarah. I think the synoptic gospels have in view "Sarah's tent". @Genesis 24:67 They contemplate it as empty, but they provide in the assembly an occupant for that tent; she is now occupying Israel's place and the Lord would have us to remember that. No true believer, no true lover of Christ, can forget or disregard the place that Israel had with Christ. We cannot but feel, we cannot but be moved, beloved, by the tears of Christ, as He saw Jerusalem. We are often touched by the tears of Christ at the grave of Lazarus, but He wept as He beheld the city. Was it nothing to Christ that *His* city should be indifferent to Him? Ah, beloved, how he loved it, as Moses said of Jehovah, "Yea, he loved the people!" @Deuteronomy 33:3. "How often", He says, "would I have gathered thee!" @Luke 13:34 No love of Christ.
{77}
had been effective in His dealings with regard to Israel. He needs comfort (speaking reverently); God will bring us to that. Receiving Rebekah, Isaac was comforted after the death of his mother.
But then He has the assembly, as I said, outside of all that, for it was not an afterthought; it was a primary thought. It were degrading to the assembly to assume that it was an afterthought; it was a primary thought. And so as glorified among the Gentiles, Joseph says, "God has made me to forget all my toil and all my father's house"; so in regard of Christ, He forgets in this wonderful relation of the assembly; @Genesis 41:51. Then we get fruitfulness in Ephraim, denoting that he has got a wholly new generation. How great a thought it is, that Christ is among us. "Christ among you", the apostle says, "the hope of glory". @Colossians 1:27.
But then there is the testimony of God, and all that it involves; Moses represents that. He forsook Egypt. He did not share the glory of Joseph for another king had arisen who knew not Joseph; "by faith he forsook Egypt". @Hebrews 11:27. We are now in the presence of the testimony of God, the faithful and true witness, and so in Moses¬ wife we have a companion for Christ as the vessel of God's testimony. This latter involves not only Israel, but every divine thought. No lover of Christ in this relation will despise the very least of the testimonies of God; whether the sun, moon or stars, everything is of interest in the testimony of Christ. It is Moses who brings in the great truth of creation, dispelling all the mists of heathen darkness from our minds. We have the true God; we have Him in all His testimonies in the heavens and upon the earth. The assembly is linked up with Christ in that way. We are the companion of Him who unfolds the mind of God, who is the Word, the faithful and true Witness, the Alpha and Omega. Wonderful place! The more
{78}
you understand the relation of Moses¬ wife to him, the more you will cherish every thought of God, even in nature. As it says, "Doth not even nature itself teach you". @1 Corinthians 11:14 Some of us are very cramped in regard of these things, but Moses would unfold to us the whole testimony of God.
And then we have what is an integral part of all this, and that is, the battles -- the wars of the Lord. David was anointed in regard to the enemies of God. He was anointed in regard to the ark, that it should have its place. He says, "We heard of it at Ephratah; we found it in the fields of the wood ... I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob", @Psalm 132:4 - 6. What an undertaking! If he did not fully grasp it, God knew; and in the anointing of David we have the divine challenge to every foe in heaven and upon earth. Satan quickly comes forward with his mightiest instrument, but David brings him down. We see one now in the conflict, fighting the battles of the Lord. "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?" @1 Samuel 17:26 And then Abigail, representing the assembly, comes to light, "My lord", she says, "fights the battles of Jehovah". @1 Samuel 25:28. Do we apprehend the Lord in that light? Are we prepared to forsake our Nabals, and become part of that which is His companion? "The woman", it says, "was of good understanding, and withal of a beautiful countenance". @1 Samuel 25:3 That, I think, is what God is bringing about today in a peculiar way -- the good understanding and the beautiful countenance. "I speak", says the apostle, "as to intelligent persons". @1 Corinthians 10:15 The Lord's supper is introduced in that connection; it is a test to our intelligence. The effect is that it builds up a constitution which is seen, which is manifest in the countenance. David himself was "beautiful-eyed" we are told. We are now coming
{79}
to personal distinctions, personal distinctiveness. As he appeared in the midst of his brethren it is said he was ruddy, lovely eyed, and of a beautiful appearance. And so Abigail is a fit companion for him. He is fighting the battles of the Lord. Let us not assume for a moment that these battles are over. It is one after another, and for David one battle after another meant one victory after another, one triumph after another; there was nothing to fear. Abigail recognised that he was fighting the battles of the Lord, that "the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling", and that the soul of her lord would be "bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God", @1 Samuel 25:29.
Now all these thoughts underlie this remarkable mandate in 2 Timothy, for Timothy was well acquainted with Paul's doctrine. "Thou hast fully known", he says, "my doctrine and manner of life". @2 Timothy 3:10 He understood the assembly and the assembly's place, and he understood the manner of life of the great apostle. And so, as the foundations were not destroyed, he was to go forth with a mandate, as it were. And what is that? You say, I thought we were in days not marked by officialism, and yet you are speaking about a seal of office. But God never relinquishes any thought of His, and in the darkest day He intends representation. It is, however, on *moral* grounds and not *formally* official. I can go forth to those who call on His name professedly, and say, I have a mandate. I have authority from God -- here is the seal written on both sides as it were, "the Lord knoweth them that are his". How many of us carry this seal about? It was in the power of it that the great revival came about from which we are all benefiting now, and it remains. "The Lord knoweth them that are his". There is not one of them in the whole world who is not perfectly known
{80}
to Christ; and if the Lord know those that are His, He never withdraws His eyes from one of them. He makes His circuit, as we read of Samuel -- "he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpeh", @1 Samuel 7:16. Let us be assured of it, beloved, that the Lord in His circuit pays attention to everyone. But He does it mediately, He does it, in the main, through His servants; He would employ us. As walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, He is judging what you do for Him, what I do for Him; this is what the Lord is doing. "The Lord knoweth them that are his". We cannot forget them; we cannot shut our hearts against them. They belong to us; they belong to the Lord. We are entitled to claim them.
Then the other side is, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". We have this seal in our possession on moral grounds -- the power of representation. Although God is falsified on every hand, there is in those who hold the seal and act on it, a representation of God, and it means deliverance, for a true witness delivereth souls. There is no other way out, it is a divinely appointed representation of God, in a day of general departure. He has opened up the way, and so the Lord says, "I have set before thee an opened door" @Revelation 3:8 -- not an open one, but an opened one; the Lord has done it. He has the key of David; as He says, He opens and no one shuts, and He shuts and no one opens; and so "I have set before thee an opened door". How it became opened I think is explained by the seal. We have the way opened for what I may call a little bit of collective representation. I think the Lord has great delight in the return to the collective thought; hence He says, "I have set before thee an opened door, and no man can shut it". So that there is a way open to us, dear friends, a door opened by the Lord in which we, having a little strength as He says,
{81}
may represent Him. He says, thou "hast kept my word (it is in that that representation lies) and hast not denied my name". @Revelation 3:8 How can those who take on another name represent Christ? It is misrepresentation; whereas this assembly -- Philadelphia -- affording a green spot for Christ, had not misrepresented Him; she had kept the word of His patience, and not denied His name. She had a little power. The Lord appreciates a little collective power, and I think the fact that He does so should be treasured in the keenest way by us. There is no pretension attached to it; it is what the Lord sees and treasures. No misrepresentation; she keeps the word of His patience and does not deny His name.
What I read in John 20 I believe gives the secret of all this; that is, we must apprehend the inner place with Christ. John comes in at the last, as we often remark. He gives the likeness of God; he brings in what is like God. You will remember in Genesis 1 man was to be made in God's image and likeness; but in chapter 5, which involves recovery from departure, we are told that Adam begat a son in his own likeness, after his own image; likeness comes first. You cannot have representation now without likeness. It would be incongruous for God to put His seal to anything to represent Him, apart from His likeness. But John brings in the likeness of God. In John we read "a man come from God", and of Jesus it says, "knowing that he came from God and went to God", @John 13:3 those who saw Him saw the Father. You have the likeness of God. Hence Adam begat a son in his own likeness after his own image. God will not have image-representation now without likeness; hence the great service of John's ministry is to bring in likeness; and so we have in this passage the exaltation of Christ, the ascension. "I ascend", He says, "to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God". Dear brethren,
{82}
what a precious link for our souls is that well-known message, a message which never wears out; it retains its brilliancy and freshness the more we enter into it. It is constantly living, and links our souls with Christ as ascended to His Father. It is what I may call the "upper and the inner chambers". @1 Chronicles 28:11 You remember when David gave the plan of the house to Solomon we read of its upper and inner chambers. We must understand the upper and inner in order to shine here for God, as Luke presents it. Luke gives us what is representative of God in external moral comeliness and beauty, but John gives the spirit of the thing; he brings in the likeness of God. And so the Lord having spoken to the disciples, breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit". "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you". There is nothing less than that, dear brethren- persons sent out with the Spirit of Christ; as the Father sent Him, so He sent them.
Then He says, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them". That is divine representation. We have in these words as I may say, a warrant for forgiving. How could we be together in the light of the assembly, save on the principle of forgiveness? We have all had to do with the sin of the world and the church, and how could we be together except on the principle of mutual forgiveness. But then there is also the retention of sins -- a most important warrant. We could not preserve what is of God without it. Divine representation involves that you must put limitations on sin. In Matthew it was, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven". @Matthew 18:18 That refers to the beginning of the dispensation. The Jews were bound by the apostles, and so in that measure the saints were released -- a very happy release from the influence of Judaism, but now at the end of the dispensation,
{83}
representation of God involves that we should begin with remission. Our attitude as knowing God is remission; the way is open for it; we have a warrant to remit. I cannot understand how we can be gathered together unless that is true; the principle of remission is a divine principle. But then there is the principle of retention. A solemn fact, but we could not be together in the light of the house of God without it. There must be the principle of retaining sin. If men will be sinners, if men harden their hearts and refuse the light of God -- the great principles that have been recovered for us -- then the sins are not remitted. There is the judicial principle going on. If Samuel judges in Bethel, he insists upon the principles of the house of God, and we must refuse people -- those with whom we cannot walk. "Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for ever". @Psalm 93:5 But the love of our hearts, as having the Spirit of God, leads us to forgive. The way is opened for every one, every lover of Christ, to this position, but the principle of it is forgiveness; if the heart be hardened and there is refusal of light, then the sins must be retained, for the Lord is amongst His people, and He judges; it says of Samuel that he "judged Israel *all* the days of his life" @1 Samuel 7:15 -- what is due to the holiness of God's house goes on to the end. May the Lord bless the word.
{84}
SPIRITUAL DIGNITY
@Matthew 26: 6 - 13 @Mark 14:3 - 9; @Luke 7:36 - 38 @John 12:3; @1 Corinthians 12:12, 13
I have it before me on this occasion to speak about spiritual dignity, the dignity which God intends to mark His people, both severally and collectively. With this in view, I hope to call attention to the anointing, particularly of that vessel spoken of in the passage in 1 Corinthians as "the Christ". "So also", it says, "is the Christ" -- referring to the saints as baptised in the power of one Spirit into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, and as having all been given to drink of one Spirit. That is what I have in view. The idea of this dignity is not what you might call new. It is not one of the things that a scribe discipled in the kingdom of the heavens would bring forth as new; but it is one of the things that, although old, retains its freshness, and is applicable now as when it was first mentioned.
You will all remember how Jacob had the idea as God appeared to him in that remarkable dream of his, in which he saw a ladder reaching up into heaven, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon it; when he awoke he said, "Surely God is in this place, and I knew it not". @Genesis 28:16. He got a conception of the character that belonged to that place where God was; and so he takes the stone and sets it up for a pillar, and pours oil upon it, as if to express the initial conception he had of the dignity of that place -- God's house. God did not forget that, nor would He have Jacob forget it. It was the beginning, as one might say, of his spiritual history in the house of God. A very small beginning indeed, and yet morally a very great beginning. How he got the idea of anointing I am not prepared to say, but he was the
{85}
offspring of an anointed family. We are told in the Psalms that God protected the patriarchs, saying, "Touch not mine anointed ones and do my prophets no harm". @Psalm 105:15. The idea was evidently connected with his family education, and if it had application to the patriarchs it certainly had application to the house of the God of the patriarchs. And so Jacob anoints the pillar. It is well to make a beginning like that, dear brethren. God takes account of it, and He sees to it that Jacob remembers it, for twenty years later He says, "I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar". @Genesis 31:13 God took account of Jacob's conception of the dignity, the honour that belonged to the house of God. And God had respect to that, and He was with Jacob until he returned to that spot, where he not only anoints the pillar, but pours a drink offering upon it. His regard for the house of God has grown, has developed into a state of soul that is now pleasing to God.
And so, beloved brethren, I wish to show from these four anointings in the gospels, that we have an expansion of Jacob's act. I desire to show that these women represent a fourfold conception of Christ as here in this world on behalf of God. He was the Anointed of God in a fourfold way; and the blending of these four conceptions, I hope to show, is that which, as in the assembly, qualifies it to be anointed; for God will not now anoint a vessel like Saul, where the moral conditions are not in agreement with the anointing. In his case, David respected the oil, but deplored and suffered from the sad disparity between the vessel and the oil upon it. God will never again anoint a vessel out of keeping with His holy oil. He needs not, beloved friends, for in His beloved Son undertaking to do His will, emptying Himself, as we are told, taking a servant's form, becoming flesh, He has got One wholly according to His own thought. "This is my beloved Son, in
{86}
whom I have found my delight". @Matthew 3:17 He has *found* it. He is no longer obliged, as one may say, to take up man in the flesh, nor will He. He has got in Christ One wholly according to His own thoughts. In the long thirty years of His private life, there was constant delight for God in that Man. He is now, so to speak, wholly independent of man in the flesh. Even although one may be head and shoulders above one's brethren, or like Eliab, have the right of the firstborn, God is not obliged to commit Himself to you in any way, nor will He; He has got His Man. And so we have presented here in the four gospels that which, as received into the souls of God's people on the principle of appreciation and adoration, and blended, becomes a vessel which God can anoint.
In Matthew we have the divine thought in government presented in Christ; in Mark we have set forth in Him the divine thought in prophetic service; in Luke in Christ as anointed, it is the vessel for the presentation of grace to man; and in John the Son is presented -- One great enough in His own Person, being the Son, to reveal God, and to make the love of God known in this world. Now all these facts were known to God in anointing Christ at His baptism, but these women (as I may speak of them, although in three of the gospels it may be only one, but I speak of them as three, inasmuch as there are no names given except in John) these women came to conceive of these divine thoughts as presented in the ministry of Christ. What God knew divinely, they learnt to discover in their measure by experience, by coming into the benefit and under the influence of the ministry of Christ; so that the woman who anointed the Lord in Matthew virtually says, He is the One to govern.
No one can be in his place in the house of God, according to God, without a right conception of government, and that conception can only be seen
{87}
in Christ; we have to learn it in Him. And as we learn it in Matthew, all other claimants to the place of rule are dismissed from our minds; not that we do not observe the indirect government of God at the present time in this world, we are thankful for those in authority, and we pray for them as we are enjoined; but they do not correspond with our ideal. As having come under the influence of Christ, having become, as Paul says, "legitimately subject to Christ", @1 Corinthians 9:21 we say in effect, There is no other ruler; the government is on His shoulder, He alone is fit to exercise it, and we anoint Him. Our ideal is there; we are in agreement with God -- He has anointed the King, and we have come under His rule. He has taught us to judge ourselves, to rule our own spirits, and no one can rule in the house of God who cannot rule his own spirit. The one who rules his own spirit is greater than he, it says, who takes a city; and no one can do that who has not come under the rule of Christ, who has not taken His yoke upon him and learned from Him. As thus taught, we have our conception of rule, and we express it as this woman did; she anointed Him on the head. With divine intelligence she recognised His official glory -- God's King.
And so with Mark -- you will understand that I do not at all purpose to make comparisons of these records, interesting as that is -- Mark records what is almost identical with Matthew; he says of the woman, however, "she hath done what she could". What a suggestion there is in that! You may say, I am not called to serve; you may have in your mind that the service of God rests with a few who are specially gifted; but the statement that the Lord makes of this woman should come home to everyone, old and young. "She has done what she could". How about that, dear brethren? How many things there are that we *can* do, and we leave them undone!
{88}
It is a question of what you *can* do, for God is not an "austere man", @Luke 19:21. He does not expect nor exact beyond our ability; as He says elsewhere, "What thy hand finds to do, do it with thy might". @Ecclesiastes 9:10. And I need not remind you of how much there is to be done. But what this woman did had direct reference to Christ, and it expressed her appreciation of the divine Servant; it expressed her conception of the service of God rightly rendered; as recorded in the earlier part of Mark, "He hath done all things well". @Mark 7:37 That was her conception.
Now in Luke, the woman that was a sinner of the city is a fit person, as forgiven by Christ, to anoint Him. She knew, we are told, that He was in Simon the Pharisee's house -- an uncongenial place, a house as cold and frigid spiritually as the polar regions; and yet she went in there, for she knew He was there. She had a conception in her soul of what He presented. Those beautiful feet had brought to her the grace of God. We cannot, beloved brethren, be in the house of God rightly, unless we have a sense of that grace in our souls -- the grace of God rightly presented to us. The Lord says, "Seest thou this woman?" He calls attention to her. He deigns to do so, even to the cold Pharisee. He says, You did not anoint my head, you gave me no water to wash my feet, but she has washed my feet with her tears, wiped them with her hair, and has anointed them with myrrh. She represents, as I said, that element in the house of God which indeed is to give character to the dispensation, and that is, the grace of God. It is a wonderful thing, dear brethren, to be imbued in our souls with the sense of the grace of God, as come to us in that precious Man whose feet had carried Him to her; whose feet had carried the grace to her and to us. Paul says, in writing to Titus, even in regard to slaves, to "adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour", for it says, "the grace of God,
{89}
which carries with it salvation for all men hath appeared". @Titus 2:10,11 Even a slave, as I remarked, is regarded as in a position to adorn that by his behaviour. But how could he do it, save as having a conception of it in his soul as presented in Christ?
And so in John 12 we have again anointing on the feet. It is not now appreciation of Him in government, or in service, or even in grace, although one cannot eliminate these, but the point is that He *loved* Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. It is a question, dear brethren, of love. "Hereby we have known love". @1 John 3:16 Mary had come to know love. It is not said of her, as was said of the woman in Luke, that she loved much; it is rather that *Christ loved her*. Divine love had come to her in the Son of God. He was on the way to give a full expression of it to God, and to man, and indeed to the whole universe. He was on the way; there were six days yet ahead of Him. But she expressed her conception of what was there; a murderous condition existed outside, but she had the box. Through His frequent visits to Bethany, He had proved to her the depths of the love that was in His heart, for God Himself had come down. With John it is "God so loved"; it is the revelation of Himself, and that by One who as we are told is in the bosom of the Father. Think of being visited, dear brethren, and that frequently, and in the most intimate way, by One who is in the bosom of the Father. Think of the infinite springs of affection that were present on the occasions of these visits. We are not told, as I said, as to her love earlier, but we are told that Jesus loved her; He loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. He had been at the tomb, where Lazarus lay in death; He had groaned at that tomb; He had wept at that tomb; He had called Lazarus by name out of it, and now He is in that circle, what we may call a circle of glory, for it is the circle where the light of the glory of the
{90}
Son of God has shone -- the love of God come near. The power of God had come near in raising Lazarus, and now the One in whom all this is resident is in the house, and Mary is equal to the occasion; she knows love. It is a wonderful thing, beloved brethren, to know love. "Hereby", says John, "we have known love, because he has laid down his life for us, and we ought for the brethren to lay down our lives". @1 John 3:16 It is the crowning feature, as I may say, in the whole blend of the assembly.
Now when the apostle wrote to the Corinthians they were very undignified, for they were allowing man in the flesh. They were allowing their Sauls, whom God had rejected; men of parts, maybe men of means, men of local Corinthian importance were obtaining recognition amongst them on account of these things. They were correspondingly undignified; they were out of accord with this wonderful blend of which I have spoken. And so the apostle brings in, not what existed amongst them, but what existed elsewhere. He refers to the human body, and he says by way of comparison, even as it has many members, so also is the Christ. He does, I admit, say later on that "Ye are Christ's body", @1 Corinthians 12:27 but it was characteristic and not absolute. Here we have "the Christ" -- the most dignified body of persons ever known on the earth. The patriarchs had been anointed, as I said; Aaron had been anointed as priest, David as king, and Elisha as prophet; but there never had been a body of persons linked up, from all nations, Jews and Gentiles, as he says, into one body. For "in the power of one Spirit", he says, "we have all been baptised (not *ye* all, but *we* all) into one body". It is really an Ephesian company of brethren that he is referring to, not a Corinthian company. It is a company such as the epistle to the Ephesians contemplates -- Jews and Greeks, who had all been baptised in the power of one Spirit into one
{91}
body. I understand by that that there has been a merging; our wills being gone and replaced by the will of God by the Spirit, we are merged, as in the appreciation, as I said, of Christ presented in the gospels. Our several relative importances disappear.
In the power of one Spirit we are merged in the baptism into one body. A wonderful achievement of God; He has done it by the Spirit. He has reconciled both, we are told, in one body to God by the cross. The cross and the world are always contrary. The Corinthian company needed the ministry of the cross, hence he could not speak of them as "the Christ". Therefore it is, as I said, an Ephesian company that is in view. They had been reconciled to God by the cross in one body, and had access jointly by one Spirit to the Father; they had been baptised in the power of one Spirit; their nationality, their several national proclivities had disappeared. We are "fitted together", @Ephesians 4:16 as we read in Ephesians, and through the ministry of the gifts, the edifying of the body of Christ goes on, "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ; in order that we may be no longer babes, tossed and carried about by every wind of that teaching ... ..but holding the truth in love". @Ephesians 4:13,14. The joints and bands working, the body edifies itself. Think of the wonderful achievement of God through the death of Christ, bringing in a company merged in this way, in the power of one Spirit!
And further the apostle says, "and have all been given to drink of one Spirit". @1 Corinthians 12:13 May I not suggest, dear brethren, that these women, of whom we have spoken, had drunk into one spirit, not indeed the Holy Spirit, but into the wonderful spirit of the gospels. Let us learn to drink into that too. I do not say that is what is referred to here; this is the Holy Spirit. And then we have an explanation of
{92}
"the Christ", how it is that there is a company here marked off by the qualities of Christ in this fourfold way, as indwelt by the Spirit, which is dignified by the anointing of God to be the vessel of testimony in this world.
Now all that I have said, dear brethren, is that we might come into this. It is not intended to pretend to any public evidence, but to come into the light of the mind of God, how that He requires spiritual dignity. The house of God is no place for our wits; there is no dignity in human wit. What we need in this respect is the anointing, not that which is put upon us, but that which dwells *in* us; 1 John 2. It makes up for all that which the world relies on, even the religious world. The religious world of the day relies upon human wit, human ability. We are independent of these in the anointing that dwells in us. "Ye have not need", it says, "that anyone should teach you", @1 John 2:27 meaning a cultured man. To the man who has got the Spirit, worldly culture is of no value; it is of no value in the house of God; it is, to say the least, undignified; it is out of keeping with the anointing. Think of the power of the Spirit of God in a man! What impetus it gives to his renewed mind, what impetus to his affections, to his feelings, to his sentiments, and to his ministry!
We are independent, dear brethren, of cultivated flesh; let us beware of it -- of relying partly on the Spirit and partly on the cultivation of flesh; the latter is a dangerous, insidious snare among the people of God. God would have us to recognise the anointing; it is a reality. He has not left us here without support. We have in the Spirit -- the anointing -- the means of knowing everything; it is a question of applying ourselves, in dependence on God, in the recognition of the Spirit, to get the mind of God. It is an immense thing to have the anointing. "Ye need not that any *man* should teach you". @1 John 2:27 If
{93}
we recognise man, we shall soon find the end of the Christ, "Christ shall profit you nothing". @Galatians 2:2 "Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ". @Galatians 2:4 Hence the importance, beloved, of recognising the anointing, that heavenly power that is come down, by which we know all things. Someone would say, Then we do not need gift? Gift is included in that -- the anointing includes the gifts. They are all come down from Christ in heaven -- from Him who has ascended up -- so as to render the assembly independent of man and of cultured flesh.
So dear brethren, what I had in mind in calling attention to all this is not to lead to any pretentious thing like a public anointed vessel now; but what I wish to have before us is the light as to the mind of God. You say, But things have changed; you cannot have the same dignity. God has not changed, He has not lowered His standard! When Elijah says to God at Horeb, I have come here to resign my commission, it is hopeless to continue service, "They have thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left". @1 Kings 19:14. God says, "I have reserved to myself seven thousand". @1 Kings 19:18. He says, Elijah, if you have given up, I have not; and moreover, I intend to carry on my service in the original dignity in which I began it; go and anoint Hazael king over Syria, and Jehu king over Israel, and anoint Elisha to be prophet in thy stead. Note the word 'anoint'. It is God asserting His right to dignity. No lowering of the standard; a day of small things does not change God, He remains what He ever was. "The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt and my Spirit", He says, "remaineth among you", @Haggai 2:5. God asserts His dignity and what is due to Him, and so if we cannot serve with dignity it is better not to serve. And so in regard to rule; better not attempt it unless you can rule in a dignified way. But we
{94}
learn by ruling ourselves, and then by ruling ourselves we are qualified to rule in the house of God. So with grace, and so with love, for it is not love in word, but in deed and in truth. As Paul says, "Yet show I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence". @1 Corinthians 12:31. That is within our reach; all these things, dear brethren, are within our reach, and God would have them in us, in the dignity, in measure, in which they shone in Christ.
{95}
GOD'S RIGHTS IN GOVERNMENT AND SERVICE
@Matthew 28; @Mark 16
J.T. It was on my mind, as the Lord might help us, to see how matters stood at the beginning, for the gospels were obviously written to confirm what the apostles had witnessed to, introduced and established. There are four features, among others of course, which characterise the revelation and intervention of God in Christ. They are: His rights in government, His rights in service, His rights in grace, and His rights in love. If these four features were understood, it would enable us to be here at the end according to the mind of God. Matthew, giving us the rights of God in government, ends his narrative with the Lord's commission to the eleven to make disciples of all nations, that is, the nations viewed as the political divisions of the earth. Mark records that they were commissioned to preach "to all the creation". Luke also mentions the nations, but obviously his gospel has in view the race of mankind, not so much the political divisions; he presents the "one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus". @1 Timothy 2:5 And then John has in view the testimony to the world.
R.B. In what way do the rights of God in government affect the present aspect of the testimony here?
J.T. Well, the recognition of these would enable us to see that the happenings among the nations are under divine control, and can but further the testimony. No one can serve in the gospel in the sense of security without a knowledge of God in government.
{96}
J.S. Is that why Matthew begins with the King, the son of David?
J.T. Yes.
J.S. And also why the administrative vessel comes in in Matthew?
J.T. Well, yes; the assembly.
A.M.H. Would you view all the political divisions on the earth as coming under the hand of Christ in the sense of all power given to Him?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth".
A.M.H. Would you connect Matthew in any way with the Ephesian thought of the assembly as the vessel of administration here, how she influences, and would you look to Ephesians for that to be developed?
J.T. I think what we need perhaps to cultivate is a little more elevation of thought. Ephesians furnishes us with that in a supreme degree. The Lord is said to have "ascended up above all the heavens", @Ephesians 4:10 and thence He has given the gifts -- the evidence of His power. If we think of the temple porch, which was one hundred and twenty cubits high, we see that the elevation dominated the other dimensions. In order to understand the vessel in which the government is set here, we have to apprehend it as having come down. We have to take account of the elevated place it has been given, otherwise in our service we shall not rise above the level of ordinary Christendom around us, which is, alas, what often marks us -- we are on the level of men. It is right to be on the level of men if we seek them individually (@1 Corinthians 9:19 - 22), but not in our ordinary walk and testimony.
P.L. Would that go with the thought, "Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven"? @1 Peter 3:22
J.T. That is it, "Gone into heaven". In Luke the Lord comes down (@Luke 6:17); the principle is
{97}
you come down. He spent all night in prayer, appointed the twelve, and then descended with them and stood in the plain in grace.
Ques. Why do you go to the end of the gospels for the point of view?
J.T. Because we want to see how the truth works out, and that is what we get in the end of the gospels. Hence Matthew speaks of one angel whose countenance is as lightning, and he refers to the Lord in Galilee maintaining the dignity that belongs to royalty -- He maintains distance -- and there is no reference to Jerusalem; that was governmental. We have to see how God deals with men governmentally, and then how He deals with them in grace. Luke in chapter @Luke 24:47, begins at Jerusalem, because he gives the side of grace, but Matthew ignores Jerusalem and shows us the Lord in Galilee commissioning His disciples there, saying that all power is given unto Him. Power is no longer vested in Jerusalem; it is vested in Him; and the apostles are to make disciples of all the nations from Galilee. Thus we see how God works governmentally among the nations today.
A.H. W. Does the repeated reference to the mountain in Matthew give the thought of elevation?
J.T. It does.
C.H.W. Is that what is in your mind, that movement begins from heaven in Matthew?
J.T. Yes; the gospel begins with what is seen in heaven. The wise men in the east saw His star; the movement was in heaven. If I am in the light of the government of God, then I see that He discriminates; some nations are much more favoured than others. That is what Matthew teaches.
A.M.H. Do you mean then by government that God follows certain lines suitable to His government, notwithstanding the introduction of the day of grace?
J.T. Quite. An Asiatic is a man as much as a European, but nevertheless in the light of the government
{98}
of God one sees that Europe has been much more favoured than Asia. On the other hand, if you are in the light of what Luke presents, one God and one Mediator, you are prepared to speak of Christ to every man and reckon on God to help you in it. Hence you pray for the governments of the world, because you see that God works through them for the furtherance of the testimony.
Ques. Then do you link the whole together in 1 Timothy? You pray for governments, and then, too, for all men.
J.T. Yes; he brings down the governors, those in authority, and merges them all in one class. God will have all men to be saved; so that you reckon on the angel relatively as you reckon on the Spirit of God. It were folly to ignore the angel, for angels are sent out to minister "on account of those who shall inherit salvation"; @Hebrews 1:14 their service is on account of us. Whatever that service may be, it is on account of us.
P.L. But the angel descends out of heaven, does he not?
J.T. He does. I think it is very important to take note of that, that the angel is here. He has come down from heaven, and he is here on account of us. "Are they not all ministering spirits [every one of them] sent out for service?" @Hebrews 1:14 *Sent* out -- they are all under commission.
A.H.W. Are you suggesting that they are here in support of the testimony?
J.T. They are here on account of us, and on account of the testimony, but they are "sent out".
Ques. Do you bring in the angel in connection with the government of God?
J.T. Yes, and all is in view of the saints.
Ques. Do the angels serve in a circumstantial way?
J.T. Well, they are providential, as we speak, but they are actually here in service, under commission.
{99}
They are here in their relative place as the Holy Spirit is here, hence you get this one angel sitting on the stone, his countenance as lightning.
W.C.G. Is your thought that the saints get the advantage of the providential happenings of God in that way?
J.T. Certainly. Angels are all under Christ, all subject to Christ (@1 Peter 3:22), but sent out. So you get both the angel and the Spirit acting in connection with the Ethiopian eunuch. Angelic service had much to do with the subdivisions of the earth, but now the angel is interested in the eunuch, in this man going down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
H.F.N. What is the connection in the last chapter of Revelation, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies"? @Revelation 22:16 How would that link on with what you are saying?
J.T. The Revelation contemplates distance, which the failure of the assembly has occasioned, so that the Lord is dealing through a representative. It is, so to say, indirect. I think that there the angel is a representative of the Lord. The Roman seal had been put on the stone of the sepulchre, and it was as if God were to say, "One angel is enough to deal with that".
R.B. Then what do the myriads of angels refer to?
J.T. The universal gathering. It is a reference, I understand, to the states of Greece, as you might say, the Congress. The angels, I suppose, would have been widely dispersed in their service, but they are seen together-the universal gathering. We have come to that; we see the myriads of angels, occupied as they have been in the government of God, a united company, witnessing to the foundations of the earth being laid, and following sympathetically since that time all the movements of God. We may be assured they represent an enormous company.
{100}
They represent wonderful wisdom and above all they represent subjection to the will of God (@Psalm 103:20); not like a modern parliament, where every man has his own opinion, but all in subjection to God. We have come to that. Manna was the food of the mighty, "angels¬ food". The universal gathering of angels is of wonderful interest to those who know God.
R.B. You mean the object lesson would be a great help in government?
J.T. Well, quite; and it would help us too in our comings together -- a company who know God and are in subjection to God seen together. We read in the book of Job, which affords considerable insight into angelic feelings, "The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy". @Job 38:7 There we get an insight into their affections and feelings, and their interest in what God is doing. Then there was a time, too, when the sons of God came up before God.
J.S. You mean we should learn from that?
J.T. Yes; we have come to that. It is a great thing to learn subjection.
Ques. What is the thought in Matthew 18, where it says, "See that ye do not despise one of these little ones; for I say unto you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens"? @Matthew 18:10
J.T. It is representation.
Ques. You have spoken of the rights of God in love coming out in John. You get the angels there too. Why are they there?
J.T. Their presence there is to indicate the dignity of the Person. They are not there to announce the power of God against all opposition, but to denote the dignity of the Person who lay there.
E.R. Is not one important point there that they are sitting, they were not standing; they are seen.
{101}
so to speak, in divine repose? I thought that was the greatest of all in John.
J.T. "Sitting ... one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain". @John 20:12
E.R. I think sometimes we have passed that by.
J.T. The angels are available to God for His will. It is a great thing to have the sense that the government of God is running collaterally with the work of the Spirit; they go together.
P.L. Would you say that government in that way relieves of burdens externally and makes way for the assembly, while the Spirit of God would work in priestly hearts to place there the burden of the testimony? If in providence burdens are lifted, it is that we may carry burdens in a priestly way.
J.T. "Who art thou, O great mountain 1 before Zerubbabel thou dost become a plain". @Zechariah 4:7. That makes room for him to "bring forth the headstone with shoutings: Grace, grace unto it". @Zechariah 4:7. No one can serve with the sense of security who does not understand the government of God. Hence Matthew is so important.
H.F.N. Is that why in the heavenly city the twelve gates have twelve angels?
J.T. I think so; they are the agencies God has employed. We have the angels and the names of the twelve tribes all gathered up in the assembly.
J.J. Would you say that Romans is the epistle that goes with Matthew? Do you think the government of God is developed in that way? I mean, the son of Abraham and the son of David; they are both brought in?
J.T. Yes, exactly. The gospel is concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. He is come of David's seed according to flesh.
H.F.N. How does what you are speaking of bear on Matthew's peculiar presentation of the assembly?
{102}
Has Matthew in view the forming of the heavenly city?
J.T. I think you would be entitled to connect it with the heavenly city, but Matthew has more in view the government of God in this provisional period.
A.M.H. Is that in view of holding the ground that God had secured in Israel first, and afterwards when Israel and Jerusalem are set aside, in the assembly provisionally?
J.T. That is what I thought. It is a great subject, because the assembly must be very great to sustain such a government as this. Angels had it, Israel had it, and now the assembly has it. It is in the assembly as unfolded and spoken of by the Lord when He was on earth.
Ques. In that way does Acts follow Matthew administratively? The angel in Acts is very largely connected with Peter's ministry, but the Spirit more connected with Paul's.
J.T. I think that is right.
Rem. Speaking of subjection, it is wonderful to see that the Son Himself will be subject, and God will be all in all.
J.T. Perhaps our greatest need is to learn to be subject, for no one can rule unless he learns to be subject.
P.L. Does the sovereignty of God as seen in Matthew particularly, test us as to our subjection to Him?
J.T. Yes; God asserts His rights in government. In Matthew the Lord says, "*I* say unto you". You have to submit to *that*.
Ques. Why is it that the Spirit of Jesus did not suffer Paul to go into Bithynia? Was that in line with Matthew?
J.T. I think that has more the antichrist in view; I think the antichrist was to arise in Europe,
{103}
and the Spirit of Jesus would have the full testimony of Jesus presented there. "The spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus". @Revelation 19:10 That spirit has been tested in Europe prominently because Paul's ministry was largely developed there. The Spirit of Jesus would have him go there; and the antichrist appears in opposition to that. We see the development now.
Ques. It is recorded of Stephen that his face shone as the face of an angel. What is the idea in that?
J.T. The heavenly thought is reflected in him.
J.J. You were saying that the assembly has this government now, and yet the assembly does not govern. What would you say about that?
J.T. The assembly has it in the way of testimony -- the direct government of God. There is also the indirect government of God which is providential, through angelic ministry. We have nothing to do with the governments of this world save praying for them, but the direct government of God is in the assembly.
J.J. That is for testimony.
J.T. It is for testimony. The only part we have in the indirect government of God is we see God is in it through angelic ministry and we pray for kings in that light, but we do not deal with it directly at all. We should seek, however, to maintain the government of God within the circle of the saints; that is, where God governs directly; He is greatly to be feared in the assembly of His saints. There is a court of appeal which the saints can take up.
F.W.J. There is no delegated government in the assembly.
J.T. I think it is direct.
F.W.J. Would it be by the Spirit?
J.T. Quite. The Holy Spirit maintains the rights of God in the assembly; the conditions at Antioch would develop this. In Acts 11 we are told that Barnabas and Saul had ministered for a whole year
{104}
in the assembly at Antioch, and the disciples were first called Christians there; there was complete identification with Christ. And then it says, "Now in these days prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch; and one from among them, by name Agabus, rose up and signified by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine over all the inhabited earth, which also came to pass under Claudius". @Acts 11:27,28. Now that is governmental action. The dearth is not an action of the Spirit; it is a governmental action and it was intended to promote assembly or house conditions, which it did, so that those that were "well off" at Antioch determined they would send to the saints at Jerusalem, and they did so by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. So we see that the governmental action of God served to promote the direct action of the Spirit amongst the saints, that is, it drew out the sympathies of the saints at Antioch for those in Judaea. In result it bound up the Jew and Gentile together in a practical way, and therefore in chapter 13 the Holy Spirit is free to speak to the assembly. He says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". @Acts 13:2 He is here personally to maintain the government and the service of God in this world, so that He asserts His rights. Levitical service is not carried on by angels but by the Spirit. It is a wonderful thing to see the direct government of God in the presence of the Spirit here in the Christian company.
Ques. That is bound up with the development of affection, is it not?
J.T. My thought was that we should not be on the level of ordinary Christendom, of the current accredited religions in the world. The temple was twenty cubits wide, sixty cubits long, but the porch was one hundred and twenty cubits high, and that maintains the *elevated* thought that was to give character to all. Looking at that structure one
{105}
would be impressed with its wonderful elevation. As to its position, it was "beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth", @Psalm 48:2 but think of the elevation of it as crowning mount Moriah!
R.B. Will not the sense of elevation give the saints the qualification to judge angels?
J.T. I think so. We have to see that Christ has gone above all the heavens, and that we are linked up with Him.
Ques. Is that elevation suggested in Saul's conversion?
J.T. Well, there was a light from heaven and a voice from heaven, and these had their effect upon Saul; he was to be the vessel for the forming of the assembly in its heavenly character; so that the calling of the vessel would give fitness for the service; he was to serve in that exalted way. He speaks of Jerusalem *above*.
A.M.H. So your thought is that all this would preserve us from diplomacy -- the human way of handling things. You have been speaking of administration on the line of carrying out divine principles amongst ourselves, but is there not something further suggested in Ephesians, where the influence of what is heavenly is felt in regard of movement here?
J.T. I am sure that is so. I have been interested in the way in which Luke would bring in the heavenly -- that which is elevated. The angel says to Mary, "The power of the *Highest* shall overshadow thee"; @Luke 1:35 not the power of God, but the power of the Highest; and then in chapter 2 it says, "Glory to God in the *highest*". @Luke 2:14. And again in chapter 10, "Rejoice, because your names are written in *heaven*" @Luke 10:20 and in chapter 19, "I Glory in the *highest*". @Luke 19:38 Then in Acts, which is the counterpart of Luke, it is what is coming out of heaven that is in view, hence, "This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into
{106}
heaven". @Acts 1:11 Then we have a light from heaven, and a voice from heaven in chapter 9, and a sheet let down from heaven in chapter 10. It is what comes out from heaven, and all that enters into the truth of the house, the vessel of testimony here, and must necessarily lend a wonderful dignity to it.
P.L. Then there is power from on high in the end of Luke.
J.J. The Lord is definitely seen on an elevated position in Matthew, @Matthew 5:1; @Matthew 28:16.
J.T. Quite.
F.W.J. What are the extraordinary occurrences you were speaking of?
J.T. Well, what has happened in our own times; the war, for example, which has become a means of drawing together the people of God. It has become a means of lifting saints who were sunk in national feelings out of such things, and leading them to discern that their brethren in other nations love them. This shows the importance of understanding the government of God; we see how it helps in our service.
F.W.J. Would the government of God in the assembly be purely moral government, and the government of God outside more what is external?
J.T. I think, as I said, what goes on outside is indirect. If it were direct, God would have to deal with things and set them aside, but He is dealing with them indirectly without committing Himself. He does commit Himself, however, to what is in the assembly, because the Holy Spirit is here; hence in the Acts when a man and woman come and lie to the Spirit they are impugning God. They might have gone to the Sanhedrim or to the emperor and done so and nothing might have happened, but they lie to the Spirit; that is, Satan is endeavouring to set aside the direct government of God in the assembly,
{107}
and God would not have it. So Ananias and Sapphira were smitten.
J.J. Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego would not bow to the external authority and they get deliverance.
J.T. The Son of God joins them and that changes the whole position.
Ques. Do you attach importance to the way the Lord meets the disciples in Matthew and changes the message of the angel, saying, "my brethren", instead of "his disciples", in view of the direct government of God in the assembly?
J.T. Well, quite. He meets them not in the same intimate way that you get in John, but more as a king would meet his parliament. Word is *sent to them* to go to Galilee and meet Him *there*. They go and they worship Him, and He says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations".
P.L. Do you see the principle in the scattering of the Jews from Rome under the emperor's decree? Aquila and Priscilla are brought down to Corinth in result.
J.T. And you get it in Jerusalem at the persecution after Stephen's death, when all were scattered; the gospel was announced by those who were scattered.
P.L. We get it also with the Lord Himself in connection with the Roman census when Joseph and Mary went up to Bethlehem.
J.J. In Matthew the nations maintain their distinctive character, do they not?
J.T. I think you have there the political divisions of the world, and God takes account of them. "Baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". They were to be baptised into the full light of God revealed in the three Persons.
{108}
Ques. How would you view the Spirit of God in relation to the rights of God in service?
J.T. God has a right in service, and surely nothing could be more touching than that He should take up that attitude. Mark begins with the "gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God"; @Mark 1:1 the Son has come in in service, and what comes out in the last chapter is, instead of an angel with a countenance like lightning we see a young man clothed in a white robe, and the gospel is to be announced to all the creation.
F.W.P. How do you distinguish between the nations and the whole creation?
J.T. The more we know God the more we see that He could omit nothing. If He has come in in service to bring the knowledge of Himself to men, He omits nothing. Even a sparrow does not fall without Him. So that the gospel was to be announced to all the creation, and Paul says, speaking of the glad tidings, "which have been proclaimed in the whole creation", @Colossians 1:23.
F.W.P. That would go beyond the intelligent creation?
J.T. I think so. Your very beast is affected if you become a Christian; you know how to use the creatures of God. "The whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now". @Romans 8:22 "For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God". @Romans 8:19 I suppose that the creation will come in in that way, as it does in principle mediately. The sons of God would not rest without everything being in accord with God. The more you understand sonship, the more you are sympathetic with God.
Rem. The wild beasts are in the wilderness in Mark.
J.T. The whole creation is in the mind of God. He has not created anything for nothing; He created things for a purpose and for His glory: "For thy
{109}
pleasure they are and were created". @Revelation 4:11 I only refer to it because it enters so much into the purpose of God. Then Luke has men, the whole race in view, and the remarkable thing is that when you have the three branches of the race set together in order, the African is placed first, that is the eunuch, then the Asiatic in Saul, and the European, or Japhethite, in Cornelius. That is how God looks at things; He reverses the order of history. The black man comes first because God would show that it is men that He has in mind, and He does not take man's way of looking at them.
R.B. Then Luke would encourage you to evangelise the Africans?
J.T. Exactly. Having the knowledge of the government of God, you may discriminate. You know that the African has not been of special value in the house of God, but at the same time he is a man and so an object of the grace of God.
Rem. It shows how necessary it is to have the truth of Matthew before we are ready to consider the truth of Mark and Luke.
J.T. I think so. The young man in white is Mark's ideal of service. You have the energy of youth and the purity which should go with the service of God. The great thing in service is what one's motives are. How easily our motives may be mixed. We are to have no double or personal motives. As Paul says, "We preach ... Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus¬ sake". @2 Corinthians 4:5 He had only one thing in view, that is, to serve the saints and to present Christ the Lord.
J.J. Is that why we know less of Matthew and Mark than we do of Luke and John?
J.T. I dare say it is. I think that perhaps we have not made sufficient allowance for the government of God and the advantage which accrues to us from it on the one hand, and then from the peculiar
{110}
kind of service which emanates from God Himself on the other. "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God". @Mark 1:1 The Son has taken on the service and God comes in, in that way, in the Son to serve, so that everything is done perfectly. He serves in the same skill and wisdom as He made the world, and even in greater skill and wisdom than was seen in the making of the world.
T.R. In Luke and John we have all the sweet savour offerings, but no forsaking.
J.T. The man in the flesh is dealt with unsparingly in the forsaking of Christ in Matthew and Mark.
Ques. What about the transfiguration?
J.T. Purity is seen in the *whiteness* in Mark's account. I think the young man is the ideal. God takes up young men. They may have grown old in service, but God takes up men when they are young and the point is to be pure in your motives in taking up service. You do not wish to become anything in the eyes of men; you simply want to serve; as the Lord Himself said, "I am among you as he that serveth". @Luke 22:27. So that God came in in service -- a wonderful fact for us -- He had a right to do that, and He shows the way; hence the young man at the tomb is clothed in the white robe. Earlier he had just a piece of linen cast about his naked body, which was snatched away from him and he was left exposed, but now he is clothed in a *white robe*.
Ques. Does the Lord take account of their under- standing in connection with service? "How is it that ye do not understand?" @Mark 8:21.
J.T. You find in the end of Mark the Lord upbraids them with their unbelief; there is more emphasis there on the unbelief of the disciples than in the other gospels. We must believe if we are to be effective in service. The principle is, "I have believed, therefore have I spoken", @Psalm 116:10.
{111}
You must believe things, otherwise you become a mere clergyman giving out things for a salary: "He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be condemned". So He joins the eleven disciples while they sat at meat, and He upbraids them with their unbelief and hardness of heart.
J.J. What is the difference between the Lord remaining in Matthew and going up in Mark? Does that illustrate the two points of government and service?
J.T. I think as remaining with us He supports us in the government. The government is said to be on His shoulder. It is not a simple thing to undertake government, so in Matthew 18 it says, "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them". @Matthew 18:20 The maintaining of government is in view in that sense. He is with us always. So at the care meetings, where we come together to consider the interests of the Lord connected with the saints, I think the Lord is specially there to maintain government.
A.M.H. Will you say a little more as to the thought of the rights of God in service?
J.T. He came in in Himself to serve. The gospels show how the Lord came in. "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, Son of God"; @Mark 1:1 not son of David. He came in immediately from God as Son. The Son serves; so that He carries out divine service before God here on man's behalf. God had a right to do that. He had a right to come in in that way, and it is very touching that He did come in in that way. The subject is taken up in Isaiah 42; "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth". @Isaiah 42:1 Then it is not only what you preach or teach, but *how* the thing is done, the purity, particularly the purity of motive, as in the white
{112}
robe; that one is characterised all around by purity, so that the servant is to keep himself pure. One has really more need to look after oneself than to look after others.
P.L. Is the evidence of purity seen in the expression, "profitable to me for the ministry"? @2 Timothy 4:11.
J.T. Quite; Mark now had the "white robe".
{113}
GOD'S RIGHTS IN GRACE AND LOVE
@Matthew 16
J.T. I thought we might proceed with the chapter in Matthew and perhaps touch a little on Luke and John, linking it all up together. What we have had can easily be linked up with the teaching of this chapter, for all must converge on the assembly; the different features of the gospels must necessarily converge there. We might touch on Luke and John.
God coming in in His rights in grace in Luke has all men in view. The preaching was to begin at Jerusalem, but to extend to all. In His rights in government as set forth in Matthew's gospel, He did not begin at Jerusalem, He began in Galilee. What we may not do in government we may do in grace, so the Lord directed that the preaching should begin at Jerusalem, but that the apostles should wait the promise of the Spirit from the Father; then the Lord is parted from them as He is blessing them and is carried up into heaven, and they worship; Him and return to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. That is, they are there in the full sense of grace. It was God's right to take up that attitude towards the guilty city.
A.M.H. Would you say in that way that grace is operative now in Luke to deliver individuals from the governmental position? In Acts 2 we read, "The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved". @Acts 2:47 I suppose, saved from that position?
J.T. Yes. God had a right to intervene in grace, so that as Jonathan sent the lad back into the city with his weapons, "David arose", it says, "from the side of the *south*" (@1 Samuel 20:41); that is, that notwithstanding the actual wickedness in the city
{114}
and in the house of Saul, the attitude was favourable. It was not merited, far from it, but God had a right to resort to grace, which He did. "David arose from the side of the south" suggests that things were favourable. In Luke 24 the divine attitude is seen as favourable in the disciples going back into the city and being there in the temple, full of joy, praising and blessing God. There was thus a testimony present in the city, and any who came into the temple could profit by it. And so, later on, after the incident recorded, David said, "Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God to him?" @2 Samuel 9:3 That is the attitude of grace.
A.M.H. Is your thought that we should take account of governmental dealings?
J.T. That was my thought. It greatly helps in the service of God to take account of His governmental ways; they cannot be altered. It is beautiful to see how David refused to touch Saul when he hunted him like a partridge on the mountains. He knew that Saul would die somehow, that God's hand would reach him, but *his* hand would not be upon him. I believe the Lord would teach us in that way how to be gracious and take account of those who may be under the governmental dealings of God. We cannot alter them; God's rights in government cannot be altered, but at the same time they are compatible with His rights in grace and His rights in service, so that David refuses to touch Saul and is enabled to pay a wonderful tribute to him and to Jonathan after they fell on mount Gilboa. In like manner we are enabled to take account of those who may be under the government of God, and to maintain an attitude of grace towards them. We have a right to -- God has given us the right to act in grace.
Ques. Is that contemplated in the first seven chapters of Acts?
{115}
J.T. Yes, up till the rejection of Stephen the southern aspect is maintained. "David arose from the side of the south". @1 Samuel 20:41 God maintains it until Stephen is rejected, and it is maintained in principle throughout Paul's ministry.
Ques. Would the rejection of Stephen be the sin against the Holy Spirit?
J.T. It was, but the spirit of grace pursues the Jew in Paul's ministry right to the end, even at Rome. Then there are, too, the rights of God in love, which is the most wonderful thing of all. "God so loved the world". @John 3:16 We have come to the Son revealing the Father, to the Father giving the Son, and the saints -- the disciples -- receiving from the Lord His breath, "He breathed into them". @John 20:22. And it is no longer a question of government, or grace exactly, or service, but of Persons -- "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you" @John 20:21 -- the Father sent the Son and there are those sent out as the Son was sent out, that is, sent out in love. That is the most wonderful position of all, to be in this world actuated by love.
T.R. Do you regard the world as the people in it?
J.T. It is the world as God made it, I think. He made it and ornamented it; it is wonderfully made. "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God", @Hebrews 11:3 but then there is one world we have to do with in which man was set, and God thinks of that. It would be of little account without man in it. But it is wonderfully ornamented, made in divine wisdom, and God has that world before Him.
T.R. Will the result of it be seen in the future day when everything is brought under the influence of divine love?
J.T. Yes; there is not a mountain, or a hill, or a lake, or a river that God does not take account of. All is there in divine skill, and He set man up in that scene. He will have that; He will have the world.
A.M.H. You mean the world in the sense of an
{116}
ordered system of things; it is "all men" in Luke, but it is having men in relation to an ordered system of things, I suppose, in John.
J.T. That is it, an ordered system of things in which He has set man.
A.M.H. He has set His heart on that, and His affections are bound up with it.
J.T. Quite.
T.R. So it is the same world; it is not another world, but new conditions are brought in.
J.T. Quite, entirely new conditions. God never gives up a thought. If He has formed the world and set man up in it, He has not relinquished that thought; He is going to revert to it.
A.M.H. When He says, "Now is the judgment of this world", @John 12:31 that is the ordered condition of things in the state to which it had fallen.
J.T. That is it. Sin had brought that about, but we cannot conceive for a moment that God will relinquish His thought as to the world. God unfolded the pattern of it to Moses on the mount, and He has never given that up. Compare @Hebrews 9:1 - 5.
Ques. Is that the thought reached at the end of the Psalms, "everything that hath breath"? @Psalm 150:6
J.T. Quite. It would be of little account without man, because it is all one piece, the ornamented and ordered scene and man set in it.
M.W.B. Is that why love is brought in in relation to the world and grace in relation to man?
J.T. I think so. "God so loved the world". @John 3:16
Ques. Is His purpose in view then in "God so loved the world"?
J.T. I think so. He will bring about a world entirely suitable to Himself.
J.J. If you speak of the assembly in relation to this system, it cannot be from a natural standpoint.
J.T. You have to take account of the assembly on the principle of the house, as His dwelling-place.
{117}
Then it is a place of rule -- government. Matthew presents it in this connection. That is a great feature of the testimony of God, and all this that we have had before us necessarily converges on what we have in this chapter. We come here to the foundation. As we have in @2 Chronicles 3:3, in the best rendering- "This was Solomon's foundation"; that is to say, now we have arrived at the thought of the house and these things necessarily are in view, but we have got to begin with the foundation. "This was Solomon's foundation for the construction of the house of God". @2 Chronicles 3:3. You have to examine carefully the foundation because an these wonderful things are going to enter into this, and we must begin right.
R.B. Then with regard to what you were saying this afternoon as to the rights of God in love, are they preserved in the assembly by our being here with the same outlook on the world as God had?
J.T. That is it. John takes that up in his epistle. "He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him". @1 John 4:16 "We have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world". @1 John 4:14 That is love, the Father sending the Son. We have seen that and testify to it, so all these thoughts converge on the assembly because "Solomon's foundation for the construction of the house" @2 Chronicles 3:3 had in view all that preceded it, and included the light that came in in 1 Chronicles. David was shown the site of the house, and he had the pattern of it by the Spirit, and all is in view in this chapter.
M.W.B. The way you have been speaking of the world gives expansion to the thought in the way John uses the term.
J.T. John begins, "He was in the world, and the world was *made* by him". @John 1:10 There it is the creation, but what it had become morally through sin is seen in the fact that it knew Him not.
{118}
M.W.B. So you used the expression, "as God made it".
J.T. It knew Him not, because of the conditions that had come in.
P.L. So that the Son making the world would give an indication as to the conception that God had; this came out fully in the presence of His Son here?
J.T. Yes; we read of "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come". @Revelation 11:15 The world of our Lord is yet to come.
Ques. Is the thought in John 1, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world", @John 1:29 that God will have it according to His thought?
J.T. Yes, sin is to be removed from it.
T.R. The death of Christ is the foundation of it all.
J.T. If we apprehend the foundation, we are on our way to understand the structure, because it was *Solomon's* foundation. The pattern was shown to David, but Solomon is the *builder*.
J.J. You refer to Solomon as the son?
J.T. Yes; it is the *son* who builds the house.
A.H.W. Do you refer to the foundation as seen in Peter's vision in this chapter, and does Peter refuse the foundation in the death of Christ at the end of the chapter?
J.T. He did not see what was necessary to all this; he did not see that, as with David, things *had to be bought*. David paid a great price for the site of the house. We are told in Samuel that he bought it for fifty shekels of silver, but in Chronicles he gave the weight of six hundred shekels of gold. He gave it *for the place*. If one is going to build a house, plenty of room is wanted, he does not want to be limited for the want of space. David gave that amount in shekels of gold for the place. We have to
{119}
think of what the Lord Jesus paid from His own point of view. If He has got the treasure, He buys the whole field; He must secure right of way.
M.W.B. Is it on that line that the assembly is brought in in this chapter?
J.T. I think so. "The Son of man must suffer"; @Mark 8:31 that is the cost. He is going to have a free hand in the building.
Ques. Do you think it is in resurrection He builds?
J.T. He builds in resurrection. He has bought the space; it is a wide area. Ornan the Jebusite did not fix *that* price. David was acting, I judge, from his own standpoint, so that he would have the right of way there. It was what *he gave* for it.
F.W.P. Are you distinguishing between the cost and the foundation?
J.T. Oh, yes. The site was evidently of wide area. God has secured a wide area for His house through the death of Christ.
P.L. Would you say the site was bought in the death of Christ, and He builds in resurrection?
J.T. Yes; it was *Solomon's* foundation.
J.J. So the wide area would embrace all the things in the end of the chapter?
J.T. There is plenty of room for building. The site of the foundation has to be distinguished from the foundation; there was no foundation there when David bought the place.
W.C.G. "He gave himself a ransom for all"; @1 Timothy 2:6 is that the thought?
J.T. Yes. He has a free hand, having the right of redemption over all.
J.J. Does it not make it all the more interesting that it was in the place where Abraham and Isaac were that Solomon began to build, "on mount Moriah". I refer to @2 Chronicles 3:1.
J.T. It was to "the *land* of Moriah" @Genesis 22:2 that Abraham
{120}
was directed to go, referring to the mount being *shown*. "One of the mountains which I will tell thee of" (@Genesis 22:2); and so David was *shown* the site (@1 Chronicles 21).
T.R. As regards David, looking at him not now as a figure of Christ in buying the site, he moves on in great enlargement from that time forward.
J.T. He prepares a quantity of iron for nails among the other necessary things for the house. Things are to be held *securely*. That is in resurrection. The nails are in resurrection and are very important in the building.
M.W.B. How would you apply that?
J.T. Well, I think they refer to the security in which things are set up in resurrection; they are beyond the reach of the ravages of time and Satan's power. "On this rock I will build my assembly, and hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it". @Matthew 16:18.
Ques. Like the "nail in a sure place" @Isaiah 22:23?
J.T. Just so.
F.W.P. Will you say a little more about the foundation? I think we can understand about the cost -- what it was to the Lord to make the purchase.
J.T. What comes out in the early part of the chapter is that the Lord would deliver us from worldly religiousness -- the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees -- the two forms that religion has taken; and then the bread -- the sense that the Lord is sufficient -- comes in. These things relieve the mind; we have learnt their character, so that when we come to the *foundation*, it does not refer to what is objective. The Lord had walked on the water, cast out demons, had raised the dead and declared Himself to be the Son of God. But that is not what is referred to here. The gospel is presented on that ground. It is the "gospel of God ... concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; and declared to
{121}
be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead". @Romans 1:1 - 4. But that is not referred to here; it is a question of being *shown*; that is, we are on spiritual lines. It is not what is presented in the way of testimony, it is what is apprehended spiritually, it was a *revelation*.
T.R. David had received the pattern of things by the Spirit.
J.T. Exactly. It says, "And Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where he appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite", @2 Chronicles 3:1. That is the idea. The thing was shown, and so it is here. "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens".
T.R. Would you say that Matthew's view in regard of the kingdom of heaven would be in the main objective, but when you come to the assembly here it is more on the subjective line, what is built in?
J.T. It is that; hence we have to be prepared to be shown things -- not taught or preached to, but shown. It is a spiritual thing.
C.H.W. You mean the foundation was shown to Peter in regard to the Person of Christ, and so to every one -- the foundation is shown to all the saints.
J.T. We have to come in our spiritual apprehension into that which was revealed to Peter.
A.M.H. Would you think that coming into that apprehension indicates that the work of God is there and the kind of material comes to light?
J.T. "Thou *art* Peter", you mean? He does not open much up to Peter about it. To him the Lord says, "I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens".
Ques. One would like to get the teaching a little more clearly; we have a good deal in Matthew about the kingdom of heaven and then in this chapter the
{122}
assembly is brought in, and further on the kingdom is returned to. Why?
J.T. In chapter 18 the kingdom is taken up in connection with the assembly. In speaking to Peter here, the Lord does not open up the truth of the assembly; He just suggests the foundation and the material, because really He is thinking of Paul; "He himself knew what he would do". @John 6:6. He said to Peter in effect, Your function will be to open the kingdom to others; but in regard of what would result from that -- the wonderful development under Paul's ministry -- the Lord maintained a reserve.
Ques. Why is it brought in at all?
J.T. Because it fits in with the teaching in this gospel as it develops. The kingdom of the heavens was to work out through the assembly. In chapter 18 the assembly is to be appealed to here, it is simply brought in as corresponding with "Solomon's foundation", but we do not get the building. The Lord says, "I *will* build", and this involves Paul's ministry.
F.W.J. You get Peter here as a sample stone; he had no function in connection with the assembly.
J.T. No, not here. His commission here refers to the kingdom. In opening the door to the Gentiles he made room for Paul, who, "as a wise architect ... laid the foundation". @1 Corinthians 3:10.
F.W.J. There is no builder but Christ in connection with the structure?
J.T. Except that you or I build according to @1 Corinthians 3. We are responsible as to what we put into it.
F.W.J. That would be more doctrine, would it not?
J.T. There is what is in keeping with the foundation, which remains as part of the building; thus what we build in is included in God's building. Hence, "I will build" included Paul. It was in his ministry the truth of the assembly was opened up.
{123}
H.F.N. How do you distinguish between the foundation spoken of in 1 Corinthians 3 -- "For other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" @1 Corinthians 3:11 -- and the foundation spoken of in this chapter?
J.T. Well, I think this is Solomon's foundation; it is *Christ's* foundation in other words; that is, He is building on this. But this would include Paul's. Paul had the *order of man* in view -- Jesus Christ -- so as to shut out the man after the flesh.
H.F.N. Is there any link between the way David built and the reference in Corinthians? It is said of David that he built inwards. I wondered whether the reference in Corinthians was more to David's building and this more linked up with Solomon's building.
J.T. David did not build the house; building inwards had reference to the city. Paul said, "Other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ". @1 Corinthians 3:11 The Lord said to him at Corinth, "I have much people in this city". @Acts 18:10. If we look at men and women as they are, we have to bring in Jesus Christ, because souls have to be led to the order of man that has been tested here, and who has answered in every way to God. That is what Paul had in mind. Hence He says, "Let each see how he builds upon it". @1 Corinthians 3:10. We may all have part in that building, that is to say, in helping souls and serving in various ways, but Solomon's foundation is what we have here. In the midst of all this service, the Lord is building continuously and He is building on the sure foundation of the revelation of Himself as the Son of the living God in our souls.
H.F.N. With regard to the first reference in Scripture to building -- the building of the woman -- might I ask how you view that in relation to the thought of building?
{124}
J.T. It is very remarkable that is the first mention of building. The word is not employed in regard to the framing of the world. But He builded the woman. There is, of course, a link between Genesis 2 and this chapter, only there it is a *companion* for Christ; here it is His assembly, having administration in view. "On this rock I will build my assembly". It is not human instrumentality here, but it all works together. The assembly here has the kingdom in view.
Ques. This is outside of flesh and blood conditions?
J.T. Yes, it is outside; but @1 Corinthians 3 contemplates the conditions in which we are, and hence we must bring in the order of man that was here. The responsibility of the builders is in view.
F.W.J. You do not look at this from an individual point of view, but as exclusively the work of God?
J.T. Exactly; Christ is the Builder.
Ques. Do you connect "Jesus Christ" with the moral side, and is the "Son of God" the spiritual side?
J.T. Of course the spiritual element enters into the moral side as well, but what the Lord builds is absolutely spiritual and we arrive at it by being *shown*. Compare @2 Chronicles 3:1 and notes in New Translation. We must arrive at "Solomon's foundation".
Rem. So the Lord refers to "My Father" in that connection.
J.T. Yes, it was revelation. Already in chapter 14 He is acknowledged to be the Son of God, but that is by the miracles. This is another matter. This is one of the most difficult points in the whole of the New Testament -- to arrive at Christ's foundation.
P.W. Would you say that the Lord builds on what the Father was revealing to Peter? Does the Lord build on what the Father was doing?
{125}
J.T. Well, what was in Peter's soul the Father had placed there and the Lord discerns it at once. There is the foundation.
J.S. Would you connect the foundation with John's gospel?
J.T. It necessarily enters into it, but here it is the Father revealing to *Peter;* "to thee", as it says. In John's gospel we have the revelation of God by the Son, but here it is the Son revealed by the Father to Peter. It is not based on what came out in the Lord's service; it is entirely on what the Father made known in Peter's soul.
Ques. Is it on that account that the gates of hades cannot prevail against it?
J.T. God has reached a position that cannot be overthrown. Government is now fixed.
J.J. In Matthew the kingdom is a necessity for the assembly; I mean the kingdom exists for the sake of the assembly.
J.T. And then the assembly is the capital whence all the light radiates. Whilst government in the assembly is not arbitrary, it is right.
H.H. What do you understand by the kingdom of the heavens?
J.T. It is the rule of the heavens, and means *now* that Christ is in heaven; and things are carried on here in the assembly on His account now.
H.H. Why is there nothing said at the end of the gospel about His going up? He says, "I am with you all the days". @Matthew 28:20.
J.T. But the Father is ever referred to as there. We know Christ is with us, but the fact that it is not said He goes into heaven does not mean that He has not gone into heaven. The point is He is here to support us; it does not mean He is here personally. He is here in the way of support.
Ques. What do you mean by support?
J.T. At the care meetings is where you realise it.
{126}
I was at a meeting here once when I realised it in a very distinct way. That is the idea; He is with us for the maintenance of the government of God and the discipline of God here, and indeed for the maintenance of the testimony. But how essential if they are to go and make disciples of all the nations that He should be with them: "I am with you *alway"*.
Ques. Are you thinking of "my assembly" in the light of the four anointings you mentioned?
J.T. The Lord has "my assembly" here, and all these features necessarily converge there.
C.H.W. What is the thought underlying that expression, "my assembly"?
J.T. That *He* would have *it*; He would not have Jerusalem.
C.H.W. In a personal way, like the pearl?
J.T. It is available to Him for the maintenance of the government of God here, pending the public display of things.
W.C.G. Where would Paul help us in regard of Solomon's foundation?
J.T. In Damascus he began to speak it. "And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God". @Acts 9:20. God had revealed His Son in him. There was the basis for a new order of things.
M.W.B. You said the foundation was a subjective idea. Is it that which is laid in persons¬ souls? That work would not be going on today as the foundation, would it?
J.T. I think you come into it. The thing is already there since the revelation was made to Peter, but you come into it on the same line. The Holy Spirit is here and He works in your soul. You receive things objectively in relation to what you hear and see, but then the Holy Spirit works in you. There is such a thing as the "spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him". @Ephesians 1:17.
{127}
M.W.B. You would not link the foundation exclusively with God's work in Peter's soul?
J.T. That was the principle of it. It is what is here in the souls of the saints; that is what it is -- the knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.
A.S.L. Is it right to think of Christ as the Son of the living God, still building the assembly?
J.T. Certainly; it is a question of what is known in our souls by revelation.
Ques. Is that a different thought from what we get in Timothy, "The firm foundation of God stands"? @2 Timothy 2:19.
J.T. Oh! well, it would be the same thing, but here it is something you have got on to, so to speak. You have got on to something that is fixed, that nothing can shake. You are on a spiritual rock; whatever happens here, there you are. That is a thing to lay hold of.
T.R. Does that give us the ability to take account of the assembly in its administrative capacity?
J.T. I think it does; you know the ground you are on now. Chapter 18 really hinges on this.
Ques. Does the Lord in John show how we come into the apprehension of it, speaking of the Spirit, "he shall receive of mine, and announce it to you"? @John 16:14
J.T. Well, yes; there is the suggestion there. It is what the Holy Spirit does in us really.
Ques. Is not the discerning of the truth of the assembly a matter of divine revelation now as ever?
J.T. Of course, what we have here was very special; it was the beginning of a new order of things and the Father took the initiative. It is not the Son's work; it is the Father's work. The Lord proceeds on new lines from this point.
Ques. Did the Lord greatly appreciate that this point had arrived?
J.T. It was a wonderful moment. In chapter 11
{128}
He looked up and gave thanks to the Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that He had hid these things from the wise and prudent and had revealed them to babes. Now here He does not tell us what the things were, but you have a definite revelation by the Father in Peter's soul, and I am sure it was a wonderful moment for the Lord -- the beginning of the new Jerusalem.
Rem. The administration would not break down in the assembly as it did in Israel.
J.T. That is it.
A.S.L. The activity of living grace in heaven is connecting the living stones together now.
H.F.N. Would you contrast the Lord's word to Peter in John 1, "Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas: thou shalt be called Cephas", @John 1:42 with what we have here? Would you say what the difference is between the two?
J.T. The Lord *looked* on him, it says, and said, "Thou shalt be *called* Peter". The Lord is giving names there; that is to say, the saints are distinguished by their movements of life in John, because there it is the Last Adam naming us, and Peter gets his name. But here it is, "Thou *art* Peter"; not, Thou shalt be *called* Peter, but "Thou *art* Peter", meaning that he is qualified as material for the building.
H.F.N. Are there in that way three phases in Peter's history -- his relation to the Lord Himself in John 1, then in relation to the Father in Matthew 16, and then the Spirit in Acts 2; is that the completion of his education?
J.T. Well, quite.
J.J. You feel in thinking of the Father the necessity for John's ministry; you feel it is left for John to bring out.
{129}
J.T. I have no doubt.
P.L. So there is what the Father does as revelation, and what Peter does in confession, and what Christ does in building.
J.T. That puts it very well together. "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God ... Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens. And I also, I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it". This refers to the light that had come into his soul, and the Lord says, "Thou art Peter".
Ques. Now, will you distinguish between that and what we are in the presence of today -- the breakdown of the responsible vessel?
J.T. That is on the line of @1 Corinthians 3; it is because the truth of Jesus Christ has not been held to by the builders.
C.H.W. What attitude was the Lord taking when He said, "I also, I say unto thee"?
J.T. That of another divine Person -- the Father had revealed something to Peter and He recognised it. The moral side must always be kept in view because of what you have to contend with. The moral side began in figure in mount Lebanon. The timber was cut down and carried over the sea and delivered to Solomon. That all refers to the moral side.
W.C.G. Are we weak sometimes on the moral side?
J.T. I think so; that is where we are defective.
A.S.L. Would you expound a little the difference between moral and spiritual?
J.T. "Moral" involves I am dealing with mixed material and I have to refuse what is evil. One has to discriminate between good and evil; that is a great thing in dealing with souls. You are not admitting any evil; that has to go.
{130}
A.S.L. What is spiritual is beyond that?
J.T. Of course, you are working by the Spirit in all that, but there is a time when the thing is delivered over to Solomon, as it were, and he puts it into the building.
A.S.L. Then there are things wholly spiritual, which is a different thought from what is moral.
J.T. I think so. You do not get the moral thought here, "On this rock I will build my assembly", but there is a great deal preceding the actual putting in of the material.
Ques. Would the blind man in John 9 help us in that regard?
J.T. There is a process of disentanglement till the man is outside. What is noticeable in this chapter is the Lord left the Pharisees and Sadducees; He has done with them.
R.B. Then "being shown", as you speak of it, is more a process on the line of the work wrought in the man in John 9.
J.T. I think you come into it; it is a spiritual apprehension.
Rem. The Lord says, "A sign shall not be given to it, save the sign of Jonas". He left them with that sign; that is the moral side.
J.T. "He left them, and went away". And then the disciples were warned to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. That is where the moral side comes in.
M.W.B. What is the connection between this and 1 Peter 2, "To whom coming ... yourselves also as living stones"? @1 Peter 2:4,5.
J.T. In the whole realm of nature there is no such idea as living stones. It shows how unique it is, and what the nature of the building is.
{131}
THE LIGHT OF SONSHIP
@Matthew 18
J.T. This question on the part of the disciples would rather indicate that they were not in the enjoyment of the light of the previous chapter. It says, "in that hour". In the preceding incident the Lord had brought out the great thought of sonship, associating Peter with Himself in the most intimate way; He says, "Take that and give it to them for me and thee". @Matthew 17:27. The truth of sonship and our association with the Lord in that relation had been introduced, and yet it says, "In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?"
H.H. How does the truth of sonship affect us?
J.T. Well, no position in the kingdom of the heavens is equal to sonship, but any position given in the kingdom of the heavens would be occupied in the light, and grace, and dignity of sonship. True greatness lies in the relationship indicated -- that of sons. The Lord says, "For me and thee". @Matthew 17:27 It is the apprehension of the relation into which we are brought as sons that will enable us to occupy our positions in the kingdom according to God, for we are personally greater than any office we may hold. That the disciples should have asked "in that hour" showed it had not been taken in at all.
A.J.H.B. Would the apprehension of sonship lead one to take the place of a little child?
J.T. It is only in the light of sonship you can do it. Their question had in view the place they would occupy before men, but the knowledge of our relation to God as sons enables us to take any relation to the will of God here. It is a matter of little consequence
{132}
whether we are in the place of prominence or otherwise; hence the Lord calls a little child in order to convey His mind as to what is becoming to us in our public capacity. But a little child does not indicate our place as sons.
P.L. Do you see this in Solomon taking the place of a little child in his prayer to God?
J.T. He said, "I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in", @1 Kings 3:7. He shines in the kingdom, but he was a son before that. It was undoubtedly in the knowledge he had of his personal dignity that he could take the place he did in the kingdom. He says, "I was my father's son". No one perhaps in the Old Testament illustrates the truth of sonship as to how it works out in the kingdom more fully than he. He had a tender place in the affections of his father and mother (@Proverbs 4:3), and God had named him because He loved him; indeed God had taken him to be His son. It is the light of this great relationship that enables us to fulfil any function in what may come out in the public position of the kingdom where God's will is carried out.
T.R. The question of trespass can only be taken up in the sense of sonship.
J.T. Well, I thought that.
T.R. It is a serious question, and it seems to be put here in this chapter on the side of recovery -- our responsibility to recover -- whereas chapter 5 puts the responsibility on the person who trespasses.
J.T. Hence it is a question here of what we are with God to have power with men. Sonship indicates what we are with God. I think the little child in the public position corresponds with the son as before God. One comes in to fulfil any function here in assurance as being in the dignity and liberty of a son. The chapters from 14 onwards have a bearing on this chapter, but particularly chapters 16 and 17; they bring out the light of Christ's dignity as the
{133}
Son and then the wonderful fact that "then are the sons free". @Matthew 17:26. It is a precious thought.
E.J.McB. The sense of dignity with God would enable us to take the most menial place here in a creditable manner.
J.T. And in taking the lowly place, the place of a little child, we come under the protection of heaven -- wonderful protection! The son does not need that; it is the little one that calls forth all the interest of heaven. The chapter sets out the ground on which things are as we approach administration -- as we take up administration here.
E.J.McB. Do you think the hour of privilege leads to the disclosure of the moral state of the soul? "In that hour"; the disclosure comes out at that time.
J.T. We rightly speak a great deal of privilege, but the question is what effect has it on us? What effect had the hour in which these wonderful things were disclosed on the disciples? One feels for oneself how little one is affected by the magnitude of the things presented to us -- God's thoughts for us. It was in the presence of all these wonderful things which divine love had brought to light -- sonship and our companionship with Christ -- and in that hour, too, that this question of who should be greatest in the kingdom comes out.
W.C.G. You said they had not entered into their privilege. How would people enter into the reality of it?
J.T. The occurrence at the end of chapter 17 took place in the house. It was one of a series of occurrences in the house, the import of which would enable us, as we follow them and enter into them, to take up administration in the house, for that is where administration is -- the dispensation of God which is in faith -- it is house-wise. The incident is, one might
{134}
say, the climax of occurrences that this gospel presents in the house -- instances in which the Lord served in the house. This may be taken as perhaps the last and the greatest. It was when Peter came into the house that the Lord anticipated him and raised the question as to the position of sons. Thus we see that the way we come into this is house-wise; it is not a public thing, it is in the house, like one who had the desire to dwell in the house to behold the beauty of the Lord. We come to see what a great thing sonship is, "Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever; the son abides for ever" @John 8: 35; we have the liberty of the house -- liberty with God. He has no less a thought for us, and in the liberty of that position we are supported by divine resources-the sons are free. "Go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up" @Matthew 17:27 and you will find a piece of money there. So the resources of God sustain us there, and it is in the light of that that we take up our service here. Hence we come into it in dignity and there is no need to be added to by it. Our place in the kingdom will disappear, but sonship will remain.
J.J. In Luke 22, when the hour was come, and the Lord sat at table with the disciples, a strife arose amongst them as to who should be the greatest. Is that the hour of privilege?
J.T. Yes; it was so.
Ques. Do we not see perfectly expressed in the Lord Himself that in the consciousness of His place with the Father, He could surrender everything here and go down to the lowest place?
J.T. I think so. John sees Him at the outset as with the Father, an only One with the Father. That is the beginning of the thing. Then those who begin to follow are invited to come and see where He abides. I think John's writings fit in now, and thus we learn
{135}
to take things up in the knowledge of our place with God.
W.C.G. On the mount of Transfiguration they had already heard Him saluted as the Son.
J.T. How wonderful that He should have said, "the sons", and then "me and thee"! @Matthew 17:27
Rem. And to be associated with the One in whom it was so perfectly expressed.
J.T. Quite; and the occurrences in the house rightly understood, ending with this occurrence, qualify us to enter on chapter 18, because administration is in the house -- the dispensation of God according to the house -- and we are to have part in the administration and it is to be in the dignity in which the Lord acted in the house.
T.R. So you would be enabled to answer to the supreme test, seventy times seven.
J.T. Well, I think that is the way; you have to go after the brother. It is the test of your power whether you can gain your brother.
Ques. "Unless ye are converted and become as little children"; why should that come in?
J.T. Well, it is quite evident they needed conversion; they could not see sonship "in that hour". You could not see the great thought of God -- this wonderful place that was being unfolded, and begin to ask about being great outwardly.
Rem. In that way our reading may be helpful to that end, that some of us may be converted.
J.T. Yes; converted to see the great thing there is for us before God. It is greater than anything we can have here before men.
Rem. For conversion would give one to look at God's thoughts according to their divine presentation.
J.T. I think that is what conversion would imply. To turn round, to come to see what there is. The point is what place we take outwardly. The Lord calls to Him a little child -- the one available.
{136}
P.L. Would you get the thought of conversion in Mary Magdalene, in her turning round?
J.T. That is very good. She turned round to this same thing; the Lord pointed out to her this very thing.
J.J. You mean, "My Father and your Father ... my God and your God"? John 20:17.
J.T. Quite.
D.L.H. But do we not get a little touch of the public line that we ought to pursue, even in the Lord's word about the dignity and giving for Me and thee, "lest we should offend them"? @Matthew 17:27. That seems to indicate the line we are to take publicly before men. We do not parade anything of our sonship, but we take the lowly place and seek to avoid all offences. Is that not so?
J.T. I think the reference to the fish is that the resources of God which we have save us from coming under outward influences, and save us from compromising our position; we know our dignity.
D.L.H. But you do not tell the outside people anything about your dignity.
J.T. But you show it.
D.L.H. But you show it in littleness, and in taking your place of nothingness here.
J.T. You can relinquish things here in the light of your dignity.
D.L.H. Yes.
Ques. Is it in the spirit of sonship that this can be carried out?
J.T. I think it is; the resources of God are indicated in the fish.
R.B. Why is it in the singular?
J.T. It is one hook, one fish, one piece of money. He did not need to cast a net out. It seems to indicate how divine resources are available at once; they are there. I think that the knowledge of sonship enables you to ask for just what you need.
{137}
Ques. So would you say it leads up to agreement on the earth?
J.T. Oh! I only meant asking as indicating we have access to divine resources. I think the sea indicates the sphere of divine resources, and these are available as we need them.
Ques. And the hand and foot and eye cast from thee, would that fit in with Colossians? "Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth". @Colossians 3:5.
J.T. Yes, I think it would.
Ques. Paul had his name changed, "Saul who also is Paul". @Acts 13:9. Is that suggestive? He came to it.
J.T. I think he did.
J.J. I suppose Timothy would set forth the spirit of a little child in serving in the house.
J.T. Yes; he was Paul's child.
J.J. What is the meaning of bringing in offences and offending these little ones?
J.T. Anything by which they might be misled, by way of example.
H.F.N. Will you say a word in regard to what you referred to in connection with the Lord's movements in the house, in the previous part of Matthew? I think you said it led up to this. Would you indicate what you had in mind?
J.T. Well, Matthew presents the official side of the Lord's service here, as Mark also does; hence He was anointed by the woman in the house of Simon the leper, meaning that she virtually said in her anointing, This is the nature, the kind of administration in divine hands -- this is the Vessel, the Administrator. She would upset by her act, if accepted by the people of God, the whole hierarchical fabric of Christendom; she anointed His head, signifying that she recognised the suitability in the Vessel that had come in, and that God had already anointed an Administrator for that which He was administering.
{138}
The wise men had begun the thing by coming to the house and falling down and worshipping Him, and in bringing out of their treasures gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and presenting them. They did not do that from experience; they did it instinctively as having light. The King was before them. The King had not entered on His administration, but He was to them the King; but at the end of the gospel the woman recognised it by anointing His head, and the Lord says, "Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her". @Matthew 26:13. It was to come down with the gospel, reminding us of what that woman did. She had a true estimate of the kind of vessel that was suitable for this great administration.
Now the wise men had set out the idea in recognising the King, but this woman had come to it by observation, by experience. I think that the consideration of the occurrences throughout the gospel would enable us to see the rightness of her act, which was also in the house -- in the house of Simon the leper. The Lord, for instance, begins in the house of Peter, and Peter's wife's mother is sick of a fever. He touches her, and the fever left her and she arose and served Him; @Matthew 8:14, 15. Then He is in the house of Matthew the publican and sits down with publicans and sinners; that is, the company there would bring Him into reproach; @Matthew 9:10. One must accept that -- that those whom God brings in are of God's selection, and may bring us under reproach. And so on right through; you get Jairus's daughter in the house. The Lord comes into the house and there are flute players there and people making a noise. That is not suitable to the house; administration in the house cannot be carried on under such conditions -- things that appeal to men's senses. So He puts them all out and He takes certain
{139}
ones in -- those who are spiritual; then He took the maid by the hand and she arose; there is power there. Later in chapter 9 two men come to Him who are blind. They come into the house and they get their eyes opened and see things as they should be seen. So also in chapter 13, He comes again into the house, we read, and the disciples come to Him and say, "Declare unto us the parable of the tares",: @Matthew 13:36 and He expounds it to them in the house.
But He goes further and brings out the truth of the assembly as the treasure, and teaches that we are to understand it as hidden. He also speaks of the preciousness of the pearl; there are things hidden and things which are seen. Then He opens up the parable of the net cast into the sea so that we may understand that the good are to be gathered into vessels, but the bad cast away; souls are to be received with deliberation; the fishermen are to sit down and select. Then He graciously said to them, "Have ye understood all these things?" They say unto Him, "Yea, Lord". Then He adds, "every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old"; @Matthew 13:52 that is to say, we learn to be householders by observing these things. Then we have this further instance, which I think is the crowning one in the house, where we are brought into the knowledge of our relation with the Lord as sons. That is what I had in mind, and if we approach this chapter in the light of these things, we shall know how to do things. The brother who has offended is treated accordingly.
A.M.H. I should like to know a little more as to administration -- the adjustment of things in the house. Is there not the administration in the house of the goodness of God and what flows out manward?
J.T. Quite. It is an immense thing to lay hold of what we are in the house and to see how the Lord
{140}
moved in that sphere, because it is in the house that we get our training, our family feelings and affections.
A.M.H. So the first serving in the incident you referred to in Peter's house would be liberation to serve Him?
J.T. Quite; we have to be relieved of feverish conditions.
A.M.H. A question has been raised as to the relation between the kingdom of the heavens and the assembly. I suppose they are not the same. Would the kingdom of the heavens be rather wider?
J.T. I think it is wider; I suppose it is the rule of the heavens here, and would extend to the whole profession. Then the great fact is God has something here that can be appealed to, that is formed of those in the light of these things, and that is outside the world and greater than the world. We are consciously greater and superior to the world in the light of what has preceded this chapter. So we deal with things administratively from that consciousness, knowing our place with God.
P.L. Do you find the truth of sonship in Isaac when he retires before the Philistines in a lowly spirit such as a little child, finally retiring into the position where the world cannot pursue him?
J.T. Quite.
A.J.H.B. Does the expression here, "enter", give the thought of being in the kingdom as having become as a little child?
J.T. I think entering here is as you might say subjective. You enter; you see now how things are and you see you have part in this wonderful thing -- the kingdom. You have to become as a little child, and you are consciously under the care of heaven. Woe be to anyone who interferes with you. So personally you are great in the knowledge of your place with God, but you are under the care and protection of heaven as having become as a little
{141}
child, and woe be to any person or system that interferes.
W.C.G. Do you think that verses 12 - 14 would be suitable for administration in the assembly?
J.T. I think so. It is a question whether we approach divine things from the standpoint of current religions around us, that is, working ourselves up to it, preparing ourselves for it, or whether we approach them from the standpoint of Matthew's gospel, coming into them in dignity; that is what we have to get hold of. If we do there is no danger, we are just content. Our personal dignity is taken care of. The first great test is how I can save my brother if he has offended me; what I can do to help him.
T.R. To seek the one that has gone astray.
J.T. Quite.
T.R. In connection with the trespass offering @Leviticus 6:16 it is interesting to notice that it is the only occasion in which the ram was connected with the sin offering. "So it is not the will of your Father which is in the heavens that one of these little ones should perish". It is a beautiful incentive to go in the spirit of forgiveness.
J.T. I suppose the ram would denote the full development of a Christian; so you act from that level. It would be Christ as seen in this gospel in the fulness of manhood before God.
T.R. So whether you trespass or whether you are trespassed against, that is the ideal and the standard.
J.T. Quite.
Ques. Are you suggesting that we learn to recover our brother before we become preachers according to Mark?
J.T. The question of preaching does not enter into this; it is more administration in the house, that is, how we get on together first of all, and because offences will come, whether we are great
{142}
enough to gain our brother. If we have lost our brother, we want to gain him. If we fail in that personally, "between thee and him alone", then we are told to "take with thee one or two more", which I am sure many of us have proved and learnt the wisdom of, and failing that, we finally have recourse to the assembly. "Tell it to the assembly".
D.L.H. Is not the assembly the vessel in which divine grace finds its perfect expression at the present time?
J.T. I thought so. God's thought was that there should be that here which might be appealed to as corresponding to heaven. Hence He says, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven". That is the assembly. The next verse is, "Again I say to you", which I think contemplates our own times, but verses 17 and 18 have reference to the assembly as it was set up. There was that on earth set up in this precious light, set up in the light, and dignity, and grace of sonship, that was in accord with heaven, and it was a very wonderful conception. But when it says, "Again I say to you", it seems to indicate changed conditions, so it is brought down to two or three, that is, God would in that way provide for the maintenance of the light and truth of the assembly right to the end. "*Again* I say to you .... For where two or three are gathered unto my name".
A.M.H. You mean in principle this can still be carried out?
J.T. That is what I thought.
A.M.H. I was wondering as to the kind of offences in question in this chapter.
J.T. It means that a brother is lost and you want to gain him. It is a question of gaining the brother.
{143}
R.B. How do you regard the binding and loosing here as compared with what the Lord said to Peter? @Matthew 16:19.
J.T. This is the assembly, and was worked out at Corinth. The epistles to the Corinthians teach us how it would work out in a local assembly.
R.B. And how would it work out as far as Peter was concerned?
J.T. That was apostolic; he bound the sin on the Jews and released the Gentiles.
A.M.H. When you refer to Corinthians, do you get the binding in the first epistle, and the loosing in the second?
J.T. The second epistle to the Corinthians would bring in the grace that should mark us in releasing -- when the year of release comes.
A.M.H. Would Peter's act be more dispensational in character? This would be administrative in the present dispensation.
J.T. It is the assembly here.
A.M.H. Is the loosing the idea of receiving into the family?
J.T. Yes, I should say so. What has marked the late revival, when a number of Christians were led to come along, was that there was no hard and fast rule laid down. Love was active, and the brethren were ready to receive their brethren freely as brethren. There was no need for binding. God did act judicially later, but loosing or remitting marked the movement. Here binding comes first, but in John *remitting* comes first. He breathed into them. "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them". @John 20:23 John's ministry is intended for the end to effect recovery, and so remission is first.
P.L. Does Ananias do the loosing: "brother Saul"? @Acts 9:17
J.T. Quite. This "again I say to you" seems to meet the case. First there are the resources we have;
{144}
if there are only two of us that agree concerning any matter, whatever we ask it shall be done -- an immense thought -- and then "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I". He is there to support them in maintaining the truth of the assembly.
T.R. I suppose we could only speak of ourselves as "two or three" today.
J.T. That is the ground we are on, I think.
Ques. Is there anything special in the way the Lord gives the word "my Father" here: "It shall be done for them of my Father"?
J.T. It is what marks this gospel.
J.J. Would you say a little more about verse 20, because it has been rather limited to one kind of meeting: "Where two or three are gathered together"?
J.T. It is important to note that it is prefaced by, "Again I say to you", and then follows, "for where two or three are gathered together unto my name". It is worked out in the support that we get from heaven. We get it in the Lord's presence with us as we seek to maintain what is due to Him, and walk together in the light of the assembly.
J.J. You were saying on the last occasion that when we are in the care meeting it would be a very great thing to recognise the Lord with us.
J.T. I think it applies peculiarly to that. It is not limited to that, but it applies in endeavouring to deal with evil; it is the presence of the Lord. "There am I"; it is the presence of the Lord with the two or three. I think God has great regard for the assembly and He intends it should be maintained to the end; so there is power available.
Ques. Does the verse go further than the prayer meeting?
J.T. The prayer meeting might be included in it, but the Lord is bringing the thing down to the
{145}
narrowest possible limits, so that it is within the range of the very fewest.
H.H. What is the force of the word "gathered"?
J.T. It is a question of being gathered together, and supposes that we have the light of the assembly. "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".
D.L.H. It refers to the actual convening or coming together of people who are in the light of the assembly of God.
J.T. I thought that; quite.
D.L.H. It does not refer to people being rightly gathered, as though it were an action of the Spirit. I have noticed there has been a thought of that kind in some people's minds.
J.T. We are concerned about things that affect the house of God; we have a sense of having to do with the things of God. If there be a serious matter, we are burdened, and we pray and come together in the Lord's name; we have to deal with it, and the Lord is there. He will be there, and so the thing is dealt with; there is power to deal with it.
Ques. Is it in the dignity of the position; and the spirit of a little child that the thing is possible.
J.T. Quite so.
P.L. Does not John in writing of Diotrephes refer to binding there?
J.T. I thought the second epistle of John is the thought of the sister. A sister, or sisters, may maintain discipline -- that is, sin *must* be dealt with. We must be free of evil, and the Lord will not allow us to be baffled. He will sustain us and support us in refusing it. Of course sisters alone cannot act in assembly character, nevertheless 2 John places upon one the obligation of dealing with a certain evil, if it came to her.
What this chapter presents is a question of offences that have to be dealt with -- really a question of
{146}
discipline. The Lord indicates that right down to the end He is with His people with a view to maintaining what is due to the house of God. The passage is really parallel in principle to John 14, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me ... . and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him". @John 14:21 The Lord comes to one there; here it is to two or "two or three", because it is a question of the assembly. You must have at least two for the assembly.
T.R. John is outside dispensation and brings in what is spiritual.
J.T. Just so; and so He speaks of coming to *one*.
Ques. Would you connect the thought of His presence in any way with chapter 16, "Hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it"? @Matthew 16:18 In this way there is support.
J.T. Quite.
{147}
THE ANOINTING OF CHRIST
@Matthew 26:1 - 35
J.T. I think the thought is to review the chapters from chapter 20 in connection with this one.
The anointing by the woman in Simon the leper's house serves as an indication of what those who love the Lord may come to by appreciating Him as presented in this gospel. Evidently she anoints Him in relation to the feature of the truth presented in the gospel; and inasmuch as it is in the house it seems a fitting response to what the Holy Spirit presents in the ministry of the Lord, for the idea of a householder is prominent in this gospel. The institution of the Lord's supper following in this chapter, and being also in the house, indicates, I think, that those who partake should know what householding denotes spiritually. It says in the Psalms, "He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children" @Psalm 113:9, and I think this gospel teaches us how to keep house spiritually so that in result there should be a generation according to God.
A.M.H. Would you say a word as to how this gospel in general bears on the thought of keeping house?
J.T. You will agree that government has a great deal to do with housekeeping. We have the idea of householding here, as we have already mentioned, also in chapter 13, and then again in chapter 20, where the householder is brought in in connection with service; and later still in chapter 21, the same idea is again introduced. It is a feature of the truth that perhaps the Lord would emphasise, if there is to be further gathering. It is said in the prophet that those who joined themselves to the Lord God.
{148}
who took hold of His covenant, and kept His sabbaths, should be made joyful in His house of prayer; He would accept their sacrifices and their burnt offerings, and then it is added, "The Lord God which gathereth ... ..saith, Yet will I gather others besides those that are gathered", @Isaiah 56:8. I thought perhaps the Lord might help us on that line because there are many being gathered, but in order that others may be gathered, God looks for house conditions, and it is quite evident that house conditions are largely dependent on the government of the house -- on the rule that is there.
In the anointing here the woman's name is not given, nor is it given in Mark, and yet the memorial of her is to be kept, so that it is not so much the person herself, inasmuch as her name is not given, but rather what she represents, and in these two gospels the memorial of her is to be continued. Evidently it cannot be continued unless there are present the principles that she recognised, for she anointed the head. The head was anointed in both gospels. Matthew refers to the administration of the Lord.
A.M.H. Do you think that would be the Lord getting His place in the house as Administrator amongst the saints?
J.T. Yes.
A.M.H. So there would be room in that way for what He would bring in of God?
J.T. If conditions which God can recognise exist amongst us, He would gather others; because I think the word in the prophet is to faith, "Yet will I gather others to him besides those that are gathered". @Isaiah 56:8. There are many to be gathered, but the great thing is to have the conditions.
Ques. What are the conditions?
J.T. That is a large question, but an understanding of this gospel would help. There are other features
{149}
of course that enter into the house, but certainly the will of God is a great feature to be recognised. The Lord insists that those who are to be recognised as His brother, or sister, or mother must do the "will of my Father which is in heaven". @Matthew 12:50
Rem. I think you suggested last time that those conditions began to express themselves in chapter 2.
J.T. Well, I think the wise men from the east begin the line of instruction by way of example, they find the Lord in the house.
Ques. Is the anointing here the climax on that line?
J.T. I think so; and then the Lord intends it to be continued in the institution of the Supper, which is also in a prepared house. We have nothing like that really in the gospel; we have many houses mentioned and the Lord serving in houses, but nothing of this character.
E.R. Do you consider that the anointing precedes the Supper in that way?
J.T. The anointing signified that she appreciated the Person through whom the principle of rule came in. This woman would be a good housekeeper; she represents the result of the teaching. She committed herself to Him, and the memorial of her throughout the dispensation is intended to maintain the principle of rule, so that the memorial precedes the Lord's supper, hence 1 Corinthians was written to assert the rights of the Lord in connection with His supper.
M.W.B. How would the thought of the house in Matthew support the thought of the house in Luke?
J.T. What predominates in Matthew is the truth regarding the kingdom of the heavens: "the will of my Father which is in heaven". @Matthew 12:50. I think he emphasises the rule of the house, so that in his gospel it is a king made a marriage for his son, but in Luke it is a certain man made a great supper. Matthew emphasises the rule and the authority of the kingdom.
{150}
Luke has the house in view, but it is rather that it should be full; all things are ready, but there is nothing about the king's discrimination. Matthew carries the thought of government right to the end, so we see in chapter 25 the completion of it in regard of the nations -- the goats go away into everlasting punishment and the righteous into life eternal. He pursues the thought of rule to its final end. Luke is more concerned about bringing in souls; God would have His house full.
P.L. God's majesty and glory are referred to at the beginning of chapter 2, "We have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him". @Matthew 2:3. Would that be what the woman appreciated in the Lord?
J.T. I think that is very suggestive.
E.R. The appreciation of the woman showed that the end -- the object -- of that gospel had been reached.
J.T. Yes. If you take the four anointings in the gospels, you get the complete thought of Christ femininely --the thoughts presented in Christ reproduced in the woman. There are four anointings, one in each gospel, and taken together they represent a blend which God can anoint -- the Christ. "So also is the Christ". @1 Corinthians 12:12 There is that brought out subjectively in the saints to which God can commit Himself.
Ques. How do you take the thought of "she has done it for my burying", in regard of what you are saying?
J.T. He was on His way to die and she indicates divine instinct as to the situation.
A.M.H. Do you think the effect of this kind of action is what you get in Corinthians, one coming amongst us and saying, "God is in you of a truth"? @1 Corinthians 14:25.
J.T. I think that is right. What the apostle is aiming at in the first letter is to bring about conditions necessary to the Christ -- the anointed vessel. They were not there as yet, but he is aiming at it, and the second letter would show that he has reached it,
{151}
because he speaks about the communion of the Holy Spirit.
Ques. Would you say what you had in mind with regard to the four anointings?
J.T. This anointing refers to the kingdom of God in the house -- the house of God. I do not say exclusively so, because other features necessarily enter into Matthew, but in anointing His head the woman intimated that she recognised that He was the Vessel whom God had anointed for government. Anyone corresponding to her would not submit to a bishop or archbishop or anything of that sort, and thus deliverance would be realised from the hierarchical system; they cannot exist together. The memorial of this woman is a rebuke to all that, and delivers the people of God from it.
Ques. Do you mean that if we are to take part in rule in the house of God, we have to be formed according to the model set before us in Christ in Matthew?
J.T. That is what I was thinking, and this woman indicates that she has apprehended the thought because she anoints the head. In Luke and John it is the feet that are anointed, but this refers to His initial function in the house of God. There is for her no other person able to exercise rule save this Man. Of course, elders and those who take part in the rule of the house of God would reflect this.
Titus was to ordain elders in every city, but he would require to know the teaching of Matthew in order to determine the qualifications of an elder.
A.M.H. Receiving direction from Christ would work out in great unity amongst the saints.
J.T. It would indeed. Do you not think the need for elders is very great?
A.M.H. Yes, I do; and to recognise what the Lord might raise up in that way.
J.T. Yes.
{152}
Ques. Do you suggest they have their place today?
J.T. Elders as formed by this gospel are greatly needed in the house of God. "Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars". @Proverbs 9:1. Now an elder would be according to that; he would be wise. The elders in Revelation 4, I suppose, are symbolical of what all elders should be. They are around the throne; there are twenty-four of them with golden crowns. That would indicate a knowledge of God and divine approval. Then when the living creatures praise and say, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come", @Revelation 4:8 the elders fall down and worship; that is, they see that the creation is secured for God and they give a reason for their worship. They say, too, that God is entitled to this because for His pleasure they are and were created. So that elders among the people of God involves the intelligence acquired by experience with God, and God knows how to give the golden crowns indicating divine approval. It is not what one takes on or assumes, but what God provides and the saints recognise that; they recognise these crowns as of God.
S.J.B.C. It is remarkable the intelligence the elders display in Revelation.
J.T. Yes. Then the elders give an account of things; they always have intelligence. Who are they? Whence came they? The elder knows: "My lord, thou knowest". @Revelation 7:14.
H.F.N. Is that why so much is made of the elders in Acts 20? Paul sent for them and they fall on Paul's neck and kiss him.
J.T. They evidently represented there the affection of the assembly.
R.B. Do you mean that the memorial is preserved in the house of God by persons who are morally like this woman, and they would answer to the elders?
{153}
J.T. I think that is how it works out.
Rem. So the woman and what she had are not separated. It is not something she had to get. It is a "woman having".
J.T. What she had is not separated from her; I think that is right. I do not see how we can have the memorial of the woman without the conditions.
J.J. Do you mean that each gospel would produce the kind of person you have indicated?
J.T. Mark also records this incident, and he also says that the woman anointed His head. There I think she refers to service -- levitical work as set forth in perfection in Christ. Of course, the rule of the assembly and the levitical service are combined in one Person, but in Mark the memorial is also to be continued and would refer to efficiency in service.
M.W.B. Would you link Matthew with what is local and administrative, and Mark with that which is levitical and therefore universal?
J.T. Yes, I think that is right.
S.J.B.C. I thought the anointing in Mark is put in connection with His prophetical character. Mark
presents Him in the prophet's character, does he not?
J.T. Well, that is so; in Mark it is the Servant-prophet; it is the Levite's gospel. The Lord did things well and promptly. We get things combined both as to government in the house of God and service carried on there. These two features were to be carried down by memorial to us. Matthew and Mark bear largely on the public course of things in the house of God.
Ques. Would you connect the idea in Matthew with the end of chapter 11, "Learn from me"? @Matthew 11:29.
J.T. That is a most important passage as introducing the new thing. That which relates to the assembly begins there. We have to learn everything from Him.
{154}
Ques. I was thinking of the way He ordered things among the disciples. Would that be His rule and headship?
J.T. Yes, and now we have in chapter 20 the householder employing servants. We have to take account of the principle set out there, that things are not to be entered upon on the line of a bargain. Those who come in at the last obtain the same as those who came in at the outset, and the householder says that he had a right to do what he pleased with his own. "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will in my own affairs?" @Matthew 20:15 It is a question of the Lord's rights amongst His people.
Ques. Although outwardly a day of ruin, would you look for eldership amongst the saints today?
J.T. Certainly.
Ques. And recognise it?
J.T. I would look for the "golden crowns". @Revelation 4:4.
J.J. The qualifications must be moral.
J.T. You do not want anyone recognised officially; it is a question of what is moral.
J.J. Would it be right to say that the kingdom and the house are interwoven in Matthew?
J.T. The kingdom of the heavens is worked out in the assembly, but the public history of the church is taken account of in Matthew in the parables, and those of us who are acquainted with Matthew will never ignore the public history of the assembly, because the Lord is judging now in the midst of the assemblies as He was at the beginning, and His judgment extends to the whole area of profession.
Ques. Is that why it is Simon the leper's house?
J.T. I think the house here would involve a certain reproach. There is no reproach attaching to a cathedral, but there would be to a leper's house. One has to accept that; we have to accept the conditions in which the Lord is pleased to be found. He was in the house of Simon the leper.
{155}
Ques. Would you say that that was like Micah in the prison?
J.T. Well, quite. The kings of Israel and Judah were each on his throne in the open space; it was a show day, and Micah was sent for to prophesy concerning the Syrians, and he says, "I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him", @1 Kings 22:19 and that really is Matthew. The prophet was put into prison for his testimony, but he was in the light of the position. The government of God goes on, but what is to be observed in regard to the present position of Christ in heaven involves that all the dispositions of God in connection with the nations have reference to the testimony. There is no other concern with God now. There is the gospel and there is the assembly, and these are the chief interests of God today, and all His dispositions on the earth (and He is in supreme control of everything) have the furtherance of the testimony in view. Evil is allowed to go on, and it is coming to a head, but it is allowed on God's terms, within the divine limitations, as I think these parables show. The kingdom of the heavens implies that God is in supreme control of things and that He carries them to an issue. Hence we see in the parables in chapter 22 not only the destruction of Jerusalem, but that the one unsuited to the marriage scene is cast out into outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth; that is, what is unsuitable in Christendom is dealt with finally. The parables pursue things to their final issue, so the more we understand Matthew the more stayed and restful we can be, knowing that everything reaches its final issue under God's hand.
Rem. So Jezebel is eaten by the dogs in Jizreel.
J.T. Exactly; the ten horns shall eat the harlot's flesh and burn her with fire.
J.J. What is the meaning of the king of Babylon taking king Jehoiachin out of the prison and giving
{156}
him a portion at his table? What is the idea of that kind of government?
J.T. That would show divine consideration for one who had had a place among the people of God. You will find that often in Scripture; God comes in at the end of a man's days, even although he may have turned aside, and signifies His mercy. He does not turn him aside on the dungheap. He is very considerate of those who have served Him. Some of us were dwelling on the last chapter of Leviticus. A man might not be worth fifty shekels, but he is worth *something*. We have to determine the value of people; it would save us from being too severe or harsh in dealing with brethren.
A.M.H. Do you think all these parables which precede this have a bearing on present conditions?
J.T. I think they have. There are parables which deal directly with Jewish conditions, and then there are others which deal both with them and also with the history of Christendom. Parables that are specially called similitudes of the kingdom of the heavens take account of the history of the assembly, and chapter 20 is of great importance, showing that the Lord will hold to His rights to do what He will with His own. So if you come in at the last He will make no bargain with you, but you will get the same amount as those who came in at the beginning.
Ques. Does chapter 25 deal specially with Christendom?
J.T. The virgins do. Chapter 22 is the king making a marriage for his son; it is God asserting His dignity in the gospel invitation. Then chapter 23 deals almost entirely with conditions at Jerusalem; chapter 24 is the Lord's mind about Jerusalem and its destruction, and the testimony that will go on after the assembly is taken away; and in chapter 25 the parable of the ten virgins refers entirely to the assembly -- and the talents too; but the parable of
{157}
the sheep and the goats is evidently the future thing having reference to the final judgment of the nations in regard of the testimony that will go out to them through the Jewish remnant. We are in possession of all that light, and the issue of the judgment of the Son of man -- the goats going away into everlasting punishment and the righteous into everlasting life. Conditions on earth are fixed, and thus we see the history of the kingdom finished. And now we come to intelligent affection. How do we regard all this light as to Christ? What is all this to you? The normal effect of it all would be that all is carried down in connection with love. These verses suggest first the anointing of the woman and then the prepared house where the Lord's supper is partaken of.
M.W.B. The Lord, being brought before us as you have indicated, would make Him have a very large place in our hearts as the One who can take entire control of everything. We would anoint Him in that sense.
J.T. Yes; everything is made of those who have affectionate regard for Christ. That is the great end of it all.
Ques. I should like to ask why the Lord's burial is brought in in connection with the anointing.
J.T. It emphasises the affection shown. If a loved one is going to die, you have that immediately before you.
Rem. Because anointing as a rule was for a course of service here on the earth.
J.T. Yes; but she discerned He was going to die, and the bearing of her act would be taken up by the Spirit and applied to us. The Lord is not going to die now, but He is on His way in another sense -- He is on a journey -- for His present position is really a provisional one; it is a question, therefore, of how we regard Him. He greatly valued this action of
{158}
hers. Her act stands over against the hatred and folly of those who put Him to death.
P.L. Would it not suggest the bearing and conduct of such an one in the house of God?
J.T. Yes. She was not yet in the light of resurrection: "she hath done what she could", the Lord said. She acted according to the intelligence she had, but she acted in love.
Ques. Is it the same thought in @Psalm 45:1 "I speak of the things which I have made touching the king"? The woman here had learned to appreciate the King.
J.T. That is right; she expressed her own estimate of Him. She is in agreement with God. God had already anointed Him. Now, in regard of Luke, he records the anointing at the beginning almost of the Lord's ministry, and it is the feet of the Lord that the woman there anointed, meaning that she discerned in those feet that grace had been carried to her. She anoints Him in regard of what He had brought into the world, in the sense of the grace of God in Christ. She loved the One who had brought it to her.
W.C.G. Is this the service of the Son of God who is the minister of the true tabernacle? Is it expressive of the character of the last days?
J.T. Surely. And then John records also that the feet were anointed. Mary had discerned that He had come in in life, and those feet were carrying Him to death. He was going to death Himself; He was laying down His life of Himself. He was not being carried. He was going to die.
Ques. Would the anointing in John touch the thought in Joshua, when the priests¬ feet touch the water?
J.T. I think it does.
M.W.B. In the gospel of John would it be our appreciation of Christ in the way we express that towards the saints?
{159}
J.T. It would work out in the way we act toward: the Lord's people. If He laid down His life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. That act of His is really the foundation of the position. So that strictly we begin with that; we begin with John because it is only in life that all these other features are sustained.
Ques. Would all these features be available to the Lord at the Supper?
J.T. I think so; He would look for them. These four anointings really represent the beautiful blend that God anoints; as we get in @1 Corinthians 12:13 "for also in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, and ... have all been given to drink of one Spirit". One is what the Spirit does for us, and the other our committal to it.
R.B. Is your thought that what God anoints goes on to the world to come?
J.T. I think so; God would anoint what is according to Christ.
J.J. You were speaking about the Lord's supper in Matthew. Would you say a little about the feature of it in that gospel?
J.T. There you have a prepared house. The other gospels make more of the furniture, but here it is, "Where wilt thou that we prepare?" It says, "Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?" It is the thought of preparation. Now Luke tells us that the Lord sent Peter and John to prepare, meaning that Luke has more in view the furnishings than Matthew has. The Lord took the initiative in Luke and He sent Peter and John to prepare, because I think He intended that the features represented in these two -- in the one the rule of God, and in the other family affection -- should be the furnishings. But Matthew does not go into that, he simply records
{160}
that the disciples thought of the preparation and that it should be in the house.
S.J.B.C. What about the man bearing the pitcher of water?
J.T. Matthew does not emphasise the thought of ministry so much. Luke brings in the furnishings and Mark introduces the thought of the man with the pitcher of water because he is concerned about ministry. Luke tells us that the Lord sent Peter and John; he is supporting Paul's ministry.
M.W.B. Will you say a little more about the distinction between the furnishing in Luke and the house being prepared in Matthew?
J.T. I think Luke has in view what we are going on with now, that is, what the Gentiles are to have, and hence he does not say anything about the evening; the others do, they speak about the evening. The time is not so defined. Luke says, "When the *hour* was come", @Luke 22:14 which, I think, means that the time is left for what Paul prescribed, that is, that the Lord's supper is not added on to a meal; "When the hour was come"; and then Peter and John represent, as I have said, the one, the government of the house of God, and the other family affection.
A.M.H. Do you mean that Luke gives the preparing?
J.T. I think Luke gives the furnishing more. Here it is, "*Where* wilt thou that we prepare?"
M.W.B. And then is the moral position suggested in the woman's action, the state or preparedness that Matthew brings before us?
J.T. I think that is it, and supposes that all is gathered up in those who partake of the Lord's supper.
M.W.B. You would have no difficulty in speaking of the Supper in connection with Matthew.
J.T. Not in one sense, but in Matthew it is the *woman* that is to be remembered; he is concerned
{161}
that the woman's act should be remembered; "told for a memorial of her". There is nothing said of memorial in the Lord's supper in Matthew.
J.J. Would the Supper here be something like in the early chapters of Acts?
J.T. It corresponds with that.
P.L. And the fact that not the two are mentioned but the disciples, "And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them", would that suggest the element of response as bearing upon all?
J.T. I think it does, and the memorial of the woman is what Bethesda ignored -- that is, the order and government of the house of God. That is the important thing to have before we have the Lord's supper.
P.L. It says in regard of Jehoiada, every man stood to his guard, and then there is the crowning of the king, answering to Matthew, and then the testimony is to be announced. Would that answer to the memorial in character? And then Athaliah is slain; that would come in in regard to the final issue.
J.T. And then another thing that comes out in Matthew and Mark -- the hymn at the exit. It is a very beautiful finish. They went to the mount of Olives. That is what is available to love -- the outlet. There is a connection with heaven in the mount of Olives.
Ques. Does that suggest an upward movement?
J.T. I think it does; they sang a hymn. In both gospels that touch is recorded. There is the outlet. The point is, the outlet is in the Spirit. It is the Spirit that is the outlet -- the mount of Olives.
{162}
THE LORD'S COMING IN AND GOING OUT
@Matthew 13:26 - 52
J.T. Some of us have been noticing the reference made by Peter, when speaking in the upper room, as to the Lord coming in and going out among them: "All the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us". @Acts 1:21. We were noting that, and that the qualification of a nominee for the vacant apostleship was that such an one had assembled with the others during that time: "It is necessary therefore that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection", @Acts 1:21,22. It occurred to me that the Lord in the house from that point of view becomes peculiarly interesting, for the coming in and going out would apply to His being in the house; and in connection with that, the unfolding of what is spoken outside is in the house. I think it would be of interest for us to look at this subject, connecting it with the house of God, where only His coming in and going out are to be known now.
Ques. Have you in your mind such a meeting as this, as well as at the Supper?
J.T. Well, the house of God is a general thought; it is that over which the Lord is as having built it. He is Son over it, and He is a great Priest over it.
P.L. Would this connect with Timothy: "Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit", etc.? @1 Timothy 3:16. What is in mystery is now made known to the initiated.
{163}
J.T. Quite so. To apprehend these movements one has to understand the house and to be in it intelligently, which is wholly a spiritual matter. Whilst the saints are said to be the house of God in a provisional way, yet it is a spiritual house, and it has to be apprehended spiritually; one has to begin at the foundation, and take account of the material, as well as of the architecture. I refer to it particularly as corresponding with what the disciples had in the days of His flesh and after He rose from the dead, for the period was from the time of His baptism until He ascended. It says, "beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us". @Acts 1:22. The house today is that which corresponds with what they had when the Lord Jesus came in and went out among them between these two events.
A.S.L. How do you speak of the coming in and going out now?
J.T. The Lord has the door open to come in here; He has arranged for that. It ties in the fact that He said, "The world seeth me no more; but ye see me", @John 14:19. It is a spiritual matter. Judas wanted to know how it was that He would manifest Himself to them and not to the world, and the Lord began in His explanation with love. "If a man love me". The door is left open in that way so that He comes in and goes out; that is, He is free. It depends on the Holy Spirit being here in the assembly.
A.S.L. Yes, He is free. Have you in your mind the thought of saints gathered together?
J.T. No, it is more extended than that.
A.S.L. Because the house of God could not be gathered together exactly; it is too vast, it is all over the earth.
J.T. The *house* is never connected with a local company. It is always a catholic thought and one has often connected it with @Psalm 113:3: "From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the
{164}
same the Lord's name is to be praised". On the first day of the week, the morning meetings, as we speak of them, start literally on our Saturday night, because they begin in New Zealand and extend westward to the Pacific coast. I refer to that, not to be geographical or literal, but to show that the house of God is a wide thought, and the Lord has all that; from the rising of the sun to the going down of it His name is praised.
A.S.L. Yes. Is not the house of God, perhaps, the widest thought of all as presented in Scripture; it embraces everything?
J.T. It does. "He that built *all things* is God", @Hebrews 3:4. The "all things" are referred to as the house.
A.S.L. So in full result the whole universe will be God's house, but we are provisionally the house.
J.T. Yes, provisionally.
F.I. Do you mean that we can only be in the value of administration in the house of God as we are able to apprehend the Lord's present movements in relation to the house?
J.T. I think so; we have to apprehend His movements, His coming in and going out.
Ques. Do you mean His movements in the way of ministry or bringing about exercises in regard of an issue?
J.T. All of these.
A.S.L. Would you include in your thought manifestations of His love to individuals?
J.T. Yes, I would. That is what John 14 expressly states. Then @Hebrews 12:14 comes in, because it is a question of seeing the Lord: "holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord". @Hebrews 12:14. You see what He is doing; you are not misled in any way; you know where He is.
A.S.L. Seeing the Lord in that sense indicates that you discern His actual presence.
{165}
J.T. Exactly; it is a question of spiritual apprehension.
P.L. The house in John is linked up with an open door in the hearts of the saints. It matters little what happens here so long as an open door is kept for Christ.
J.T. He has got access here. The Holy Spirit maintains things livingly for Him. The Holy Spirit is here abidingly; the Lord *comes*.
Ques. Would it embrace what you get in Hebrews as to divine service? You get the house spoken of there in the beginning of the book.
J.T. Yes, quite. He is recognised as Son over it, and the Spirit speaks in it in chapter 3. He is a great Priest over it in chapter 10, so that you can "draw near"; it is available in that way.
P.L. Would you connect His movements in Matthew with power and support, and in John with love?
J.T. Well, I think that is just. In Matthew He is with us always in the way of support, mainly, I apprehend, in connection with the maintenance of the government of God here, so that in seeing His movements -- His coming in and going out -- you learn how things are in the house of God. Everything has to be learned from Him; He built it and He is over it.
A.S.L. So that the coming in and going out is not over, it is continuous.
J.T. Yes, it makes the house of God a most wonderful place; one needs to be spiritual and holy so as to be there, and to see what goes on there.
A.S.L. One peculiar feature in regard of the house of God is its being catholic. But it is open to even two or three who are in the truth of God to taste something of the fatness of it. The fact of our being reduced numerically to a very small number does not
{166}
in any way preclude the enjoyment of the proper portion of the whole house.
J.T. Is not that the point of John 14? First He comes to one who loves Him, knowing His commandments and keeping them, and then to one who keeps His word the Father and the Son come, and make their abode with him. See verses 21, 23. @John 14:21,23.
A.S.L. These verses 21 and 23 of chapter 14 are very wonderful; they are intensely individual. The whole of the chapter otherwise is collective; it is the whole company.
J.T. Yes; in Matthew the wise men find the Lord in the house; the star did not guide them to Jerusalem, because the Lord was not there, but the star, "went before them until it came and stood over the place where the little child was", @Matthew 2:9. They went to the *house*, that is where the little child was, it was not in a manger in Matthew. See verse 11. I refer to that as significant. So here it says, "having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house". Then the next thing is, "his disciples came to him", and that suggests that the opportunity is open to us to come to Him there.
A.S.L. And there He speaks quite differently from the way He does by the sea-shore.
J.T. Yes.
Rem. In the history of our souls we have to reach Christ for ourselves. No one can do that for us, we each have to move in that direction so as to have spiritual perceptions and sensibilities.
A.S.L. In connection with what has been said, I suppose the practical difficulty with regard to the truth of the house of God is that it is purely and entirely spiritual, so that it is only as we are controlled and taught of the Spirit that we can conceive the thing at all.
J.T. Yes. In Acts, in speaking of the Lord's ascension, the fact is recorded that those who saw
{167}
Him go up went to the upper room. That is a spiritual movement, because that place had been discovered earlier to them on spiritual lines. They did not need the man bearing a pitcher of water to direct them to the temple. At the end of the gospel of Luke when He was carried up into heaven they returned to Jerusalem and went to the temple, that is, they were there as witnesses -- they were God's witnesses there; but in the Acts after they saw Him go up they go to the upper room, meaning, I apprehend, that that had been discovered to them earlier on spiritual lines; they had found the upper room by following the man who had the pitcher of water, according to the Lord's own directions.
Ques. Would that suggest the Spirit?
J.T. I think the ministry of the Spirit. It seems to be a spiritual reference in the Acts as leading up to the great truth of the house, the assembly, because it is discovered on spiritual lines.
P.L. That spot would become fragrant to them in the unfolding of the desires of the heart of Christ for them. And we are safe, are we not, only as we pursue what engages His heart, that is, the whole assembly?
J.T. The Lord said, "There shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house", @Luke 22:10. It is a word for anyone spiritually desirous of knowing the place. It is a divine provision. That preceded this, and so did the institution of the Lord's supper, and these precious memories of that place had the effect, according to the Acts, that they sought it out after He ascended, "where were staying both Peter and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude the brother of James. These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several women, and Mary the mother
{168}
of Jesus, and with his brethren". @Acts 1:13,14. They really, as we might say, went into the house where the rights of Christ, at any rate where those who represented the rights of Christ, were.
Ques. Would you say a little more as to Matthew 2, where the Lord is found in the house?
J.T. Well, I thought it is in keeping with Matthew's account; it is the dignity of the King. In Luke He is in the manger. I quite recognise that Matthew is later historically, nevertheless there is a distinction to be made between the manger and the house. We are on the line of the government of God in Matthew, and so it is the little child *and its mother* there; the mother was a divine provision for Him. But it was in the house that the wise men found Him and brought forth the evidence of their regard and reverence for Him.
Rem. You said that the Lord's coming in and going out suggested His having liberty. I suppose you would say that He must be allowed to exercise His rights?
J.T. Well, that enters into it. It should exercise us as to whether the conditions of John 14 exist amongst us.
Rem. We get His service -- the benefits of His service -- but as Son over God's house His rights must be recognised.
J.T. Yes, in referring to those who were in the upper room, the apostles, I had that in mind. The apostles represented His authority, and that is where they went.
Rem. Speaking generally that is why His services are missed today in Christendom, because His rights are not acknowledged.
Ques. Will you say how you view the upper room in relation to the house?
J.T. Well, it is what is discovered on spiritual lines. The Lord could have easily given them the
{169}
exact street and number, as we may say, but He did not do that. He knew well enough where the house was. He knew where Saul was; He told Ananias where to go to find him. He did not tell the man bearing the pitcher of water to show them the way, and He did not tell them the number of the room, as we speak; He simply says, "a man shall meet you ... follow him into the house", @Luke 22:10.
Ques. Do I understand that in the movements in the opening of the Acts they were governed by spiritual instinct?
J.T. That is what I was thinking.
Ques. Their spiritual instincts were in exercise to find it. Is it not the same today?
J.T. Yes; that is how the house is to be found out, it is a spiritual institution.
Ques. You view the saints in connection with the house of God and you discover them on spiritual lines, would you say?
J.T. Well, I would have more the thought of the house abstractly first; I should have the idea of a spiritual house, and I think John helps us in regard of that, in that when the disciples asked the Lord where He dwelt He did not tell them.
Rem. I was thinking of "whose house are we". @Hebrews 3:6.
J.T. Well, saints are the house of God provisionally. The thought of the house of God is a very wide one. Peter calls it a spiritual house, that is the thing to take in at the moment. When the two disciples had followed the Lord, according to John's record, and desired to know where He dwelt, He did not tell them; that is intended to throw us on our spiritual understanding; He says, "Come and see". Now, what do I make of that? I have got to look at it and see what it means. It is not recorded merely as of historical interest, it is something for us; and "they came and saw where he dwelt", @John 1:38,39. He did not say to them. "Come and see"
{170}
until He turned round and saw them following Him; they had been moved already by the ministry of John, they were touched by it and they followed Jesus, and He turned round and saw them following. It is one thing after another. He says to them, "What seek ye?" And they say, "Rabbi, where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see". @John 1:38, 39. That is the principle of John 1, it lays a spiritual basis in your soul. The house must be taken up first of all abstractly, and then you come to it that the saints are it now. You come to it in that way and you begin to look at the saints as spiritual, because Peter will have it so, "Ye also as lively [living] stones". You never heard of such a thing in the whole realm of creation; it is not in keeping with nature that a stone should be living. Well, I have to take hold of that; hence he says, "Yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house", @1 Peter 2:5.
H.F.N. You have alluded to the first reference to the house in Matthew; the last reference is in relation to the house of Simon the leper; it says the Lord went into the house and there the woman anoints him. Is Matthew 2 the beginning of the instruction, and would the completion of the thought be reached in chapter 26?
J.T. I think that is very good; she anointed His head, too.
Ques. What do you refer particularly to in His head being anointed in Matthew?
J.T. Well, it is so in Mark also, whereas in John it is His feet. I think in the anointing of His head the Lord is recognised in His official dignity. In anointing His feet He is recognised in His love; those feet were going to carry Him out through death, "Six days before the passover" @John 12:1. Mary anointed Him for His burial. It was as if she said, These feet are going to carry you into death for me.
{171}
I think the woman in Luke 7 anointed His feet because she had learned grace, He had carried the grace of God to her, "How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace", @Romans 10:15; @Isaiah 52:7. It was not for His burial there, whereas the anointing inside in Bethany by Mary had reference to the Lord going the full length; it was for His burial; she knew He was going to die; but I understand Matthew and Mark have in view the official dignity of Christ, and so the anointing is on the head. But your reference is very interesting because it is the end of the thought of the house; He is owned fully.
H.F.N. What Matthew gives us, as you were saying, is the rights of God in government, and the anointing would indicate the full recognition of that.
J.T. Yes. There is the full recognition of His official rights. The fact that it occurs in the house is instructive, and ought to have an effect upon us as to how we regard the Lord in the assembly.
H.F.N. So the wise men give us the first movements in regard of the house; they brought out of their treasures gold, and frankincense and myrrh; and the woman represents in that way the development of the education that Matthew brings about.
J.T. In reference to the Lord in the house, I think we see in chapter 13 how you get the unfolding of the mind of God there; those who know the house, and the Lord in it, are never puzzled.
Exposition is the first thing, and then He adds to that. First it says that His disciples came to Him, saying, "Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field", @Matthew 13:36. Well, He expounds that, but He does not stop there. That is a thing we might note. We may desire to know certain things, but the Lord knows more than what we ask about, and He will add more than we ask; the unfolding of the truth of the assembly comes out first in verse 44:
{172}
"A treasure hid in the field ... goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field". That is a further thought, it is more than the exposition they asked for; it is a new thought -- a thought which should be taken note of, because it indicates that the Lord has acquired rights of the whole world through redemption. This gives great room for movement in service in the gospel. He has bought the field because of the treasure that was in it. There is nothing in the way; He moves to get the treasure. First we get the purchase of the field because of what was in it, and then the purchase of the pearl itself. There are the two thoughts. And then He adds another thing, that is, the net; of these three things He gives instruction in the house, as suggestive of what He may do for us where there is inquiry.
P.W.D. Why is it called the kingdom of the heavens -- in the plural -- and not the kingdom of heaven?
J.T. I think it is because all the ordinances of the heavens have got part in the rule of the heavens, as some of us were noticing. Jehovah speaks of these in @Job 38:31 - 33; they *all* have their part in the rule.
Ques. In suggesting that the house is a provisional thought, have you in mind that it is in view of the education of the saints?
J.T. Well, it is; so wonderful things will be opened up to us. The house is that over which Christ is as having built it as the Son. The Son is over the house, and the Son sets us free in it, that is, He gives us to understand that as being sons we have liberty in it and we see His comings in and goings out; then we have here opened up to us the mind of God. There is the full answer to the inquiry of the disciples and more; we need not inquire elsewhere.
A.S.L. It is important practically to see that the assembly is the house of God only provisionally. It keeps in view the other families that are to be introduced
{173}
in their various places in relationship in the house. You often hear the expression that God has secured for Himself a company that can worship in His presence; that is very true, but He has secured for Himself a variety of companies. We want to get hold of that. It is not simply and only the assembly, blessed as it is above all families.
J.T. The Father names every family. The assembly is the house now, pending Israel's reinstatement; then God's house will be in Jerusalem again. The assembly will be the tabernacle of God in the eternal state of things; @Revelation 21. In the light that the Lord is pleased to vouchsafe here we get more than we ask for; we have the light of the assembly opened up. We get the principle of it in Acts 1. One thing we should notice is the room there is in regard of service -- testimony. The Lord has clear rights, universal rights. He has bought the field for the sake of the treasure in it, so that He has the right of way everywhere. Abraham bought the field; he secured it, and the cave and the trees that were in the field. And so, too, David bought the site for the house; he *gave* so much for the *place*. I think it is a principle with God that there must be ample scope, a free hand in the service; and He discloses that here in speaking about the intrinsic value of the assembly, the field and the treasure in it.
A.S.L. He buys the field, and then the net is cast into the sea; that is a universal thought. There is plenty of room there for service in the gospel; the sea is the whole vast expanse.
J.T. I think the sitting down and selecting the good is a present feature of the kingdom of the heavens, for certainly a mixed lot has been drawn in in the net, and it tests us as to whether we can discern the good. David said to Abigail, "Blessed be thy discernment", @1 Samuel 25:33. "Every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like ... a
{174}
householder". We are to be on that line. The thing is to be a householder, one who can bring out of his treasure things new and old. He has got things new and old, and he brings them out of his treasure.
P.L. Nothing would make us more discriminative and contributive than to be near Christ in His feelings of love for the assembly.
J.T. And then to be a householder. It is a remarkable place that the house has in Scripture; and the responsibility in the house, whether it is your own house or God's house, is to learn to be a householder.
P.L. You move householdly as a son in Matthew.
J.T. And then you have a *treasure* and out of it you bring things new and old. As discipled into the kingdom of the heavens you see how God has been moving in government from the very beginning; that is, you have the things old, but you have the new ones as well. Things are not old in the sense of being effete or useless, but more as being antique; they are valuable for their very age. Some of the things we now learn in Christ had been spoken of and exemplified indeed from the outset. To be instructed in the kingdom of the heavens means that we see the principles of rule from the very outset. God set the great lights in heaven at the beginning.
Ques. Do you not think that we sometimes look at the expression "rule" as something harsh? It is really the rule of divine love; there is love in connection with all God's governmental ways.
J.T. I think the ordinances of heaven, as some of us were seeing, are most beneficial, even physically. Everything in the world, we might say, depends on the ordinances of the heavens physically -- the existence of life, and guidance for men moving about. God has mercifully provided for the human race. All these things depend on the ordinances of the
{175}
heavens; how could men traverse the seas without them?
Rem. "Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion". @Amos 5:8. There is order there.
J.T. Quite. Job refers perhaps more than any book to the testimony of creation -- the heavens and the earth and all the living creatures of the earth and the sea. Everything depends on the ordinances God mercifully placed in the heavens. They are not harsh; they are merciful.
A.S.L. The reason why we think them harsh is because we have got away from God; we are lawless. But what a terrible thing if there were no rule; we could not live without rule: "In the beginning God created the *heavens and the earth"*. @Genesis 1:1. That is the order.
J.T. Yes, that is the order; and He has set ordinances in the heavens and they have application to the earth. There are ordinances governing heaven itself for its own maintenance, and there are ordinances which have application to the earth. They are not arbitrary, they are benign, even physically; how much more so spiritually. The old things here which the householder has in his treasure are what he has seen in creation; and there are things, too, that God had already communicated, but now, he says, I see them all in Christ; they are connected with the new things.
Ques. What were the old things?
J.T. I think the things of the Old Testament; the beginning of Genesis 1 for instance, and we view them in the light of the new. We begin with new things. The householder brings out of his treasure things new. He shows them first, but now, he says, this is something one thousand years old, look how beautiful it is! You see it now as it referred to Christ.
P.L. So the Lord is filling their treasures at the end of Luke: "Beginning at Moses and an the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures
{176}
the things concerning himself". @Luke 24:27. And then Peter in Acts 1 brings them out of his treasure.
Ques. Would you say a little more as to the scribe being discipled? What does that mean; is it that he has to be instructed, disciplined?
J.T. It means "taught". You are subject to the person who teaches you.
Ques. Is the thought of the house that you are governed by divine principles?
J.T. That is one thought of it; you recognise "the law of the house". @Ezekiel 43:12.
Ques. You referred to David buying the threshing-floor of Ornan. In one place it speaks of fifty pieces of silver and in the other of six hundred shekels of gold being paid. What is the difference?
J.T. The writer of Chronicles refers to what David *gave* for the *place*.
Rem. I was thinking of the silver in contrast to the gold.
J.T. I think the silver would have reference to redemption, and possibly have regard to the price Oman would have put on the threshing-floor, but Chronicles would record the larger view of what David gave for it; he would have the place. We are not told how much territory he secured, but you may depend upon it he had in view that there should be no claim on the house of God afterwards. No one would have any right to say, I own that property, or part of it. He purchased it with gold. He gave gold for it because it is a question of the intrinsic value of the purchase by Christ.
{177}
BRETHREN
@Matthew 12:46 - 50; @Mark 3:31 - 35; @Luke 8:19 - 21; @John 20:17, 18; @1 Thessalonians 1:2 - 4
J.T. I thought we might consider the subject of brethren, and how we are to be in that relationship according to God. The passage in Thessalonians should read, "brethren beloved by God". I mention that because it points out what the brethren are to God, "brethren beloved by God". That is a point to have in view in our reading. We have to think of what the brethren are in relation to Christ, in the main that is the thought; but we have also to think of what we are to one another, and of what the brethren are to God. Hence the rendering is, as I understand, "brethren beloved by God". I thought it would be of interest to us all to look at this subject of practical import, because in the recovery to the truth of it we should look for the end God had in view originally; and among the many features that appear, the thought of brethren is one of the most interesting and practical.
It has occurred to one lately that the Lord is working now to bring about such brotherly relations as will enable us to walk together; and in order to determine where we are as to this, we may look at the features of the brethren as indicated in the passages read. There is a ministry, I believe, proceeding corresponding with that of Joseph, who is said to have had a house into which the brethren came, and in which they were tested and adjusted. Samuel also is said to have had a house in which he judged Israel, and Solomon, too. I refer to his own house, not to the temple -- the house of God. Where anyone who typifies Christ is said to have had a house, it points, I think, to what is personal to Him,
{178}
and what refers to the immediate sphere of His affections; so there is that at the present time. There are general interests, the kingdom and the house of God, but there is that which is the immediate sphere of the Lord's affections, and I think that His brethren represent that sphere; and if we are not consciously in it, there is a ministry proceeding to bring us into it. If we come under the influence of that ministry, we shall come into that sphere -- the sphere of the immediate affections of the Lord. John 20 gives the highest thought connected with brethren: "Go tell my brethren", and presents the immediate sphere of His affections. We may be in the wider, more extensive and more general sphere of His interests, but the Lord is aiming at bringing us all into the more immediate sphere of His affections.
Ques. Is your thought that Matthew, Mark and Luke present the ministry needful for us in taking this up?
J.T. I think Matthew insists on the will of God, which would be a wider thought. Those who do the will of God are recognised as His brethren. In Mark there is a circle sitting round Him and listening; they come nearer to Him; then we have in Luke the word of God, those who hear it, and do it, meaning that now we have the thoughts of God unfolded; and then in John the formal intimation on the part of the Lord, on His own side, of the brethren as in direct family relationship with Himself and His Father and His God. The last presents the full thought, which none of us should stop short of, but many do. The greater number of us, perhaps, are short of that; and being short of that proves that we have not come definitely under the ministry of Joseph, or under the ministry of Samuel, so to speak.
Ques. Would you say what you have in mind in that regard?
J.T. Samuel, we are told, judged Israel in a
{179}
circuit every year "all the days of his life". @1 Samuel 7:15. He judged Israel in Bethel, in Gilgal, and in Mizpah, and then his return was to Ramah, where was his house, where he also judged Israel, and where he set up his altar to Jehovah.
Ques. Have you a thought in regard to the judging in those places?
J.T. I think the judging in those places represents some divine principle which the Lord would enforce. The first thing to see is that Samuel went in circuit. Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpah was his circuit, and in those places he judged Israel all the days of his life. Notwithstanding that a king had been asked for and granted, Samuel retained his service in Israel all the days of his life. That fact is typical of the Lord's present, patient service to His people, even though the many have selected a king, that which is in agreement with the nations around, in other words, are bound up with the present clerical system -- that which involves the rejection of the Lord in this light -- not a murderous rejection, for they were not intending to put Samuel to death, but they rejected him. Samuel said, "God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you", @1 Samuel 12:23 so the testimony in regard of him is, he continued to judge Israel in these places all the days of his life. It meant he continued to judge Israel even while Saul reigned. Notwithstanding that the mass of the people of God today have selected that which is in agreement with the nations -- the clerical system is really in agreement with national religious customs -- the Lord continues to serve, and intends to do so. The Lord is continuing to judge His people everywhere; every denomination comes under His eye, and He carries on, and maintains His judicial attitude towards them. His judgment is according to certain principles; He does not accommodate His judgment to them. In Bethel He would judge in the light of the house of
{180}
God, which Bethel means, and so if He judges in Gilgal, He would judge in the light of the condemnation of man in the flesh, that which is a reproach to the people of God -- the reproach of Egypt.
Rem. Would you mind just continuing Mizpah and Ramah?
J.T. Mizpah is not so clear, but apparently has reference to the covenant, which is an outward witness, a witness between two, a witness between Laban and Jacob; and evidently the Spirit of God takes up the town with this name in Samuel, and gives it a place of prominence. The kingdom was renewed there, or set up there. It was there, too, that God gave the victory to His people, when by the command of Samuel they were gathered together there, and drew water and poured it out before the Lord and fasted in humble acknowledgement of their weakness and inability to meet the Philistines. It would stand for the faithfulness of God: "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us". He never relinquishes His love for His people. The Lord's supper would be the sign of that to us; the unchanging love of Christ is witnessed there; He is "the same yesterday, and today, and for ever". @Hebrews 13:8. In His own house you come to a more immediate sphere, the sphere of His direct affections; and judgment carried on there would mean that the family relationships would be adjusted. I think that is what is going on now. The Lord would remove all that hinders the reality of our place as brethren, so that we should not be using the word without having the character of the thing.
Rem. It was on the occasion of the second visit to Joseph that they came into the house.
J.T. That is interesting; he spoke roughly to them at first.
Ques. I was just going to ask as to the connection between what immediately precedes the passages we
{181}
read in Matthew and Mark -- the evidence of His rejection.
J.T. The natural relationship is given up. His rejection had brought out that the relationship after the flesh is disowned, so one is to forget one's own kindred and father's house, "so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty". @Psalm 45:11. We have to begin by disallowing the natural.
Rem. So the relationship would be of a spiritual character. It would rather suggest that it is a new generation in John.
J.T. Yes, it does; the position of children of God is given to those who have received Him; but then they have been born of God, "not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man". @John 1:13.
Ques. Would Psalm 133 suggest the relationship enjoyed?
J.T. I think it would -- the goodness and pleasantness of it, and what it is like; it would agree with Thessalonians, "brethren beloved by God". It is a most beautiful statement, as though God would look down on this Thessalonian company, marked by these things that are mentioned, and would see in them what His heart could take pleasure in. They were brethren, but such as were beloved by God.
Ques. Is it a relationship that particularly belongs to this life, while we are here?
J.T. I think it goes into eternity, "Firstborn of many brethren". @Romans 8:29. I think it is a relationship that abides.
Ques. Does it give you the idea of kindredship?
J.T. I think it does.
Ques. Do you make a distinction between doing the will of God in Matthew and Mark, and hearing and doing the word of God in Luke?
J.T. I think there is progress in it. Matthew is doing the will of God; in Mark He looks round on them that surrounded Him, but Luke brings in the
{182}
word. The word of God is that which declares to us the mind of God, and in keeping that we are recognised as the brethren of Christ.
Ques. Why is it the "will of my Father" in Matthew, and the "will of God" in Mark?
J.T. I think in Matthew it is usually, "My Father which is in heaven". It is the rule of heaven. The question often arises, what is involved in the kingdom of heaven? It is not only Christ there as Man, but the Father rules in heaven.
Ques. Would you say a little about "My brother, and sister, and mother"?
J.T. I suppose it might apply in the future day. It is the ground on which Israel will come in in the day to come; as it says in @Psalm 45:16; "Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children"; not because they are born of Abraham, and could say "We have Abraham for our father", but because God was able of stones to raise up children to Abraham. Those who will have that place in the future must come in on this ground.
Ques. Would it mark the affections existing among brethren?
J.T. While the Lord says, "Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother", it would be difficult to make that fit in with the assembly, although the maternal thought is in the assembly. The book of Proverbs opens up before us the instruction of the father, and the teaching of the mother. These are features here in the assembly; but I think when He says "my mother", we have to wait for that. There is a day in which His mother crowns Him (Song of Songs 3:11), but that will be Israel as brought back by the will of God. Israel will have to learn what the mother is according to God, and so the sister. Canticles recognises both mother and sister. "My sister, my spouse"; that is to say, the family
{183}
relationship must be established before the marital, and it is established to begin with in the acceptance of the will of God.
Ques. Do you suggest that the features of the brethren are seen in hearing the word of God, and doing the will of God?
J.T. I think the mother and sister refer to Israel in the future. The sister is seen in those collectively who do the will of God. The Lord having the assembly in view unfolds what is brought into that. The epistle to the Romans brings that about in the soul. I suppose it is reached when he says, "Ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you". @Romans 6:17.
Ques. Do you get that in the Lord's mother? "Whatsoever he saith unto you, do". @John 2:5.
J.T. She had come to it. She says first, "They have no wine". He knew that. Then she says, "Whatsoever he saith unto you, do". The Lord commits her to John in the end of the gospel; on the cross He says to her, "Behold thy son!" John will take care of her. I think the loved disciple carries through the thought of the mother; but it is the mother who has learnt the will of God. Israel after the flesh is not the mother. Revelation 12 brings her out in her dignity; she is "clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars". @Revelation 12:1. She could not have a place like that without learning the will of God. No one can rule others if he does not rule himself. It is only as bowing to the will of God that anyone of us can be the expression of the will of God.
Ques. Do you put the will of God in Romans? Where do you put the word of God? In Luke?
J.T. One would not like to limit Romans; the word of God comes out there too. Romans is the will of God, but it is, too, the word of righteousness.
{184}
Paul taught the word of God at Corinth. In general, the word of God is the unfolding of His mind.
Ques. Would the word of God answer to the declaration of God?
J.T. Yes, I think so; the declaration of His mind.
Ques. Do you not think it is important, if we are to be together as brethren, that we should recognise that it is a relationship outside of what is natural?
J.T. It is, I am sure. That is what Luke is leading us to. I think the ministry of Samuel may be said to precede morally the ministry of Joseph, because Samuel has to do with the kingdom and judgment, but Joseph has to do with the brethren. Immediately Joseph begins his history it comes out; at seventeen years of age, when he was tender and affectionate, he was with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, the handmaids of Leah and Rachel. These sons were at a disadvantage; they were the sons of Jacob, but they did not have the same mother. Joseph was with them in the field, and heard their evil discourse, and felt it. There are those who, speaking typically, are at a disadvantage through their mothers -- through ecclesiastical relationships; the discourse in these associations is not in keeping with God. Joseph was a typical brother, whose mother was a wife. Jacob loved Rachel; and Joseph felt the evil discourse of the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, these two handmaids, and went and told his father about them. That is what brought out the antagonism, and where the spiritual history begins, which ends in chapter 45, where he kissed all his brethren -- every one of them, even those whose evil discourse he had reported.
Rem. Though they had four mothers, all came to unity under Joseph.
Ques. Did they not say, We be sons of one father?
J.T. That is what they say to Joseph; they did
{185}
not say how many mothers they had. That is where the difficulty lies. The ecclesiastical association of the people of God involves a state wholly unsuitable to God.
Ques. Speaking about that verse in Romans, "I commend unto you Phoebe our sister", @Romans 16:1 that would not go so far as Mary in John 20, I suppose -- the latter would be wholly spiritual?
J.T. Well, Phoebe came very near to it. I think Mary Magdalene comes up to the thought of a sister. We have another reference to a sister that we may note: "Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife?" There is a spiritual thought in that. The Lord recognised the sister first. In Canticles it is the sister, then the spouse. I think the sister comes to light in doing the will of God.
Rem. There is the "little sister" in Canticles.
J.T. She is a sister, of course.
Rem. I wondered whether it would be the two tribes and the ten tribes.
J.T. The Lord does not call her His sister. The saints recognise the little sister; she needs development. He recognised Judah as His sister, meaning she had come into this.
Ques. Do you think the thought in the Lord's mind might be the elect nation coming to light in Him?
J.T. Quite.
Rem. They will live for ever, and be in relationship with Him.
J.T. That comes out in Ezekiel. The relationships He brings out here involved the cutting off of Israel as they stood.
Ques. Does the Lord, speaking of His mother and sisters, carry us on to the thought of the Lord being Son over His own house?
J.T. There you are on different ground; that is a question of the house of God.
{186}
Ques. You referred to Solomon's house. I wondered if you were carrying on that to "Son over his own house"? @Hebrews 3:6
J.T. I think "His own" in Hebrews 3 is God's house. It really reads, Christ is Son over His house. Moses was a servant in it, and Christ is Son over it, and I think God's house is somewhat wider than that which is suggested in Joseph's house, or Samuel's, or Solomon's. In Solomon we see two things: Solomon's house, which was one thing, and God's house, which was another. What we want to see is an immediate circle for the Lord, expressed in "my brethren". "Go to my brethren". @John 20:17.
Ques. Do you link up the thought of brethren with that of the family?
J.T. It is the family in relation to Christ; sons are in relation to God. Children are in relation to God, but brethren are in relation to Christ. In Matthew and Mark it is "my brother, and sister, and mother", but in Luke it is "my mother and my brethren".
Ques. What is the difference in the relationship in Matthew, Mark and Luke, and that in John, established consequent on His resurrection?
J.T. I think Matthew, Mark and Luke are on moral lines, whereas John is more from the divine side. The family relationships are established before the marital. We find that throughout Genesis. In Genesis 22 after Christ is risen typically, it was told Abraham that Rebekah was born; it was *told* him; see verse 20. @Genesis 22:20. It was a matter of light that such a person as Rebekah existed, and she was directly related to Abraham -- a direct descendant of Terah, his father; and hence in chapter 24 he makes his servant swear that the wife for Isaac must be of his kindred. He knew she was there, the point was for the servant to find her. The person was already known to exist.
{187}
Ques. Is "my brethren" more an assembly thought?
J.T. Well, it underlies the assembly. His brethren are those who form it. John brings in the persons who form the assembly; but we do not get the expression, "the assembly" in John's gospel.
Ques. How do you look at the Lord in these three relationships presented in the gospels, "my brother, and sister, and mother"?
J.T. We do not say "our brother" to Him; we observe the reverence which is due to Him.
Ques. Is it that He was here in relation to the will of God personally, and He recognised these as moving on that line?
J.T. That is it; they were brought into accord with Him. We have to look at it from the side of sovereign generation, and also from the side of exercise -- from the moral side.
Rem. That is Matthew, Mark and Luke.
J.T. Yes, but John is entirely from the side of divine choice and generation. Chapter 21 shows the disciples were not marked practically by a state that suited the calling at all. They are viewed entirely from the divine standpoint in John.
Ques. Is it similar to what the apostle says, "Ye brethren after the pattern of Isaac"? @Galatians 4:28.
J.T. Yes, born of the free woman. Those who come into the light of the assembly have a true mother now.
Ques. How would Mary find the brethren in John 20?
J.T. I think she herself represented what the Lord had in His mind. She loved Him, and if you love the Lord you will find the brethren. You know where they are, even although their state may not be in keeping. The secret of finding the brethren is that you love the Lord.
Rem. What marked them in John 20 was that
{188}
they loved the Lord, however ignorant they may have been.
J.T. They did indeed. The Lord clothed them all, I believe, with what He saw in Mary. He clothes all with what He finds in some.
Ques. Is the emphasis on "*my* brethren"? I was thinking of "having loved *his own"*. @John 13:1.
J.T. I think it is. "Go to *my* brethren"; @John 20:17 and to link it on with Philadelphia greatly helps. It emphasises what belongs to Christ; the overcomer is to be regarded in that connection.
Ques. Would 2 Timothy help us to find the brethren? "The Lord knoweth them that are his". @2 Timothy 2:19.
J.T. I think the seal is a sort of warrant that the believer has. In Esther's time there was the king's seal; Esther had power in the use of the seal. So today, those who love the Lord may not know all the brethren, but they have a moral warrant to approach all. "Having this seal, The Lord knows those that are his; and, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". @2 Timothy 2:19.
When the world says, if you teach or preach to serve Christ, that you have never been ordained, you can say, I have got this seal. You have a right of way on moral lines with the seal. There it is, "The Lord knows those that are his". He has a right to every one of them, and knows where they are, and you cannot interfere with Him. Whatever you may set up as a barrier, He will reach His own. The Lord says in John 11, "Let us go unto him". The Lord knows the brethren, and knows where they are, and has a right to them, and no one can interfere with them. He will seek out everyone of them. But the other side of the seal is, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". @2 Timothy 2:19. The only available ones to us are those who withdraw from iniquity.
Rem. You carry moral credentials with you.
{189}
J.T. Our position is entirely moral now, and it is most powerful where declension has set in.
Ques. Would it answer to hearing the word of God, and doing it?
J.T. It would indeed. Luke and John come near together; John particularly brings in the full thought, "*my* brethren". The Lord has got brethren, the immediate circle of His interests and affection. In Matthew he says, "*my* assembly"; in John, "*my* brethren".
Ques. Would you say in @Song of Songs 5 you get both? The Lord takes up the term 'my' and the bride does.
J.T. The bride says, "Let *my* beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits". @Song of Songs 4:16. He says, "I am come into *my* garden, *my* sister, *my* spouse: I have gathered *my* myrrh with *my* spice; I have eaten *my* honeycomb with *my* honey; I have drunk *my* wine with *my* milk". @Song of Songs 5:1. It is remarkable the recurrence of the word 'my'.
Ques. It finds a response in the heart of the bride, and she says, "I rose up to open to my beloved"; @Song of Songs 5:5 is that it?
J.T. Quite.
Rem. The saints at Thessalonica had the features of the brethren.
J.T. Yes, they were young believers, but they were brethren beloved by God.
Ques. Would you say the truth of things that is presented in Joseph would lead our souls that way?
J.T. I think that is what the ministry of Joseph is for. The people of God today are scattered abroad in different religious organisations, each of which represents a mother. Hence the training of the children of God is so marred. The Lord is working now to bring us back to the primary thought. Joseph speaks roughly to them, he puts them in prison.
{190}
We need that discipline; to be brought into limitations -- into custody -- where we cannot do as we like. It is a wholesome experience; we learn what it is to be subject in spite of ourselves. Then he releases them and brings one of them into the prison house. The next visit they make he brings them into his house, and they eat with him there. All that is indicative of the kind of ministry the Lord is carrying on to bring His people back into the primary thought of God for them. And then the silver cup comes in, what he used himself. The cup suggests what we are to drink out of. It familiarises us with one another, brings us into intimate relationships. The cup brings out what underlay all their crookedness, and having come back into Joseph's house again, it says, "he was yet there". You may be sure where ministry is effective, we come back in self-judgment, and we shall find the Lord there.
Ques. Would you say all that was necessary that there might be a moral issue reached with them?
J.T. Judah was their spokesman, he speaks about the father, and the younger brother. "My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?" @Genesis 44:19. Now things are being brought home to them -- the claims of the father, and the claims of the brother; what they had been disregarding all the time. Judah is coming to it.
Rem. They reach the family thought last.
Ques. Do you suggest that is the road we have to take?
J.T. I think that is the road.
Ques. What about speaking harshly?
J.T. We need to be woke up. Many of the people of God have no idea where they are, and that they are disregarding the will of God and every divine principle. It is time to speak plainly.
Ques. Do you take it that the prison is the place
{191}
where self-judgment goes on, which paves the way for the kiss?
J.T. I think it is. While Matthew and Mark bring in the thought of doing the will of God, in Luke the relationship is connected with those who hear the word of God and do it; it supposes our being regulated by the thoughts of God, that we are coming nearer to the primary thought. When one sees a Christian beginning to recognise the word of God, there is encouragement to hope for him; he is coming near. He begins to recognise the rights of the brethren. Such are brought to say, "We are verily guilty concerning our brother".
The way Judah makes the acknowledgement concerns them all. Then you have the disclosure on Joseph's part to his brethren, which really corresponds with John 20, "I am Joseph your brother". @Genesis 45:4. He calls attention to his mouth -- "it is my mouth that speaketh unto you"; @Genesis 45:12 then he kissed all his brethren, and after that his brethren talked with him. He had first spoken to them, and that would answer to what the Lord is speaking to us now in view of intimate relations being established as His brethren.
{192}
SUBJECTION TO CHRIST
@Job 38:33; @1 peter 3:1
I have it before me to speak about subjection, having in view that we may see how that in subjection to Christ we may adorn the house of God. In the epistles which speak of the house of God we find references to adornment. In 1 Timothy, in Titus, and in 1 Peter from which I have read, the Holy Spirit refers to adornment, and the references show that it should appear in those who are subject. In 1 Timothy women are to learn in silence in all subjection, and their adornment is not to be that which the world employs, but that which becomes those making profession of the fear of God -- good works. Special consideration is paid by the Spirit to those who, as in the government of God, are in the place of subjection. I do not refer to the subject for the sisters alone, but rather to bring out the thought that adornment in the house of God is dependent on subjection to Christ.
Now God has great regard for adornment. The heavens are said to be adorned, or garnished by the Spirit (see @Job 26:13); the earth, too, is wonderfully adorned; indeed, our persons are divinely adorned physically. I do not suppose there is a creature that is without adornment in some sense from the divine point of view, and so we may readily understand that God is greatly concerned about His house, that it should be adorned, and what we learn is that the adornment is within the range of all. According to the letter to Titus, a slave -- one occupying the most menial position in the lowest grade of society -- is regarded as adorning the doctrine of God our Saviour; @Titus 2:10. Think of the dignity attached to such an one! that in his unqualified subjection he adorns
{193}
the doctrine of God our Saviour -- doctrine being authoritative as enforcing the mind of God. Mark you, it is not "the word", or "the commandment", but "the doctrine", that by which the mind of God is enforced in this world, as Paul taught in the school of Tyrannus; @Acts 19:9.
So the doctrine of God, that which conveys His mind in regard of salvation in an authoritative way -- a way calculated to impress the minds of men -- is to be adorned by one in the very lowest grade of society. Such is the opportunity within the reach of the most obscure of the people of God in this world. And so a sister in her duties or domestic affairs, as in subjection, may be marked by the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit. Let us not suppose for a moment that it is God's thought that this should be found simply in women, for no right-minded believer would wish to be without that which in the sight of God is of great price when he could have it. It is not exclusive, and so I read this verse in Job because God Himself in questioning Job inquires as to the ordinances of the heavens, "Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens?" To know the ordinances, the laws, the statutes of any country requires a life's study and then it were difficult to find two students of law to agree; indeed, there is no regularity in human laws; whereas if we consider the ordinances of the heavens we shall find the most perfect regularity, and we shall not find any enactments overlapping. They come out in a divinely concise form in the first book of the Bible.
One would particularly commend to the attention of all the first chapter of the book of Genesis, where we find God Himself, unsolicited, moving to bring about an order of things which He pronounces in detail to be "very good" -- an order of things which we may call the world, wonderfully regulated and ordered, marvellously ornamented, and replete with
{194}
living intelligence, and all from the hand of God In that chapter we have the ordinances of the heavens ordinances which, in so far as may be, men of every age have profited by. I need not refer to those who profit by the ordinances of the heavens, but they are ordinances which have never had to be revised nor added to, but which stand out in undimmed perfection and lustre throughout all the centuries of the ages of the life of men upon the earth
Every mariner knows what they are to him -- knows these wonderful ordinances of the fourth day when God set great lights in the heavens, the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night, and when "He made the stars also". @Genesis 1:16. God doubtless had in view, among other things, which I hope to refer to, the need of the race in traversing the ocean, for God thought of man. I believe that the mercy of God as a faithful Creator extended all down the way and foreseeing the needs of the race as it multiplied had so ordered the heavens that the treasures of the sea might be available to the race. "He made the stars also". @Genesis 1:16. God did that. Men little think of God's wonderful forethought, holding in reserve unknown lands and continents, in His mercy. Without the stars it were difficult to conceive how they could have been discovered, and so experienced faith says "the sun to rule by day ... the moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever", @Psalm 136:8,9. It is the mercy of God. But one is not concerned in this address about navigation or the discovery of continents, and yet one is encouraged to refer to them as not to be despised in a material way, for "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning", @James 1:17. The ordinances are fixed, and Job is questioned here by God Himself as to what he knew about them and about their relation
{195}
with the earth: "Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?"
This leads me to that well known gospel which presents to us the rule of the heavens upon the earth -- the gospel of Matthew. It treats of the ordinances of the heavens in a spiritual way. It is not simply "heaven", the word is "heavens", the ordinances of the heavens. The wise men of the east to whom Matthew refers in the early part of his gospel, had been accustomed to look up into the heavens, and they had some understanding beyond the ordinary prognosticator of the east, or the ordinary mariner of the west, for neither in his natural ability could divine what *this* star meant "We have seen his star in the east", they say, "and are come to worship him", @Matthew 2:2. They had light in their souls, and in that way represent those who can understand something about the ordinances of the heavens. They were moved by what they saw. It was not an ordinary star; new things were about to be disclosed and the magi represent those who are prepared for new movements in the heavens
Hence the Lord in chapter 5 ascends the mountain. They had followed the star and they had found the Lord in the house with His mother. The disclosure of all that is new comes out, not in the manger, but in the house; @Matthew 2:11. All the precious ordinances which were about to be unfolded lay embodied in that precious Babe in the arms of His mother in the house. Well might they bring forth their precious things as with divine instinct they discern the divine movements of the star. God had made that star. We can well understand that God had reserved it to indicate the wonderful event of the incoming of His Son out of the heavens. He had come in; He had come to earth, and God had surely especially designed that star. To understand Matthew we have got to be prepared for something new; "New things do I
{196}
declare", God says in the prophet; @Isaiah 42:9. The world lay asleep as to it, but these wise men of the east were awake. They were ready for the movements of heaven, they move with them, and they found Him who, as they said, was born "King of the Jews", but not in Jerusalem, for Matthew will always slight Jerusalem. The star led not there, nor to any earthly centre. The point of it is that divine rule is in the heavens and not upon earth. They found the King in the house, and it is befitting that it should be so.
I need not go over the well-known history of the early chapters of Matthew as the Lord began to move out, but we read in chapter 5: "Seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain", @Matthew 5:1 and He sits on the mountain. I trust, beloved, that you may follow what I am saying, so that you may come more definitely under the rule of Christ, under the rule of the heavens. You may say, How could it be the rule of the heavens when Christ was upon earth? Why not? The Father was in the heavens. The Father is the Source of all rule; the Son has taken it up mediatorially. He was a Man under authority here; He has taken it up to "put down all rule and all authority and power" (@1 Corinthians 15:24), as the apostle says, too, "casting down imagination and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ", @2 Corinthians 10:5. But when the Lord has put down all rule and all authority He will deliver back the kingdom to God, even the Father; @1 Corinthians 15:24. As God He has got rights in government, but He is pleased to take them up as Father. Think of the rule of the *Father*! Hence the Lord would disclose the ordinances of the heavens as He ascends the mountain and sits down; He would unfold these wonderful ordinances that the Father had formulated, He who "maketh his sun to
{197}
rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" @Matthew 5:45. They are His ordinances -- the ordinances of the Father. The rights of government belong to God, as it says, "power belongeth unto God" @Psalm 62:11, but He is pleased to exercise His rights of government as the Father. One would urge the young especially to ascend that mount and to listen to the law of His mouth -- "better unto me", as one said, "than thousands of gold and silver", @Psalm 119:72.
The Lord "opened his mouth" and the first word He spoke is 'Blessed'. I think you will find it nine times over as He begins to unfold the ordinances of the heavens, so that it should be determined, as it says here, how they affect the earth. "I say unto you", He says. One says, I will do this or I will do that; another says, I will emigrate and make money and I will take my family afterwards; yet another may say, I will emigrate and make money and come back and spend it. And there are a thousand other suggestions of our wills; but the Lord says, "I say unto you" -- what about that? What does He say? As James says, "If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that", @James 4:15. You say, I do not know the Lord's mind. Then you had better look at this verse, "Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven?" The great principle in understanding the rule of the heavens is subjection. "Dost thou determine their rule over the earth?" -- of these ordinances on the earth? Can you understand how the ordinances of heaven apply on the earth? The first thing, as I said, is the principle of subjection and the next thing is, "I say unto you". How can you have a house beautified and adorned according to God unless there be the full, unqualified acknowledgment of the rights of the Lord Jesus into whose hands the government of God is delivered? It is impossible. There must be unqualified subjection
{198}
to the Lord. Hence the Lord says, "*I* say unto thee".
And then see what you are let into in this subjection. We have the unfolding, the interpretation, and the application of the ordinances of heaven -- the law of His mouth -- to your position, and to my position here upon earth; see what you are led into in entire submission to Christ, in sitting down at His feet and hearing the law of His mouth! The heart is touched with the sense of the blessedness of what is unfolded at the very outset "Blessed", "Blessed", "Blessed", nine times over.
And then, "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time". @Matthew 5:21. The world is full of contradictory tradition, so that the minds of men are perfectly bewildered today by the enactment and the repealment of laws, whereas we have in the Lord Jesus a definite unfolding of imperishable, unalterable laws, and withal laws of blessedness, laws of life, laws governing us in every possible relation in this world -- the ordinances of the heavens come down to earth, unfolded and applied in the most tender, considerate and wise way by Him who came to earth. Is His presence on earth in any way the weakening of the rule of the heavens? No, beloved, it is the establishment of the rule of the heavens in an intelligible way on earth, hence that wonderful sermon on the mountain, beginning with the beatitudes from @Matthew 5:1 to the end of chapter 7, after which, "when Jesus had ended these sayings", He came down from the mount, and those who had heard "were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes". @Matthew 7:28,29. How hesitating the legislators, the lawmakers of this world often are, but here is a Lawgiver of whom it is said, "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come", @Genesis 49:10. You see here the Law-giver, you hear the
{199}
law of His mouth unfolded in the most considerate way, so that it says, "He taught them as having authority". @Matthew 7:29. That is what the soul requires, someone who can speak with divine authority, and yet while unfolding the law -- the ordinances of the heavens, can apply them, rendering them intelligible to us in the most wonderful code that ever existed in human language.
When the Lord had come down from the mountain, He is ready to heal a leper, and the healed leper is to be governed by these laws. The believer, cleansed by the touch of Christ, is to be in this world the expression of the ordinances of the heavens. Hence the next man that comes in in Matthew after the leper is the centurion. He says, as it were, I see the point, you are a Man under authority; I am like that. The centurion discerned in the Lord One here under authority, One who was here on account of God; he says, "I also am a man under authority ... and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bondman, Do this, and he does it", @Matthew 8:9. Now he says to the Lord, "Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed"; he had said too, "I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof". And when Jesus heard it He said, "I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel". It was to another outside of Israel that the Lord said, "O woman, great is thy faith", @Matthew 15:28. I refer to the Canaanitish woman in that chapter; she discerned the Lord, and accepted His designation of her, that she was but a dog relatively, one who had that place in the government of God in this world. But she ceased to be a dog spiritually, for a woman who has great faith is not a dog, she is material for the house of God. She is a cedar of Lebanon, as it were, about to be fitted in there to reflect the ordinances of the heavens, for the cherubim were carved upon the cedar in the house.
{200}
The house of God is to be the reflection of the ordinances of the heavens, so we ourselves, coming under the influence of the law of His mouth, will reflect them. The ordinances of the heavens are reflected in the assembly; all the gracious consideration of heaven, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit, to whom we are baptised, is found within the walls of the house of God. That is the divine effect of the ornamentation. Think of the magnitude of our position that we should become ornamental in the house of God! It could only be as in subjection. Hence, as we see in Peter's epistle, the wife is taken up by the Spirit as in subjection; she is taken up to call attention to this wonderful adornment in the house of God, "the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price". That is what God looks for, that is what God is aiming at, that there is to be a testimony to the truth of the house of God which is "the pillar and base of the truth". @1 Timothy 3:15.
The truth involves every feature of the revelation of God as presented to us in the four gospels. The house is intended to be great enough to sustain all. Think of the position, dear brethren, of the house of God, to maintain His rights in government, His rights in service, His rights in grace, His rights in love. These things in a brief way suggest to us the truth that came out perfectly in Jesus who said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life". @John 14:6. Truth is there in all its infinite perfection in Christ. It is now in the assembly; it could be there only as she is in subjection to Christ. The Holy Spirit is given to those who obey Him. No one who exercises his own will should speak about having the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God is hampered and hindered where our wills are active, but as our souls are subdued under Christ, subject to Christ, the Holy Spirit is free and He works out these wonderful traits in us, foreshadowed in the
{201}
tabernacle, and especially in the temple -- the ornamental features of the house of God. He loves to work them out in the saints as He has a free hand by our subjection to Christ.
May God lead us to it, dear brethren! It is a wonderful moment we are in -- the end of the period; the Lord is, as it were, finishing the work of the assembly, and as was said, He would beautify it. Ezra speaks about beautifying the house of God, that is, in the recovery he did not as a priest overlook the interior of the house of God. God put it into the heart of the king of Persia to beautify the house of God. And God will do that now by bringing about in His people entire subjection to Christ, and, indeed, we may say, in submitting to one another in the fear of Christ, so that there may be a free hand for the Spirit to weave out, to trace out these adorning features of the house of God, one of which is a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price.

INTIMACY
@Genesis 45:12 - 15; @2 Kings 2:4,6,8 - 14; @Romans 16:16
I have in mind to speak about intimacy, first as with the Lord, and then spiritual intimacy with one another. I may say at the outset that what underlies this intimacy is love -- a known love. John speaks not only of what may have been heard of by way of testimony, but of a known love. He speaks of love first as known objectively, as he says, "because he has laid down his life for us" (@1 John 3:16); but if that knowledge is to be maintained, it must be by the Spirit; hence John in his epistle brings in the Spirit, saying, "Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, that he has given to us of his Spirit", @1 John 4:13. The Canticles correspond somewhat with John's first epistle; it treats of love, but not what I would call a known love. It would be impossible to understand what might be called the emotional, or poetical books of the Old Testament except as we understand love. As reading them, we are enabled, through having love by the Spirit, to fill out, so to speak, the blanks. The most casual reader of the Canticles will observe a certain uneasiness in the feminine speaker; settled peace through redemption was not known, and the Holy Spirit was not given. The state of many a believer at the present time corresponds; love is known to exist in Christ, but through ignorance and carelessness it is not known as in union with Christ. No one really can know love in continuity except as in union, and when I use that word it is not as having any special light upon it beyond that it involves the possession of the Spirit, which is really elementary; the possession of the Spirit underlies union.
{203}
There is in Romans the idea of a descending love and there is also the idea of an ascending love. It is in the maintenance of these two thoughts in power in the soul that union is understood and love known as a permanent possession. If the ascent does not correspond with the descent, something has intervened, for, to use a simple figure, water always rises to its own level; hence the love of God that is shed abroad in the heart of the believer by the Spirit is intended to return to its source. In Romans 5 it is seen in its descent; it is a pure, holy, untainted, and untaintable stream; it comes in there on the line of the administration of the Lord; it is His glory to bring it into our hearts, and so it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us. I refer to that particularly because God notifies us, as it were, at the outset as to the incoming of love that it is brought in by the Holy Spirit and shed abroad in our hearts. Having it in the heart we look at everything that seems to be adverse in this world as in our favour: "tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us". @Romans 5:4,5.
Then in chapter 8 the Spirit is spoken of as the Spirit of adoption. It is the Spirit of God's Son really, and what marks it as such is ascent -- "whereby we cry, Abba, Father". @Romans 8:15. In the light of John 20 we can understand how the Holy Spirit (the Spirit of sonship) as indwelling us moves towards the Father, and so as the chapter proceeds we are told that "all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose". @Romans 8:28. It is not only specified things, but *all* things, and they work *together*. Those who love God -- the water thus rising to its level -- are of such interest to Him now that "all things work together for good". There is
{204}
thus a constant movement of the Spirit of God -- the descending and the ascending movement which ensures the permanency of love in a living way in the heart of the Christian. I do not proceed beyond that as regards union; that is the basis of it. Romans gives us the principle of things. The germ of everything is in Romans to be worked out later; hence the value of that epistle.
The emotional books of the Old Testament, as I took the liberty of calling them, are only understood and enjoyed by those who know love. In that way they become a constant delight to the soul; and I may say here that one knows very little of spiritual emotions and one is assured that what one knows as to oneself is, alas! general. The emotional books are the very heart of Scripture. It is well to have light, but God looks for emotion; not the movements of the flesh, surely, but the emotions which the Holy Spirit would produce in relation to God and in relation to Christ. Even Romans gives us examples of spiritual emotion; at the end of chapter 11, and again at the end of chapter 16, we find instances. I refer to that because one would desire to see substance in what is presented to God.
The Lord in John's gospel reaches quickly the thought of the worship of the Father; He reaches it as having brought in the Spirit, not as in the way of shedding abroad the love of God in our hearts, but as the power for the purification of the affections. John presents to us the Holy One, and to have part with Him implies holiness; but before we can have holiness we must have purity, for holiness is in advance of purity. Elihu in the book of Job chapter 37:6 says, "For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth". @Job 37:6. That refers in type to the life of Jesus as a witness on the part of God to the purity that He looks for. John 4 explains how that purity is to be brought about: "The water that I shall give him
{205}
shall be in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life". @John 4:14. Immediately upon that He speaks about the worship of the Father; He says, "God is a *spirit"*. That; is a word we do well to take notice of. We have to do with God, and God is a Spirit. The Lord had laid the foundation for it in His discourse with Nicodemus, "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit"; @John 3:6 and He had said that one had to be born of water. Being born of water is negative, but if I have the Spirit as a fountain in me, that is not negative but positive, and in the power of it I can worship God "in spirit and in truth". @John 4:24. Then, as I said, holiness is in advance of that. Holiness is in the *Holy* Spirit. John does not use the expression *Holy* Spirit often; where he does use it, it is in reference to the state of the saints. Thus in chapter 1 we have, "He it is who baptises with the *Holy* Spirit". @John 1:33. In chapter 20 He says, "Receive ye *Holy* Spirit". @John 20:22. I dwell upon that because it is so essential, if we are to worship God, that it should be a *holy* worship, and that can only be as the Holy Spirit sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts.
Now having said that I would like to refer for a moment to Joseph, because he is a type of the Lord as adjusting relations between brethren, and in the adjustment we are led on to the thought of intimacy. Joseph appeals to them, and says, "Behold your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you". He had spoken roughly to them before. Some of us know what that means, and it may be that some of us need to be spoken roughly to even now. It is no unkindness, for "faithful are the wounds of a friend", @Proverbs 27:6. Joseph not only spoke roughly to them, but he had put them in custody. It is no kindness for those who are in any way governed by self-will to be allowed liberty among the people of God; it is neither kind to themselves nor to the people of God.
{206}
It indicates impotency, if one is allowed to move about at large who is governed by self-will. God would not have it so; He has given us the means of limiting such. Joseph had those means and he employed them, and it led to repentance and to recovery; it led to the acknowledgment of the rights and affections of a father and to the rights and affections of a brother. Without these, there can be no peace among the people of God. As Judah, representing the ten, acknowledges the rights and affections of the father and the affections of the brother, Joseph makes himself known; @Genesis 44:18 - 34; chapter 45:1. The Lord cannot own us otherwise. The way is then open for intimacy. Joseph calls attention to his mouth; "it is my mouth", he says, "that speaketh unto you".
Then it says, "he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck". Benjamin represents the brother; he had no part in the crime, but he had to suffer with those who committed it. We may thank God if there is a Benjamin where there has been general departure. Benjamin comes in for a special recognition. The Lord is perfectly just, and Benjamin has the first embrace. The balances of the sanctuary are beyond any human balances; they are divine, and the Lord is infinitely fair in the bestowal of His affections: "Mary", He says, "hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her". @Luke 10:42. No doubt she would share it with others, for love is ready to share, but it is *hers;* she never loses it; it is the reward of devotedness.
But Joseph kissed *all* his brethren too. Esau says to Isaac, "Bless me -- me also, my father". @Genesis 27:34. Isaac typically is Christ risen, and we are told that "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau". @Hebrews 11:20. He had more than one blessing, but there is a special one for devotedness. The Lord says to Philadelphia, "I will
{207}
make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee". @Revelation 3:9. Think of that -- the recompense of love! "If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned". @Song of Songs 8:7. The Lord knows how to value it. Then it says, "He kissed *all* his brethren, and wept upon them". Benjamin wept upon his neck, but we are not told that the ten wept upon his neck, but after Joseph kissed them we read that "his brethren *talked with him*".
May I enquire, especially of the young ones here, have you ever talked with the Lord? You get it in Canticles, as I was remarking. He says, "Let me hear thy voice". @Song of Songs 2:14. It is not taking up well-known phraseology, that is not talking with the Lord at all, He has heard that before many a time; what He looks for is the outcome of love -- freshness -- like the Psalmist, "*My* heart is inditing a good matter; *1* speak of the things which *I* have made touching the King". @Psalm 45:1. What about that?
The Lord's supper is really the expression of the love of Christ; it corresponds with the kiss of Joseph. The intent of it is to maintain continual freshness in our hearts. The love of Christ is as fresh and vigorous as it was when He died. "That ye may know", says the apostle, "the love of Christ which passeth knowledge", @Ephesians 3:16 - 19. It is like the *fresh* jawbone of the ass which Samson used, as one has often remarked. The Lord's supper brings the death of Christ very near, as near as if it were today; that is the intent of it, so that there should be a corresponding freshness in our souls. Hence it says, "*after that* his brethren talked with him". They had talked with him before in the way of remonstrance, in the way of importunity and in the way of confession, but now it is a question of liberty.
We are not told what they said. The point is not what we say to the Lord, but that we are speaking
{208}
with Him, that we have liberty of soul with Him -- we have something to say to Him. The natural memory is of no value at all in the things of God; the principle is five words with the understanding. Two things are spoken of in the first epistle to the Corinthians -- ten thousand instructors (@1 Corinthians 4: 15), and ten thousand words; @1 Corinthians 14: 19. Beware of these! It is *one* father and *five* words. These are the features that stand out against the ten thousand instructors and ten thousand words. The Lord does not need the ten thousand words, but the five words spoken with the understanding will be for the edification of the assembly.
Well, as we said, Joseph's brethren talked *with* him after he had kissed and wept upon them. That is what I would call a family scene. It was private, for Joseph had said, "Cause every man to go out from me" @Genesis 45:1; nevertheless as he wept aloud the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. It is like the music in Luke 15, hints of it should go abroad. There are such things as adjusted family relations, and reciprocated affections, and everyone should know something about these. It is not that you cast your pearls before swine, but Joseph raised his voice in weeping and the Egyptians heard it.
Now I want to say a word on the scripture we read in the book of Kings as to intimacy with the Lord in regard of His interests. We are admitted into the family circle as adjusted, and "perfect love casteth out fear", @1 John 4:18 so that we have liberty to speak to the Lord, but now, what about the interests of the Lord?
Elijah in a special way represents Christ here as the vessel of the testimony of God. He stood for it. I do not refer to his breakdown; that is not the point here. If God reinstates a man in His service, it is not for us to question. Elijah is in the full vigour of service and he begins with Gilgal, the first great
{209}
feature of God's testimony as Israel entered into the land. Then he goes to Bethel, the next great feature, for the house is always in prospect, indeed it was a long-known thought in Israel from the days of Jacob. Then he goes to Jericho, representing the power of God as overthrowing the world; and then to Jordan. The Lord is infinitely interested in every phase of the testimony of God, and in recovery nothing is omitted. We may overlook and ignore things, but the Lord never does. Elisha may be taken to represent one interested in the testimony. It is not now a question of family relationships; that does not appear here at all. Elijah had been told to anoint Elisha, it was a question of the testimony; so what is seen first of all in Elisha is respectful regard for Elijah, and as I was remarking lately, instead of anointing Elisha, Elijah casts his mantle upon him; it was for Elisha to fill that in his service. It is surely a matter of great concern, for no one can enter rightly into service who has not a model before him. You may think you are doing well, preaching well, and speaking well, but what about that model? What about that cloak? Have you come up to that? That is the principle of the testimony of God, and your safety is in clinging to the Lord; He says, "Learn from me". @Matthew 11:29. You may learn from Levites who have been longer in the service, but the great model is the Lord, and let us never have a lower standard before us; God has no lower standard. The equipment is available, but if we come short of it, let us admit it, and the admission will be our salvation. So Elisha clings to Elijah, intimating that he discerned in Elijah the divine thought.
Christ is the divine thought of a vessel; Luke presents that to us. Elijah tests Elisha: he says, "Tarry here"; but Elisha says, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, *I will not leave thee"*. One would take that home to one's heart; it is the essence
{210}
of our salvation in regard of the testimony of God. That principle is to work out in every bit of service that we render. Elijah tests Elisha at every point, and finally they went on, intimacy becoming more evident, and they cross the Jordan. I cannot dwell upon it; it is a wonderful theme. I connect it with the epistle to the Colossians, for now intimacy is to be in correspondence with the Lord -- with Christ; that is the principle of Colossians, correspondence in obscurity, going out of sight. The word 'hidden' is a feature of Colossians. Things are hidden; our very life is said to be "hid" with Christ in God. That saves us from all desire or effort to be conspicuous in any way. If there be a feature in us which is inconsistent with the Lord, He will talk to us; but there cannot be free intercourse with the Lord until we are restored. Elijah and Elisha walked and talked together. If there be correspondence with the Lord, then it is mutual. There is nothing more blessed than mutual communications with the Lord -- intimate intercourse with Him.
In verse 11 it says, "It came to pass as they *still went on and talked"*. Elisha had been saying up to this, "I will not leave thee". That is a phrase that should become living in every one of our souls; the Lord tests us in that way. But now instead of the subject of the conversation being given it says, "As they still went on and talked". How delightful! It is a Colossian scene typically; we are circumcised in His circumcision, the reproach of Egypt rolled away, "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead, and you ... hath he quickened together with him" @Colossians 2:12,13; we are made to live in the life of Christ.
One might enlarge on this wonderful theme set forth in type in these two as they still went and talked; we are led on into Ephesians, that is, to the power of God, for "behold, there appeared a chariot
{211}
of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder". Elisha comes into the power of the heavenly Man -- for that is what is prefigured. It is Ephesians; we come into the power of God working in us here, so that we may stand for the testimony, but the intimacy that precedes that enables us to stand intelligently in the use of that power; we know the mind of the Lord. One would dwell upon it -- talking with the Lord in the light of His interests here.
How often do we have seasons with the Lord *going over the ground*? It may be in the sleepless hours of the night; an excellent opportunity for reviewing things with Him. In a way, I know of no service more to be valued than prayer in this sense -- as in correspondence with the Lord, having nothing to confess, nothing to intrude, but to be with Him in restfulness of heart in regard of the testimony here. When you wake up the next day to take up the service, you will find the chariots of fire and the horses of fire; you will find what Elisha found -- the power of God all round you and in you, for there is no limit with God.
I would like to say a word now about mutual intimacy, that is, with one another. We get it in the verse I read in Romans 16: "Salute one another with a holy kiss". This exhortation is found in other epistles; it is found in the first and second epistles to the Corinthians, but I connected it with this epistle because it is, as we all know, the gospel or elementary epistle, and therefore it brings in every believer in Christ. The word 'salute' is repeated many times in the chapter. I believe it occurs twenty times. This has to be noted. How often do we salute each other? The word is well known; it is used in a military sense perhaps in a stronger way than it is used in this verse, but to say the least it involves respect, and we shall never love the saints unless we respect them; how important, therefore, it is to respect the brethren. Taking account of
{212}
them in the most elementary way enables you to see how great they are. They are addressed in this epistle as saints, and the word 'brethren' is used too, but the epistle takes account of us as having believed the gospel, and twenty times over we get from the great apostle of the Gentiles himself salutations; he saluted the poorest saint in Rome. You might say, He would salute the emperor. No doubt; but he is saluting the saints in Rome. He might have used the word 'salute', and then have given a list of the brethren, but he does not do that; each one has to be saluted. Then he says, "Salute one another with a holy kiss". It is not only those who are in my set socially or otherwise, but "one another". It lays down the principle of intimacy among the people of God from the very outset.
Then he says, "*All* the assemblies of Christ salute you". We see how in the wisdom of God the great apostle lays the basis for respect between the east and the west. The feeling between the east and the west is almost as old as humanity, and the Spirit of God takes account of that. The apostle's great labours up to this time were in the east; "from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum" @Romans 15:19 he had fully preached the gospel of Christ, but now the east and the west were to be linked up in mutual respect. "All the assemblies of Christ salute you". The saints in Rome, rich and poor, old and young, male and female, are to be saluted, and they are saluted by the great apostle of the Gentiles, and they are saluted by all the assemblies of Christ. Now, he says, "Salute one another". You are to maintain this high standard of mutual respect; we in the east respect you in Christ, and see that you respect one another, and do so in holiness; let your kiss be a *holy* kiss.
{213}
DIVINE SUSTENANCE FOR TESTIMONY AT THE END
@Psalm 104:15,16; @Genesis 27:26 - 28; @Matthew 25:1 - 10; @Revelation 22:16, 17
The exercise that I have had in view of this meeting is as to how the assembly is to finish its course, how it is to quit the scene of its testimony -- whether it is to leave in corresponding dignity to that in which it began its course in this world. It was set up, as we all know, not only in dignity in the way of position and of title, but in the furnishing from the Lord that was meet for such a dignity and position; "in everything ye are enriched by him", @1 Corinthians 1:5.
I referred, therefore, to the Psalms, because in the passage read we have God's provision for man, that is, for man as His representative in the creation. The psalm throughout speaks of God's wonderful faithfulness in providing for all His creatures, but when the Spirit comes to man, we have provided for him that which should in every way sustain him in the creation as God's representative. We have wine to gladden his heart, oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart; these three features were intended to set man up so as to represent God in the dignity that was fitting. They contemplate man in redemption rather than man as created. Not that God has surrendered His thought in man in creation, for He has not; God never surrenders any thought of His, but His thoughts find fulfilment only in redemption. Hence in Christ here we have set out the divine thought in man, for Adam was but a figure of Him that was to come. We read nothing about wine in Genesis 1 and 2. We do find it later as the product of Noah's husbandry; not, however, to bring about a dignified representation of God, but the opposite, alas! It waited for the
{214}
Lord Jesus to bring out these features in man -- a heart gladdened by the wine of God, a face shining with the oil of God, and a manhood that was marked as that bread which came down from heaven, whose meat and drink it was to do the will of Him that sent Him. The thought of God was that that should be continued, that there should be here a representation in keeping with that.
In the gospel of Luke we have developed what Christ was here. At His sepulchre there were two men; we are to have adequate testimony to what shone under God's eye in Christ -- the wine in the Spirit, the oil in the Spirit, and the bread which is the humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ -- the bread of God which came down from heaven to give His flesh for the life of the world. Thus in verse 15, while we get the divine thought set forth in Christ, in the next verse we get the trees of the Lord spoken of -- the testimony here corresponding to Christ. These are not the men of history known to this world. "The trees of Jehovah are satisfied" -- for that is how it should read -- representing men moving about in this world under the direction of the Lord Jesus, satisfied. The world and its evil have nothing to offer to seduce and attract them; they are satisfied. I have no doubt that in the apostle Paul we have set out this great idea. I touch on it just for a moment so that we may see the great place that man has in the divine thoughts, and that that should be sustained according to those thoughts. The furnishings are ample; we have in the apostle the idea of a man -- a Jew, indeed, with all the advantages after the flesh that any Jew could have, but his testimony had reference to the Man Christ Jesus, and his ministry was to build that up in the saints.
So that in writing to the Corinthians, who were influenced by the principles of the world and were walking as men of this world, and who had laid but
{215}
little hold of the divine idea of the trees of the Lord -- of men divinely satisfied and built up after Christ, the apostle has to refer to what he might have kept secret, but which, indeed, should have been known to them in a moral way -- for he had been amongst them eighteen months or more -- that is, to "a man in Christ" whom *he* knew. Morally he should have been known amongst *them* but their measure was according to man in the flesh; "these", he says, "measuring themselves by themselves ... are not wise" (@2 Corinthians 10:12); that was the standard they had. Paul's standard was different from that. He apprehended Christ as a Man before God, a Man who spoke to him out of heaven in the Hebrew language, saying, "I am Jesus" @Acts 9:5; he laid hold of the divine thought in Christ as He is, so he says, "Henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more", @2 Corinthians 5:16. It was Christ in another sphere, in another condition. Then later he says, "I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago ... caught up to the third heaven", @2 Corinthians 12:2. Was ever such a tree in paradise?
Paul, most surely, was one of the trees of Jehovah, satisfied, one of the cedars of Lebanon which He had planted! The paradise of God is to be ornamented with such trees. The tree of life is there in Jesus; but there are to be trees there, and Paul was one of them. He has to refer to that, "I know a man in Christ". But it is not peculiar to the great apostle; it is the divine thought for *every one* of us. In the Authorised Version it says, "The trees of the Lord are full of sap"; but that is not the thought exactly, although it is true they are full of life, but they are *satisfied* in the dignity in which God has set them and they spurn the dignity of this world; they are beyond it. That is the testimony that God intended to be continued here in a *moral way* in the absence of Christ.
{216}
I say in a moral way, for the apostle's reference to himself in the first epistle was as "the filth of the world ... the offscouring of all things", @1 Corinthians 4:13. The apostles accepted this; God had set them to be such as in the testimony; it is the corresponding effect of one's heavenly calling.
Now God has not surrendered His thought. The title -- the dignity, is accorded to us, and the supplies are available; the question is, whether we are appropriating this wine, this oil, and this bread; and whether we are to *go out* as men in Christ characteristically, for how shall we be caught up otherwise? "Caught up to the third heaven", @2 Corinthians 12:2 he says. God would have it that we should go up in that dignity, and *that* dignity refers to *that* place; the corresponding moral dignity is that we are hidden here. We go up in private. The Lord went out of this world publicly by the cross, but He went up into heaven privately, "the world seeth me no more" (@John 14:19), and His disciples saw Him no more in this scene, but "this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven [what dignity there was in that], shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven", @Acts 1:11. Shall we appreciate seeing Him come that way, or shall we "be ashamed before him at his coming"? @1 John 2:28.
Now in regard of Jacob, what I want to say is that in him God sets out the idea of "a field". Jacob is a believer here under the discipline of God; these things run together, as I hope to show. Isaac says to Jacob, "Come near now, and kiss me". Very few of us -- one has to admit it as to oneself -- understand divine kissing; it has to be learned. God has to show us the way of it, and He has done it. The father of the prodigal "ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him", @Luke 15:20. I suppose it is, caressingly. As the Holy Spirit comes into our souls He gives us to know the depths of the love expressed in that figure.
{217}
It says he *fell* on the prodigal's neck and kissed him. Then in Joseph we have typically the kiss of our Lord Jesus Christ; as Paul says, "who loved me, and gave himself for me", @Galatians 2:20. The apostle was made to realise the warmth of the kiss of Christ, and so he enjoins the saints at Rome, at Corinth, and elsewhere to kiss and to kiss holily. We have to begin the path of discipline, the path of testimony for God, with a kiss, or it will grow irksome and we shall become hirelings. It has to be in love, and Isaac says, "Kiss me ... my son"; and as Jacob drew near, Isaac smelled the smell of his raiment. What kind of an odour was it? Not an odour of this world, "The smell of my son is as the smell of a *field* which the Lord hath blessed: therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven ... and plenty of corn and wine".
The idea of a field has a great place in Scripture, but this is a unique reference, and I take it to correspond with Acts 1 and 2. I think Acts 1 is like a field; there was never a field like that before. The Lord had been looking after it; it was the smell of a field which Jehovah had blessed. What wonderful potentialities were in that field! But they should be developed through discipline. We all know the agricultural processes which bring about a desired crop, and so we can understand the history of Jacob. What a brilliant end he had! Would that one could reckon on such an end for oneself, and for the assembly! He went out of this world like the sun in its splendour; he went out at the end of his course worshipping. God had a wonderful crop in that field. Jacob had the mind of God and he worshipped in intelligence. Shall we go out like that, dear brethren? We shall do so only as we understand the supplies.
The supplies which Acts 2 indicates remain; and so, in speaking to Esau later, Isaac goes on to say, "With corn and new wine have I supplied him". @Genesis 27:37.
{218}
The supplies were there; the position was great, the mind of God about Jacob was wonderful, but the supplies were equal to it. Thus, as set here in the testimony of God, for that is what Jacob represents, we *must* come under discipline: "whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth" @Hebrews 12:6; but it is to develop His field. He will not be diverted from that; the king himself, we are told, lives by the field; @Ecclesiastes 5:9. God will have His crop; hence the discipline which every one of us has to go through. Shall we go through it and come out at the end like Jacob? See the brilliancy, as I said, of his departure! possessed with the mind of God, guiding his hands wittingly, worshipping, and indicating the history of his sons with perfect accuracy from his own knowledge of God and His ways -- there is the end that God has in mind for us, as availing ourselves of the corn and the *new* wine. Jacob was to be sustained with corn and *new* wine. Those of us who have tasted it and enjoyed it are not wont to say, "The old is better" @Luke 5:39; the more one experiences of the divine path, the path of faith, the more one values what is new. Anyone who is given to speaking of old things, unless he speak of the new first, has lost the sense of the new wine.
If we are inclined to say "The old is better", our speech betrays us. We have not followed, alas, the fresh vigour of what God supplies for His people! I urge upon you the importance of cultivating what is new, not what is novel, but what is new spiritually, what is new according to God, for freshness is what marks God's activities. "There is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of God", @Psalm 46:4. A river suggests energy and freshness. Thus Jacob was to be sustained with corn and new wine.
Jacob sets forth the saints viewed, not as the "man in Christ", of whom I have been speaking, although it is a correlative idea, but viewed as under discipline,
{219}
and the result of that discipline which involves a crop for God. If God sets out an idea, He does not relinquish it. God's intent now is to bring to pass that we should go out, as Jacob went out, in brilliancy.
Now in Matthew 25 we have an assembly idea. It is a parable of the kingdom of the heavens, but it refers, as you will observe, to the virgins. We are not now occupied with manhood, or the discipline of God, or the testimony of God exactly, but we are occupied with affection for Christ. Is the assembly to finish her course here as she began it? I think the parable answers in a definite affirmative, and one has great encouragement in it. The number is reduced by one half, but what God looks for is not quantity, but quality. Ten would suggest to us the responsibility attaching to the assembly in her virgin betrothal to Christ. Five brings down the thought to one of weakness, but notwithstanding the weakness, there is the possession of the oil -- of that which carries us through. The oil refers to the Holy Spirit as sustaining us as luminous in this world, and He suffices to guide us, and to sustain us to the end. Let us then recognise the Spirit in the fullest and most absolute way. There is enough in the Spirit for us viewed as espoused to Christ; as Paul says, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ". @2 Corinthians 11:2. The Lord lays great store by the espousals: "in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart", @Song of Songs 3:11. But of what value is the espousal unless there be the corresponding affection for Christ? We are now in the presence of what is collective, of the assembly's proper relation to Christ whilst He is away; are we in accord with the virgin thought, that chastity of love for Christ that refuses the influence of the tempter? "Lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity
{220}
that is in Christ". @2 Corinthians 11:3. The Lord would preserve us in simplicity as to Christ; He would bring in the simplicity that marks Himself; as the apostle says to the Colossians, "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him", @Colossians 2:6.
Again he says, "I ... beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ", @2 Corinthians 10:1. We are to have these thoughts in our souls so as to be preserved in simplicity as to Christ, and to be in accord with Him in the power of the Spirit. I believe the epistle to the Colossians is to bring about correspondence with Christ; as ye have received Him. How did they receive Him; how was He presented to them in the gospel? It is thus that we are to walk in Him, rooted and built up in Him, for "in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily", @Colossians 2:9. All that God is is in Christ; and although we speak of the simplicity in Christ all the fulness of the Godhead, is there bodily. And then we are filled full in Him, so that we need nothing outside of Christ. What spiritual independence the epistle to the Colossians gives the saints! Like Elisha, we, as risen with Him and as quickened with Him, can walk with Him and talk with Him, and in that way we become intimate with the Lord.
The rapture will not be a surprise to those who are accustomed to walk and talk with Christ over Jordan; hence he says, "Seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God". @Colossians 3:1 - 3. It will be a question only of change of position; the rapture will be no surprise if we are in entire correspondence with Christ. It is this that sustains us in virgin character here. "And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the Bridegroom!" -- that is how it should read; it is not exactly a question of His coming. There are those
{221}
at the present time who make much of His coming, and surely it is a great subject, but the point here is *Himself*. And the five wise virgins having oil in their vessels with their lamps, go forth to meet Him, and they enter in; they go the whole way. This is in keeping with Matthew's way; he shows us the end of things, and how precious is the thought, as having gone forth, to enter in to the marriage! Already the Bridegroom is known in a well-known love, so there will be no surprise with those who, in the truth and reality of Colossians, maintain communion with Him.
The sequel of it all is presented in the last passage read. The Lord says, "I Jesus". I think He is saying that now. He addressed Himself to Paul in that way, and now He is saying, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches". What faithfulness! During all these centuries that wonderful ministry has been carried on, judicial indeed though it be, nevertheless to be valued by those who love Him. It is Jesus who does it. The great recovery we are benefiting from now is the fruit of the whole course of His judicial dealings in professing Christendom, and those who love Him know it. And then the love that could add, "I ... have sent mine angel". Let us not neglect that testimony, the testimony to the seven assemblies that were in Asia; Philadelphia is one of them, and that testimony remains in all its force. The angel, so to say, is witnessing it at the present moment, and the point of all the letters to the assemblies is to be an overcomer; that is the great result. Jacob was an overcomer. God looks for that, and, as the Lord says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches", *love understands*. Then He says, "I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star". We are now on the threshold of another day; we are in the
{222}
presence of the root and offspring of David, but we are also in the presence of the bright and morning star, which means the introduction of another day. How it should stir our hearts, dear brethren, that wonderful day of glory, and inspire us to more strenuous devotedness! As He says here, "Let him that heareth say, Come ... and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely"; that is the maintenance of the attitude of God by those who hear.
Now I want to refer to the word, "and the Spirit and the bride say, Come". It is not that they *should* say Come, but they *do* say it. The Holy Spirit has completed His mission, so to speak. The Comforter -- He who has come out to bring the assembly to Christ -- has secured her. Wonderful result! What a wonderful triumph! The Lord is, I believe, leading up to it amongst us in the way He is presenting Himself to us; this cry of "Come" is, I believe, audible, and it is how God intends that the assembly shall finish her sojourn here. "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready". @Revelation 19:7. That is a subjective readiness. She *has made herself* ready. And then it says, "To her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints". @Revelation 19:8. God has granted her to be arrayed thus.
{223}
*Pages 223 to 335 -- "The Lord's Movements in Relation to the Assembly". 1924 (Volume 66)*.
THE LORD'S MOVEMENTS IN RELATION TO THE ASSEMBLY
@Song of Songs 2:8 - 10; @Song of Songs 4:16; @Song of Songs 5:1; @Song of Songs 6:1 - 3
What I have in my mind in connection with this meeting is to speak about the movements of Christ as they are to be known during the period of the assembly's sojourn here. Scripture also speaks clearly and distinctly about His movements later, when He will return to take up His rights on the earth. He will come out of heaven, we are told, the armies that are in heaven following Him @Revelation 19:14, "His feet", as we read in the prophet Zechariah, "shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives", @Zechariah 14:4. The gospels make much of His movements when He was here upon earth. The lover of Christ feeds his soul in tracing out that path; not only the way, but the very footsteps of Jesus afford delight to those who love Him. Faith spoke of Him in the prophet: "his going forth is assured as the morning dawn" @Hosea 6:3; so that the Scriptures abound with references to His movements.
But I wish to confine what I have to say to His movements during the assembly's sojourn here -- His movements in relation to her. It is important to remember that these movements have heaven as their base. Indeed, as one thinks of them one cannot but revert to that wonderful movement of His referred to in John 20, which I believe should appeal to us of the assembly in a peculiar way. The Lord refers to it in speaking to one who loved Him pre-eminently -- Mary. He says to her, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father", @John 20:17
{224}
That word would appeal to her heart. She knew the movements of the Lord in the days of His flesh; she knew something about His path, and what it meant, and now she hears the word 'ascended'. To her it would answer to the reference in the prophet, "his going forth is assured as the morning dawn". The night of weeping was over, the sorrows were all behind, and a new day had begun to dawn, and, as we understand it now through subsequent light of the assembly's day, it is a day without an evening.
Then He went on further to say to her, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God". @John 20:17. She was to carry into the bosom of that circle the light of that wonderful movement of Christ -- His ascension into heaven. Later they saw Him go up and the light of that was carried into the bosom of the circle and was to remain there. It was as the "morning dawn". You can understand how all subsequent movement would have heaven as its base. He was ascending to Him who was His Father and their Father, His God and their God. That is the position for us. The assembly began with that precious light of His ascension into heaven, so that subsequent movements would all subserve that light. They would maintain, among other things, in the circle of the saints the heavenly atmosphere, the heavenly grace of Christ, indeed, the very life of the assembly would hinge on these movements, for as He lived, the assembly would live, and those who form the assembly would see Him. "The world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also", @John 14:19. The very life of that circle was to be dependent upon the movements that were to follow.
One would love to convey to the saints the divine thought of elevation. The thought of brethren dwelling together in unity in the well-known Psalm 133
{225}
is connected with elevation. I refer to this because of the constant tendency with us to drop to the level of the religious circles around us. The goodness and the pleasantness of brethren dwelling together in unity are connected with elevation; indeed, we read of God building His sanctuary like the heights. See @Psalm 78:69. We have a sure footing, but in maintaining the foundation let us not forget the heights! "He built his sanctuary like the heights", and so in the psalm I referred to we have the ointment from the head of Christ, that is to say, it refers to what He is personally. Whether in heaven or on earth He is the same Person; the ointment is from the head of Aaron; the dignity of Christ flows down to the skirts of His garments; the heart is occupied with His personal appearance.
But then there is the dew of Hermon, which is not only connected with His Person, but with His position; "the dew of Hermon that descendeth", @Psalm 133:3 so that the moral fibre of the saints is built up upon these lines -- Christ personally in His dignity, and then His position in heaven. The latter maintains us above the level of current religion. Let us beware of finding ourselves on the level of current religion. The admission amongst us of fleshly sentiments, national feelings, local prejudices, family traditions, all these things, with many others, tend to drag us down to the level of current accredited religion in the world; whereas the setting of the truth of the assembly is to maintain us in spiritual elevation. If everything in the way of intelligence comes from Christ, as the precious ointment from the Head, there is no room amongst us for natural ability, or for the religious training that we may acquire in this world; all that is shut out. If we see that the things come from above, we refuse all that is beneath as unholy and unfit for such a circle. And so the movements of the Lord are as it were above. I do not deny that He comes to the
{226}
level of His failing people, for He does, as we see in Revelation, where He is seen walking "in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks" @Revelation 1:13 in the garb of a judge, with eyes as a flame of fire. This is a solemn fact indeed for the people of God, and for all who profess His name on earth!
But I do not speak of that, I speak rather of the normal movements of Christ, so that the loved one here, who may be taken to represent those who love the Lord today, says, "The voice of my beloved!" in an exclamation. I wonder if we have all heard that. It thrills the heart as it is first heard. The sequel shews that she was in surroundings not wholly suitable, nevertheless she had the ear trained sufficiently by a knowledge of the Lord to recognise His voice. That ear has to be attended to. How often the saints of God are deceived by voices. Even a Joshua missed it as he descended from the mount with Moses; he thought he heard the noise of war, whereas he heard the noise of mirth, the noise of an idolatrous song; @Exodus 32:17,18. So one would seek to be impressed as to the importance of an exercised ear, indeed a circumcised ear. "Doth not the ear try words", says one; @Job 12:11. Alas, many of us allow all kinds of words through that organ to the defilement of the whole moral being. We have to learn to try words and to refuse the defiling words, to stop our ears from hearing of blood @Isaiah 33:15, so that we may be ready for the voice of the Beloved.
But then she describes Him as coming. She says, "Behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills". This bears out what I have been remarking, that the Lord's movements are above the level of the earth. One loves to think of Him, of the agility with which He moves about, leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills. He is gone, indeed, far beyond the range of all eminences, but He can descend even as He has
{227}
ascended. So we may think of the Lord in what He is on earth, "From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's name is to be praised", @Psalm 113:3. "Behold, he cometh", she says. Now the eye is active after the ear. We have to learn in the assembly to look for this. And then she describes Him, "My beloved is like a roe or a young hart". You see how the soul becomes acquainted with the Lord as watching His movements. The question may often arise as to how the Lord may move and be with all His people. I think we have a spiritual suggestion here as to the agility with which the Lord reaches His lovers. That is the secret of this book; the secret of the Song of Songs is love. You will never understand it unless you love. It is a love song, and the Lord comes to His lovers. As the apostle says, looking at it from this standpoint, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha", @1 Corinthians 16:22. Such was his sense of the lovableness of Christ that anyone who did not love Him should be accursed.
But there was a wall, alas, between Him and her. He did not scale it or force His way. One would speak to souls, as to where you are in view of these movements, whether after all, as the Lord comes in His love, a wall exists between Him and you. Let us look to these walls, dear brethren -- some secret reservations in our hearts which are obstacles, as it were, to the Lord. But it says, "He standeth behind". How long? He has come this time to get you to move. He would have you to get out of that house, from behind those windows and that wall. "Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away", He says. If He come, He is going to say something about those circumstances in which you are. In spite of the fact that you can hear His voice and describe His agility, there may be that wall and those lattices, and He is not going to acquiesce in that.
{228}
In His love He would ask you to move out of those circumstances. It is a time of movement, and He would have you in the enjoyment of Himself in His movements.
Then in chapter 5, without going into details, He comes now in answer to an invitation. "Let my beloved come into his garden". The north wind has come, and also the south; the north wind is one of the most effective servants that the Lord has. He knows its source; He has been there. We read in @Job 37:9 of "cold" coming out of the north, and in the same chapter we read of "gold" coming out of the north. The Lord Himself has been in the "cold" -- in the distance of death -- and the gold has come out of it in infinite richness, and so one believes that the north wind in the hand of Christ is one of the most effective servants of His love. Discipline goes on, "For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me". The Lord says, No, "My grace is sufficient for thee". That gold has got to be developed; and the apostle, seeing this, says, "Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me", @2 Corinthians 12:8. So here you will observe that the north wind has been invited, and the south, to blow upon His garden, and now the invitation is to come into it. The Lord looks for that. The Lord looks for the desire of the heart, "Let my beloved come into *his* garden". It is not *my* garden, but His. Let us be on our guard about 'my meeting', 'our meeting'; that leads to legalism; it is contrary to the house of God. It is, "Let my beloved come into *his* garden". If it is not His, it is valueless. Hence He comes into His garden, and He says, "I have gathered my myrrh with my spice". It is all His. There is now through discipline the acknowledgement of His rights; and there is the myrrh, that precious commodity that was used as an ingredient of the
{229}
anointing oil of the tabernacle, and typical of suffering love. The Lord looks for that. What it indicated in the tabernacle was His mind, and He never changes His mind. He looks for the myrrh, He gathers it, and the spice. We may think of the Lord coming into His garden, finding the precious fruits of the Spirit in suffering love among His people, the reflex of His own experience here.
Then it says, "I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey". It is the mutuality, as one may say, of a chastened, suffering people, not a reigning people. The Corinthians were reigning as kings; they did not have anything in the way of myrrh, that suffering love that should have anointed them. The second epistle brought out a little of it, but the first speaks of none, save in the abstract. Of course it was seen in the apostles whom God has set forth last "a spectacle to the world, both to angels, and men ... the offscouring of the world, the refuse of all, until now", @1 Corinthians 4:9 - 13. There was the continuous expression of suffering, for God had set them as models; solemn fact, but they accepted it. The Lord in His movements looks for the myrrh and the spice, and then for the honeycomb with the honey, which is the mutuality of suffering brethren. We are called to that. We are called to the moral dignity of the anointing oil of the tabernacle -- the suffering love of Christ produced in the power of the Spirit in His people; and then to the honey, the sweetness of that fellowship, and that communion in the Spirit that belongs to the circle.
You will notice that He eats both the honey and the honeycomb, referring to the mutual feelings, sympathies, and services that He delights in in His suffering people. Then, further, He goes on to say, "I have drunk my wine". Think of the Lord, in spirit, referring to a stimulant. You can understand that one speaks guardedly, but there was the drink
{230}
offering which was for God. Jacob anointed the pillar a second time with the drink offering for the pleasure of God; the house of God is for the pleasure of God; wine that maketh glad the heart of God and man; the Lord finds gladness of heart among His people. Then He speaks of His milk, "I have drunk my wine with my milk"; milk suggests satisfaction; what satisfaction there is in the Lord as He finds His milk. Each of these commodities has its own spiritual significance as the Lord is pleased to use them to indicate what He finds in His movements in the circle of those who love Him.
And then in chapter 6 you see further movements of the Lord. He is as One "gone down into his garden". Here again you have the elevated thought. He has *gone down*. The lover can now give an account of His movements. One sees progress. There are those who know what the Lord is doing universally. One of one's greatest exercises is to maintain in one's soul the recognition of the universal character of the house of God, and the universal activities of Christ, so that whilst one takes account of one's local responsibility to the Lord, one also loves in the Spirit all the saints, and is interested in what the Lord is doing *everywhere*, for He is over the whole house. He is the Son who has built it and He is over it as Son, and He moves everywhere, and the lover of Christ is interested in all His movements. Hence she says here, "My beloved has gone down into his garden to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies". He is doing something for Himself now. Think of the Lord gathering the lilies! What a movement that is, what an attractive occupation for Him! I need not remind you who the lilies are: "Even Solomon in all his glory", the Lord says, "was not arrayed like one of these", @Matthew 6 29. But He is gathering these in His gardens.
Then she says, "I am my beloved's, and my
{231}
beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies". I apprehend that that means He feeds His flock among the lilies; that is what she knows. I appeal to those of us who seek to take an oversight among the people of God. The Lord has great regard for those who take an oversight; He is Himself the Leader in this, as in all else. He is the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls; @1 Peter 2:25. Hence He has special interest in those who take an oversight among the people of God, and such should be concerned as to where the Lord is and what He is doing *everywhere*. One's great desire is that the brethren may be universal in their affections and in their outlook. He has gone down into His garden, but now He is feeding His flock. One thinks with satisfaction of the many whom the Lord has raised up today in different parts to feed the saints; they should be prayed for. The Lord is doing it mediately, as one might say, He fits persons to feed others; as He said to Peter, "Feed my lambs", "shepherd my sheep", "feed my sheep", @John 21:15 - 17. He looks for that. He feeds His flock, as I believe it should read, among the lilies. The Lord watches for your soul, and He lays it upon hearts to watch for your soul so that you might be guided aright -- shepherded, and also fed: "He feedeth his flock among the lilies". And note, not only that He feeds them, but also *where* He feeds them -- "among the lilies".
{232}
PAUL'S EMBRACE
@Acts 20:1 - 12,36 - 38
My thought is to speak a little about the assembly as set up by Paul. I want to dwell on the mutual affection and the mutual feeling that mark the record given in this chapter. You will observe that in the beginning of the chapter Paul embraces the saints at Ephesus and at the end of the chapter they embrace him; that is, he had acquired a place in their affections. These are the things that the Holy Spirit sets down for us as marking the establishment of the assembly at Ephesus, this assembly being obviously selected by the Spirit as representing the full result of Paul's service; and a wonderful result it was, as we may see, for the work there in the saints enabled him to speak to them and to write to them without reserve. He says in his discourse to the elders that he had not shunned to declare unto them the whole counsel of God.
He had said to the Corinthians in his first epistle that he could not speak unto them as unto "the perfect"; he could but speak to them as to babes. Babes *in Christ*, thank God! But *babes* in Christ, although most interesting and loved of the Lord, are not exactly the material to form the assembly. The assembly in the divine thought was to be formed of men, that is, believers founded in the truth. In the epistle to the Romans believers have come to apprehend Christ in His moral greatness, for that is how we come first of all to apprehend the Lord. He has come in for us and effected our deliverance, and hence acquired a place in our minds on moral lines. Young believers need that if they are to have stamina -- the qualities typified in the acacia wood. They need to apprehend Christ as He came in on moral
{233}
grounds to deal with moral issues, in order to settle them so that their souls are set up with God in righteousness.
Then the believer apprehends Christ as He is presented in the epistle to the Colossians, that is, he comes to apprehend Him according to what He is personally. He begins to see in the Lord His personal dignity, and distinction, and beauty. We are detained before Him. Colossians presents Christ personally; He is the Son of the Father's love: He is before all things and by Him all things were created. He is the beginning and Firstborn from among the dead, and He is the Head of His body, the assembly, and in Him all the fulness was pleased to dwell. The Lord then becomes personally interesting to the soul.
Then in Ephesians He is presented to you as being *made* Head: He is *given* to be Head over all things to the assembly; that is, you see Him in relation to the fixed purpose of God. He is the Man of purpose; He is the Christ, the Man by whom God does everything and in whom He sets out all His pleasure in relation to the assembly. He gave Him, it says, "to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all", @Ephesians 1:23. So that the Ephesian is the fully developed man. The teaching of it is to bring us to "the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ", @Ephesians 4:13. To such the apostle can announce the whole counsel of God; so that with the Ephesian believers the development in their souls through the ministry of the apostle enabled him to unfold to them the whole counsel of God.
The Corinthians, describing, alas, the great mass of believers, were but babes in Christ. So he says, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified", @1 Corinthians 2:2. See what they shut themselves out from through
{234}
their carnal condition! In Luke 24 the Lord stood in the midst and said: "It is I myself". Then He says: "Have ye anything here to eat?" @Luke 24:39,41. If the Lord had gone to Corinth and raised that question when Paul wrote his first letter, what would they have brought forth? What *could* they have brought forth? The question He asks the company at Jerusalem, "Have ye anything *here* to eat?" raises the point which is the test. It is what you have *here*! What had they in Corinth? That question may be justly and indeed profitably raised with every company of believers. In answer to the question put to them in Luke 24 we read: "And they gave him part of a broiled fish, and of a honeycomb". @Luke 24:42. They had these two things. They had what spoke of the sovereign resources of God, and they had drawn upon those, dear brethren. They had drawn upon the infinite resources of God -- *the fish*. They had besides the mutual feeling amongst them which *the honeycomb* suggests.
Then the Lord proceeds to open their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures. He opened up to them the depths, as one might say, of the Pentateuch and of the prophets, and the Psalms. Think of the opportunity they had! The apostle could not do that with the Corinthians. He had to turn aside to deal with the fleshly condition amongst them; indeed, he had abstained from going to them. He gives them in that way a solemn notification that a fleshly state of things in any company precludes the Lord's visitations, for the apostle represented the Lord. He was in entire sympathy with the Lord, and the Lord was with him, and he refrained from going. The conditions were not suited to the Lord's coming to the company.
In Luke 24 He opened their understanding, because the conditions were there for it. The Fountain of knowledge was there: He who was with God when
{235}
the foundations of the earth were laid was there; wisdom was there; understanding was there; and all was available to them, and so He opens their understanding so that they might understand the Scriptures. But the Corinthians were only babes, and the apostle says, I cannot speak to you as unto perfect, but we *do* speak the wisdom of God among the perfect. I refer to all this by way of warning. A fleshly condition is seen in the recognition and maintenance of national things, occupation with man, with families, with business, and all that goes with these things. These are the marks of babes. You may have the Spirit and yet be going on with these things which shut out from you the hidden wisdom.
This hidden wisdom is the "wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory", @1 Corinthians 2:7. Think of that! Not only the wisdom that was with God when the foundations of the earth were laid, but the wisdom that was prepared *before* that -- God's wisdom which none of the princes of this world knew. It is beyond their range. It had come within their range in Him who was the wisdom of God, but they had no eyes to see it, any more than carnal Christians have. As living after the flesh and in fleshly conditions we are shut out from this hidden wisdom; "the wisdom of God in a mystery", as it says in @1 Corinthians 2:7; we shut ourselves out by a carnal condition from the most precious heritage conceivable -- the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predetermined before the world for our glory. Paul spoke of it to these Ephesians, but he spoke of it as "all varied". The angels see in the assembly the "all varied" wisdom of God. Think of the wonderful opportunity there is for us in that the Lord would open up to us these wonderful things! The Lord would stand and open up to us these blessed things as we are prepared to "follow on to know the Lord" @Hosea 6:3.
{236}
These things are all available for us, they are all there; so the Spirit of God says, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him", @1 Corinthians 2:9. Note "the things" and the word 'prepared'. The apostle goes on to say: "But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit". @1 Corinthians 2:10. God has held back nothing and the apostle was not going to hold back anything. One is tested as to what one does with the little bit of light one gets from the Lord. Sometimes we hold it back too long or wait for a special occasion. The apostle would open up what he had to the saints as they were prepared for it. God had revealed the things by the Spirit, and he was prepared to open them up to the Corinthians, but he was shut off by their carnal condition; nevertheless, he refers to the things so as to move their hearts. He had them all, and he was ready to impart them, but, alas, their unspiritual state hindered.
You will observe that I have been contrasting the Corinthians with the Ephesians. The Ephesians were the perfect, and so he embraces them. He embraces them and leaves them, and then later when returning that way from Miletus he sends for the elders of the assembly -- their representatives -- and opens up the truth again to them, pressing upon them their responsibility as to the assembly as set up at Ephesus. And what you find is that they embrace *him*. I see in the two embracings the correspondence between the vessels of the light, representing the Lord Himself, and those who receive the light. There was a correspondence. I take their embracing the apostle to represent the love that they had for Christ. You see the correspondence between him who brought the light of the counsels of God -- the light of the love of Christ and the love of God -- and them. "They all wept sore, and falling upon the neck of Paul, they ardently kissed him".
{237}
Well, that is how the matter stood, but I want to show you the mutual features which the Holy Spirit interweaves here between Paul's departure from Ephesus, having finished his work there, and his return and sending for the elders. I want to show you how the Holy Spirit weaves into it all the features of the assembly. You will notice there were with the apostle certain ones at Troas, "Sopater son of Pyrrhus, a Berean; and of Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus", @Acts 20:4. These represented, as you will observe, not only different countries and localities but even different continents. Now one of the most baneful sentiments that can arise in the assembly is local and national feelings, and I have no doubt the Holy Spirit introduces these brothers so that we might see how perfectly united in spirit and how entirely free from all such feelings they were. If the national feeling is cherished you cannot have development. The house of God becomes stifled by the existence of these feelings; it is not that we cease to be Christians, but we cease to recognise the house of God in its universal character. It is never viewed in any other way than universal. It is *never* limited to a local company or nation.
So I apprehend the Holy Spirit brings in these brothers from different parts as representing general exercises. The writer himself, "Luke, the beloved physician", @Colossians 4:14 was amongst them. He was a man like Ezra in the Old Testament, whose delight was to present David, David's kingdom and the house. Luke says: "The first day of the week *we* being assembled". That "*we*" embraces all those brothers; it included the great apostle himself. It is the *we* of mutuality, the *we* of mutual respect among Christians, and of affection. It is the *we* which includes the interests of Christ and the testimony of God. He
{238}
says it was the first day of the week. It took them five days to get there, but they spent seven days in that town. How these days were filled I would not undertake to say in detail, but we may be assured they were happy days, they were *assembly* days. They are introduced here by the Spirit of God between Paul's departure from Ephesus and his return when he called the elders. The Holy Spirit introduces them as representing conditions or features that are becoming to the house of God.
Now it is remarkable that the first day of the week is referred to here for the first time in this book. It is scarcely referred to by the twelve after the record in the gospels. It did not really fit in during the transitional period in which the Jewish nation was recognised. It did not fit in there because it represents a wholly new order of things. It is an assembly day. The assembly involves a complete break with all that this world ever had before. Before it is introduced in Matthew the Lord left the Pharisees and the Sadducees; @Matthew 16:4. There must be a definite break with all that there is in the world; however honoured an institution may be, however ancient, whatever its reputation, there is to be a definite break, especially with that which is religious. The Lord left them.
I understand by the reference to the first day of the week that the Holy Spirit is beginning afresh. The assembly is set up in its four-cornered relations, as I may say. The sheet let down from heaven was knit at the four corners. It was heaven's indication that an order of things was about to be introduced which was universal. It is no longer "the Jew first", @Romans 2:10 it was to be *men*, and this chapter is full of instruction as to the universal character of the assembly. Peter saw the sheet come down; it was to prepare him to open the door with suitable grace so that Paul, whom the Lord had in reserve, might have a free hand.
{239}
Thus chapter 20 is the full complement wrought out by the great architect of the assembly; you have his affection for it and its affection for him, and in between this development the first day of the week. We go back now to begin over again with the day on which the Lord Jesus arose. The assembly begins there. It took years to work out, but when it was worked out it is linked with the first day of the week. The first day is the beginning of the dispensation; it is nothing less than the beginning of the eternal era of things.
The seventh day was the end of the period that marked the Old Testament. The first day of the week has reference to an unending period. "His going forth is assured as the morning dawn", @Hosea 6:3. Luke says: "The first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread". One would love to dwell on that, dear brethren, because the first day of the week arouses such memories, such spiritual feelings and sentiments, in those who love the Lord, that it becomes one of the most interesting subjects in the Scriptures. Paul does take it up in the letter to the Corinthians, chapter 16, but not in this connection. He takes it up in connection with the giving of money for the need of the people of God. The Corinthians were scarcely in a state for the opening up of what the first day of the week means, but he does refer to it. Whilst it is connected with the mere giving of money as the Lord prospered them, it was as much as to say, I want you to be affected by everything that would induce you to give, and if there be anything that would induce you to give it is the memories connected with the first day of the week.
It is the beginning of a spiritual era, and if the light of that enters your heart you will easily relinquish your hold on what belongs to Monday or Tuesday. The latter perishes in the handling, but
{240}
what the first day of the week represents does not perish in the handling. It refers to Christ risen and glorified, having gone up to where He was before. Nothing that is connected with Him spiritually will perish, everything is imperishable, and that is what the first day of the week really means. It corresponds with the assembly. The assembly is imperishable. It is the product of Christ as He came out of the grave. He brought it out with Him. It comes down from God out of heaven. After a thousand years it retains its youthfulness, as we see in the book of Revelation. There is nothing corruptible in it; it is incorruptible like Himself. The first day of the week is introduced here in connection with the breaking of bread. "We being assembled to break bread". That is what should mark the first day of the week. It comes in here for the first time in the Acts. It is in keeping with the light of the moment. And it stands out connected with the assembly and will be connected with it until the assembly is taken up.
In conclusion there is one other thought I would add. The next thing after they are come together to break bread is that Paul is mentioned. It says, "Paul" (verse 7). I have been speaking of the mutual side, that Paul was included in the *we*, but what is to be continued is to be entirely governed by Paul's ministry. Peter and John are not to be neglected, but here Paul stands out before our souls. Paul represents Christ in a peculiar way. He had a special place, as the Lord says: "He is an elect vessel unto me", @Acts 9:15. So we read, "And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread, *Paul* discoursed to them", @Acts 20:7. He discourses and then he breaks bread and then he talks. Two words are used here, the first in verse 7 is *discoursed*, the second in verse 11 is *conversed*. I only refer to that because discourse is connected
{241}
and stands out as a governing principle as we break bread. Conversation followed because it gave opportunity for the expression of any exercises that may have arisen during the discourse. The Lord looks for that. If there are any exercises produced by the discourse He will meet them when they converse. The word 'talked' or 'spoken' in verse 11 has a conversational significance. It is not a connected discourse. We find in Matthew 13, that the Lord went into the house, and it says His disciples came to Him. He places Himself where they could come to Him and ask Him questions. And they came and asked, and He opened up things to them. Here it came after they had broken bread. "When he therefore was come up again and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed", @Acts 20:11. It was a typical occasion. There was opportunity in the conversation for inquiry, so that there could be no difficulty. The Lord looks for us to come to Him; "His disciples came to him", and coming to Him all difficulties are solved. He is ready to answer, and I have no doubt that such a conversational state of things ensued on that occasion after Paul had broken bread. One's desire is to occupy our attention with the assembly, to see it as it was, so that we can move in the light of it now. Unless we see it as it was, we shall not understand the present. We have to see it as it has been, and what it shall be. The Scriptures are definite as to what has been and what shall be. What is hazy is what is *now*. We need to be in the light of what has been and what shall be, so as to be in the light of what is present. There is the light of the former glory and of the latter glory, and they converge in the present position, and in that light we can have understanding of what is becoming to Christ in a day of brokenness.
{242}
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRUTH OF THE ASSEMBLY
@Acts 18:1 - 11,24 - 28; @Acts 19:1 - 20
J.T. These chapters, as I understand them, present the circumstances attending the full development of the truth of the assembly; chapter 18 having to do with the tabernacle or wilderness character of the assembly as it was developed at Corinth, and chapter 19 with the assembly as typified in the temple in the land. In the Psalms we read, "When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion", @Psalm 114:1,2. There the full development of the truth of the house was in view, and was seen in Judah, but then there was the wilderness feature, in which the mind of God was set out. So we have the word of *God* more in chapter 18 and the word of the *Lord* in chapter 19. Chapter 20 being based on chapter 19 shows what developed at Ephesus.
I thought it might be helpful to look at the circumstances connected with the development of the truth of the assembly in chapter 18, as suggestive of the catholic or world-wide feature of the assembly. We see how God moved governmentally, as we may say, to permit and pave the way for what the Holy Spirit was developing; the command that all Jews should depart from Rome served to further the work of the Spirit. Two persons from the west appear at Corinth, then a man of Alexandria appears there, all ready to help and contribute; independent contributors, as it were, although joining in most heartily and sympathetically with what the Spirit of God was doing through the apostle Paul. There was the evidence of a general movement of God tending to suggest the world-wide character of that which was
{243}
being developed -- the house of God -- the assembly as a general thought.
H.F.N. Would you develop your thought as to the tabernacle and the temple in the land. What are these particular views of the assembly?
J.T. The assembly as developed at Corinth answered to the tabernacle in the wilderness, whereas the assembly as established at Ephesus had the land in view. As you will observe in verse 11, Paul remained at Corinth one year and six months, teaching among them the word *of God*, but in verse 10 of the next chapter we read, "This took place for two years, so that all that inhabited Asia heard the word of the *Lord*". Then in verse 20 it says, "Thus with might the word of the Lord increased and prevailed". That, I think, has reference to the conquest of the land, for it goes on to say in verse 11, "God wrought no ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, so that even napkins or aprons were brought from his body and put upon the sick, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits went out". Then I think we have, in these Jewish exorcists and the seven sons of Sceva, a reference to the seven-fold power of evil against the testimony, which the conquest of the land brought out. Everything went down at Ephesus before the Lord. No power could lift up its head against the testimony there, so that the assembly was established there in complete superiority to the power of Satan. But the overthrow of the enemy is not so much in view in chapter 18; it is rather to establish what is capable of *going through*. The word of God, conveying the thoughts of God, is therefore more in evidence.
F.S.M. Would the epistles addressed to these assemblies maintain the thoughts of the tabernacle and the temple?
J.T. Yes, as I remarked, the epistle to the Corinthians develops the truth of the assembly in
{244}
the wilderness, whereas that to the Ephesians unfolds the truth of the assembly in the land.
F.S.M. In Ephesians we have the conflict with, spiritual wickedness.
J.T. I think that is the reason for the connection there. The evil spirits are cast out; we get the effort of the enemy in a seven-fold way, the seven sons of Sceva, to withstand the power of God, but they are ignominiously overthrown and exposed. It says they fled out of the house naked and wounded.
Ques. What is the difference between the "word of God" and the "word of the Lord" in that way?
J.T. The "word of God" unfolds the *mind* of God. Moses was taken up into the mount, and as we know God unfolded to him His mind. He showed him the pattern of the tabernacle, which represents His mind in regard to the heavens and the earth. It was a pattern, as it says, of the tabernacle, a worldly one; that is, one that represented the holy, universal order of God. That has come into this world. Moses came down from the mount, and had it set up. It was not very great outwardly -- an oblong enclosure with a tent in it. It was easily measured and compassed, but nevertheless it represented the mind of God. Inside there were the ark and the cherubim. It was constructed and set up in the wilderness. It was carried about -- movement is the feature. But then the purpose of God was that Judah was to be His sanctuary, because the wilderness was only by the way, and was connected with the ways of God, but His purpose was in connection with a fixed abode; "exceeding magnifical", @1 Chronicles 22:5 as it says. There was to be a vast structure or system of things connected with it -- four houses we read of, but the house of Jehovah was to be on a grand scale -- to be His dwelling-place. That was what He had in His mind. What came out in the wilderness was on the way to that. For faith they ran together. The assembly,
{245}
as seen in Ephesians, was really for faith. It "groweth unto an holy temple *in the Lord*" @Ephesians 2:21. Thus in chapter 19 it is, in the main, the word of the Lord, because the Lord has to deal with the forces of evil arrayed against the truth, and the exhortation to us is, "Be strong in the Lord and in the might of his strength". @Ephesians 6:10. We have to do with "the universal lords of this darkness", @Ephesians 6:12 and we need to know the Lord in the might of His strength, in combating these forces.
F.S.M. Is that indicated in Exodus 15, "the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established"? @Exodus 15:17.
J.T. That did not refer to the wilderness but to the land. It had Canaan in view. "Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in". @Exodus 15:17. So that in @Psalm 78:69 "He built his sanctuary like the heights; like the earth which he hath founded for ever". That is what Judah was to God.
H.F.N. Is there any point in the fact that the chapter opens with the apostle traversing the upper regions?
J.T. I thought so. It is a suggestion of the heavenly side, I think; and then follows the sure foundation practically in the twelve men who receive the Holy Spirit at the apostle's hands. We are now approaching the great structure which Paul set up.
Ques. Is it in that way the great climax in his ministry? It is completed at Ephesus.
J.T. Chapter 20 is the climax; then the journey to Jerusalem follows, which is rather another line of things. His work is completed in chapter 20.
H.F.N. It is striking that the first chapter you referred to is introduced by the thought of "tent-makers", and the second chapter by that of traversing the upper regions. Would they both bear upon what you have been speaking of?
{246}
J.T. Yes, I think so. The circumstances seen in the opening of chapter 18 are designed to be humiliating, to bring the flesh down. The assembly, as in this world as a testimony for God, was never intended to be conspicuous or great, but rather as the Lord Himself said, a "little flock" -- outwardly small, but intrinsically precious. Note here how there are three persons lodging together in the most ordinary way, "because he was of the same craft". It is to bring down the pride of the Corinthians. God had this end in view; He always works with an end in view, and He knew what would develop at Corinth -- the pride of the flesh. He knew the architectural reputation of the city -- it was a place of fine edifices -- man's ideas of building. And these three people of the same craft dwelt together in one house; their names would be utterly despised if they were mentioned to the leading architects of the city. Tent-makers did not belong to their line; they were occupied with stately buildings of beauty and grandeur. Thus God intended to bring down in the saints all that man could glory in.
Ques. Would you connect with that, "not many wise"; "ye see your calling, brethren"? @1 Corinthians 1:26
J.T. Yes, surely.
Ques. Were they not there in relation to suffering?
J.T. Priscilla and Aquila had had to leave Rome in consequence of the emperor's command that all Jews should depart. There is no pretension to anything great in chapter 18; it is all intended to bring down the pride of the flesh and to bring us into reproach. Things that are conspicuous (even large congregations) tend to furnish food for the flesh. We have to be on our guard against that because God will not go on with anything of that kind. He intends the wilderness position to be one of lowliness and obscurity, hence the tabernacle consisted outwardly of an oblong enclosure of one hundred cubits
{247}
long, fifty cubits wide, with a tent inside it, the boards of which were ten cubits high with badger skins thrown over it, all of which has precious meaning to faith, but to the natural eye nothing at all.
F.S.M. Do you suggest that we have to learn to appreciate the reproach of the cross, and the position of the assembly in the wilderness before we can enter into the dignity of the position?
J.T. I think that is right. There stood the brazen altar in the court. That meant that suffering was the order of the day. Suffering was suggested in all the outward appearance; the badger skins, and indeed all the skins, indicated that suffering had occurred; so, too, did the altar itself, and the shittim wood -- only one kind of wood, the shittim or acacia, which represented power of endurance, not outward grandeur. You can understand how much that is needed if we are to bear the weight of the testimony of the mind of God -- no less than that. The mind of God was disclosed to Moses on the mount; he brought it down, and it was set up in figure in this structure. It requires power of endurance to stand and hold that against all the pressure and opposition that there are.
F.S.M. Is that why Paul refers to "Jesus Christ" in the Corinthian epistle?
J.T. That is in accordance with his point of view. It is what Jesus Christ was here -- resisting evil. It is that character of things that has to be built in.
Rem. You get the thought that the *people* should be in accordance with the testimony. They dwelt in *tents* in the wilderness in correspondence with the tabernacle.
J.T. It was a movable state of things, but chapters 19 and 20 bring out the state of dignity which belongs to the assembly, so we get the word of *the Lord*.
Ques. Would "baptism in the name of the Lord
{248}
Jesus", and also what characterised the Ephesians, "faith in the Lord Jesus", @Ephesians 1:15 fit in?
J.T. Yes, indeed. That is what you get. Paul said to them that they should believe on Him who should come after John, that is, on Christ Jesus, and then it says, "When they heard that, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus".
F.S.M. There would be a sense in which the two run on together in our souls -- the reproach connected with the Corinthian epistle, and the dignity connected with the Ephesian position.
J. T. Yes, the latter enables to sustain the former. We come together outwardly as disciples of the Lord, and we are ill reproach, but inside we lay hold of what we are *before God*, which is different from what we are before men.
H.F.N. And that would empower us to take up the reproach connected with the testimony here.
R.W. Would the two sides come in with baptism? There is no mention of the name of the Lord in chapter 18? Would it just be the side of humiliation, our disappearing here?
J.T. Yes, I think so. "The word of God" means that one has to expect reproach. The mind of God does not take into account what I am after the flesh at all. I may be a rich man or an educated man, a man of family or what not, but that has nothing whatever to do with the mind of God. The mind of God is to bring in a man fitted to stand in the testimony of *Jesus Christ*. I have to be formed according to the word of God.
R. W. Would the baptism of John indicate the disappearing side?
J.T. Yes. As you get in Acts 1, the requirements of the man who was to occupy the vacated position were that he had assembled with the disciples during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and
{249}
went out amongst them, beginning with the baptism of John, until the day in which He was taken up from them. That is the kind of man who was to take Judas¬ place. "From the baptism of John", that was the beginning of one order of things; he began there; he was to have assembled with the disciples all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst them. What movements he would see! What utter disregard for the flesh and its pretensions he would have seen in Jesus as He came in and went out among them. That is the character of things we have to learn to fit in with the assembly as set in this world in testimony.
Rem. That seems to cover both sides, does it not; the disappearing side in the baptism of John, and then the going up into heaven?
J.T. Yes. "The day in which he was taken up" @Acts 1:22 would suggest that if you have accepted the testimony of what He was here, you come into the dignity involved in His going up. Think of the dignity of His going up into heaven!
Ques. Is that why, in Ephesians, the great truth of ascension comes into prominence?
J.T. Yes; His ascension means our going up too.
Ques. Would the baptism of John be the beginning of a spiritual movement, and then the ascension be the completion of it?
J.T. Yes, quite. The ascension brings out the cedar, that is, the material for the house, or fixed abode. The cedar suggests the magnificence of the house of God, as seen in Ephesus, but we have to learn what the Lord was as coming in and going out among the saints, from the time He was baptised until He was received up. Let us understand what these things mean. The Lord was to be learned in being *with Him;* and in His assembling, too, *with them;* @Acts 1:21,22.
Ques. Would that be equivalent to following the
{250}
journeyings of the ark of the covenant in the wilderness?
J.T. Very much. One often feels that we know very little about assembling; "of the men who have assembled with us". @Acts 1:21.
Ques. What is the force of that?
J.T. You see how the Lord acted in assembling. You have to learn how to assemble -- how to be in the assembly -- from Him. Think, for instance, of the night in which He instituted His supper! how He would act. Those present would take account of every movement and word of the Lord, and what a taste of His love they would get there! They would be governed afterwards by that. Even in breaking the bread, they took account of *how* He did it, and what He said.
Rem. In the forty days after He had risen from the dead He also assembled with them, which would be more spiritual, because He was then risen.
J.T. I think these forty days would perhaps instruct us as to the assembly in Ephesians. I do not say it would not enter into the other, for it does, and they run together, but we must think of the Lord as risen from the dead, as coming in amongst them, when it says, "He assembled with them", @Acts 1:4.
Ques. Does not that give us the true principle upon which we learn the truth of the assembly, that is, from the Lord Himself? It is not simply that we have read it in a book, or even heard about it in ministry; the impressions must be made upon us by the Lord Himself.
J.T. Yes, the Lord moves in the house of God, and it is for the saints, especially the young ones, to seek to know how He moves, so as to know how to move themselves -- what to do; as the apostle says, "that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God". @1 Timothy 3:15. The Lord
{251}
had set the way for them. If He is Son over God's house, we need to consider Him. You say, He is in heaven; well, He is, but He is over the house, and He is priest in the house -- the great Priest. We have to apprehend Him as the Son and Priest in it.
Ques. How would the movements of the Lord be learned now?
J.T. Well, I think it is seen in the character of the ministry, and in the grace that He produces in the brethren. As you were saying, "holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord". @Hebrews 12:14. With holiness, you see His movements -- what He is doing. It is a spiritual matter, but one can understand how you see the Lord -- where He is. That is a good expression, for it means that you observe how and where He is moving. You are not misled. You are not going to be diverted. You know what is of Him.
H.F.N. I think your reference last night to the thought of assembling in Matthew 13 was very helpful -- the Lord coming into the house and His disciples coming to Him. In answer to their inquiry He gives an explanation of the parable. We would not only like the Lord to assemble with us in the breaking of bread, but that all the ministry of the house of God would come under that head.
J.T. Yes, it is well to see that the house is a general thought; so, as I was remarking, "from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's name is to be praised". @Psalm 50:1. The whole administration of the house is in His hands. All the priests are under Him, all the Levites, and all the shepherds and elders. Grace has been given to all "according to the measure of the gift of Christ", @Ephesians 4:7 so that everyone of us is under the Lord.
F.S.M. It may be a different simile, but the bride in the Canticles observed every movement of the Bridegroom. Would not affection notice the way in which the Lord does things, as well as what He does?
{252}
J.T. She could give an account of Him, where He was gone. One who loves the Lord can give an account of Him -- where He is and also His beauty. She outlines His features. One has known believers who do not move about by reason of physical infirmity, but they know what He is doing and where He is. While the Lord was moving about those forty days, Mary of Bethany would undoubtedly know about it. After He appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, she would know about that too. It is remarkable how you get to know of His things and movements when you love the Lord.
H.F.N. Do you suggest that if the Lord give us the forty days of assembling, coming in and out amongst us, there is a sense in which He always gives us the ten days?
J.T. I think the ten days suggest the opportunity we have for proving what we have learned. We have seen the Lord, what He has been doing, now we are allowed to act. Our movements now prove whether we have learned the lesson or not. During the ten days they continued in prayer. The disciples having seen the Lord go up, returned to Jerusalem and went to the upper room. That was instinctive. He had not told them to go there, showing that they had learned something. The upper room was in keeping with the ascension. Later those who represented His authority were there; Peter, James and John and all the apostles, Mary the mother of Jesus and His brethren. Then the question arose about this vacated apostleship. That was a test for them. What should they do? They had recourse to the Scriptures. Then Peter stood up among the *brethren*,  not yet with the *eleven*,  showing how he had learned to recognise the brethren. The next time it says, "with the eleven", @Acts 1:26, @Acts 2:14 because he was going to preach *publicly*, but in this matter of taking counsel as to the mind of God, he stands up among the brethren. He quotes
{253}
Scripture and they have recourse to prayer, and then to the lot, meaning that they did not know. It is a good thing to admit that we do not know. That brings God in. God is given an opportunity of deciding the matter. All this shows of what material they were.
Rem. What you are saying seems to connect also with Corinthians, "temple of God", @1 Corinthians 3:16,17 and Ephesians, "holy temple in the Lord". @Ephesians 2:21. Would you say a word as to the difference?
J.T. I think the temple in 1 Corinthians is what the saints are characteristically. It is what they are now as having the Spirit. We are entirely independent of the world and the wisdom of man; the mind of God is among the saints. One proves it constantly. You get the things of God unfolded. They are made more enjoyable in the company than they are in your own room or closet, not that you cannot study them in your room, or pray there, but the idea of the temple is that you are among the saints, where the Spirit of God is. The fact that the Holy Spirit is with the brethren to whom you are speaking involves that light comes out. Things are seen in relation to Christ. I am sure we have found this in our experience.
It *grows* unto an holy temple in the Lord; that is in view of the land -- the millennium. When the Lord will have subdued everything by His rule, everything will be seen to be right. The temple sheds its light upon everything. All will be in keeping with the temple.
Ques. What is the primary spiritual thought in connection with the temple?
J.T. It is where God is to be inquired of. "And to enquire in his temple", @Psalm 27:4. It is where His mind is disclosed.
Ques. Did I understand you to connect that thought with "Israel his dominion"? @Psalm 114:2.
J.T. More with Judah being His sanctuary, which.
{254}
I apprehend, means that it was the purpose of God in taking a people out that there should be a temple in Jerusalem -- not only a tabernacle in the wilderness, which was to be temporary. His purpose was a fixed abode, and that is what I understand by Judah being His sanctuary, because Judah was not His sanctuary in the wilderness; it was more Levi. See @Psalm 114:2.
Ques. Does not the tabernacle present what is holy and heavenly, and spiritually greater than the temple in the land?
J.T. It does as to what it represents, but its outward appearance is very small. It is for *testimony*, but the temple is permanent. In the millennium the assembly will be the vessel of the rule of Christ. The light of the temple will make all plain.
Ques. Does Simeon coming into the temple (Luke 2), throw any light upon that?
J.T. I think so. He had the mind of God, and he expressed it -- "a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel". @Luke 2:32
Ques. Would you say a word about the temple in 2 Corinthians 6, as to how it is introduced. Is it in connection with the building where the Lord can walk?
J.T. There the point is that God dwells among us and walks among us, and this calls for holiness; not so much that the light is there, but that God has a place in which He dwells and walks, and this becomes very searching, for if God walks there, He sees what is going on.
Rem. Referring to Luke 2, we get in the first two chapters the Holy Spirit referred to seven times altogether: in relation to John, Zacharias, Mary, Elizabeth and Simeon, but as regards Anna He is not mentioned. Anna was in the temple day and night. I think we get in Anna one who was the product of the Spirit of God, something on the line
{255}
of Colossians, for instance, where the Spirit is mentioned only once -- "your love in the Spirit". @Colossians 1:8.
Ques. Will you say a word in regard to Exodus and Leviticus?
J.T. Exodus is the establishment of things, and God coming to dwell, and then the benefit of that to me is in the way I take it up, and become active spiritually in drawing near as in Leviticus, in the appreciation of the offering of Christ. Priesthood is available for drawing near. Then Numbers is the thing in public testimony and the order that becomes it.
Ques. Did Stephen take up the two thoughts you suggest to us? He speaks of our fathers having the tent of testimony in the wilderness, and then goes on to David, and Solomon building Him an house.
J.T. Yes, I think those two thoughts are put together by the Spirit of God.
{256}
THE VASTNESS OF DIVINE UNDERTAKINGS
@1 Kings 5
J.T. This scripture suggests to us the vastness in the divine mind of the undertaking which is foreshadowed here. To ordinary eyes it would appear as if Solomon were going to build a huge city, so many men -- one hundred and eighty-three thousand -- were employed, and one would gather that the house of the dimensions given in the next chapter would not want a great deal either in material or builders. We must note the vastness of the undertaking in the divine mind, so that there may be a corresponding idea in our minds. The result may not appear as it is in the mind of God if we look on outward things; but the Holy Spirit would impress upon us that it is a very great and stupendous work. We have to look at the result in its intrinsic worth. What is foreshadowed here is intended to convey to us that what we are occupied with is very great. The question is, what have I to do? What am I employed in, occupied in? None of these men were to be idle, they were not to be in each other's way, and there was no confusion. God would call attention to the greatness of the thing we are brought into; the building is still going on, and material is still being brought in. Material is not easily procured, it is not to hand. There is a vast undertaking on, and a great deal to be done. Perhaps there has been a little neglect of rough work, and religious zeal has lapsed as in the days of Ezra; they settled down then to a very quiet time, they dwelt in ceiled houses: it required energy to get material from *the mountains*. To go up to the mountains requires a good deal of zeal; it is rough work. Yearning after souls is seeking material.
{257}
The confession of Peter in Matthew 16 brought into sight the foundation. Matthew 15 is the rough work that preceded the stones being brought in. The woman there is not yet a stone but on the way to it. At the end of the chapter we read, we get stone-squarers; there were great stones and costly stones which the king commanded to be brought. Rough work is most important, but we do not care about it. God has His own estimate of things, it is a great undertaking. It is well to keep this in view, especially in a "day of small things". @Zechariah 4:10.
Ques. Would occupation with such a chapter lead us to what is universal?
J.T. The Lord went out to the borders of Tyre and Sidon. The saints are not to be content with the children of the saints coming in; there is material to come from "regions beyond". It is for us to consider how to get that material into the assembly. God would impress on us that we must not underestimate the work; the amount of workers shows us that. The apostles remained at Jerusalem, out of the region of material for the house. It involves exercise to go up to the mountain. Ephraim was given the hill country (Joshua 17); it was said to him, "If thou art a great people, then get thee up to the wood and cut down for thyself". @Joshua 17:15. If you are great, set to work and do something.
Ques. What about sisters having part in the work?
J.T. Yes, we are all called to the work; it is a question of knowing what part I am to have in it. The overseers would indicate the differences in the work. The first thing is to accept the obligation, the next the levy. There are no volunteers, we are put under tribute; the obligation is put on us. We have our work cut out, and plenty of it. Matthew 13 gives the extent of the field -- the world. We are too cramped; we should move out into the region of Tyre and Sidon. In the days of Haggai God said.
{258}
"Go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house"; @Haggai 1:8 and they did so. The prophet spoke and the people began to move. The dates show the rapidity of exercise and movement. If believers could but see the vastness of the undertaking! "Who hath despised the day of small things?" @Zechariah 4:10. In these days it is a great thing to get light on what was the mind of God at the beginning.
Ques. Are we slack because we are deficient in light?
J.T. We get the prophetic word. The prophets stirred up the people, and Haggai shows the result came at once. Let not your hands hang down; God will carry out His work in grace -- who will join in? God is not asking for volunteers; it is an unfulfilled obligation if we do not join in the work. God will make difficulties disappear; the great mountain will become a plain; @Zechariah 4:7. God is working with people. We want to get a sense of the extent and the greatness of the undertaking in God's mind; it requires many workmen.
Ques. What was the difference between the building of the house in Solomon's days and the rebuilding in Ezra's days?
J.T. Things are necessarily on a smaller scale in Ezra's days; the main thing then is that we are not to let go the glory of the first house, that which was at the beginning. The latter glory of the house shines out now on our present position. We want the light of what was in Solomon's days, but we work on in Ezra's days and are encouraged as in the light of Solomon's days. I think Acts answers to Solomon's days, and Ezra and Nehemiah to 2 Timothy days. The overcomer in Philadelphia has the new Jerusalem that comes down out of heaven in view. You usually find in Scripture something in reserve, "He himself knew what he would do". @John 6:6. God kept John in reserve, and now we have the wonderful light of the city.
{259}
We do not always know even at the beginning of a reading what the Lord has for us, but the point is to give Him room. Peter might desire to have things a certain way, but the Lord says, "What is that to thee?" @John 21:22. The Lord reserves His right to bring out His reserves. Daniel had more light than Ezra and Nehemiah, but he was not at Jerusalem. He was greatly beloved and he was given to understand what would befall his people at the end of the days, and it was said to him, "Stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent". @Daniel 10:11. John leaned on Jesus¬ bosom. Who could have told that Saul breathing out threatenings was God's man in reserve, but the Lord knew what He would do. Paul knew God had revealed His Son in him; he had great strength in hewing. The Lord says to Paul at Corinth @Acts 18:10, "I have much people in this city". The stones had to be squared! Paul said, There is much rough work to be done here; so he laboured there for eighteen months. God is with us today; the governmental conditions generally in the world are intended to help. When God works with us nothing interferes.
Ques. Would the work at Corinth be rough work?
J.T. Yes, Paul preached "the word of God" there, he brings in the *mind* of God. David had *prepared* the material for the house, but it was reserved for Solomon to *build* it. He had been brought up in the affections of a son, and he had great conceptions of the undertaking. We get the beauties of the house more in @1 Kings 6.
Ques. What would cutting down the timber be?
J.T. It was like Saul -- he *fell* to the ground. Then Ananias brought him to the sea, as it were, and told him to be baptised. The timber was to be carried down in rafts on the water. The eunuch also accepted the water in baptism. We come out of death for the structure. God takes us out of death (Romans 6), we are baptised in the name of the Lord:
{260}
and in the truth of our baptism we commit ourselves to the Lord. Now Solomon is going to build and Jehovah gave him wisdom. He lays the obligation on all, he raises a levy. He sent them to Lebanon to be one month there and then two months at home. He treats his workmen with the utmost consideration. The Lord is not a hard taskmaster; He says, "Come ye yourselves apart ... and rest awhile". @Mark 6:31. He considers for us in our toil; He took rest Himself and sleep. A servant needs that: constant toil makes us hard in spirit, we lose the heavenly character; we need the home, the rest of the assembly. Solomon had great stones and costly. We come now to what he is doing, he is looking after the stones personally. They are not put in yet.
Ques. What is the thought of the foundation?
J.T. Zerubbabel put the headstone on; Christ is the Foundation and the Headstone. We are at the end now; the Lord is putting on the headstone. The Lord is working at the finish, the grace of Christ is bringing all together, beautifying the house. As the corner Stone it is how He is known and held in the affections of His people. Wheat and oil in verse 11 suggest the Spirit of Christ that would give character to these activities. Wheat affords strength, oil is not anointing oil here, but food that gives heat, producing energy and thus promoting a good constitution.
There is an interesting touch in the last verse as to the stone-squarers -- Giblites. They give the finishing touches to the stones. The chips are knocked off before we find our place amongst the saints. In the next chapter (verse. 7) we see there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool heard in the house while it was in building. Stones were finished before they were brought to the house. Very few of the Lord's people are built in. Living stones fit into their niche without giving friction.
{261}
HOW MATERIAL FOR THE HOUSE IS SECURED
@1 Samuel 20:41, 42; @1 Peter 3:15 - 20; @Ephesians 2:17
The Lord took the ground here on earth, as in subjection, of being shown what the Father did; and in taking up servants He laboured to reveal the mind of God to them, to bring them into accord with the mind of God. We should read the gospels in that light. They were not written from the standpoint of relief for men, though they contain wonderful records of relief; they were written from the standpoint of revelation, and the Lord is seen in them labouring to bring His apostles into accord with the mind of God.
In Luke we find the Lord spent the night in prayer before He called them; and having named them He descends from the mountain with them on to the plain. They were, as knowing God, to come down to the level of men to reach souls. It was necessary that they should come down to the level of men as the Lord did, carrying with Him divine grace so that it might be available. At the end of Luke's gospel they are told to tarry in the city of Jerusalem until they should be endued with power from on high. They were to understand in the tarrying what was in view: that repentance and remission of sins were to be preached in His name to all the nations, and that they were to begin at Jerusalem. They would learn in that tarrying their
own impotence. Every moment of the day would remind them that the great work was not to be undertaken at their own expense; so they were charged to remain in the city of Jerusalem until they should be endued with power.
That is the point of view in Luke. The great work had to be undertaken, the enlightenment of all the
{262}
nations through preaching, and so the vessels must be in accord with the work. It must not be undertaken in their own energy but in the energy of power from on high. There is another power; alas, we are made to realise in these days, how that power is operating! It is said, "this is that power of the antichrist". @1 John 4:3. We have to meet that power of antichrist of which we have heard; but the enlightenment of nations from Luke's point of view was to be undertaken by vessels clothed with power from on high. This is heavenly energy as seen in Acts.
The evangelist is to be a sympathetic servant, as the apostle Paul said, "to the Jews I became a Jew" @1 Corinthians 9:20; he became all things to all men that he might gain some. He was out for material for the house; he was a workman who shrank from nothing, whatever had to be done, to further the great mission entrusted to him. The Lord had come down to the plain. He stood by Paul in the roughest part of the work, and as he set out from Antioch what rough work he had to do! But he finished the work, it says, "which they fulfilled", @Acts 14:26. Those chapters of Acts, beginning with chapters 13 and 14, should be read studiously by all of us, but particularly by those who decide to go to Lebanon with the levy to bring down the timber. Such labourers must be prepared for rough experiences, but they can undertake it as endued with power from on high. The apostles, particularly Paul, shine in the acceptance of all the circumstances of that labour.
In the end of Matthew we see that the Lord told His disciples to meet Him in Galilee, not in Jerusalem; they had to be brought into accord with the mind of God about Jerusalem. Luke would lead them on the grace side to present the gospel in Jerusalem, but not Matthew. We have in our service to understand the government as well as the grace of God. The government implies that the city is to be
{263}
destroyed; the grace, that the gospel is to be preached. We have to hold in our souls the government of God; it is favourable to the gospel. We are enjoined to pray for all in authority. We have to understand the government of God; it is on parallel lines with the ministry of the Spirit. So in Matthew the Lord said to His disciples, "I will go before you to Galilee". @Matthew 26:32. And later He sent word to them that they should go into Galilee and there they should see Him. We have to learn what it is to meet the Lord in Galilee in the service of God. There we learn the government of God. He passes over nothing; Jerusalem was doomed; Paul said wrath is come upon them (the Jews) to the uttermost. The Lord announced that all power was given unto Him in heaven and on earth. The power is to be exercised outside Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the city of the great King, but He is outside His city, He is in Galilee, and says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth. Go ye therefore and make disciples of all nations". @Matthew 28:18,19. There is no thought of 'if' here, they had all power behind them. These eleven men were to go forth in the light and knowledge of the government of God, and of all power in heaven and upon earth being behind them. Then further He says, "Behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age". @Matthew 28:20.
In Matthew all *nations* were in view, in Luke all *men*, more -- the race; in Mark *creation* is in view. We have to know God in government, in grace, and in creatorial rights. The Lord is representing God in all these phases and the disciples are to be in accord. In Mark He says, "Go into all the world and preach the glad tidings to all the creation". @Mark 16:15. He looks at men according to Mark as creatures, and God as a faithful Creator; He has in view to bring out of creation "a kind of first fruits", as James says, "of his creatures". @James 1:18. In John it is not only His governmental rights, His rights on men in grace, or His
{264}
creatorial rights, but His rights of *love*. Who is the evangelist great enough to present the rights of love, the rights of the love of God? "God so loved"; He had a right to give His Son, He gave Him in love. God so loved, not now the nations, not now the race, not now creation, but "the world". Think of the kind of love that could rise above the history of the world and love it! John, the most profound of all the evangelists, says, "Grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ. No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". @John 1:17,18. We have hardly touched that, and yet to rightly preach the gospel we have to understand the viewpoint in this wonderful gospel -- to understand the love of God.
The Lord laboured to bring His people into the abiding-place where the love is to be known, so He says, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you", and He breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit". @John 20:21,22. It is as receiving the Spirit of Christ in that intimate and holy way that one is fitted to stand up and announce the gospel of the love of God. Hence John says in his epistle, "We have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son as Saviour of the world". @1 John 4:14. It is a wonderful thing to get in your soul the thought that, "The Father sent the Son as Saviour of the world". We are to be brought into accord with that -- the heart of God. In regard to such a service there is a great work to be undertaken in calling men out of the world, and creating material for the divine pleasure; God would equip us by the understanding of love as presented in the gospel.
Now I want, with regard to David, to refer to the character of the dispensation, and to show that things are on the earth at this moment in a southern aspect, that is, that God's attitude is favourable to man. You will remember the setting of this passage in Samuel. Jonathan had been enlightening David
{265}
through a remarkable instrumentality as to the murderous attitude of Saul; the incident was represented, and had its antitype in Jerusalem in our Lord's time. Jonathan had brought weapons, and through these he was to acquaint David with the attitude of Saul. The lad had gathered up Jonathan's artillery, and had gone into the city with these weapons: "instruments of cruelty" @Genesis 49:5 were there in Saul's house, as of old they had been in the habitation of Simeon and Levi. But David was outside, just as the Lord had gone out from the gate of the city realising the murderous attitude of His enemies. He suffered without the gate, and said of Jerusalem, "Weep not for me, but weep for yourselves". @Luke 23:28. There was divine compassion in that dreadful hour, and so on the cross there is no change of heart; He retains the attitude of grace in all His infinite fulness: He says, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do". @Luke 23:34. It was, as it were, a ray of divine grace from the south, from the favourable aspect, in that dark hour; and so David as fulfilling the type was led of God.
Jonathan was about to go after his weapons. It suggests that he was to maintain a *long distance* connection with David. Jonathan was characterised by this, like many Christians today, who keep at a distance from the Lord. The connection may be cut, and we suffer with the ungodly. One wonders often how it is that many believers can stay so far away from the Lord; one knows they love Christ, but how *can* they stay so far away? Jonathan elected to stay far away, and yet David shone, as it were, on Jonathan; he arose from his place in the south. What wonderful grace in that dark hour! "Father, forgive them".
So at Pentecost the position is unchanged. There is not only the announcement of forgiveness but the presence of the Holy Spirit, a divine Person come
{266}
down in the very city of Jerusalem. Marvellous grace! And all for them. As David arose from his place in the south on that eventful day, after the lad had gone, and exceeded Jonathan in his weeping, so the Lord arose in holy splendour, and shone from heaven in the gift of the Spirit, and in the announcement of forgiveness on that city. Peter says, "The promise is unto you, and to your children". @Acts 2:39. What shining, what warmth there is, as the Lord Jesus shone from heaven! Again, we read, "Being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this". @Acts 2:33. That is the initial feature of this dispensation, and onwards from this time the material is to be brought in in that wonderfully favourable circumstance. It is the southern aspect. David arose from his place in the south in the energy of life, his heart unchanged to Jonathan, as later we find his love unchanged; there was grace, too, even for Saul. This is the favourable aspect in which we are to go out and bring in the material for the assembly.
In 1 Peter 3 and Ephesians 2 we have in keeping with this the wonderful warmth of the moment; this is the acceptable year and the day of the glad tidings to men. Peter says, "Christ also hath once suffered for sins". Peter was a witness of the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow. He "once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by [or in] the Spirit". Look at the Spirit. It is the Spirit in which He died and was quickened. In that Spirit going, He preached, and see what the distance back was: "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work". @John 5:17. The Spirit lights up that moment, the hundred and twenty years while the ark was preparing, and shows that the Lord preached then. "In which also going he preached to the spirits which are in prison, heretofore disobedient, when the long-suffering
{267}
of God waited in the days of Noe while the ark was preparing". Such was the energy of the Lord, He was preacher then, He was working then. Preaching and building went on, Noah was the instrument, but Christ was the Preacher.
It is a tale of glory as one sees it stretching back through all those years. What a spirit in the presence of the most dreadful violence and wickedness existing. The Lord testified in wonderful patience through one solitary man, but His Spirit would not always strive: it strove one hundred and twenty years through one man! These were wonderful days; though days without result in the way of conversion, yet there was the fragrance of the testimony, the Spirit of Christ was there, and thus there was something for God.
The other side is in @Ephesians 2:17, the sun, as it were, shining above us. It speaks there of Christ "*coming*", not "*going*", as in Peter. Coming He has preached the glad tidings of peace to those afar off, and to those nigh. The position is this, the Lord Jesus has come; John says, "This is he that came by water and blood" @1 John 5:6: He brought the means of cleansing with Him. The Son of God has come, and Paul says, "and, coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace" to those who were far off, and to those who were nigh. The Lord Jesus is the Preacher, He takes up weak vessels like ourselves, but the preaching is His.
We have spoken of the Gentile territory from which material for the assembly is secured, but there is also the Jewish territory. In Matthew 15 the Lord preached first to the Gentiles; according to the record there, He went first to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon and then into Galilee, and in the light of the next chapter (Matthew 16) we see that God is preparing material, those far off and those nigh, that He might now reconcile both in one body to Himself by
{268}
the cross. So that now we "both have access by one Spirit to the Father", we draw near to God. Reconciled by the cross, brought out of everything in which the flesh prides itself, brought together in one body, through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. There is no long distance with God, but the most intimate relationship; we draw near to the Father by one Spirit, so that we are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God. And all this is through the preaching.
In Ephesians the house is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. The Lord coming He had preached to those who were afar off and to those who were nigh; He followed up His servants in all the rough work and sufferings entailed, and the material was brought in -- the preaching was not in vain. The wonderful result is that we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Not only is a sure foundation laid in Zion, but the grace of Christ gives character to the whole structure; "Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone", @Ephesians 2:20 in whom, too, we grow to a holy temple in the Lord. We are today being fitted together as living stones and increasing to a holy temple in the Lord; through us the divine mind will be known in that day.
{269}
MATERIAL FOR THE ASSEMBLY
@2 Chronicles 3
J.T. Some of us have been occupied elsewhere in looking at the material for the assembly -- the house of God. It might be helpful to pursue the subject. Our inquiry hitherto has had to do merely with the rough work, preparatory to the actual material being brought to Jerusalem. 1 Kings 5 contemplates the house being built, and in the chapter specially now before us, we get more particularly the ornamentation of the house. It was overlaid with gold and with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was gold of Parvaim (verse 6). The question is as to how far the divine thought is entered into and how far we correspond with it.
The epistles which treat particularly of the adorning of the house of God are: 1 Timothy, Titus, and 1 Peter. All these speak of the house and the order that becomes it, and there is also the thought of ornamentation. The idea of ornament is especially seen in persons who are in the place of subjection, that is, in women and in slaves. Peter speaks of the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price.
Rem. A meek and quiet spirit is a great ornament.
J.T. It is mentioned in Peter in connection with sisters in the place of relationship and of relative subjection. A slave in Titus was to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things; that is a very great thought! The idea of ornamentation is very extensive, and enters into the creation of the world. The word usually used for world suggests the thought. God made it. If we look at the heavens they are wonderfully ornamented; we admire the stars. So, too, is the earth; there are mountains, hills, lakes,
{270}
rivers, which beautify it. All these came from the hand of the Creator, showing His skill. The garden of Eden must have been a wonderful place, coming from the hand of God for man's abode. It was God Himself who planted that garden for man.
Rem. Ornaments in the house of God are in His *sight* of great price.
J.T. God is dwelling in His house. He sees a sister, it may be, in the place of subjection, and a slave adorning the doctrine; that in His sight is of great price. We are all called to be subject, not only to those who rule, but also to submit ourselves to one another in the fear of Christ, so that each one can have a part in the ornamentation of the house. David received the pattern by the Spirit, and Solomon built it according to that pattern.
Rem. The thought of variety is connected with ornament.
J.T. Yes; that is seen here. The interior of the house is described here: palms, flowers, precious stones, and cherubim engraved. These things were all intended to beautify the house. Ezra spoke of that, "to beautify the house of Jehovah", @Ezra 7:27.
Rem. The priests can enter into what God has in His mind.
J.T. Yes; Ezra was a priest. All the saints contribute to the adornment of the house. The site on which it is to be reared up was mount Moriah, which means, "shown by Jehovah" -- a shown place; chapter 3:1.
Ques. Has this anything to do with the secret exercises of Ornan?
J.T. David had a wonderful experience there. The sword of judgment was extended over the city, and it was sheathed there. This corresponds to the thought in Matthew -- the material in chapter 15 is from the borders of Tyre and Zidon -- rough material. The Canaanitish woman was one of a race under the
{271}
curse, but she was attracted to Him, her need did that, but He met it and more. He was there for the timber, and in her readiness to submit to the outward degradation of her position, she qualified for elevation to be a cedar. The more ready we are to humble ourselves, the more readily we lay hold of the light. She had to be brought down, so to speak, on the rafts by sea. In chapter 16 the Lord speaks of building His assembly. The idea of "shown" corresponds with Moriah, where the Lord appeared to David. It conveys the thought of revelation. The great point is to lay hold of it in the soul. Moriah means, you are shown a thing.
Ques. Do you link this in any way with Abraham?
J.T. It is not the same mountain, but there is a correspondence, for Abraham was *shown* the mountain on which to offer up Isaac; @Genesis 22:2.
Ques. Is there any thought in sacrifice being connected with the foundation?
J.T. David would not offer to God what did not cost him something. "I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah to offer up burnt offerings without cost". @1 Chronicles 21:24. In @1 Chronicles 21:28 David got light, but the reference here is to Solomon. He began to build the house of Jehovah on mount Moriah, meaning "shown of Jehovah", where He appeared to David his father. See notes in New Translation. If you apprehend this you begin on spiritual lines. The saints are the house of God, but the spiritual underlies all that. You must connect everything in a spiritual way.
A point to be noticed in Matthew is the geographical position of these chapters. In chapter 15 the Lord is in the territory of Tyre and Sidon, and in chapter 16 at Caesarea Philippi. The whole earth was involved in the building; material is to be brought from every part of it. "Make disciples of all the nations", @Matthew 28:19 but the spiritual foundation underlies all. When you
{272}
come to the foundation of the house you are on spiritual lines. You may find these places on the map of the Roman Empire, but you cannot get the spiritual foundation on the map. You have to be *shown* it. "On this rock I will build my assembly". "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens". @Matthew 16:17,18. That is the point you get here; that is the principle of mount Moriah. It is a spiritual thing arrived at on spiritual lines. "This was Solomon's foundation".
Ques. Is the foundation the sufferings of Christ?
J.T. The full price has to be paid. Immediately after the revelation of the Son of God the Lord speaks of His sufferings; @Matthew 16:21. The point here is the foundation. "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". Peter discerned Him as Son of the living God. This was nothing he had seen before, it had not been presented in testimony in an objective way, but was a revelation shown. The ground taken in Romans is, He is "marked out Son of God in power ... by resurrection of the dead" @Romans 1:4; that is objective ground, outward testimony. The Lord is declared Son of God by resurrection of the dead; that is by the testimony of what He did: He had raised the dead. The assembly is built on something inward, something known inwardly. Verse 3. This was Solomon's foundation. The foundation was there, the rock. It is Solomon's foundation because he is the builder. The foundation is there. There is a *moral* connection with mount Moriah of Genesis 22. It is God's provision -- the mount was shown and the ram was shown. It is spiritual ground.
F.W. It was *three days¬* journey to get there.
J.T. The assembly is based on revelation, we have to have things shown. I do not mean that there is a fresh revelation to every believer. The revelation is there, but we must reach it, and then it gives character to us ever after; "To whom coming", @1 Peter 2:4 etc.,
{273}
coming to Him in that connection. The movement indicates that you apprehend Christ as the Son of the living God. Here you have, "This is Solomon's foundation for the construction of the house of God". The Lord says, "I will build my assembly". @Matthew 16:18. The foundation is what is for God. "Other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ". @1 Corinthians 3:11. That is the order of man that came out. That does not fit in with this world.
Ques. What is the difference between that which is founded and the foundation?
J.T. The foundation supports the structure. Solomon's foundation was for the construction of the house of God. The rock does not suggest any preparation. It is as it is in its original state; no chiselling there or use of hammer, but original shape and state. Rock speaks of stability. Peter was a stone, a part, but the point in the rock is solidity and firmness; the rock is just as it comes from God -- Son of the living God, a stone cut out of the mountain without hands. We must retain clearly before us the pre-eminence of Christ. He has come out personally in His divine dignity.
Rem. Would you say a word or two as to revelation?
J.T. This revelation (Matthew 16) is one of the most interesting things in Scripture; it is what you must be shown spiritually. The Lord did not reveal that in His service, but the Father was pleased to reveal it to Peter. David received the pattern of the house by the Spirit. The more you receive the revelation in your soul, the more you are impressed with the magnitude of the structure. He who formed the world is building the assembly. Ezekiel, too, is shown the house, "in order that it might be shown unto thee". @Ezekiel 40:4. It is an immense thing to be prepared to be shown. The Holy Spirit is here for that purpose, to take of the things of Christ and to show them to us.
{274}
Ques. What is the thought in everything inside the house being overlaid with gold?
J.T. God is there, all speaks of God. There is no silver mentioned here, although it is mentioned elsewhere in connection with the house. It is a question of what *appears* and is found now in the assembly here. Gold represents what is of God, silver represents redemption. Silver is seen in the sockets of the tabernacle, because the ground being redemption it is prominent. God is seen more in the house; you are not impressed with redemption in Solomon's temple, but with the fact that it is God's habitation, His dwelling-place. The church epistles speak of the house; they have that in view, God is to be seen there. After the foundation we get the length, breadth, and height.
Ques. Why is there brass in the house?
J.T. Whilst it is the dwelling-place of God, it is the place where He judges; there is authority there. We get the foundation of the building here, but 1 Kings brings out the heavenly side -- it is a much more extensive side of things there; it has chambers round about in three stories. Then there are besides, Solomon's own house, the house of the forest of Lebanon and the house of Pharaoh's daughter; these bring in a system of houses suggestive of unseen things, of the spiritual, heavenly order of things. Solomon speaks of things which fit in with the assembly today; "covered the house with gold, and engraved cherubim on the walls". God's government on earth is set forth in the cherubim. The dimensions have a spiritual meaning -- length, breadth, height, twenty by sixty by thirty cubits, and the porch one hundred and twenty cubits high.
Ques. What is the spiritual thought of the porch?
J.T. The length of the porch was in accord with the width of the house, and being one hundred and twenty cubits high suggests a great elevation, which
{275}
points to spiritual dignity. We are not accustomed to much elevation; our thoughts usually run along the earth. The grace of the Spirit is an ornament to the house of God; the most obscure saint may adorn the house of God. An ornament will be put in place by a master hand. Mary is a good illustration of an ornament, she is set in her place by the Lord Himself. It is not necessary for us to come together to be an ornament. The house of God is always there and is not in any way dependent upon our being convened. A man qualifies for the house of God in the measure he rules his own house. These things all come under God's eye. God delights in a well-ordered household, and you are concerned that this consideration should be reflected in all your relations which meet God's eye, not only for righteousness, but for ornamentation. Anna and Simeon are ornaments. Simeon took the Babe up in his arms and said, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word". @Luke 2:29. There was entire subjection; it was not according to his own wish, but according to God's word. He speaks of the Lord according to all that He would be. Anna comes up, a widow far advanced in years. Sometimes the old ones drop out, but she departed not from the temple. She comes in as an ornamentation. Every day she was there serving God with fastings and prayers night and day.
"Neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house, while it was in building". @1 Kings 6:7. There was no noise of workmen, all that was done before. Not only were the stones and the timber prepared, but precious stones and all fine work and artistic work. Solomon garnished the house with precious stones. He overlaid the house with them for beauty. Precious stones suggest the product of great care and labour by the Spirit through discipline. Discipline brings out these precious stones. The Lord works with us for years and years to bring this about.
{276}
Ques. What would the beauty of the stones refer to?
J.T. Solomon overlaid the house with precious stones for beauty. The Lord works with us in discipline; it goes on all the time of our sojourn here. He is dealing with us as sons. "If ye endure for chastening, God conducts himself towards you as towards sons". @Hebrews 12:7. This is to bring out fine results.
Rem. These would be the moral excellencies of Christ coming out in the saints.
J.T. Yes; and in one who is a son, there is dignity beneath it all. The Lord works out His own design, which is that we might be partakers of His holiness-not righteousness; the precious stones are for *beauty*. The spirit of subjection brings within the range of all to be an ornamentation in the house of God. "A meek and quiet spirit, which in the *sight of God* is of great price". @1 Peter 3:4.
{277}
THE LORD'S PLACE AMONG HIS OWN
@Genesis 49: 8 - 10; @Hebrews 2:11,12
J.T. It says of Judah that he "prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler", @1 Chronicles 5:2. He is referred to as one whom his brethren shall praise; and what follows in the passage explains how this will come about. Judah in that way becomes a type of the Lord, as acquiring a place among His people; He prevails. He acquires a place first on moral lines, as in Romans, and then personally as in Colossians. He is Head in Colossians on the ground of what He is personally, and in Ephesians He is made Head as man according to God's purpose; He acquires a place thus in the midst of His people, and becomes their Leader.
Rem. In Revelation 5 He is spoken of as the Lion of the tribe of Judah who had prevailed.
Rem. John sees Him as "a Lamb as it had been slain". @Revelation 5:6.
J.T. The Lord's supper brings before us His love; He prevails in love.
Ques. Do you mean that He prevails over us and subdues us? I was thinking of Him more as prevailing as a lion's whelp.
J.T. Before He prevails universally He prevails among His people.
Ques. Does the line of the hymn, "Whose love has set us free", show it? (`6:5)
J.T. Yes; you cannot but accord Him the supreme place. Romans brings the Lord in as taking up what lay upon us, and the Deliverer becomes the Husband; @Romans 7.
Ques. Would you connect it with John 21? Love had prevailed in Peter's case.
{278}
J.T. Exactly. Judah acquired the place of chief ruler on the ground of prevailing. The Lord gradually acquires a place with us, and first, as we know Him in what He has done for us; we thus become attached to Him. He prevails, as we see in Romans 5: "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. *Much more* then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, *much more*, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life", @Romans 5:8 - 10. It is on moral grounds; as David in slaying Goliath acquires a place in the heart of Jonathan, so the Lord gradually acquires the chief place in the heart of the believer.
The introduction of Judah as the one whom his brethren should praise is worked out in that he couches as a lion. It says, "Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?" @Genesis 49:8,9. Then it says, "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be". The sceptre and the lawgiver come in in the way of subjugation and adjustment. We shall never know the Lord "in the midst", nor accord Him His place as is due, unless we apprehend the sceptre and then the lawgiver.
Ques. What do we understand by the sceptre?
J.T. Well, I think it is the rule of Christ. The sceptre is a well-known figure of rule and government. Many of the Lord's people are not subject to Him. Romans brings out that He is Lord, and we come in for what He administers on the ground of obedience. "And to him", it says, "will be the obedience of
{279}
peoples". Romans works this out doctrinally. The Lord acquires a place through what He has effected for us, and then the sceptre comes in. You may accord Him that place, but He asserts it as well. The sceptre symbolises His power and His official place as Lord; so that the sceptre shall not depart. It is not going to be taken out of His hands. Kingly power is gradually vanishing from the governments of this world, but in spite of that the sceptre shall not depart from Judah. The Lord is not going to relinquish the sceptre, whatever men say or do, but holds to it; and if we are to come in for the blessing, there must be the recognition of His rule. It is seen strikingly in Acts 9. He brings down Saul, the enemy of the saints; He reduces him to make him subject, and then he is made a vessel for the service of the saints. That is what the lordship of Christ involves. We may well, therefore, give this matter our serious attention. But then, there is not only the sceptre, but the lawgiver.
Ques. Would you say, that there must be the recognition of the lordship of Christ before we can know Him as Head?
J.T. There must be.
Ques. Would lordship lead to headship?
J.T. It makes way for it. "And to him will be the obedience of peoples", @Genesis 49:10.
Rem. Like Saul of Tarsus, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" @Acts 9:6.
J.T. Yes; he recognised the sceptre. The rule of Christ entered his soul.
Ques. Is it a moral thought? He is Lord of all now, not future only.
J.T. We say, "Other lords besides thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name", @Isaiah 26:13. But, alas, a great many of the Lord's dear people refuse the Lawgiver and sceptre. Many of them have been turned aside
{280}
and find themselves in connections which disregard the authority of the Lawgiver, so that they miss the headship of Christ. You cannot get the opening up of ministry from the Lord without the headship of Christ. From the Head all comes -- all the substance, and nourishment, and consequent increase.
Ques. How does Shiloh come in here, "Until Shiloh come"?
J.T. Shiloh is the gathering centre: "And to him", refers to Christ, I think, as the gathering centre for His people. We see that historically, for the tabernacle was set up in Shiloh in Joshua's time, and Israel assembled there, and the mind of God was disclosed as to the inheritance, confirming what I was remarking, that we get the good of headship as we are subject. There were seven tribes which had not till then received their inheritance, and the lot was cast at Shiloh. We get the mind of God there as to our place in the inheritance.
Rem. I was thinking of John 20, which seems to coincide with Shiloh.
J.T. Yes, quite; there is immense stress laid on obedience in the Scriptures if we are to come in for the blessing. It is said of Moses that he "was king in Jeshurun". @Deuteronomy 33:5. He was accorded a king's place.
Ques. Does that mean that he was chief in their affections?
J.T. Yes. It was not kingship as in David. Moses had *acquired it*, "When the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together", @Deuteronomy 33:5.
Ques. Is God's thought that we should come under the lordship of Christ before headship? Peter says, He was made both Lord and Christ.
J.T. Yes; God made Him both Lord and Christ, so that the Holy Spirit is given to those who obey Him. Hence the saints today who disregard the authority of Christ shut themselves off from the
{281}
benefit of the Head. Numbers of God's beloved people find themselves in circumstances where the sceptre and the Lawgiver are disregarded.
Rem. I was rather interested in the thought of the lawgiver. Some of us do not like law; but you said just now it was His commandments.
J.T. Well, "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me", @John 14:21. It is a wonderful thing to see the government of God set forth in Christ. Matthew is the great assembly gospel. In chapter 5 Jesus went up into a mountain, it says, and His disciples came unto Him, and He opened His mouth and the first word spoken was, "Blessed", which I think He repeats nine times over. It is blessing that is before Him. This is the kind of rule you come under. What a government that is! People are to be blessed, but blessed in subjection. Hence He says: "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time", etc., etc., "but *I* say unto you". @Matthew 5:21,22, @Matthew 5:27,28. That was quite intelligible to the disciples because they had come up to hear. So a good law is a great blessing.
There can be nothing greater in the government of a nation than good laws. No country in the world has been more favoured than this country in that regard, where there are laws that guarantee in detail a man's life and property, in so far as that is possible in human affairs. In Matthew 5 to 7 we get a law formulated from the lips of Christ, and in Psalm 119 an answer in men by divine grace to it. In Numbers 21 we read, "Spring up, O well ... the princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver". @Numbers 21:17,18. The Holy Spirit comes in in that connection. There is respect for the Lord, "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him". @John 14:21. He comes in in that way.
{282}
Rem. That is a wonderful thought, "My Father will love him". @John 14:23.
J.T. Such is His appreciation of such as have His commandments and keep them.
Ques. Do you see that order in Psalm 45, where it speaks of the subject of righteousness, "Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness [lawlessness]: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows"? @Psalm 45:7.
J.T. That is a most interesting passage, because it shows what the sceptre is. It is a sceptre of righteousness. Paul says to the Romans, "Ye have obeyed from the heart" @Romans 6:17; and that works out not only in regard of our salvation, but in the assembly -- we learn how to take our place in relation to others.
Rem. We read in Numbers of the well which was dug at the direction of the lawgiver. I was thinking in that way of the heart being secured -- the result of Christ being the Lawgiver.
J.T. Yes; room is made for the Holy Spirit as we are subject to the Lord.
Ques. What about the first epistle to the Corinthians in relation to the commandments?
J.T. Well, I think that epistle embodies the Lord's commandment as governing the assembly. It says, "If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14:37. It is in the singular you will observe, commandment, not commandments; and, as I was saying, those who pull away from the rule of the Lawgiver forfeit much blessing. You cannot have the gain of the headship of Christ unless you are subject.
Rem. So that acknowledging the sceptre as indicated in Romans would lead on to Ephesians.
J.T. I think Romans adjusts us individually to take up our place with others. So chapter 12 commences:
{283}
"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service". @Romans 12:1. Then he goes on to show that we being many are one body in Christ, and teaches us how to behave, and how to take up our relative place in relation to one another; and that leads us to Corinthians, where we are formally addressed as the assembly of God. The saints are addressed as the assembly of God, in a place -- in Corinth. And then is added, "with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours". There is the full acknowledgment of all who call upon Him as Lord, "both theirs and ours". Corinthians 1:2. That brings in the universal thought of the assembly. "There is *one* Lord, *one* faith, *one* baptism". @Ephesians 4:5. In all the assemblies every thought of independency is excluded. We are bound up together. The whole assembly is bound up, in that way, in the acknowledgment of the Lord and of the principles that govern the house of God, and this makes room for the headship of Christ; so that He has His place amongst us, as it says in @Hebrews 2:12, "In the midst of the assembly I will sing thy praises".
Rem. And thus the obedience of the people is really their gathering around Him as the Lawgiver; thus we receive light and guidance and nourishment from Him as Head.
J.T. I think we prove the truth experimentally in submitting to the principles of the house of God; we get ministry and nourishment from the Head.
Ques. Would you suggest that without that we do not get divine communications?
J.T. I know we do not.
Rem. In order to get the mind of the Lord any introduction of that which is of man must be excluded.
J.T. Yes. In 1 Corinthians they are regulated by way of consistency. It would be inconsistent to
{284}
identify themselves with Judaism or heathenism, since they were identified with the symbols of the death of Christ. The questions are put: "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread", @1 Corinthians 10:16,17. It is "we", not 'ye', meaning that the whole assembly is in view in the Lord's supper; and then in the next chapter you get the Lord prevailing. It is introduced so as to place the Lord before us in His love. Judah prevailed among his brethren. So the Lord prevails among His brethren. We are made to feel this as He is before us in the Supper, and that makes room for His headship.
Ques. What do you understand by prevailing?
J.T. Well, that He acquires such a place in your heart that He rules and controls you; you give way to Him.
Ques. Is it a moral thought, "Unto him shall the gathering of the people be"?
J.T. Yes. In John 11 the Lord intended to prevail at Bethany; He had not as yet prevailed. He was a friend of the family, but that did not mean that He was everything to the family. They were more occupied with Lazarus¬ death than with Him. But His presence with them produced a great effect upon them, and in chapter 12 Christ is everything.
Ques. Might we speak of that as lordship merging into headship?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. In chapter 11 He prevailed by way of authority, but in chapter 12 in love.
J.T. Yes; so He says, "Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" @John 11:40. Then we see what a wonderful thing happened. The Lord wept and
{285}
groaned. These things are intended to affect Mary, and they do; indeed it is irresistible. In chapter 12 they make Him a supper. Lazarus is now one of those who sit at table with Him. Mary and Martha are thinking of Christ now.
Ques. Would it be right to say that in prevailing Christ gets the pre-eminence in the affections of His people?
J.T. Yes; you must give way, you then get the good of His headship.
Ques. Is it not interesting that in John 11 we get Shiloh brought in in principle, "that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad"?
J.T. Yes; and, in the next chapter, "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me". @John 12:32. It is not "all men" -- "men" should be omitted. It is universal. He prevails in the Supper. His love to death is presented there; that is the intent of it. Then in chapter 12 there is room for the Spirit; and in chapter 14 there is ministry. We are to be regulated by the law that governs the house in the ministry. Five words spoken with the understanding so that the assembly may receive edification is better than ten thousand words in a tongue. We might say, too, the choir is being formed. The ark prevailed in David's day. It had been twenty years in the house of Abinadab. Later David brought it up; but he did not bring it up according to the due order, and so it was turned aside into the house of Obed-edom, and the blessing turned aside with it, and he missed it. He hears of it, and then he does not want to miss the blessing, so he resorts to the due order, which would correspond with the Lord's commandment. He then dances before it. It had prevailed in his heart; and after that in 1 Chronicles you get opened up the whole service of song for the house of God -- a wonderful choir and singing. The first epistle to the Corinthians
{286}
corresponds with the way in which He prevails in His people, so that room is made for the singing. You have the instruments, so to speak, in chapter 14, and in chapter 15 the strings of the instruments are tightened up by the truth of resurrection. "To the chief Musician. On my stringed instruments", Habakkuk says. "The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds¬ feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places", @Habakkuk 3:18,19. Whatever happens, "I will rejoice in the Lord, and will joy in the God of my salvation". The prophet is quite free and sings.
Ques. Does the Lord's supper link us up with the eternal state?
J.T. Well, it leads up to it, especially as the breaking of bread is connected with the first day of the week. Chapter 16 suggests spiritual *sentiment*, which necessarily enters into the singing. If your heart is under the influence of the first day of the week you are spiritual, for it is the beginning of a spiritual and eternal order of things. 1 speak of what is in these chapters for faith to take up.
Ques. Do you say that the Supper itself becomes the preparation for the choir?
J.T. Well, I think the Lord comes in and prevails. He takes His place; then we have the Spirit in chapter 12, love in chapter 13, and edification in chapter 14. The governing word in that chapter is "understanding". You cannot have a choir without that. Everyone must know his part. In chapter 15 we are tuned up by the resurrection of Christ, and in chapter 16 we get allusion to the sentiment that should prevail among us on the first day of the week.
Rem. In the resurrection we see the glory of God, and we reach that morally by calling on the name of the Lord. We recognise Him as Lord; we come into a sphere of salvation. Then His love and grace towards us would lead us on into that order of things.
{287}
We are led on by Him; and the One who leads the singing in the midst of His people is the One who has been perfected through sufferings.
J.T. Yes; so that we come on step by step until we apprehend we are *of Him:* that "both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren".
Rem. So we reach the moral sphere where the Man of joy opens up the joys of His heart and displays the Father's glory.
J.T. Yes.
Rem. We were saying the Lord "triumphed gloriously", @Exodus 15:1 etc., but it is another thing to have the heart opening out to Him in affection.
J.T. To prepare Him an habitation. Well, all that had its fulness in David. David is the counterpart of Moses really; David brought about the dwelling and all that was suited to the dwelling. The habitation is what was set up in Jerusalem. There was nothing about singing in connection with the tabernacle.
Rem. So Psalm 132 would come in.
J.T. Yes; David said, "We *heard* of it at Ephratah" (that is, of the ark), but it does not stop there, but goes on to say, "we *found* it in the fields of the wood". @Psalm 132:6. The first book of Chronicles opens the subject up to us in detail. David introduced the song first to Asaph, the chief singer; @1 Chronicles 16:7. There you have it.
Ques. Could we have a word or two as to Hebrews 2, which was read?
J.T. Well, I was thinking we are led on. As the Lord becomes better known we are led on to the knowledge that we are *of Him*. Romans is on moral grounds, and Colossians on personal grounds. You form a link with Christ personally. Ephesians is Adam and Eve -- "bone of his bone". "This mystery
{288}
is great", says the apostle, "but I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly". @Ephesians 5:32. Ephesians is the disclosure of the secret of the mystery. It is in the understanding of Ephesians that we can enter into what we get here in Hebrews, that we are "of him". What a wonderful fact that we are of Christ! "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren", @Hebrews 2:11.
Ques. Does that correspond with Colossians?
J.T. It is more Ephesians. Ephesians is the full disclosure of the secret. He says, "This mystery is great, but I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly". You come that way by Colossians. It is personal; the greatness of Christ personally is before the heart; but in Ephesians the woman is brought to the man. There it is the height of divine purpose concerning Christ and the assembly. There is not a shade of disparity between Christ and the assembly in the epistle to the Ephesians.
{289}
HOLINESS
@Romans 1:4; @Romans 5:5; @Romans 12:1; @Isaiah 6:1 - 3.
I have in mind to speak about holiness, a subject which one approaches with much diffidence, but it is so essential that one is encouraged to touch upon it for the Lord's sake. It is but little known, notwithstanding that it is a subject as extensively dealt with in Scripture as any other, and it is particularly in evidence in the way the Spirit of God is designated in those portions which treat of grace. It will be found by comparison that the evangelist Luke, who presents grace in Christ, employs the designation "Holy Spirit" when referring to the Spirit of God more than others; not that John and the other gospel writers have not holiness in view, for John has the seraphim in mind, as I hope to show, but Luke speaks of the *Holy* Spirit much more frequently than John. John treats of the Spirit of God, but refers to Him as the Spirit, or as the Spirit of truth, presenting the truth, as He does from the side of divine sovereignty -- from the side of life. He has ever in view to bring in life -- living creatures. The life introduced thus is holy, essentially holy: "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit", @John 3:6, the Lord said to Nicodemus. The truth is presented in relation to the Holy One, as John says recording Peter's confession, "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God", @John 6:69.
Christ comes in by way of life according to John, and in connection with life, for in Him was life and it was a *holy* life; whereas as presented by Luke He comes in on the line of grace, and the tendency is, in receiving grace, in approaching God as set forth in that gospel, to overlook the thought that He is
{290}
holy. As God has been pleased to proclaim forgiveness everywhere to everyone, the tendency is and, alas! has been, as is seen abroad in the profession of Christianity, to overlook the holiness of God. The grace of God is thus turned into lasciviousness, and trifled with; it is a danger that exists in everyone of us as recipients of grace, and so Luke, as I said, almost constantly employs the designation *Holy* Spirit. The Spirit we have received in connection with the grace of God is the *Holy* Spirit.
It is noteworthy in this connection that Paul at the very outset in his presentation of the gospel emphasises the same feature -- the grace that has come to us in One who had been marked by holiness. It has come to us by way of holiness. Of old the cherubim guarded the way of the tree of life. The cherubim represent the will and government of God, for He will not have persons alive before Him who are not holy. That Adam should have partaken of the tree of life as he was would have been a disaster, an unspeakable disaster, but Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his *holy* myriads", @Jude 1:14. How those holy myriads are produced it remained for Scripture to tell, but Enoch, who evidently was alone in walking with God on earth, is led to see that he is not to be alone for ever. The Lord is to have myriads.
God was not to be limited to one man: He valued an Enoch then as He values one today, for in the love of His heart He looked for company. Enoch walked *with* God, and, I repeat, God valued that; indeed He valued Enoch so much that He told him before He took him to heaven that he pleased Him. There is hardly a thought in the Old Testament more touching than that God should have graciously communicated to this man before He took him out of a world where only corruption prevailed, where men did evil every day, and grieved Him every day, that
{291}
he pleased God. And so we read, "he was not, for God took him". @Genesis 5:24. But that one man was not to remain alone. He was the seventh from Adam, ending, in that sense, a spiritual period.
And so now we have the Lord as the holy One. Enoch and all other saints were holy, but *Jesus* was "*the* holy one of God". @John 6:69. As He came into this world we have the testimony by Luke, "That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God", @Luke 1:35. How precious He was to God as born into the world, and God claimed Him thus. He was infinitely holy, I need hardly say, from the outset, *absolutely* free from all taint. The Spirit of God in Luke surrounds the scene, as it were, with a holy atmosphere, angels attending, and "that holy thing", @Luke 1:35, as the Spirit of God designates the Babe, claimed as the Son of God. So we have holiness in the mind of God associated with Christ from the very outset.
If one looks at the passage in the opening of Luke's gospel, one is impressed by the recurrence of the word 'holy' especially as regards the Spirit. The divine ideal was coming into the world, One who could hold Himself absolutely free from the corruption that obtained there. So, too, the holy myriads will be in correspondence with Him. God is to surround Christ with myriads, but they are to be holy. As the Lord was bearing the judgment on the cross, meeting the wrath of God as regards sin and sins, He said, "Thou art holy". @Psalm 22:3. He maintained there in His holy soul and in His utterance what was due to God. He was not only meeting righteousness. God *was* righteous, but He was more than righteous, He was holy, and holy as inhabiting the praises of Israel. Wonderful thought! that God should inhabit, not heaven, but the praises of Israel, and in inhabiting these He was holy. So in that dark hour that stands alone, Christ is making known to us that if God is
{292}
to be praised, if God is to be worshipped, if God is to be served, it must be in holiness.
Hence, as we were saying, the apostle Paul, in opening his great gospel epistle, refers to the Spirit of holiness, "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead". One has no difficulty in including His own resurrection in that passage, but it refers doubtless to the resurrection of others. It comes down to ourselves in a very touching way, for it involves that our resurrection shall be of that Spirit. We shall be raised absolutely free from taint of sin, and shall come out in glory in entire suitability, and in entire correspondence with Him who is to come with the holy myriads.
Then the question is as to the state of our souls now, there is no question as to what we shall be. This epistle, which is a fundamental epistle, introduces the element of holiness at the very outset, and Jesus testified to it as He died, "bearing our sins in his own body on the tree", for the epistle tells us that God sent His own Son "in likeness of flesh of sin" @Romans 8:3 -- it is a remarkable expression -- and yet He was infinitely holy, and could say as sin-bearer, "Thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel". @Psalm 22:3. So in that gospel which is to lay the foundation of Christianity in souls the apostle introduces the thought at once that the Lord Jesus was "marked out" -- not made -- "Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness". Thus we have the element of holiness, the germ of it, for the gospel received into the believer's soul carries the germ of everything with it; every feature is there to be developed.
But the believer needs more than the light. So I read in Romans 5, which brings out another thing; "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us". The gospel has in view the hearts of saints as the sphere of God's
{293}
operations. He is to dwell in the praises of our hearts, all is to emanate from hearts filled with the holy love of God. The Lord having gone on high is made Lord and Christ, that is, He is set up officially over everything, but for the moment He is occupied with the hearts and bodies of the saints. Presently He is to be occupied with other things, with the physical heavens and earth, for every item of the creation of God belongs to Christ. Indeed, the gospel is announced to all creation, but He is occupied now with our hearts, "Son, give me thine heart", @Proverbs 23:26 He says. That is the logical outcome of the reception of the light of the gospel. The Holy Spirit is given to all who obey Christ, and we obey, as the word says, "from the heart". Christ is made Lord, and He is exercising His authority at the moment in taking charge of our hearts, and garrisoning them with the holy love of God. If He secure the heart, He secures everything. "Keep thy heart with all diligence", the word says, "for out of it are the issues of life". @Proverbs 4:23. The whole body is affected by the heart, hence God lays hold of it.
Romans 5 is a kingdom chapter; it unfolds what accrues to us through our Lord Jesus Christ. The chapter shows what a believer comes into as coming under the dominion of Christ. The Holy Spirit is here in relation to the authority of the Lord so as to enforce it in our hearts, and He does it effectively by bringing in the love of God. No one is really subject who does not love. It is in love you are subject; it is in love you say, "Our Lord". No one can say *Lord* Jesus save by the Spirit. In the sense of love the believer is effectively subject, and then he is for the divine pleasure. God has won you and He is not going to give you up. He is wonderfully patient. He may discipline you, and discipline is one of the assets of the kingdom; instead of tribulation being removed it is employed to work out patience. The
{294}
Lord sees to that, for He will have your heart and bring the love of God into it. It is the service, I venture to say, that He has the greatest pleasure in at the present time.
We have "the Lord of glory" in @1 Corinthians 2:8, and "the glory of the Lord" in the second epistle @2 Corinthians 3:18, and glory is that He brings in the love of God. He makes the covenant of God effective in our hearts; and, as I said, I believe it is the service the Lord has most delight in at the present time. It is wonderful to think of the way God has designed to bring about subjection at the present time, by introducing into our hearts positively and authoritatively His love. So God is now producing a holy vessel on the earth. His train is to fill the temple, as we read in Isaiah 6, and we are to be in that train; but how, save on His own terms, that is, by having our hearts indwelt by His love.
So in Romans 12 we have the injunction to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable. Chapter 8 tells us the Spirit is life in us. "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness". @Romans 8:10. I apprehend that corresponds with the living creatures in Revelation 4. They are in the midst of the throne, and are marked by strength, firmness, intelligence, and rapidity-four features. Then what they say is; "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come". @Revelation 4:8. How completely creation is shown to be secured in life and in holiness to God! Then the elders join; they would represent priestly intelligence derived from experience in the ways of God; they fall down and worship God. They recognise He is entitled to all this, for they say, "Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created". @Revelation 4:11.
Now I think Romans brings about in the people of God at the present time what corresponds to the
{295}
living creatures. Paul says, "I beseech you therefore ... that ye present your bodies [for that is the part of us specially connected with creation] a living sacrifice". That is our *intelligent* service, and answers to the living creature which had a face as a man -- intelligence is the feature that is emphasised. It is our intelligent service to present our bodies. A Christian's body is worth more than millions of money to God. If all the money in the world were called into service, you could not make a temple of God out of it, but the believer's body is said to be the temple of the Holy Spirit. Hence you present it living and holy. The Spirit in us is life potentially. It is for me to prove it by the use I make of it. The poorest saint can present his body. We are not to trifle with our bodies. Each one is to hold his vessel, as it says in 1 Thessalonians 4, in sanctification and honour. What am I doing with my body? Present it to God, the apostle says. And how 1 As "a living sacrifice, holy". God will not be trifled with. My body must be according to Himself if I present it. It is our intelligent service. This epistle is supposed to bring about an intelligent state of soul before God, hence the injunction in chapter 12.
Now I think all this leads up to Isaiah 6. John tells us in his gospel that Isaiah saw the glory of Christ. All will remember the passage in chapter 12 in which Isaiah 53 is cited, and then the evangelist quotes from chapter 6 of the same prophet and adds, "These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him". @John 12:41. Who among us who loves the Lord would not rejoice in what Isaiah records, that he saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filling the temple? Seraphim are attending and they say, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory". What I apprehend the Lord is doing at the present moment is filling vessels with glory. The
{296}
"whole earth" is not yet filled; for faith it is so, it is a prophetic scene, but what the Lord is doing now is filling vessels. And all vessels, as we read elsewhere, great and small, are to be hung on Christ, for He is the nail in a sure place. What I have in view is to show how vessels are filled, how vessels of mercy at the present moment are, as the word says, fitted for glory. The Lord is fitting us by bringing the holy love of God into our hearts, so that the whole body becomes luminous. Wonderful the vision that Isaiah had! And he gives the date, the year that king Uzziah died; that has its own voice to us, but time will not permit for us to dwell on it. "I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple", he says. The tendency in the world for many years past has been to drag things down to earth, to the level of the miry clay. Things are on the line of moral degradation, government is dragged down in the same way, and there is no remedy. Politicians may scheme and legislate, and we pray for them, for we must have order, but the miry clay is inevitable; there is no remedy. The only remedy is in glory, in a Man lifted up on a throne. One would connect Isaiah 6 with the Lord's present position on His Father's throne. There is no throne like that for it involves the continuance of the grace of God. As long as He sits on that throne we have the year of grace. And then there is "his train"; I would like to call attention to that. Romans, I believe, brings in the train. As we come to recognise the place the Lord has, and associate ourselves with it, we become, I believe, part of His train. Nothing could be morally greater than to be identified with the throne on which the Lord sits. Even a slave may adorn the doctrine of God the Saviour; one in the lowest grade of society is thus contemplated as in the train
{297}
of the Lord. We see thus what is available to the weakest and most obscure -- to be part of that glorious train. One might dwell on illustrations of it in the New Testament, where His people are identified with Him in His present position, becoming in that sense part of the temple. In @1 Corinthians 3:16 they are said to be "temple of God", being indwelt of the Spirit. The mind of God which gives light as to everything is found in the temple, so that Christians, as part of the temple, ought to be able to give some account of things.
Then there are the seraphim. They are symbolical, and one called to the other. Now I would say no family named of the Father will know mutuality more than we do. We are ennobled by being Christ's brethren; and we have respect one for another. No one can love another if he does not respect him, respect must precede love. The light of the calling enables me to respect the brethren, and then I love them, and have mutual relations with them. So the seraphim call one to another. In that scene of glory there are mutual communications; and what do they call? They speak of glory, that is what they are occupied with. If we respect the saints at the present time, we come to speak one to another of holiness and glory, as having learned the love of God. The secret of it is, that we are vessels of glory; we are able therefore to speak of glory; it is not foreign to us. "The spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you", @1 Peter 4:14 the apostle Peter says. Speaking thus, one has to admit how little of this is current, how little glory is the theme among us. Isaiah could refer to the Lord as exalted and he knew He was holy.
I believe the Lord would impress upon us this great feature, the "knowledge of the holy". May I suggest that we have it before us, that our conversation should be more about Christ as the Holy One.
{298}
Let us familiarise ourselves with the great function that we are to fill. The heavenly city is to come down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God. Let us then, if I may venture to speak thus, familiarise ourselves by the Spirit with this glorious theme. The seraphim cry to one another. This feature of holy conversation marks the moment. It is said of Joseph that he kissed all his brethren; he conveyed to everyone of them that he loved them, and then it says his brethren talked with him; @Genesis 45:15.
{299}
THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE LORD
@John 14:15 - 26; @1 Samuel 7:15 - 17
J.T. The manifestations, or comings, of the Lord to His people may be regarded in a general way. There can be no doubt that He comes to us where the conditions are the most favourable, but it has to be remembered that He comes sometimes for correction. The comings to Bethany indicate that He took account of what was there and came in relation to what was there. The passage in Samuel, I thought, might be indicative of the Lord's circuiting, and the effect of it -- Samuel judged Israel. We can see that John is peculiarly fitted to call attention to the way of love, which this gospel really is, as he himself was such an object of it. The references to love in John 14 are, I think, to impress upon us what the possession of it may involve, what it brings within our reach, and how the Lord having place through it affects and influences the whole house. John 14 does not show the full bearing of His comings and manifestations; it shows what they are to the loved ones, but I think the passage in Samuel, which may be rightly connected with it, shows that all the saints come in for the gain of them; so that he judges, as it says, in all those places and then he judged in Ramah also, "for there was his house".
F.W.J. Would you say a little more as to the difference between the house and the other places he visited; are they connected with the thought of the kingdom?
J.T. He went in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah, and his return was to his house at Ramah. I thought Bethel would speak of judgment in the house of God. Gilgal of the end of flesh and Mizpah.
{300}
I suppose, of covenant relations. Then there was his own house where he lived, the place which love would provide. He judged there too; that would be more intimate, I think. But before we can have the judgment in the house, it seems as if we must know something about Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpah.
A.M.H. I suppose we can hardly come to the intimacy of the family without approaching that way.
J.T. I think that is how the recovery has come about in our times. The addresses to the churches, which give the history of the assembly, would show that the Lord made selection even then, judging Israel, so to speak, according to these principles; but in the recovery there was a revival of the truth of the house of God which would have a very general bearing in the disallowance of the flesh; for there can be no room for the Spirit of God unless we recognise the house and the disallowance of the flesh. Mizpah may be taken to represent that in which God comes in in that way -- and then you have Samuel's return to Ramah where he lived, which would involve a certain liberty with him. One can understand how Samuel would come back to his own house, and then it says he judged Israel there also, and built an altar to Jehovah; he maintained the worship of God there.
F.W.J. Does Bethel show forth the unchanging purpose of God in connection with His house, and Gilgal the real start to the soul, the deliverance from Egypt?
J.T. Yes; the reproach of Egypt was rolled away at Gilgal. When Samuel judged there, he would be constantly reminding them of the fact that the flesh had no place in the things of God.
A.M.H. Would Bethel be an awakening in the hearts of the saints as to what was due to God?
J.T. Well, it was a long-standing testimony to the house of God. It was one of the oldest witnesses
{301}
God had; indeed, it dates back to Abraham's going down into Egypt. It was between Bethel and Ai he set up his altar, but Bethel was a definite place in Israel from the time of Jacob. God appeared to Jacob there, and Jacob said, "Surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not". @Genesis 28:16. God has been in His house for centuries, and many did not know it, but He was there. God had said to Jacob that He would keep him in all places whither he went; and before he goes on his way he built a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it. God never forgot that; He says to Jacob later in regard to Bethel, "I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar ... now arise, get thee out from this land" @Genesis 31:13; then later still, he goes up and lives there @Genesis 35:1, so that Bethel had a great place as a witness on God's part amongst them. Samuel would have that in view in his circuits. In those circuits he was to be feared. When he came to Bethlehem to anoint David, they feared him @1 Samuel 16:4; he represented God. We read here that he judged Israel all the days of his life, even when Saul was king. I think he represents the Lord in the skilled way in which he carries on the judgment of God amongst us, even though the majority of saints have sought out another king. Samuel maintained judgment effectively.
F.W.J. His name precedes the prophets in Hebrews 11.
J.T. Indeed, he presided over them in his own day. When Saul was putting forth his greatest efforts to destroy David, the latter found refuge with Samuel, and Samuel was presiding over the prophets; @1 Samuel 19:20. What wonderful spiritual power it showed that he could carry on his service in spite of Saul! Thus on the one hand the Lord comes within the range of love, which would correspond with His house, but on the other hand we must recognise that in His circuits He takes notice of us all -- even if we
{302}
are not giving proof of our love to Him in keeping His commandments.
A.M.H. How are you connecting Samuel with the passage in John 14? You began by saying the Lord's comings were regarded in a general way.
J.T. John contemplates what Christ would be for us in heaven as Mediator. He says, "I will beg the Father [He does it on our behalf], and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever". What precedes that is, "If ye love me, keep my commandments", that is, it is a question of what is within the range of love. Then He says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", that is a general statement; it is not a question of when or where, but that He does it. In the presence of the Spirit He left the door open for visitations, and His having a footing here; I think, too, that room is made for the other side, He circuits the saints in a judicial way.
A.M.H. I was going to ask whether the judicial activities of the Lord are included in His comings.
J.T. I think so.
F.W.J. Was it after forty days of His circuiting after His resurrection that He prepared them for the Spirit's coming?
J.T. I think He prepared them for His own coming too. The presence of the Spirit here left the door open for Him. The successor to Judas was to be one of the men who had assembled with them during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among them, meaning that it was necessary for one who was to have a place in the assembly to be accustomed to these movements.
F.W.J. The Spirit would not come, according to this scripture, except there was a suitable state wrought in the soul.
J.T. He says, "If ye love me". Then the Spirit's presence provides a way whereby the Lord Himself
{303}
can come in in these different ways. He does not need to come in angelically, as in the Old Testament; He comes in Himself, but Spirit-wise, and that continues.
Ques. Do you mean that the Spirit keeps the door open in the affections of the saints for Christ?
J.T. Yes.
F.W.J. The assembly would not be formed for Him to make His manifestations to till the Spirit had come. You get the pattern of the thing in John 20, but not the assembly proper till the Spirit came.
J.T. It is a very great thing for the Lord to have a door opened here in the presence of the Holy Spirit. I think perhaps we have been a little inclined to limit the comings and the manifestations to a certain time. It is a very general statement, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you".
A.M.H. The thought there is, I suppose, primarily comfort, but it would not be limited to that.
J.T. I was thinking, connecting it with Samuel, that the Lord, in coming, would have the *whole* assembly before Him; "His return was to Ramah; for there was *his house*".
F.W.J. Is verse 21 individual?
J.T. I thought so. "He that has my commandments and keeps them". Verses 15 to 20 refer to the primary state of the saints before defection took place, but verse 21, I believe, contemplates actual defection. But what they had collectively before the defection is now available to individuals on the ground of keeping His commandments, but it is connected with love all through.
Take the anointings in the four gospels by the women; these, taken together, would show what God can anoint here, whether in the government of God or the service and grace of God or the love of God. These converge in the assembly -- the Christ, the anointed vessel. The women in Matthew and
{304}
Mark anointed Him on the head, and their names are not given. In Luke the woman anointed Him on the feet, and her name is not given; but in John, where it is specially a question of love, her name is given; there is personal recognition. John gives us the *persons*, and Paul those persons in the assembly; hence John fits in so well with a day of small things, for it is a question of persons. So here, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me". That one has a name; John brings in the name.
Ques. How do you distinguish between the visitations of Christ referred to in verse 21 and what we get in verse 23, "we will come to him and make our abode with him"?
J.T. There you have a further condition added in answer to Judas¬ question, "Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him". The "word" is a further thought to the commandment. The word involves that you have the *mind* of God. Aaron was anointed in relation to the tabernacle without sacrifice, meaning, I apprehend, that the Lord's ministry was the unfolding of the mind of God as to what God would reside in. The word opens up the things in which God would dwell; that is anointed and Christ in connection with it. And I think that where the word is kept by one who loves the Lord, there is in principle that in which God can dwell. I think the commandment delivers us from existing evil, but the word opens up the structure wherein God dwells. In the passage referred to @Leviticus 8:1 - 12 the *altar* was anointed *seven times*, meaning that there was one capable of sustaining all that was due to God in sacrifices.
A.M.H. You have the scheme God has before Him, and you can make room there for the divine thought.
{305}
J.T. Yes, the Lord has helped us to move in relation to His *mind*. 1 Corinthians is a commandment, but 2 Corinthians opens up His mind more, then Colossians and Ephesians would be the full unfolding of it. God has helped us in relation to these things, and it is in that relation that the Father and the Son dwell with us. It is very interesting to follow up these thoughts. It is His commandment first; we cannot go on with the ecclesiastical system of things around: "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". @2 Timothy 2:19. But then there is what is according to His mind: and the word gives us that.
A.M.H. The commandment has to come first to extricate us. Then the divine thought is that we should enter into the mind of God.
J.T. Yes. In our own time the Lord has not only delivered us from what is evil, but has opened up His mind to us in the ministry graciously supplied, calling attention to Paul's doctrine. In Acts 20 as soon as the breaking of bread is mentioned Paul is brought in and his long discourse (verse 7), as if that was to characterise the house. He says to Philadelphia, "thou hast kept the word of my patience". @Revelation 3:10.
A.M.H. Going back to the first day of the week, is your thought that the breaking of bread there is connected with the new beginning, and then the discourse to give form to it, the development in detail of what comes in on the first day of the week?
J.T. I thought so. John prepares us for what is eternal. He does not connect the *Sabbath* with the resurrection like the other evangelists; this latter would mean that the assembly has a place here in relation to previous testimonies. John immediately speaks of the first day of the week @John 20:1, and again does so when the Lord comes into the midst (verse 19). He begins his gospel, too, with "In the *beginning* was the Word". @John 1:1. He accustoms our
{306}
mind to eternity in the references he makes. Quoting the Lord's words, he says, "No one has gone up into heaven save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven". @John 3:13. "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before" @John 6:62: "Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". @John 17:24. Then he comes to the final thought when He says, "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". @John 20:17. He has lifted us up to that; I think John makes the way for us to come into association with the Lord in what is eternal.
Rem. We are warranted in the breaking of bread to have what is eternal before us.
J.T. I think we are. Then, if the Lord is brought in by the memorial, He would lead us to that.
Rem. In regard to the manifestations, you spoke of them as being general and not referring to time or place. We are apt to connect them with the breaking of bread, at any rate the expression is often used on that occasion. Would you say a little more as to that?
J.T. I think it is quite right to connect them with it. The conditions obtaining as we gather together to break bread are certainly the conditions which would be suitable for His coming, but it would not be right to limit it to that.
Rem. No; "manifest myself to him" might suggest any time, I suppose.
J.T. Yes; but conditions suitable to Him would correspond with Samuel's house. He might have judged Israel without having a house, because after all a judge's circuit does not depend on his house or his family, he has qualifications apart from those. But Samuel, we read, had a house, and he returned
{307}
there, and there he judged Israel. He would judge there in the light of the family. I think we have to recognise the family thought amongst us.
F.W.J. If you have the first day of the week, you have that relationship established, My Father and your Father, My God and your God.
J.T. Yes; then in that relationship we have judgment in relation to the family. I suppose the judgment in the house would necessarily take account of the relations of the brethren. It is wonderful how the Lord is adjusting the brethren. He judges, so to speak, in His house.
Rem. We read in Peter that judgment begins there.
J.T. Yes, quite -- at the house of God.
A.M.H. Public relations would have to be adjusted first, would they not? The covenant is more a public idea.
J.T. Yes. I think the family judgment would correspond to the dealings of Joseph, for when Judah and his brethren came in to the house Joseph *was there;* @Genesis 44:14.
A.M.H. The judgment would have reference to what was between themselves as individuals as well as in relation to Joseph.
F.W.J. When you think of the breaking of bread in the Acts, how does the Supper fit in?
J.T. I think the Supper has reference to the public testimony; that is the eating and the drinking. They are the same, of course, but the breaking of bread is one feature and the eating and drinking another. When the Lord's supper is mentioned it is formally stated that "as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come". @1 Corinthians 11:26. It is the *Lord's* supper involving His authority.
Rem. You said the other day that the Supper was external and that the breaking of bread related more to what is inward.
{308}
J.T. I think the breaking of bread has an inner bearing and the Supper is more connected with the public testimony.
F.W.J. Would the Supper be connected with the activities of divine affections in the soul?
J.T. No doubt; and there is food for the soul in it, but as regards its setting, the synoptic gospels would connect what we do publicly as a testimony continuing on what preceded. In John 20 it is connected with the first day of the week, because there we arrive at the assembly in connection with the purpose of God. In Ephesians the whole counsel of God is told out; there is correspondence between John 20 and Acts 20 -- it is on the first day of the week. But the Lord's supper is in relation to an assembly in a locality, and there is a testimony in it.
F.W.J. The Corinthians were not doing it. Is that the only place you get the term "Lord's supper" mentioned?
J.T. Yes; but you get the breaking of bread mentioned several times.
F.W.J. Is the Supper in that sense a public act?
J.T. I think so. "It is not to eat the Lord's supper". @1 Corinthians 11:20. What he is speaking of is the *manner* in which they were doing things. Outward order is in view, and so the death of the Lord was shown in the eating and drinking of the emblems in the Lord's supper.
Ques. Does the breaking of bread lead to the Lord's supper?
J.T. We have to be very careful lest we convey the thought that there are two things; it is *one* thing with *two aspects*. You could not have the Lord's supper without the breaking of bread, but the breaking of the bread is the memorial; that brings Him in. It is in that way that the breaking of the bread has an inward bearing, for the Lord would lead you into the thoughts of God for you. What we do
{309}
outwardly is a testimony, anyone present can see you eating; it has reference to the death of the Lord, "ye announce the death of the Lord", @1 Corinthians 11:26 but the breaking of bread has reference to what the Lord Himself did when He instituted His supper, hence it is to call *Him* to mind. The Lord having a congenial spot, which I think Philadelphia represents, is of immense advantage at the present time, and it ought to stir our hearts up that there should be such a place. The Lord can, as it were, come to His house, for He not only judges there, but, as we see in Samuel, he built an altar there; there is something now raised up for God in his house.
F.W.J. He was the only link between God and the people.
J.T. Quite. Jehovah was rejected. "They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me", @1 Samuel 8:7. I think the mass of nominal Christians today have rejected the Lord; they have taken on what is according to the customs of the nations around. Nevertheless, it says of Samuel that he "judged Israel all the days of his life"; he kept on praying for them. If you pray for the brethren, you will have power with them.
Ques. Will you say a word about His knocking: "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking" @Revelation 3:20; is it through His own?
J.T. I think He does things mediately, through those available. I think the powerful ministry the
Lord raised up has affected the whole of Christendom. He knocked at their doors.
F.W.J. All that we see in Christendom today would have its seed in Corinth.
J.T. Yes. I think it is a most appealing thing that the Lord has a spot to which He can come; Samuel returned to his house. Then there is something for God too, he rears up an altar there.
{310}
THE DIVINE FAMILY
@John 1:11 - 13; @Proverbs 4:1 - 9
J.T. I thought this passage in John would bring the subject of the counsels of God before us in a concise way as they are in view in this gospel -- these verses being a sort of epitome of what John has to unfold. He reaches the family thought immediately. It will be observed that he places the right of being the children of God on the ground of our reception of Christ and our believing on His name. We are not exactly regarded as born into the family; the question of birth comes in as *fitting* us for the position, but the position itself is on the ground of the reception of Christ.
The passage in Proverbs came into my mind because I think that book has a great place in the education of the family. As we shall see, the right to be the children of God is necessarily come to, under the tuition of the Lord. I think that the Son of the Father's love, into whose kingdom we are thus brought, is typified in Solomon. There is an intimate relation between the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love and the family; the one, I think, merges into the other, but the tuition is of relatively equal importance with the position. If we are to have the right to be God's children, a right which He gives us, we must come under the tuition of the Lord, not exactly as the Lord, but as the Son of the Father's love. There is authority in the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love, but it is hardly the authority of the kingdom, it is the rule of the *Son*. Hence Proverbs, in the early chapters particularly, abounds with parental references and terms, for, whilst He is the Son of the Father's love, yet He takes up a parental place towards us: we come under
{311}
His rule in that way. The citation in @Hebrews 12:5, "My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord", being from Proverbs 3, shows that He has a parental rule over the family. Solomon, I think, typifies the Lord as seen in John 1. The apostle says, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father". @John 1:14. That was how He was contemplated, and in that position, I think, He rules the family. So Proverbs becomes of great importance to us, particularly as young believers, if we are to be in the family of God rightly, and are to adorn it. "Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother; for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck". @Proverbs 1:8.
S.J.B.C. I suppose in Hebrews, when quoting, "My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord", @Hebrews 12:5, the writer says, "the Lord" because it is a quotation, for the whole context shows that he is speaking of a father's discipline of his children.
J.T. Yes, "Who is the son that the father chastens not?" @Hebrews 12:7. Solomon comes in in Proverbs as one who himself was a son unto his father; verse 3 should read, "For I was a son unto my father". The Lord was contemplated as having the glory of an only-begotten with a father. He was *with* Him; so that His rule becomes of peculiar effectiveness. It is a rule of affection, having in view that the family should be rightly formed so as to grace the house.
Ques. In that way, do you view the Lord as having first been in that position in relation to the Father, and then instructing us in it?
J.T. That is what comes out. He was a Son to His Father, but in speaking to us He does not do so as one of the family, He is not in that position exactly, it is rather that He is representative, hence the repeated expression here, "my son"; He does not speak to us as brethren, but as unto sons.
{312}
Ques. On the mount of transfiguration it was said, "This is my beloved Son ... hear him". @Matthew 17:5. Is that the thought of the instruction?
J.T. Quite; only that would have reference to *all* the communications of God, involving the tabernacle, the unfolding of His thoughts, whereas when the Lord speaks in a parental way He has the family in view, which is somewhat more limited and a different line.
S.J.B.C. Are you on the line of sons of the kingdom? I mean, "sons and daughters". @2 Corinthians 6:18. It is not sonship in its full sense as brought out in Ephesians.
J.T. No. We have to distinguish when we come to further inquiry as to the difference between sons and children, but John deals with the family in a very general way. He does not develop the heavenly side, what we are towards God, though he does touch it; but that is Paul's line. John has in view the family as here in whom the Father's traits are seen, and to that end I think Proverbs is of immense importance as bringing us under the direct rule of the Son of the Father's love.
One has remarked on the way in which the book of Genesis deals with the subject so that the stream, so to speak, of generation should be kept pure. Abraham was called upon to come out from his country, and kindred, and father's house. In him God intended to begin the great parental line; so much is made of the birth of Isaac, the weaning of Isaac, and the intimate and affectionate relations between him and Abraham, his father. So when Isaac was received back from the dead in figure, we read that it was told Abraham that Rebekah was on the scene, descended directly from his own parentage. He had it as a matter of light through communication, and later he acts upon this light in sending out his servant to seek her as a wife for Isaac. He is concerned that the stream should be kept, as it were,
{313}
pure, that the family should be unmixed. That is a great principle, I think, in approaching this subject, because the people of God are so affected by admixtures.
A.M.H. Is that why it is emphasised here in John that the children of God have been born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God?
J.T. That is what I thought, according to the principle laid down in @Genesis 1:12,21,25 "after its kind". God abhors admixtures. Later Rebekah lamented, when conferring with Isaac, that the daughters of Heth were such a trial to her; they were typical of the strange elements brought in amongst the people of God. Unconverted people, unspiritual people, finding a place among the people of God cause grief of heart; hence the desire of Isaac and Rebekah that Jacob should go to her kindred.
Ques. When you say, "finding a place", do you mean in association, companionship -- that kind of thing?
J.T. Yes, I think we know something about that. Rebekah protested that life was not worth living with those daughters of Heth in the house. Jacob himself brought great disaster into his house by world -- bordering at Shechem. We find influences such as Bilhah and Zilpah in the family of Jacob. Joseph was keeping the sheep with the sons of the two handmaids, we are told in @Genesis 37:2, and "Joseph brought to his father an evil report of them". I refer to that as illustrative of what I have been remarking as to the allowance of foreign elements in relation to the people of God. They are borne with, but the results are inevitable. These sons of the handmaids, labouring, as they undoubtedly were, at a disadvantage through their mothers, were marked by evil discourse, and Joseph felt it. Joseph is typically Christ as the one who adjusts family relations, and he comes into evidence in this way as
{314}
discerning the evil discourse of these sons of the handmaids.
Ques. What is the antidote to all this for us?
J.T. Well, the avoidance of world -- bordering and worldly associations. The statement here that they were born "not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God", @John 1:13 is God's notice given at the very outset that there is to be no mixture in His family; I do not say that there could be this strictly, but in a public way there can be. Those who have the place of God's children may find these strange corrupting elements among them.
Rem. I suppose the family of God as such is self-supporting, self-sustaining, and complete in itself. You need not go outside of it.
J.T. Quite. We may be assured that God has provided everything for us, but yet I think the book of Genesis has a loud voice for us as to the responsibilities of those who are parents, and as to those who should exercise parental influence among the saints.
Ques. Do you not think the word to Eli is solemn in connection with that, that all of his house should die in the flower of their age because of their sin?
J.T. Yes. We come then into the position of being children of God by receiving Christ; there was no admixture in Him. What had come to pass was this: He was here, as it says, "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us". @John 1:14. He was contemplated as an only one with a father, and He was definitely received.
Ques. Does Paul view the family of God in Philippians¬ in the same way as John when he speaks of the "children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation ... holding forth the word of life"? @Philippians 2:15
J.T. I think so. Paul views them there as the children of God set here as lights; John is occupied with their dignity, and their right to take that place,
{315}
and we are told that as being in that position they were born of God. Man had nothing to do with it.
Ques. Do you think it is possible for one to be in the enjoyment of family relationships of this kind if they are bordering on the world?
J.T. Well, it is remarkable how we seem to carry the spiritual and the natural together at times, how we are able to hold on to what is natural, to the natural birth and all that may go with it. One often notices that, and we know what the flesh is, whereas the principle with the great parent was, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house". @Genesis 12:1. That is the principle that underlies parentage according to God, the family of God; so as we forget our own people and our father's house, we begin to take on a beauty that He appreciates, "So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty", and then it goes on to say, "for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him". @Psalm 45:11. You say, Well, I have come in on the ground of grace; I am called upon to "hearken, O daughter", and addressed as being in the family at the outset; I am a daughter and treated on the principle of grace, called upon to forget my people and my father's house, as if it were optional. But it is not optional, for the next thing is, "He is thy Lord". There is nothing optional with the Lord. If He address you on family lines, and indicate that He sees beauty in you as you abandon natural family lines, yet He immediately gives you to understand that "He is *thy* Lord", and there is nothing optional now; you have to say to Him about everything.
Ques. I was wondering where David's kingdom comes in in connection with this; is it a parallel exercise?
J.T. I think that would be the kingdom as we usually refer to it: "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
{316}
shalt be saved". @Romans 10:9. And then, too, we are baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. I think we come definitely into the kingdom for protection, for rule, for subjection. That is the side of the kingdom as seen in David. You get the Solomonic side in Colossians and the Davidic side in Romans. In Colossians He is the Son of the Father's love, and we have been translated into His kingdom; and that supposes the will being subdued, but the thought of authority is carried forward.
Ques. Authority connected with instruction?
J.T. Yes; it is the authority that a parent has. A man rules in his house, but he rules in affection; but nevertheless absolute rule is there. And so, even to the bride, as contemplated in Psalm 45, it is said, "He is thy Lord".
N.L. Is it not really a question of righteousness?
J.T. Quite. It is worked out in John's epistle.
N.L. "If ye know that he is righteous". @1 John 2:29. It is in the psalm, the One who "loved righteousness". @Psalm 45:7.
J.T. Yes; the bride is to take on His character. One is particularly concerned about the strange elements that God serves notice must not be admitted, named in this passage: the will of the flesh, and the will of man, have no place. But it goes on to say in @Psalm 45:12, "The daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift", that is, having come to the recognition of the Lord and that His will is imperative, and that there is nothing optional, and you worship Him, and He commands the soul definitely, then you come into the region of *gift*. We get the principle of forgetting things in Joseph; he said, "God has made me forget all my toil and all my father's house". @Genesis 45:51. Then we have opened up in the psalm what we come into in the region of gift and clothing -- family clothing. It says, "the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour. The king's daughter is all glorious
{317}
within: her clothing is of wrought gold. She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework ... instead of thy fathers shall be thy children". @Psalm 45:12 - 14. All this, I think, is an incentive to young people to take up the relationships of the family of God, an incentive to abandon all that clings to us after the flesh, that we may see that we are brought into these spiritual relationships leading up to the greatest possible dignity -- to be the companions of Christ within. You will notice that the passage really begins with the position of *the queen at His right hand* in gold of Ophir @Psalm 45:9; that is the light of God for us, but the remainder of the psalm is to lead us up to it.
Ques. Would the thought of dignity in our souls help us on this line?
J.T. I think it is a great thing to see the mind of God in the abstract. The king is described in the early part of the psalm, but he is described by one who loves him. Then the queen is said to be on his right hand. That is the mind of God; but who is going to be the queen? That is then set before us. It is like the latter glory of the house. John sees the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down, but who is going to form that city? When we realise that we are to form that city, then we cast off all natural relationships, our face is set in that direction, and that is what God is doing now, I think, leading us up to see the dignity that is in the mind of God for us, and that nothing of nature enters into that. The abnegation of natural relationships would refer exclusively to what is spiritual and of God; we come into these in carrying out the will of God. It is a question of laying hold of the spiritual family and of the fact that we cannot live in the natural *and* in the spiritual; it is one or the other. We come into the natural to carry out the will of God, not to *live* in it.
S.J.B.C. Do you not think that many have got off the path through being swayed by natural
{318}
relationships? None of us is exactly free from this danger.
J.T. We want to see that the spiritual family has all in it that is necessary for the enjoyment of those who form it, and dignity at the end. The *queen* is the divine thought, the companion of the King. I am being prepared for that, and the essentials are, "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house; so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him". @Psalm 45:10,11.
Ques. How do you distinguish between the family thought in the Psalms and in Proverbs?
J.T. The Psalms usually work things out from the side of *experience;* Proverbs works things out from the side of spiritual affections and authority in the family. The family has a head.
J.J. Would those things you mention in John be the particular danger of the Colossians: the will of the flesh and the will of man?
J.T. Yes. The kingdom of the Son of the Father's love is the protection against these things. The first great thing is to apprehend Christ as the Son of the Father's love; we are attracted to a family over which He is. It does not say the Father has translated us into His own kingdom, but "into the kingdom of the Son of his love" @Colossians 1:13; obviously that there might be that training under Christ which fits us for the family. It is receiving the Lord which gives us title to this family.
Ques. Do you mean it is as receiving the Lord in that way as the Son of the Father's love?
J.T. Yes, it involves that. John presents Him as knowing Him in that way; His own rejected Him, but those who received Him came into this.
Ques. Do you think it would help us to see that in Hebrews 12, which you have already mentioned, God conducts Himself towards us as towards sons?
{319}
J.T. I think it would; that is where discipline comes in.
Ques. Hebrews also speaks of Christ as Son over God's house. Is that the parental thought too?
J.T. Yes. It is an entire mistake to assume that He is in the house as our elder brother, or that He regards us as brethren in that connection. In the house He is in the position of a parent; so that "if ye know that he is righteous, ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him". @1 John 2:29. Now that involves Christ; it is not only that it is God in the absolute, but it involves Christ. It is through Christ that the divine features have come to light on earth, righteousness and love; it is through Him we come into these things. It is a matter of great importance to understand the parental position of Christ as seen in the gospels.
Ques. I think you said that He was amongst His disciples as Joseph was amongst his brethren. Is that so?
J.T. Well, but as parent He is not exactly on that level: He addresses us as sons.
Ques. Do you get it in chapter 13 of this gospel: "Ye call me the teacher and the Lord"? @John 13:13.
J.T. Yes, and then you have the expression, "children" (verse 33). It is in Him that God has come out. We could not be born of God except as apprehended through Christ. There is no denying that there is a sovereign work involved in being born of God, but there is also the thought of taking on the divine features.
Ques. Does that come out in the end of that psalm from which you quoted, "I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever"? @Psalm 45:17.
J.T. Quite. The Lord was here in the place of God, and He could say, "He that has seen me has seen the Father". @John 14:9. The revelation is through Him,
{320}
and, in being born of Him, we take on the divine traits; "everyone who practises righteousness is begotten of him". @1 John 2:29.
Ques. Do you mean that it is in the Son, in Christ, we come to know what the features of the Father are?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. So it is not merely that we come under the direct tuition of the Father as such, but it is the tuition of the Son.
J.T. The tuition is through the Son. The quotation in Hebrews 12, I think, shows that the discipline is through the Son. The book of Proverbs gives the rule, the tuition, the instruction that we receive through the Son of the Father's love. All the discipline comes in that way, I think.
Ques. What are you referring to in Hebrews 12?
J.T. "Ye have quite forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by him". @Hebrews 12:5. That all comes out through Christ. It is what we come into as in the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love, I should say.
Ques. Then in John's gospel you think the Lord was setting before His disciples the Father, as He said, "If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father"? @John 14:7.
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Does not the Proverbs issue in the King and His consort?
J.T. Yes; in the last chapter we have the King and the virtuous woman. We have to do with the *Lord*. Things may seem to be permitted, and we may go on with the spiritual on the one hand, and the natural on the other, but the Lord has to say to all that, for "He is thy Lord"; we cannot get away from it. He will come in sooner or later because He will have things according to Himself. There must be the relinquishment of the natural. If we are going
{321}
to live in the natural, then we have to do with the Lord. He is our Lord.
Rem. To know our origin as being born of God should have great place with us.
J.T. Yes; that is what you get in this passage in John: "Who are born ... of God". The other things are all refused at the outset.
S.J.B.C. You were saying just now that it is not exactly our being born into the family, but would not being born of God imply that, and that then we have right and title to take the place of children? I thought children were always connected with nature, not position so much.
J.T. If you say you are born into the family, you leave out the *moral* side; God works through that. If coming into the family is on the ground of the reception of Christ and believing on His name, then you have the moral issue. How did you come to receive Christ? There must have been some moral process that led you to do that. New birth does not put you into the family; coming into the family involves a moral process. God always works on those lines. It is that which makes the fibre whereby in later days you learn to refuse the will of the flesh and the will of man. How did you come to receive Christ? Did you see anything of the flesh, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man in Him? No, you did not. Then there must have been a moral process. If you have received Him, it means that you have learned to abandon the will of the flesh and the will of man.
Ques. Would you say receiving of His fulness is consequent upon receiving Christ?
J.T. It goes with it; but receiving Christ means that you have decided the matter. He has been presented to you in testimony, and you have decided, you are going to accept what He presents. There is
{322}
not only the reception of Him, but believing on His name and what that involves.
Ques. Do you connect intelligence with it?
J.T. Yes. There has been no suggestion of the flesh, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man in Him. Then how did I receive Him? I received Him through a moral process in the soul. I have come to prefer Him to the will of the flesh and the will of man. "He was in the world, and the world had its being through him, and the world knew him not". That speaks of what awful darkness exists in the world. It is the world, too, which He made. The Creator was in it, but they did not recognise Him. They "knew him not". They did not recognise the features of the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, and yet He "dwelt among us". Then He came unto His own (those who had a special relation to Him as Messiah) "and his own received him not". Then it is put in the way of contrast, "But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God".
Ques. Is it not important to see that this does not come in in the synoptic gospels, but in the gospel where the sovereign work of God comes out, and they are born of God in order to receive Christ?
J.T. Yes, that underlies it. They would never have arrived at the discernment of His features without that; but there is the *discernment*, they received Him and believed in His name.
F.W.J. He would be the source of all light. They had no light apart from Him.
Ques. How do you understand the passage, "He who receives whomsoever I shall send receives me; and he that receives me receives him who has sent me"? @John 13:20.
J.T. That is on the same line; it is the principle of representation. We get the principle of representation at the outset in Scripture. Image comes before
{323}
likeness. God said, "Let us make man in our image after our likeness", @Genesis 1:26, but after sin came into the world, likeness must be seen before representation; hence in @Genesis 5:3 we read, "Adam begot a son in his likeness, after his image". After sin comes in we must have likeness first, because likeness is a moral feature. Before that statement is made, we read that men began to call on the name of the Lord; and it agrees with what we are speaking of, that in Christ here we have the likeness of God absolutely; it was God Himself, but there was likeness in the moral features, and hence the representation. Then the reception of one who is sent by Christ is the reception of Him, because there is likeness there.
Ques. Would "whomsoever I shall send" @John 13:20 involve too the Holy Spirit?
J.T. I think He is referring to what He had in mind in the teaching. He sends them out at the end. He breathes upon them and says, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you". @John 20:21. They would be representative, because of having His Spirit; they would be like Him.
Ques. Was not that representation true of the Colossians? It was said to them that they had received Christ Jesus the Lord, and His features were seen in them; they were to walk in Him.
J.T. Yes.
A.M.H. Do you come back in that way in Colossians to the thought of the image of the invisible God?
J.T. I think that is what is set out; the epistle begins with that. The thought is to bring us into correspondence with Him in Colossians.
Ques. What is your thought as to believing in His name?
J.T. That refers to the renown that He acquired "These are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye
{324}
might have life in his name". @John 20:31. The name involves, I think, His absence now. John wrote this long after Christ went to heaven. His name had acquired a place and the saints were here in it -- they believed in His name.
Ques. In view of what you have said, why does Solomon emphasise so much the necessity of being formed in wisdom?
J.T. Because I think God intends to set out His wisdom in His family: that is where the wisdom of God shines. The apostle says, "We speak wisdom among the perfect ... God's wisdom in a mystery ... which none of the princes of this age knew, (for had they known, they would not have crucified the *Lord of glory*)". @1 Corinthians 2:6. The wisdom of God was, as he says "predetermined before the ages", (@1 Corinthians 2:7) hidden wisdom for our glory; hence the immense importance of the saints coming into divine wisdom. "Wisdom is the principal thing", Solomon says. Solomon was typical of Christ; he was a son unto his father, and tender, and an only one in the sight of his mother. I think he was the most extraordinary babe we read of in the Old Testament. He is called Solomon, and it is said Jehovah loved him; in fact, Jehovah had in His mind to make him His own son. Well now, as Solomon enters on his rule, he says to God, I do not know how to go out or to come in. There is the beginning of what we get here, because if we are in the family, the thing is to know how to go out and to come in. The Lord Jesus went out and came in amongst them from the time of John's baptism until He was received up, and Solomon says, I do not know how to do that. The Lord Jesus knew how to do that. He knew how to take a place in a family, how to be housefather, how to touch their hearts in family dignity. So God says to Solomon, I will give you what you have asked for. I will give you other things, but I will give you that, and the first great
{325}
test of Solomon's wisdom was the maternal feature. Can he determine who is the mother of the child? That is where wisdom is tested as to whether we can determine the parentage -- whose the child is. One can easily tell where children are brought up under the nurture of the assembly.
Ques. Is that what the apostle brought before the Galatians to discern their true character?
J.T. Yes. The true mother of the child loved the child. Solomon said, "Bring me a sword". @!Kings 3:24. The one woman lay on her child; she was not a true mother. It is a poor mother that lies on her child at night. The other one had the child in her bosom, and the false mother took the living child out of her bosom; the bosom was where the child belonged, and Solomon brought to light immediately by the suggestion of the sword who the mother was. That is where the wisdom of God shines. We can tell where the instincts of Christ are from the maternal side, for there is the maternal side amongst us as well as the paternal side. Paul says he brought up the Thessalonians as a "nurse would cherish her own children". @1 Thessalonians 2:7. He would not lie on one of the children! He says, Ye are beloved by God. The Thessalonians were to God exactly what Solomon was; they were *beloved of God*. Paul had the maternal feeling and care for the Thessalonians. You could have easily told by visiting Thessalonica what kind of a mother they had.
A.M.H. Do you think the sword would suggest the Lord's ways in dealing with us to bring to light what the true generation is?
J.T. I think that is what comes out very often in the crises amongst us. You can soon tell where the mother is. I have known brethren who said they would do this or that even though their action divided the saints of God, and I think such are like this woman who would have the child divided. That
{326}
is a terrible spirit to be found amongst the people of God; the true maternal spirit says, No, keep the brethren together, we want them all. It is a wonderful thing to see how in a maternal way brethren are to be kept together, in the truth of course, but to divide wantonly is of the devil.
{327}
FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS
@Romans 5:5; @1 Corinthians 12:7 - 13; @Romans 8:14 - 16
I have in mind to speak of the Holy Spirit as here to bring about immediate, intimate, family relationships and the affections suited to them. We are called into God's immediate family -- that is our greatest blessing. In the pattern of the house given to David by the Spirit, we read of upper chambers and of inner chambers; the upper chambers suggestive of that family dignity which is to mark the people of God, and the inner chambers speaking of that intimacy and nearness to God and to Christ which also belongs to the people of God. Every family in heaven and on earth is named of the Father and has part in the scheme of glory, but meanwhile He is working to bring about a family which is in the greatest possible nearness to Himself as having the Spirit of His Son, to whom also belong the "upper chambers", as indicated in the Lord's message through Mary to His brethren after He was risen, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God". @John 20:17. The disciples had been prepared for this by the Lord; the relationships and the affections suited to them had been in view in the various manifestations of His glory they had witnessed in His life on earth. In chapter 2 we read, "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory". @John 2:11. That was the beginning, and so we have a succession in John's record calculated to prepare their hearts for the place designed for them in the counsels of God. The Lord said to Nicodemus, "No one has gone up into heaven save he who came down out of heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven". @John 3:13. And again to the Jews, "What and if ye
{328}
shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?" @John 6:62. These and many other references made to the men whom the Father had given Him out of the world would prepare them for the glory of the new position they would share with Him. Indeed, they had heard these words from His lips, "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory". @John 17:24. All this was preparation for that final message, "I *ascend*". He was ascending to His Father and to *theirs* -- the "upper chambers" were theirs! I go to prepare a place for *you*. How little they understood this as He spoke to them, but how wonderfully it would unfold to them later after He was glorified. When the Holy Spirit came, as sent forth from the Father and the Son, they understood that there was a place for them in the family, both the upper chambers and the inner chambers.
So in this connection I want to speak of the Spirit in His service in the kingdom and in the house, the assembly, and in His service in the family. The relation of the Holy Spirit in the kingdom is a wide subject, but I only touch upon one feature of it which affects the family. It is one thing to be in the kingdom, and another to be in the house of God, and still another to be in the family. There are intimate relations in all these concentric circles into which we have come. If we think of David, that man after God's own heart, a remarkable king, yet he could not build the house. As to himself he had to confess, "my house is not so with God". @2 Samuel 23:5. He was no success as a family man, great as he was in the kingdom. We have to distinguish and not stop short in the kingdom, but press forward to the truth of the house. Solomon built Him an house; He had also his own house. I connect the thought of the family with that. We read of Joseph as having a house, Samuel too, to which he returned, and where also he
{329}
judged Israel. So there is that which corresponds to this thought now, that which is the immediate sphere of God and of Christ, the family thought, and the Holy Spirit is here that the saints might be in immediate, intimate relation to God as their Father.
But then there is the service of the kingdom. Romans gives the doctrine of it, not indeed doctrine cast in iron moulds, or set forth in creeds, but as Moses said, "My doctrine shall drop as rain, my speech flow down as dew, as small rain upon the tender herb, and as showers on the grass". @Deuteronomy 32:2. That is what Romans is, it is doctrine that comes down. We cannot be right without doctrine, it is like the banks to a river, it keeps the mind in proper channels. So then the kingdom is the sphere where the will of God is dominant, and where the Spirit operates, and there it is that the doctrine comes down from heaven itself with refreshing power. In the kingdom the doctrine is distilled like the dew. We come into it through our Lord Jesus Christ, everything reaches us that way. Tribulation existing, it becomes our servant; instead of outward deliverance from evil, we are made inwardly greater than the evil; we overcome evil with good. That is the triumph of God! This kingdom levies tribute from the very evil elements it has to do with, and calls them into service for good. So "tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us". @Romans 5:3 - 5. The action of the Spirit under the Lord -- for it is a feature of the kingdom -- is to shed the love of God abroad in our hearts. The Lord is the Lord of glory, and He is bringing in authoritatively the love of God. We are indeed vessels of mercy, fitted for glory; and now the Lord is insisting on the glory being introduced, the love of God filling the vessel. We are to be filled with the glory of the
{330}
love of God. Is the Lord allowing us to be in this scene empty and inactive? No, the Lord is the Lord of glory; He is over the glory, it is under His hand. Glory has shone out in the death of Jesus, it is where the love of God shone out, and it has shone in our hearts. That really brings us to the ministry of the new covenant, for we are to be active in spiritual life. The letter kills, the Spirit gives life, and we read, "the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty". @2 Corinthians 3:17. So the Lord brings in the Holy Spirit into our hearts, and He sheds the love of God abroad there, and we are thus in the kingdom, not in name only, but in power. The heart is subdued by the love of God; we bow. There are many other things connected with the kingdom, but the feature I would press at this time is that the Lord brings into our hearts by the Spirit the holy love of God.
Now we are fit for the assembly. No one is rightly in the assembly who is not filled with the glory. It is a wonderful service that the Lord is carrying on for us in filling us with the glory, fitting us for our place in the assembly, as having the love of God in our hearts by the Spirit. That is the effect of coming under the Lord's administration in the kingdom; the Spirit has gained a footing in our hearts -- a dwelling there; we are filled with the glory. As dwelling there, He ornaments the saints, but He works from the interior; He begins with the heart. We read in @Proverbs 23:26 "Son, give me thy heart". He takes possession of your heart, and He reads your heart, "He who searches the heart knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God". @Romans 8:27. What a wonderful sphere of operation is the heart of the Christian! Well, the kingdom produces that, and when your heart is secured, you are ripe for the assembly. The kingdom contributes to the house. I think that these holy gatherings --
{331}
holy convocations, they are called in Scripture, which are, thank God, becoming more and more general -- are intended to forward the house operations of the Spirit.
When I speak of the house service of the Spirit, I refer to what is general or universal, but the Holy Spirit operates also locally. Indeed, so pronounced was the local feature in the early days, that the apostle in referring to his journey to Jerusalem @Acts 20:23 says that "the Holy Spirit witnesses to me in *every* city that bonds and afflictions await me". But then He operates house-wise, generally. The Lord is looking for the reproduction of Himself: you must have all the saints for the reproduction of Christ: "So also is the Christ", @1 Corinthians 12:12: That means the saints put together, not in a local way but in a general way, an Ephesian way, Jews and Greeks merged in one whole. "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body ... and have been all made to drink into one Spirit", @1 Corinthians 12:13 that does not refer to the Corinthian company, but is really based on the truth of Ephesians which speaks of the whole assembly, and it is there that the Spirit of God operates house-wise for the reproduction of Christ.
So these gatherings which afford opportunities for saints to come together from various places, even from different continents, give evidence of the operations of the Spirit in the house. We have thus what corresponds to Troas (Acts 20), where the house of God comes into view as set up by Paul. There were certain brothers of note spoken of who accompanied him in his journey, the first mentioned is a Berean. He was a brother who would remind them of the importance of all Scripture; you must have the whole book, for "every scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable". @2 Timothy 3:16. A Berean is one who would have searched the Scriptures diligently.
{332}
Then there were two brothers from Derbe; they would add their quota of spiritual experience and observation. There were two from Thessalonica, lovely brothers they, for the Spirit of God wrote of them, "brethren, beloved of God". I do not know of a more distinguishing title than that, "brethren, beloved of God", and doubtless they were that as dwelling together in unity according to @Psalm 133:1, found in freshness and vigour as the result of the administration of the great apostle among them. That is what Thessalonica yielded, this assembly in God the Father, these brethren beloved of God. How delightfully they would contribute at this Conference! What interchange of thought there would be as they sat down with the other brethren thus gathered! Then, further, there were two from Asia, where the "word of the Lord had prevailed". There were none from Corinth specified, for the Spirit of God would name such as would contribute house-wisely and spiritually to the Ephesians. These two brothers from Asia would speak of that mighty work of God through the energy of the Spirit in the great apostle which brought down every feature of the world. If any young Christian present like Eutychus, had spoken of some novel he might have been reading, or of some other item of worldly interest, such men would have rebuked him; they would have told him of the books that had been burnt at Ephesus. Depend upon it that a fall like that of Eutychus had been preceded by a history of departure. There are books which eat into the soul like a canker. Young people are often undermined spiritually by what they read, but these brothers would tell of the mighty energy of the Spirit in the teaching of the apostle which had brought down all these things, undermining the world of books, so that they burnt them. Just as in the days of Joshua, the city of Kirjath-sepher, the city of books, had been destroyed.
{333}
So in these holy gatherings, you get house influences brought to bear, and the young are rescued.
These gatherings represent the work of God elsewhere; because we are all of one Spirit we are one body. In the power of the one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit. It does not say "ye all", but "*we* all", he is referring to the house. So there is liberty now in the Spirit for His gracious administration -- spiritual manifestations are unhindered. Whether it be in the Western hemisphere, or the Eastern, whether here or there, "all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will". @1 Corinthians 12:11. We are united in common feelings, sympathetic interests, so that we walk about Zion, we count the towers thereof, we consider her bulwarks; we are interested in all that God is doing wherever it is -- it is all God's work. Now it is for us to look into our hearts and see if we are in accord with that, because aside from these features we shall not reach the special family privileges which the Spirit is bringing about at this time.
Now to turn to @Romans 8:14. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God". Think of the dignity of being led by the Spirit of God. There are four things we are told which are "stately in going", @Proverbs 30:29 - 31, the lion, the horse, the he-goat, and a king. They represent what is spiritually stately and comely; they are entirely free from selfish personal pride, aims and objects. A lion does not turn aside for any, it says. The Spirit is here to maintain the testimony, to reprove the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgment. Peter was bold as a lion when he stood up and accused the Jews of the murder of Christ. He is not afraid as he says "the originator of life ye slew", @Acts 3:15, for he was indwelt by the Spirit of God, and led by Him he is bold as a lion.
{334}
Then there is a warhorse; it smells the battle from afar off. He discerns when the conflict is on; he is not afraid when he hears the thunder of the battle and the shouting. He enters the fray as led by the Spirit of God; he stands in the conflict for the truth.
Then the he-goat is one who refuses to come under human influences; he is one of the most interesting of these figures, for human influence is a most baneful thing in the house of God; you are useless to the Spirit of God for the moment. Aaron came under the influence of the people when he made the golden calf while Moses was on the mount with God, for you are either under human influence or spiritual influence. The he-goat holds himself for God, and led by the Spirit of God, you come into the midst of the people as Moses did, as a king against whom there is no rising up. A man who is for God cannot be turned down. Moses probably faced two million people when he came with the authority of God, and there was no turning him aside. All these things are involved for those who are led of the Spirit of God. We are not under "the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father". @Romans 8:15. The current religions of the day tend to bondage, to the re-establishment of what God has set aside as effete and worn out; many a heart is filled with slavish fear of God. But the apostle says here, "ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ... a spirit of adoption". It is not here *the* spirit of adoption, but "a spirit", that kind of spirit, a Spirit of adoption, and by that Spirit we cry, "Abba, Father". In Galatians it is the "Spirit of God's Son", it is definitely the Holy Spirit, but here the apostle would emphasise the kind of spirit we have received, whereby we cry, Abba, father. Here we come to our most intimate relationship, we cry, Abba, Father, by Him. I am speaking of God and to God in the most intimate
{335}
way as if He only were before me -- Father, Father. That is the result of the Spirit of adoption in my soul, God would bring us to this immediate, intimate relationship with Himself, so that He Himself, the Father, is supreme to my soul. When I say it twice, I am resting in it.
John brings in early in his gospel the thought of the Father; you will remember He says to the Samaritan woman in chapter 4, "the Father seeks such to worship him". @John 4:23. We have noticed that Samuel after having circuited all Israel, returned to his own house at Ramah, and there he built an altar, and there also he judged Israel. In connection with the judging in Samuel's house, I think we get the spiritual adjustment of the family. The Lord in that way would set brethren together happily and freely, so that there might be this free and direct approach as it is said, "By him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father". @Ephesians 2:18. He would bring us to that; it is the great end in view. He is the Spirit of adoption to bring about inward correspondence to God's Son, to bring about the affections of the inner chambers where we have direct access to God, and where we cry by the Spirit of adoption, "Abba Father"!

THE POWER OF GOD (1)
@2 Kings 2:1 - 14; @Romans 1:1 - 4; @Romans 4:19 - 25; @Romans 5:1 - 4; @Romans 15:18 - 21
J.T. The subject to be considered is *the power of God* as worked out in Romans, Colossians and Ephesians. I thought the subject could be worked out intelligently by seeing the power of God in Christ; then how it is transmitted to others as illustrated in the chapter in 2 Kings, corresponding with Romans. Elijah being a type of the Lord as the vessel of the divine power and Paul representing the exercise of it as here, corresponding to Elisha. Paul is taken up as "an elect vessel", as the Lord said: "to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel", @Acts 9:15. I thought it would help us to see how Elisha came in for the power that was there, the power he had the opportunity of witnessing in Elijah.
Does that agree with the Lord's words: "Greater works than these shall he do", @John 14:12?
It corresponds as indicating how the power seen in Christ was transmitted. The passage before us shows that Elijah was subject to the Lord; "The Lord hath sent me to Bethel", etc. Elisha clings to Elijah from point to point, reminding us how we are to come in for divine power. We learn subjection from Christ. I think Elijah represents Christ as anointed by the Spirit. Romans speaks of His power as the Son, referring back to creatorial power. God had given a witness of His power in creation; @Romans 1:20. "The exceeding greatness of his power" @Ephesians 1:19 goes beyond His creatorial power. "Eternal power" belongs to Romans and "the exceeding greatness of
{337}
his power" to Ephesians. Romans says He is "declared to be the Son of God with power". John 5 enlarges on this. @Romans 1:1 - 4 would cover the time of His ministry on earth. He sent word to the Baptist saying, "the dead are raised". @Matthew 11:5, @Luke 7:22. He was declared to be the Son of God by resurrection of the dead.
You see the transmission and the continuity of power in selected vessels. We must see the thing worked out in the Lord and then in sample men, so that we may observe how it works in all of us. The first meeting of Elisha with Elijah was marked by Elijah casting his mantle on him. That mantle represented what Elijah was in the exercise of his ministry. God would have nothing less than that. Here Elisha takes it up, but he uses the mantle in connection with "The God of Elijah", as *we* would say: "The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ". You must be in the Spirit and mind of Christ before the power that is in Christ can be exercised by you.
Elisha was engaged in that which is profitable -- ploughing. It is what is necessary if there is to be anything for God. It refers to what was going on in his soul. He was ploughing with the twelfth yoke, that would indicate that he was content to be the last. Undoubtedly God was working with him, as with Saul: "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks (or goads)", @Acts 9:14. Ploughing is foundation work.
The mantle would have reference to Elijah's personal circumstances; these were in keeping with his ministry. The mantle would represent the prophet's stature. It fell from Elijah. That is, it was to remain here like the "conversation" of those who have gone before us; @Hebrews 13:7. The man goes into heaven, but the mantle remains. There was a testimony in the mantle. The great point to recognise is those who have gone before. The
{338}
principle of a model is that on which God works. You must take account of those who have gone before. "Be imitators of me". @Philippians 3:17. It is a great principle with God to hand on the things through a model. It should not get smaller as it is handed on. It would be a humiliating thing to admit that the thing is reduced, or that one is not up to it.
In taking account of things in that way we are kept humble, for we have to admit how small we are as compared with the great vessels through whom the testimony has come; but the thing is to admit it and maintain the standard.
The mantle would not fit Elisha as well as Elijah. That is what Elisha admits, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" But he uses the mantle the same way that Elijah did. It was the power of God in both cases, but he admits it is Elijah's mantle.
The dropping of the mantle was a sort of challenge to Elisha.
When it fell from Elijah it would be the occasion of great exercise to Elisha, for it indicated a standard for his service. Each one of us has to discover the present standard. In the clerical system there is no taking up of the mantle, so to speak, that fell from the Lord Jesus; it is a human standard there, if indeed there is any.
The double portion and the mantle are not the same thing. The former is to enable us to conform with the latter -- "the power that worketh in us", @Ephesians 3:20. The after ministry of Elisha shows that he was formed by it. That corresponds with Joshua as the attendant of Moses. Nothing humbles us more than the moral stature of those who have gone before as compared with our own. The mantle would always be a witness of Elijah's ministry. I do not think it is ever the thought that one man should put on another man's mantle. You have it before you as a witness. You think of what God wrought in him, and you say,
{339}
I have not come to that. Timothy knew Paul's doctrine and manner of life.
Paul was little. His name implies that. Philadelphia had a *little* power. It was commendatory and yet humiliating, because at Pentecost it was not a little power but great power. "Greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father", @John 14:12 but they could not exceed what was displayed in Christ *morally*. His circumstances limited Him; @Luke 12:50. The diminished power with us would no doubt be directly due to the vessels of dishonour. There is, of course, the general state of the professing body. All this should humble us. Saul could not be a model to David, so David would not use Saul's armour. David sets out an idea and he never warred on the lines of Saul. When he met the lion he took him by the beard. David is like Elijah; he sets out an idea which is to be followed. David's men learned from him.
Paul was delivered from the people and the Gentiles to be an exclusive vessel of the testimony and the Lord in commending him says: "Behold, he prayeth". That is the way to acquire divine power. He *prayeth* -- he was still doing it.
There may be a space of time between the mantle being thrown and becoming a follower. The following would indicate that he understood the mind of Christ. The journey taken (@2 Kings 2:1 - 8) would indicate the mind of God as seen in Christ. It takes a good bit of exercise to become a follower. You may have got the call a good while before. Gilgal comes first and it suggests that one has to find out the utter worthlessness of the flesh. Elisha was in the company of a man who was spiritual. He would observe what intelligence Elijah had. Then, as at Bethel, he would see where God's presence was known. At Jericho you see how the stronghold of the enemy is brought down and then at Jordan how death is dispossessed.
{340}
When he exercised the transmitted power he began at Jericho, like Paul, then he went to Bethel. That is the evangelistic testimony comes first to bring in recruits. "The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof" would indicate the wonderful display of power available to support the testimony, and then he comes back from Jordan and begins at Jericho, which would correspond with the labours of Paul. "From Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ" @Romans 15:19 -- "Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God". That is how the testimony was brought into Europe. It was in a man who had learned the power of God.
The power of God in the resurrection of Christ shows that God is for man, like the battle of Elah; @1 Samuel 17:2. So the chariot of Israel; God is for Israel in spite of the governmental condition. Then there was the excess; even Naaman was blind.
Is there any difference between the journey of these men and the three days of Saul's experience at Damascus? The Lord spoke to him out of heaven and he is led by the hand into Damascus.
Yes; both instances were educational. Damascus was not just right. Ananias questions the Lord's order. The Lord said: "Behold, he prayeth". That should have been enough. He was not praying when he left Jerusalem. It is said of Elijah and Elisha that they two went together.
The sons of the prophets would represent nominal believers; what they profess to know the spiritual man knows much better. There were fifty of them at Jericho, the number is in keeping with the world. The king of Israel had sent fifty men to Elijah, and they were consumed. I think the sons of the prophets represent nominal Christians governed by worldly principles. They were not in accord with God's testimony. Elisha was, and he says: "Hold ye
{341}
your peace". Why be silent? They were interrupting. There is a lot of that. It enters sometimes into the house of God. It is important to learn to be silent. There is much interruption in the house of God. It was an immense moment for Elisha, how precious the time was! Do not break in upon that! Cling to the one who has the light, the others are not worth listening to. There is a lot of talking in Christendom, a great deal said about the coming of the Lord, but it does not spring from those who are in contact with the light. It may be information, but it is not the ministry of the Spirit.
The cry of the children, "Go up, thou bald head", suggests that followers of Christ would be in reproach in the world, The children are a sort of continuation of the sons of the prophets. The point is an attempt to set aside the truth for the moment; that is, the heavenly -- the truth of the ascension of Christ. Elijah had gone up. The sons of the prophets had brought in a false principle that would develop. It is developed in the children. They are called "little boys out of the city". They represent a *generation*, they are degenerate. The efforts of the "fifty strong men" would be to connect you with some valley and take your attention from heaven. "Nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee". If you apprehend the Lord as in the gospels, you want His Spirit. It is a great thing to value the Spirit. In John 4 you get the gift from the divine side, and in chapter 7 it is from the side of reception, "which they that believe on him should *receive*". Then the rivers flow out from their bellies. The Spirit is connected with the ascension, not the resurrection. It says: "Jesus was not yet glorified". @John 7:39. It brings in what is heavenly.
Paul says: "I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ", @Philippians 1:19. John 7 says:
{342}
"The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified". It is important to connect the Spirit with heaven, hence the emphasis laid by Elijah on the necessity for Elisha to see him go up. The power that was seen in Christ in ascension was in harmony with the Spirit of holiness which characterised His ministry on earth. The disciples as with the Lord on the mount of Olives and looking up after Him when He ascended, would be ready for the Spirit.
The ascension of Elijah is a type of the Lord's ascension. It says in @Luke 9:51: "when the days of his receiving up were fulfilled". Then later it says He "was carried up into heaven". Heaven valued that Man. In the Holy Spirit coming out there is no lapsing. There is no separation between the Lord and the Spirit. The Spirit links us up with Christ. Another thing comes out in connection with His power -- God is pleased to use vessels outwardly insignificant, like the little maid in Naaman's house and the lepers outside of Samaria. These vessels suggest how in our times God is pleased to use insignificant persons for the accomplishment of His work. The little maid was entirely free from national feeling which would naturally have possessed her. The spirit of the prophet was in her. There is no trace of resentment nor national feeling even though she was a captive and amongst those who had carried her captive. She is a remarkable type of the kind of vessel the Lord is pleased to use now. God indicates here that if you are to be blessed you must be in accord With the vessel through whom the light has come to you. Naaman was ultimately brought into accord with the little maid. If I receive light, I must be conformed to the vessel through whom it has come to me. Naaman was a very great man, God had even used him, but he retained his greatness. Though he wanted to be relieved of his leprosy, he had no thought of being relieved of his greatness. So
{343}
he sets out with every evidence of it. All his gold and raiment speak of human power, which is really leprosy. He did not go to the prophet but to the king because he was on human lines. God says, as it were, If you are to come into blessing, it must be through the recognition of the vessel through whom the light has come; so in the end his flesh is made like unto the flesh of a little child. He had come to that. What marks the woman of Shunem is that she provides for the vessel of the light and then the little maid comes in in the next chapter, representing the humility of the vessel through whom the gospel is preached. Titus contemplates a slave adorning the gospel. She was a slave but in God's account honourable. Naaman has to come to that. He goes to the king first, who, of course, was entirely on natural lines; but Elisha knew and said: "Let him come now to me". @2 Kings 5:8. He goes and stands before the door of the prophet, but Naaman does not see the prophet. It is now a question of *the word*. You have already had the light and the vessel through whom it came. It is not a question of seeing another vessel, but the *word of God* is to regulate me and it tells me what to do. He goes away in a rage but he has to come to it. His greatness has to go.
Elisha had said, "My father, My father!" That showed his respectful recognition of Elijah. It was as if God said to Naaman: You are not going to see another. Converts are to be like the vessel through whom the light comes to them. He says: I will give him the word. The little girl directed him to the prophet. In Luke 4 the incident is presented altogether from God's side. The rich man in Hades says: "Send Lazarus", but Abraham says: "They have Moses and the prophets". @Luke 16:19 - 31. You must accept God's testimony as rendered to you, or you will get nothing more.
God works on the principle of design. He has
{344}
something to work out in men. Naaman has to come to that. He *plunges* in and comes out after the seventh plunge like the flesh of a little child. He goes back to Syria in correspondence with the little girl. These chapters make the way for weak vessels to be used in the expression of the power of God;
What is the significance of the two mules¬ burden of earth?
He wanted to be right. He wants to worship God. You can understand how different Naaman would be. The greatest man, if converted, would sit down by the side of the poorest man on earth. He would recognise through whom the light came to him. The little maid is entirely free from the world and national spirit. She represents a divinely selected vessel.
As to going back to the house of Rimmon, Naaman had a right exercise so far. He desired to worship God. His burdens going and coming were very different. All that he took back was humble compared with what he brought. The numerals, *ten* talents of silver and *six* thousand pieces of gold, refer to human resources, but two mules¬ burden of earth represents what is in his soul. He humbly recognised what was becoming in a cleansed leper. The letter to the king of Israel was all on human lines as Christendom is. His first movements speak of man's measure and resources.
When Naaman came back, he came back as a little child. The two mules¬ burden of earth was an acknowledgement of what he was as in the flesh. In the law God had directed that an altar of earth should be made and sacrificed on by the people; @Exodus 20:24.
There is no record of what was said after Elijah and Elisha crossed the Jordan save what refers to Elisha's request. After they crossed the Jordan "They still went on and talked". There was communion. It is a Colossian scene.
{345}
THE POWER OF GOD (2)
@Colossians 1:11; @Colossians 2: 9 - 15; @Genesis 17:1 - 14; @Genesis 18:1 - 8
What we considered this morning had reference to God's power in grace. Elisha's ministry refers to that towards *men;* we would consider now how the power of God is available to us as before *God*. As we need to be sustained before men, so we need to be sustained before God; therefore, the connection of circumcision with the power of God has in view the position of the saints in God's presence. God says to Abram: "Walk before me" -- before My face; @Genesis 17:1. Chapter 18 shows that the door of privilege is open to those who have that light -- the knowledge of God in His almightiness and the disallowance of the flesh. This fits in with Colossians. Isaac was to be brought in on the line of God's power as this chapter shows. The prayer in @Colossians 1:9 - 13, covers the circle of the saints on earth. The evidence of power is "endurance and longsuffering with joy". It does not go so far as Ephesians -- "endurance" is that one can bear much; then "long suffering"-- not of a stoical kind. God looks for that in the circle. But in chapter 2 we have a position before God according to His operation, a position taken up in *faith*. For that the power of God in *quickening* is necessary. What God had in His mind in Colossians was as fruit of the gospel, to set up a circle marked by the vigour of life, as it appeared in Christ on earth -- the "new man renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him". @Colossians 3:10. There was to be practical correspondence with Christ in every relationship, as we see in Chapter 3 throughout. Then in speaking to God, there would be free intelligent outgoing to Him. Abraham in Genesis 18 is, so
{346}
to speak, a quickened man; chapter 17 is the light of the position. Three men came and found there the intelligence and energy of life, the recognition of what was due to God. The quickening is a positive, practical thing, I am made to live. Circumcision is positional -- that is in Colossians. In Philippians 3 it is position; the past is all gone; God is worshipped by the Spirit, and there is no confidence in the flesh. Abram's name was changed and this involved the power of God, for the new name implied that he was to be "a father of a multitude of nations". We get what is in the presence of God -- what is suitable. The scene in chapter 18 shows what God would delight in. It seems as if Jehovah coming as a Man in company with others, desired to bring out what was in Abraham and Sarah and the young man. One may take it as a type of any company. From Antioch onward the Spirit of God seems to enlarge on the different circles brought about by the apostle's ministry. The coming of the apostle to different localities (@Acts 20:21) brought into evidence what was of God in each. Here in Genesis 18 what God could participate in is available. What is suggested first of all, is that God brings about a condition in the circle that He would test out. In Judges 6 the angel of the Lord came and sat under an oak, that is, he took up a position where he could take a survey of what there was. Gideon was threshing wheat to keep it from the Midianites. It reminds us of what marks divine visitations. Visitations are not only made in chastisement. We read "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten", @Revelation 3:19 but divine Persons also come as knowing what is in a locality, so that it might show itself. Here, in Genesis 18, the coming is to affect a scene, a festive occasion with sufficient persons to fill it out. Two were angels, but all are introduced as "three men". Abraham said Lord to One of them -- "standing near him". It was to
{347}
introduce the conditions for festivity. Abraham discerned the Lord. He was not putting himself forward. "*They* said" -- the company is kept in evidence. The next verse shows what was there. There are right instincts as to what was suitable for Him. We get the contrast to all that in Simon's house; @Luke 7:36 - 50. The Lord looks for what is suitable and what He takes pleasure in. It is a Colossian scene. Abraham is just a type. This is a scene designed by heaven. We have three men coming and the coming brings out what was there. If you take up Colossians (the Old Testament is intended to illustrate and bring out detail) it says in @Colossians 1:12,13, "Giving thanks, etc. ... translated into the kingdom of the Son of his love". We are taught what is suitable. Who can teach what is suitable to the Father save the Son? The Son of the Father's love becomes the Teacher of the saints. Proverbs is the teaching of the son of the father's love. He knew his father from his infancy; he was qualified for the position over all the sons. God said to David, as it were, He is your son, but I am going to take him to be My son. Proverbs is written to train the saints so that they might know what is becoming to God. In chapter 30 the writer says he had no knowledge; he got it by acknowledging that.
In Colossians Paul teaches the saints how to be before God. Proverbs 30 is the secret of the book. The great product of Proverbs is a wise son. The "rod of correction" would come in in the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love. "Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him", @Proverbs 22:15.
"The tenor of his way" (@Proverbs 22:6), refers to the true light which already shines. The child begins in that light, and being trained up in it, will not depart from it in later years. You reckon on the work of God. That is the light which should
{348}
govern us in baptism. It is "the entry", the entry is according to faith, you have God. Moses¬ mother brought him in in connection with light. He was hid three months of his parents. He got his start there. He was forty years in Pharaoh's house. No doubt he rode on horses of Egypt like others, but the rod of discipline, forty years in the wilderness, put human pride far from him. I refer to all that because it shows how young Christians are to be brought up. The son speaks to us in Proverbs, he insists on what is good for us all the way through. Solomon is the most extraordinary babe in Scripture outside of the Lord. The house of the believer is contributory to the house of God. Solomon is the great contribution of David. God says: I will take him to be My son. He says this even in a house where disaster had come. The greatest thing for children is an example. Abraham means "father of a great multitude". He was a true father. He conveys the parental thought. The parental thought is one of the greatest truths in Scripture. "Riches are the inheritance of fathers" @Proverbs 19:14 -- the thought is that you pass on something, you do not leave your children in poverty --spiritually.
The Proverbs has sons in view. Am I a wise son? That is what you have before you for yourself and for your children. All your ministry has in view to make sons to make the heart of God glad: "A wise son maketh a glad father". @Proverbs 10:1, @Proverbs 15:20. That is what Colossians is aiming at. As we come on in Colossians we see the aim is to bring us into correspondence with Christ -- the circumcision of Christ, His baptism and quickened with Him. Solomon knew, I suppose, in a thousand ways what pleasure he was to David and Bathsheba. Jehovah had signified His own pleasure in him, so he could speak with authority. It is a voice to all Christians as wise sons to be like him. Colossians is to bring us, Gentiles, into correspondence with Him as a company on earth. Ephesians is the
{349}
full thought of God; we are set together in Christ *in heaven*.
In Colossians it is the energy and freshness of life. What an immense thing for God to have these circles throughout the Gentile world! Paul carried on a sacrificial service that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. Colossians 2 corresponds with Genesis 18; Abraham knows what to do. God says, as it were, I want to have a festive scene, and I want to have it with Abraham! He brought His company with Him. You have to be in power before God, that is the setting of this passage; Genesis 17. Then you have the covenant of circumcision -- a permanent testimony that there is no power for that in the flesh. There should be nothing between the Head and the saints. There is plenty of resource as you draw upon Christ. "In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". "Bodily" means brought within our range. The Lord said, "Have ye anything *here* to eat?" @Luke 24:41. What have you got as your own, produced by the Spirit; that is what the Lord looks for. He came to Abraham, it was to bring out what was there. The Lord would not take us by surprise, love looks for Him, expects Him. He would not come to put us at any disadvantage. He knows sons, knows what they have got. They have learned to draw upon His resources. "Bodily" refers to what is available. "They gave him part of a broiled fish"; that was what was available for the Lord, "and of a honeycomb". The honeycomb would set forth mutual affection among the saints, which the Lord delights in.
@Colossians 2:10: "filled full in him". It is an abstract statement. It is there potentially but has to be worked out. The wise son is a Colossian. That is what the epistle is aiming at. The "fish" (@Luke 24:42) refers to what faith brings in, the resources of God. The "honeycomb" is what each one contributes.
{350}
these things that Abraham provides doubtless have a meaning severally. A "morsel of bread", "three measures of wheaten flour" and a "calf" -- all features of Christ. The wheaten flour is His humanity. The calf would refer to His having come to die, He has died. The milk, the food which the Lord Himself partook of as we know; it is constitutional. He partook of His wine and His milk; @Song of Songs 5:1. God looks for freshness -- "a calf *tender* and good", all fresh. Jehovah was thus entertained by one who had the light of His power, and who was to walk before His face. As to his circumstances, Abraham was governed by the light vouchsafed to him.
We can only take up the Old Testament as illustrative. We get freshness in Colossians; the *new* man suggests this. The little maid in Jairus¬ house as raised, corresponds, she was youthful. She is raised from the dead and everyone is put out except the father and mother and Peter, James, and John and the raised child -- seven in all. The scene suggests the freshness of life which is to be sustained. "He ... commanded that something should be given her to eat". @Luke 8:55. That life is to be sustained. That is aimed at in Colossians; God is looking for freshness and vigour among the saints.
{351}
THE POWER OF GOD (3)
@Ephesians 1:15 - 22; @Ephesians 2:10; @Ephesians 3:13 - 21
We have dwelt on the power of God as exercised in grace in the kingdom, which has to do with man's need, and then as needed if we are to be before God according to His mind, as in Colossians. It is on that side there but in Ephesians it is presented from the side of the divine mind; the power of God is seen as exercised in bringing about His *entire* purpose in the heavens and on the earth. One desires that we might see the vastness of it and there is the need of prayerfulness in approaching the subject, especially on account of its greatness. It exceeds the power exercised in bringing about the physical universe. We do not know that there was any opposition to God in the creation of the physical universe, indeed one would conclude that there was not, but in bringing about the spiritual universe there is opposition from the outset. But it brought out the more what God is and the power exercised especially in the resurrection of Christ. There can be no doubt that Satan had wrought in the creation before the work of the six days recorded in Genesis 1. It does not appear that this extended to the heavens. @Genesis 1:2 speaks of the *earth* being without form and void and darkness on the face of the deep. There is nothing said as to the heavens in that verse. A change had evidently come over the earth, for we read, "He created it not in vain (or void); he formed it to be inhabited", @Isaiah 45:18. In that way we see that the work of God in the six days was necessitated by the effect of evil having entered into God's primary creation.
There is nothing said about *creating* in Genesis 1 after verse 1 till the fifth day. God was using what
{352}
was there. He changed it into a different form. What was there was available. The dry land was made to appear; it had been submerged. Then He said, "Let the earth bring forth grass", etc. @Genesis 1:11. So the "great lights" in heaven; they were all adapted to the new order of things. We get the word 'created', in connection with the living creatures. Then the Spirit emphasises the fact that man is not a development of what was there, man was *created* on the sixth day. God doubtless anticipated the modern opposition in what is called evolution, so the testimony is that man was created, he was created in the image of God. The word is employed six times in connection with man; @Genesis 1:27; @Genesis 5:1,2. From verse 2 to verse 9 all was "commanded" or "made", not, 'created'. I think it is well to notice that. It shows the wisdom of God in the Scriptures, foreseeing later efforts of Satan. "God himself that formed the earth and *made* it", @Isaiah 45:18. We have to distinguish between the material that already existed, which God could and did use and *additional* creations.
After the first creation darkness ensued. You could not Conceive of God creating it thus. "The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters". @Genesis 1:2. God had a moral system of things before Him and the Holy Spirit was waiting to bring it about. The Spirit of God in Genesis 1 occupies us with what is before men every day so that we might know the history of the things that appear. The "worlds" in @Hebrews 11:3 are the whole universe. We get three words: 'created', 'made' and 'formed'. Romans and Corinthians treat of the testimony in connection with the previous ways of God; in Colossians and Ephesians we have new creation, *wholly new*. In the other epistles believers are taken account of generally as being in the state of responsibility in the world. The question of good and evil had to be settled. This took place on the cross and now God
{353}
is free to bring in a wholly new order of things. This epistle deals with the greatness of God's power brought into activity in the resurrection of Christ. The whole force of evil was entrenched from ancient times. The old serpent brought into activity all his power when the Lord was to be put to death.
The Ephesians had faith, and love for all the saints, and on this ground the apostle gave thanks for them and prayed for them; @Ephesians 1:16. When you come to the fifth and sixth days in Genesis 1 you have life capable of affections -- living souls. A plant has no affections; still it has life. But it is in the life of Christ and in the Spirit we have affections. The Ephesian saints were marked by affection (compare @Acts 20:37,38) and hence the great light vouchsafed to them.
Adam was a figure of Him that was to come. God intended to work every thing out in a Man. All the different creatures mate, then go together. There is a remarkable link between the fishes and the birds; it is on the principle of an egg through which generation takes place; they were created at the same time. The land creatures and man are linked together. Solomon had something to say about all the living creatures (@1 Kings 4:33) and about man, of course. No doubt what he said would convey the mind of God. The lower creatures were all put under man. Adam had wonderful intelligence, he would, no doubt, give them names according to their movements. Man is spoken of as a "living soul". You have in him as regenerated, affection according to God by the Spirit, affection that abides -- "Love in the Spirit". @Colossians 1:8. "Soul" in the lower creatures has reference to the affections which they have. Man has a link with the lower creation, but see what a different breath he breathes! "The Lord God ... breathed into his nostrils the breath of life", @Genesis 2:7. The lower creatures do not have spirits in this sense.
{354}
We receive our spirit from *God*, not from our parents. "The spirit of a man is the candle of the Lord". It is the link with God that every man has. God has left that door open to touch man. Man has got a spirit, it is the highest part of his being. God is called the "Father of spirits". @Hebrews 12:9.
In Genesis 2 there is no emphasis laid on power when God made Adam to live, but in Christ's resurrection we get the *exceeding greatness* of His power and it is "to usward who believe". All the power of evil is against that. We have before us in the opening of Ephesians the power by which God has brought about a spiritual universe. You have "the exceeding greatness of his power", @Ephesians 1:17 - 20. We have to know that. It is not simply ordinary power but the same that wrought in Christ. In chapter 3 we are to be strengthened with might in the inner man by the Father's Spirit. The first thought in the apostle's prayer is "The spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him"; the knowledge of God, that saints should know it. A greater power now operates in believers than what operated in creation. The great display of power is in the spiritual universe; this power operates in us; it is "the power that worketh in us". Ephesians is the least understood of all Scripture.
In Acts 19 the Spirit of God tells us that Apollos was at Corinth. Corinthians gives the order of God in the assembly now. But while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul comes to Ephesus and asks the disciples he finds there: "Have ye received the Holy Spirit since ye believed?" @Acts 19:2. The known possession of the Spirit is essential to what he is going to bring about now. We cannot build an Ephesian structure in connection with those who have not the Spirit. So they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus, twelve men at one time. Paul remained a long time at Ephesus. Then we get the seven sons of Sceva --
{355}
the complete power of evil brought in against the testimony. What was arrayed against Christ is the same still. We are now in the presence of the accomplishment of the purpose of God, looking into eternity. You must have the power of God for that. These seven men were ignominiously ejected, there was overwhelming power there in defence of the truth. Paul says: "If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus". @1 Corinthians 15:32. There seems to have been a combination of religious and commercial evil and then literary power -- books. The world was there in all its features. Satan has power specially as man's lusts are appealed to. As the Ephesians had seen power in Paul's ministry, they were to *have* it in a spiritual way. We may see the evidence of power, but that is not enough. We are to *have* the power; hence the prayer here and in chapter 3. The inscription on the cross was written in Hebrew and Greek and Latin -- the world was there, the world committed itself. There was no drawing away from it, the thing being written up. The world is committed to the death of Christ, the whole world. That is how the thing stands as we sit down to partake of the Lord's supper. We "show the death of the Lord". @1 Corinthians 11:26.
The thing now is that we might be spiritual; to get from God "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him". Whatever arises, you are able to meet it. A man then is furnished to meet all emergencies, in the way of having power to locate things. "Wisdom is better than weapons of war" @Ecclesiastes 9:18.
In Ephesians 1 the power is "*towards* us", in chapter 3 it is the power -- "the power that worketh *in* us". In chapter 1 it is to know objectively through the eyes of the heart being enlightened; it is to be apprehended as it wrought in Christ. This power continues on in the dispensation. In chapter 3 it
{356}
works in the "inner man", enabling us to enter into our privileges.
<blockquote>"And see! the Spirit's power<br>Has ope'd the heavenly door". (`74:5)</blockquote>
One is able to arise to take one's place on high; that is the thought of *sitting*. The power of God is still operative in the saints.
The passing through Jordan was a great fact and the falling down of the walls of Jericho and God hearkening to the voice of a man, in the sun and moon standing still, but God is not slackening His hand in a spiritual way, we have a greater thing today: souls being operated on and in, made to sit down in heavenly places in Christ. Taking Christ out of death and the saints out of it is one act; it really lasts through the whole dispensation; that is, the power that wrought in Christ continues in the quickening and raising to heaven of the assembly. We were dead in trespasses and sins, but God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love wherewith He loved us, quickened us with Christ, and has raised up together and made us sit down together in heavenly places in Christ. The book of Joshua helps as enlarging on all this; the same power proceeds till every enemy is dislodged. The raising in Ephesians 2 is not raised from the dead exactly, but rather elevated. The word 'together' is used. Love for one another would have it so -- we are raised up *together* and made to sit down *together* in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. All is effected by the exceeding greatness of the power of God. God took Christ and the assembly out of death at one stroke. As remarked, it extends as to us over the whole dispensation; this wonderful power continues to operate.
This prayer of the apostle's contemplates three things: the hope of His calling, the riches of the glory of His inheritance and the exceeding greatness of His power. It is all *His;* it looks at things from
{357}
the divine standpoint, hence the immense outlook in Ephesians. The inheritance is the saints here, what God has in *them*. What an immense thing it is that we are in the sphere and time of this wonderful operation and that we are the subjects of it! That is what affects one so much. We are living in the period in which, so to speak, Eve is being formed, that is, Adam was put to sleep and God builded the woman out of his rib. In regard to Israel and the world Christ is asleep at the present time, and the assembly is being builded. The light of Ephesians 1 and 2 enables us to take our place in the assembly. We see that by the Spirit's power we may enter into heavenly places.
All the types of the assembly have reference to the testimony of God here except Eve, she is *for Adam*. Rebekah represents a provisional state of things. Asenath is the assembly as Christ's companion as among the Gentiles, and Moses¬ wife refers to the *whole* testimony of God. Psalm 90 is the whole range of divine testimony. Moses represents Christ in relation to the whole testimony. Abigail is in connection with conflict. She became wife to him who was fighting the battles of the Lord. Eve represents the *primary* thought of God. The Lord's supper is connected with the whole testimony of God, but it affords an outlet from the sphere of responsibility. We take the Lord's supper as disciples, as those publicly identified with the Lord in His rejection; but the light of Ephesians leads us further. Matthew and Mark alone record that they sang a hymn after the Lord's supper was instituted. They have to do with dispensational things. Luke and John have to do more with heaven. The singing of a hymn indicates an outlet from what is dispensational into what is heavenly; "they went to the mount of Olives". @Mark 14:26.
"Upon whom the ends of the ages are come" @1 Corinthians 10:11;
{358}
the ends of the dispensation all come on to us. This is a serious fact, and it enters into our position as at the Lord's supper. We are connected with the whole testimony of God. But there is an outlet in the hymn, it is a link with heaven. We pass out for the time from dispensational things into what we get in Ephesians. It is a great thing to apprehend that the Lord goes out at the top, to speak reverently, in the sense of what He finds. "My wine and my milk". @Song of Songs 5:1. It is all His; what the saints have and provide is all His and He values it. *We* should go out in what *He* brings in. We are thus added to; that is how *increase* comes. A word of ministry given is as from the Head; it is on the line of contribution. He causes those that know Him to inherit substance. A word thus given is right so long as it edifies; it should add to the brethren.
Ephesians 2 indicates our *position*, chapter 3 *enables us to take it*. In verse 14 the prayer is to the Father; we are in His presence now. "Of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named". We are now to be strengthened by His Spirit so that we may be able to apprehend, etc. (verse 18); it is not simply light as in chapter 1, but as *power in the soul*. Ephesians looks into eternity. You cannot take it in but you can take in something of the love of Christ. What is there is the love of Christ. It is beyond your compass, but you are to *know* it. If you did not have the love of Christ as a known centre, so to speak, you would be lost in eternity; no finite being can compass it; but I know the love of Christ and I rest *there*. It looks into eternity here. The chapter closes in a doxology, the apostle's heart being moved thus by the thought of what God has in the assembly. Christ is to be in our hearts by faith, so that as "rooted and founded in love", we are fully able to apprehend the breadth and length and depth and height. You are thus gradually brought into
{359}
eternity, Christ is dwelling in the heart by faith and we know His love and are filled unto all the fulness of God. Love is the life of heaven, the life of God. There are *four* dimensions given, thus what is outside the range of the natural mind and natural things. "Rooted and founded" one is fixed. "His roots are like Lebanon", roots that stand the test; there is the thought of stability. As *rooted* in love I am nourished in it, as *founded* I am stabilised. We stand up in love. One stands up as nourished in these roots. The believer is taken out of a world of hatred through the power of God; he apprehends God who is love. It is what I understand to be eternal; although finite, one is not lost in infinitude, because he knows the love of Christ and is *filled* unto all the fulness of God. You have to do with what exists all around, but you apprehend, as rooted and founded in love, what God has in His mind. It is God Himself in relation to the whole purpose of His love. "Filled even to all the fulness of God" is a marvellous thought; all else is necessarily shut out. Then we get the doxology, the outburst of a heart moved by all these things. A note of praise of this kind is very rare among the people of God.
The four dimensions refer to what came out in Christ. The depth is the descent of love. It is all a question of love in eternity, intelligent affection. Love is the life of eternity.
It was one thing for the Lord to come down, but another thing for Him to descend into the lower parts of the earth -- the heart of the earth, It is a moral thought, love went to that point.
What we have here is not objective, you are *In* the thing. You take into account that love is the life of God; all these measurements have reference to love as expressed in Christ. Here the apostle *bows his knees;* in chapter 1 he says "making mention of you in my prayers". Here his exercise seems
{360}
deeper -- that the saints should be able to enter into these great things of God. He could do no more than pray; he knew the Father alone could give them the power needed.
One greatly desires that we all should get some thought of eternity; the Father can bring us to it. The power is available in the Spirit of the Father to bring us into all this. "According to the power which *works in us"* @2 Corinthians 13:10. There will never be any greater display of power than what is active in the assembly *now;* the power that worketh here *in* us.
{361}
THE POWER OF GOD (4)
@Ephesians 4:7 - 16; @Ephesians 6:10 - 24
From the beginning of this chapter it appears that the apostle treats of what comes under the *Lord*, to develop the side of administration. Chapter 3 is parenthetical, it brings out the apostle's own part in this great scheme of God, and then his prayer that the saints might enter into it. His prayer is in connection with the great scheme of chapter 3. He brings us to eternity, to the final end, and that God would do "exceeding abundantly, above all that we ask or think". @Ephesians 3:20. But in chapter 4, he returns to the thought of the Lord, for he was the "prisoner of the Lord". @Ephesians 4:1. The "prisoner of *Christ"* @Philemon 1:1 refers to the whole scheme of God, what He is accomplishing through Christ, looking into eternity; but "the prisoner of the *Lord"* has more to do with administration in time, hence the gifts. They are a special provision to aid in time the ministry so that the body of Christ should be edified. He introduces the subject of gift and brings all the saints into it, "unto everyone of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ", before going on to speak of special gifts, which would involve specific power exercised by individuals,
In Psalm 68 they are "for the rebellious also, that the Lord might dwell among them". It is the thought of subjection, to bring down high thoughts. The fact that they come down from an ascended Christ renders them superior to all that is adverse here.
Are they given by the Head and administered by the Lord?
In the exercise of them here we are subject to the Lord. Paul began with the question, "What shall I do, Lord?" @Acts 22:10.
{362}
One who has received grace may develop from that into a specific gift, like Philip; he was a deacon first, then an evangelist. The Lord has given the gifts to the assembly in love, they come from the Head as an endowment. The Spirit brought all the gifts. Paul's gift does not remain, the effect remains. Your gift is not the same as another's; you could not disassociate the gift from the person who has it. The Spirit brought them all here. The person who has a gift is sometimes designated as the gift itself. "He gave some apostles", etc., that is, the persons. They come from Christ as an endowment for the assembly so that she should be edified. Those who have them come under the Lord in their service. In @1 Corinthians 12:28,29 they are subjects of desire, but they come from the Head. In desiring a gift you are not thinking of prominence, although it will give you that. You see the need for the gift among the saints and so you desire it in order to serve them effectually.
Is it different from the work of God in a man?
It is. You take these gifts here, they are not "sign-gifts", but normal gifts, the Head has given them as ascended. Positive ministry for edification is in view here -- not miraculous power. You could not think of these as unconverted persons. In @1 Corinthians 13:2, we read of one who may be "nothing". If a man is nothing, there is no formation of God at all. In these gifts there is not only the expression of Christ in the way of intelligence and love, but there is power attached to it. The gifts came with the Spirit, He brought them down. In 1 Corinthians 12 prominence is given to the Spirit in the distribution of the gifts. The Lord made all provision for the assembly at the outset, it is all here. The endowment is bountiful, enough to carry us through to the end. As one who has a gift departs to be with Christ the Spirit takes up another, but the gift is not the same; each has his Own distinctiveness. It all lies in the
{363}
Spirit. The gift is always in keeping with the vessel who has it. The vessels are fitted for the gifts; there is much evidence of this in Scripture.
There was not the same power after Moses left; this was not because God was not still with Israel, but because of the character of the vessel. On the other hand, when the power Moses had was distributed to the seventy, it was not increased. The power was the same; but this would not be true if Moses was removed, for his presence affected the power exercised. To use a figure we have to consider not only the strength of the powder, but also the calibre of the gun. In regard to the power given to the seventy it was as if God said, I have given enough, if seventy others are brought in, they simply exercise what you have. But Moses was not to continue, nor were the apostles. Therefore there was a diminution of power in the removal of Moses; there was no one like him. If the vessel is removed, that medium of power is removed. You cannot expect the same power as was seen in the apostles, but there will be enough. The excess of power was needed to introduce and inaugurate the testimony, that is not needed now. But all is according to divine wisdom; Joshua was fitted for the work given him to do as Moses was for his. It is of importance to recognise that the vessels are divinely fitted for their work and they are not interchangeable. Each has his own work and, normally, another cannot do it as he can, so that the order of the gifts was in wisdom. "He gave some, apostles, some, prophets", etc. In every stage of the church's history, there is a sufficient supply. The apostles were necessary to inaugurate, they were the direct successors of the Lord, none could take their place. They represented the rights of the Lord; they had such power as to command and enforce subjection. Paul had the power by him; he speaks of having in readiness, it was there. No one can
{364}
speak in this way now; of course the Holy Spirit remains, but the vessels available are not as those used at the beginning. Here in Ephesians 4 the gifts include the persons. The apostles¬ writings stand, but the power they wielded is another matter. A gift is never said to be given to a local company. That is a point of importance for all who seek to serve the Lord; it is given to the assembly. Elders were for the city, it was an office, but a gift is for the whole assembly.
The apostles were to tarry in Jerusalem until they were endued with power from on high. The Lord said, so to speak, You are to be My representatives, and so you need power from on high.
When the Lord took up Paul, you have the idea of a *vessel;* @Acts 9:15. You do not get that term in the choice of others; he was entirely at His disposal -- a vessel in the Lord's hands for His pleasure. As Paul was brought in, Peter seems to have understood something of the new energy and activity that were about to mark the work of the Lord; we read that he "passed throughout all quarters" @Acts 9:32 and coming down to Lydda, he finds Aeneas and says to him: "Rise up and make thy couch for thyself". @Acts 9:34. With the others he had remained at Jerusalem, but now he seems to anticipate what God was about to do by this wonderful vessel He had taken up. The most extraordinary energy shows itself in Paul. He speaks of having "fully preached the gospel of Christ", "from Jerusalem and in a circuit round to Illyricum". @Romans 15:19. Peter also seems to anticipate the sufficiency there would be in each company formed from among the Gentiles. Aeneas had to learn that in making his bed for himself; then as to Tabitha, Peter delivered her to the widows, *alive*. These two persons represent the local companies of Christians throughout the world. So that it appears Peter's apostleship was now taking universal form. The rails were laid, as
{365}
it were, for a train from Rome to Jerusalem! Peter anticipates what God was about to do universally. The Thessalonians imitated the assemblies of God in Judaea. Thus the unifying work of God was seen in a corresponding way among the Gentiles. "She that is elected with you in Babylon salutes you" (@1 Peter 5:13), illustrates the binding affection that existed between the east and west. There was a great extension of activity for the apostle had gone to Babylon. I suppose "She that is elected" refers to an assembly. The east is linked up by Peter with what is going on in the west. The reference would be to something for God in Babylon. She was *elected* with those of the dispersion in Asia Minor. It is a great point to see what God is doing and to be in line with that. In his epistles, Peter links up Babylon with the strangers of the dispersion in the west. He further says, "even as our beloved brother Paul also", @2 Peter 3:15 he thus links up the whole work of God in terms of affection. While presenting the government of God, Peter unifies the saints. Unity indeed is the great trend of any ministry that is of God. I think it is very beautiful to see how Peter speaks of Paul: "As they do also the *other Scriptures"*. @2 Peter 3:16. He treats Paul's epistles as scriptures; that was important for Jewish believers. It was a great thing that Peter had come to that. In Acts 10 he saw a sheet let down; this prepared him for Paul's ministry.
What is the service of an apostle?
To bring in and establish the authority of the Lord in the souls of the saints. We get in Acts 2 the apostles¬ doctrine, fellowship, breaking of bread and prayers. Those who were converted continued in those things. This involved a new system of things, which for faith took the place of what Moses had set up. The prophesying was subject to desire. From the setting up of the system, the need for bringing in *the mind of God* would be always
{366}
apparent; a prophet does that. A moral state is necessary for the exercise of gift; the vessel should be in keeping with what he is ministering. Gifts are sovereign and yet they are subject to desire.
After you have authority in the apostle and the mind of God in the prophet, the evangelist brings in the children, so to speak. The evangelist is seen in Philip. We get the suggestion of discernment in his four daughters. They would maintain what is according to God. Philip evangelised Samaria, but he did not detect Simon Magus, but Peter and John did. It shows how we are exposed to extraneous matter being brought in which would be hurtful to us.
After persons are gathered, the next thing is to *keep them together;* a pastor would be concerned about that. The evangelist is a bearer of good tidings, having love for souls; the pastor and teacher knows what souls need by contact with them. This involves house-to-house work, you see saints every day in the week. This service is, alas, very little known. Pastor and teacher is one gift. A pastor, or shepherd, would gather and seek to keep the saints together; then, in teaching, he would adjust them by the truth. One great feature of teaching is adjustment; it refers to the mind. A man may have more than one gift, but it is well for a man to know that in which he is most effective. You may have to do that for which you have no gift. There is a great deal of dormant ability among the people of God. Many are too local, they do not accept general obligations. Paul accepted his indebtedness to the Greeks and to the Barbarians; he accepted obligation to all mankind. One is obligated according to what he has received from the Lord. "Say to Archippus: Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the *Lord* that thou fulfil it". @Colossians 4:17.
How do you get confirmation as to gift?
{367}
You find out how you are effective, the Lord supports you. Many have not got the sense of obligation. The Lord says: I have given you something and I require it of you. We have to say to the Lord: it has cost *Him* much. A sense of obligation makes you very sober. You should not proceed unless you are effective. The Lord gives you to know that and He supports you. Ahimaaz would go, but he had nothing definite to tell; see @2 Samuel 18:20. A man should have the sense in his soul that the Lord has sent him, then he is effective.
In working it out now, is there not a responsibility resting on the saints to recognise gift?
There is. During recent years it has come to be held that brethren *should* work with their hands, but this cannot be set down as a divine principle; of course every brother should seek to *have to give*, but one principle cannot militate against another. "They which preach the gospel should live of the gospel". @1 Corinthians 9:14. Let not the saints assume that a man should always work with his hands, if they do they close their eyes to scriptural principle. He that ministers the word effectively is entitled to the means of support; @Galatians 6:6 shows that it is his due. The time may come when the general needs of the saints are so great that more free labourers may be needed, I believe it *has come*. We should watch the effectiveness of brothers who minister. The saints ought to have ability to discern as to it. Philip's four daughters would be able to discern. Those who labour are necessarily subject to the commendation of the assembly. The saints, if you give them time, arrive at the mind of God. "Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest". @John 4:35. The Lord said that to the disciples after they had been to buy bread and a woman of no reputation was going to do the work. "Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest", @Luke 10:2.
{368}
etc., was said to those already in the field. It is a great thing to have a sense of obligation to the Lord, to the saints and to all to exercise my ability. A brother has found out he is effective in a certain line and he sees the need of it, the next thing is to be sure that he has the commendation of the brethren.
We get the end to be reached in @Ephesians 4:16. There should be no dwarfs, all should be developed after Christ. The gifts aid to this end, as it says here. He presents Christ and believers are formed and grow accordingly. It is: "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man". There is to be no disparity between Christ and the assembly. Your exercise or mine is to be sure to present Christ not only in word, but in yourself. How are the saints to arrive at it unless they get the presentation of it? -- Christ presented objectively.
All *together* is what Ephesians has in view, so the apostle goes on to show the importance of it. "But holding the truth in love, we may grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ", etc. (verse 15, 16). The saints arrive at a point where there is self-edification in love -- an automatic condition, the saints move on themselves.
Could we have a little as to the armour in chapter 6?
The more you are full-grown, the better the armour fits you, but young believers, as well as old ones, should have it. We are now on the line of warfare -- "For the rest, brethren" (verse 10), this is the last word. You are on the ground of Joshua 5. Joshua was outside of Jericho and the Lord appears with a drawn sword. Joshua asks: "Art thou for us or for our adversaries? And He said, Nay; but as Captain of the host of the Lord am I now come". @Joshua 5:13,14. From that point onward you get the power of God exercised in warfare.
This is the location of the enemy. If the position
{369}
of the opposing general is known by a commander he has a great advantage; here we are told that the enemy is in heavenly places. What a disadvantage the Syrians were at because the man of God knew of their movements! It is not a question of power only, but also of wisdom. We know where the headquarters are. It saves you from being resentful. You are *standing* here, not taking possession. You are to hold the position and not to leave out any part of the armour. It is defensive. Then there is "the sword of the Spirit". You may use it in an offensive way. You think of the general interests of the Lord, not merely of those in your own locality.
We read of the tower of David builded for an armoury; the bride's neck was like this (@Song of Songs 4: 4). David took Goliath's head to *Jerusalem;* David knew the armour in which the adversary would trust. That is a great thing. He took his head to Jerusalem, he led captivity captive. He had Goliath's armour there to look at at any time. Taking his head to Jerusalem was a token that he was going to reign there.
It is well to notice that the loins are to be girt about with truth. The loins are the lower affections by which we get into touch with what is defiling. Truth maintains you in vigour and holiness. "He that doeth truth cometh to the light". @John 3:21.
Where do we come into contact with these principalities and powers?
In the 'troops', so to speak, immediately before you; they are men. The thing is to get behind them and see Satan's design. This chapter exposes his whereabouts. "The universal lords of this darkness". This is not a local matter. We are in the front of the whole power of evil; how needful to see that we have the whole armour of God! The Lord is, so to say, the great General on our side. Take the figure of a war; the general has a universal
{370}
place and commands all. Christ is "Captain of Jehovah's host", whereas Satan controls the forces of darkness. Thus we may see the seriousness of our position. Satan is specially against the truth of Christ and the assembly. The Lord spoke of Satan falling as lightning from heaven, and in the same chapter (Luke 10) spoke of the names of the saints written there. We are to occupy his place there. Satan would obliterate every trait of Christ here, hence the importance of the armour, so that the position of Christ and the assembly is maintained in testimony here. A great principle in conflict, as someone said, is 'after him'. You begin with a model; David was the leader and all came into line. If one has not a good conscience he is exposed and Satan will take advantage of it. So we are to have the loins girt about with truth and have on the breastplate of righteousness. In the world to come the saints will occupy the place of rule. Now there is a vessel formed in divine light and power here and Satan will attack that to the very end. The Lord said of the assembly, "Hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it". @Matthew 16:18. What a word! The truth stands, and the assembly will remain intact and will come out as in Revelation.
{371}
DIVINE VISITATIONS
@Acts 13:1 - 3; @Acts 21:1 - 11
The companies of believers seen in these scriptures would afford conditions for divine visitations; in a certain sense the apostle, as coming to these localities, would be representative of the Lord.
Some of us have been looking at Luke. In chapter 9 the time of His "receiving up" was drawing near and He sent messengers to certain cities of the Samaritans and they refused Him. Then in chapter 10 He sent out seventy, two by two, "into every city and place whither he himself would come". @Luke 10:1. He came to Bethany as an example, He was received there. "A certain woman named Martha, received him into her house". @Luke 10:38. Then the Spirit of God gives us facts covering the conditions in that house; the house was Martha's. Those responsible in a meeting may not be the most spiritual. Mary was the most spiritual at Bethany. Her attitude would gratify the Lord's heart.
In chapter 11, "One of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray", @Luke 11:1 and He gave a formula as to what they should say. Then He speaks of one who did not have what was necessary, but obtained it by asking; and then the Lord goes on to verse 13, which is the great means of local furnishings, that is, the Holy Spirit, so that the Lord in coming might find conditions which He could delight in. We could not have such without the Holy Spirit. In Acts these are concrete cases. If conditions are not right, the Lord cannot be there.
What are local furnishings?
Conditions where things are according to God. Take Antioch for example, in the assembly there were certain prophets and teachers. They ministered
{372}
to the Lord. It is a question of what is in heaven being brought down here; heaven was the place of it, the subject beginning with His being received up. In going in there, the furnishings were perfect so that the Spirit coming from heaven, should bring out a counterpart of heaven. Legislation and social etiquette combined do not provide conditions for Christ to come in, these conditions are brought about by the Spirit.
So in Antioch we get an indication of the mind of heaven. We see how God can bring together people of all conditions of society. Barnabas, Simeon, Lucius from the north of Africa, Manaen, evidently a nobleman, the highest condition of society; Saul, whose history we know, a citizen of Rome, a Pharisee of the Pharisees, and yet he is the last in the list. This shows that his natural ability did not count; he is not at all occupied with himself, he is amongst his brethren as one of them, no distinctions are in his mind. "The rich and poor meet together: the Lord is the maker of them all", @Proverbs 22:2. The Lord was before them; the levitical family was among the Gentiles. They were fasting, disallowing the flesh, and hence the Holy Spirit could speak. Verse 2 is what marked the company.
What is ministering to the Lord?
I suppose it would be priestly. Aaron was to "minister unto me in the priest's office". @Exodus 28:1.
What form would it take apart from the Lord's supper?
It would take form at all times where we turn to the Lord and speak to Him. In Luke 8 they ministered unto Him in material things. There should never be a coming together of the Lord's people but that He should have something. In Acts 16 we have both prayer and praise by Paul and Silas in the prison. See how that scene answered to heaven! The Holy Spirit had come down from heaven and He brought
{373}
about spheres on earth answering to heaven. The Spirit is unhampered, He is seen here as acting freely and sovereignly. One would never feel satisfied except the Lord had some part in what engages the saints. In Numbers 28 you get "my offering and my bread", etc. @Numbers 28:2, that must be always in view. At Antioch the Lord was considered. The presence of Barnabas and Saul during the previous year would tend to form the company. They were there a year. "The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch", @Acts 11:26.
It is a great thing to keep before us the thought of dwelling -- "a place for the Lord", Psalm 132. These two brothers would convey that thought and bring to the saints what was required for the Lord. David said that Jehovah's house was to be "exceeding magnifical", @1 Chronicles 22:5 it was to contain upper chambers, inner chambers, treasuries, the house of the mercy-seat, etc. He specified them and impressed upon Solomon that they should be all there. David had the pattern of the house by the Spirit; @1 Chronicles 28:12.
God is in heaven, His dwelling place is there. The thought was to bring in here what corresponds with heaven. We can understand that nothing else would be suitable.
Paul and Barnabas had been accustomed to gather with the assembly. They took pattern from the Lord in that; we read of His "being assembled together with them". @Acts 1:4. Then the disciple who was to take Judas¬ place must be one who had assembled with them. "All the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us". @Acts 1:21. That was the principle.
In coming together to read the Scriptures even, we should have before us what the Lord would do -- what part He would have. He always takes His part with us. The barren woman is taught to keep house and be a joyful mother of children. The thought of housekeeping enters into all this. The
{374}
house is in order and hence the missionaries go out to bring in the children. Hence where the order of the house of God is presented in 1 Timothy, the attitude of God toward all men for blessing is in view.
Fasting is the disallowance of legitimate demands. It is not a matter of righteousness exactly, that is imperative. The apostle gives us an outline in 1 Corinthians 9 of what governed him. He did not use these liberties, for the sake of the testimony. "We have not used this right", he says, "but we bear all things that we may put no hindrance in the way of the glad tidings of the Christ". @1 Corinthians 9:12.
We get "prophets" here, and "teachers". The prophet brings in the mind of God; one great feature in teaching is adjustment. If God speaks to you, you feel humbled; that is the effect of prophetic ministry. In the order of the gifts we get pastors and teachers. The pastor brings in food for the saints, but then he also adjusts their minds to the mind of God.
Luke takes great pleasure under the Spirit of God, to bring out the comely things; he has in his mind to bring in all that was at the beginning. He speaks of a "a multitude of the heavenly host". @Luke 2:13. What is according to God is brought in here. They were well known in heaven and were to be known here. The Lord reminds the disciples that their names were written in heaven, and further that He saw Satan as lightning fall from heaven; @Luke 10:18. Thus it was cleared for them.
The composition of any meeting should be a matter of great interest. It is a question of what the Lord does. We have in New York a remarkable composition from all parts of the world. We get among others at Antioch, Niger mentioned here and a Cyrenian; it is the composition of "the assembly which was there". It gives us the leading brothers, they are all occupied with the Lord. There is no thought of what anyone was as in the world.
{375}
In the introduction of the dwelling of God in Genesis 28, the Lord stood at the top of the ladder. Jacob was lying on the earth; those were not normal house conditions. It was to show how the light came into Jacob's soul. If God remained at the top of the ladder, Jacob would not understand the full meaning of Bethel -- the house of God. When he goes back to Bethel, he goes back as a prince with God. Jacob is a type. In @Genesis 35:13, we read, "God went up from him in the place where he had talked with him". He had been down to be with Jacob. Jacob is a peer now; typically, he is a fit companion for God in His house. The peers are here at Antioch; 'titles' are, so to speak, in order. God has made them princes. "Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in the earth", @Psalm 45:16. The Lord is the Prince of the princes of the Levites. The principle is that all are princes by having the Spirit, but the practical qualification is largely by prayer, thus they are *fit* for the assembly. "As a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed", @Genesis 32:28.
We read in verse 2 of our chapter, "The Holy Spirit said". How would that be today?
He would speak through someone. He would always speak through a medium, but the saints would recognise that it was the voice of the Spirit.
We see the importance of Acts 13 as a basis for the operations of God through Paul. They "returned to Antioch". It is the setting of Antioch, and the apostle's labour is seen in connection with the assembly there. This is set down as a principle governing levitical work, that is, their local meeting. They would always have a sense of obligation there. The work at Antioch did not begin with Paul and Barnabas, but through those that were scattered by the persecution at Jerusalem. The assembly never sends out a missionary or servant, it is the
{376}
Holy Spirit who does that. They got their commission in the assembly from the Spirit.
There was no thought of setting up Antioch as a metropolis, the simplicity of the order of the assembly at Antioch strikes you, that assembly was formed by those scattered, a sort of voluntary service. The assembly at Antioch was the outcome of a sort of service without a commission as it is *now*. Now it is generally the outcome of love; your hands find work to be done, and you do it. The Lord takes you up as a workman, do what your hands find to do and the Lord will give you a commission in time. This principle indeed is seen in Paul himself, for he laboured at Damascus and Antioch before he was formally commissioned by the Spirit.
Apollos came from Alexandria. His appearance is very interesting. Paul had been taking the initiative everywhere, now we get other persons, Aquila and Priscilla, who had no previous relations with Paul. They are found at Corinth. Then Apollos appears at Ephesus; he needed instruction, but he was greatly fitted to augment the work of God. All this shows how God is never committed to one man for His work. Apollos is a brother who might be emulated; he was accurate and knew the Scriptures. "He spoke and taught *exactly"*. @Acts 18:25. It is a great feature in ministry to be exact. It makes it imperative that we should read Scripture to use it as Apollos did. He made a point of causing the Scriptures to speak, to bring them to bear on his hearers. It does not say he was a prophet. He knew how to take off the stone from the well's mouth to water the flock. He had the baptism of John and the Old Testament Scriptures. "He that hath, to him shall be given". @Mark 4:25, @Luke 8:18. The Lord gave him more. The Lord led him on and he was a ready learner. We read that he was "an eloquent man", as though God used what was there. A man speaking under the power of God would speak eloquently, in a
{377}
sense it would be good speaking, words and sentences conveying things forcibly. It is not a question of studying eloquence.
In Acts 21 you have three illustrations of local companies: Tyre, Ptolemais and Caesarea. Tyre was the centre of the great commercial system. In verse 4, the disciples said to Paul, "by the Spirit", etc. It does not say which one said it; it is simply that the disciples at Tyre spoke to Paul by the Spirit. It was normal Christianity. They were the result of Paul's ministry, no doubt, now *they* speak instead of him.
Was it not failure in Paul that he did not listen to them?
I would be loath to bring that in. The point is to see the wonderful results of the gospel that there were disciples who could speak to Paul by the Spirit. However gifted or spiritual, you are to remember that you may come to a local company and get help yourself. One ought to be open for it, open for help from any of the Lord's people. The great thing to emphasise is that the result of the gospel brought out these conditions. It is well to be prepared for it, because these local conditions are simply a reflection of what is in heaven. You must not think you have got the watering-can exclusively, because the Spirit is there and you may be refreshed.
In the previous chapter, in Troas and then at Ephesus, the apostle is representative of the Lord. They embrace the apostle; it indicates the love they had for the Lord. At Tyre, Paul and his company stayed seven days. It afforded an opportunity for assembly affections to be displayed. At Ptolemais, they remained one day; there the *brethren* are saluted. The "brethren" are the same as the "disciples", only viewed in a different light. The latter term refers to everyday conditions. At Tyre they accompanied him with wives and children. We see them as they are. "And we kneeled down on the shore
{378}
and prayed". What a beautiful scene! What it must have been for heaven! It was a reflection of what was there. In heaven Paul was highly honoured, they all knew him there. However great a brother may be, the Spirit of God is greater. There are no wives and children in heaven, but there are brethren there; they will be there eternally. Paul saluted them.
Then at Caesarea there is Philip the evangelist. As a matter of fact he is the only one *called* an evangelist. He was known that way, not that he evangelised Caesarea. He came as far as Caesarea in his ministry, after he had evangelised the eunuch. It was Peter who brought the gospel into Caesarea.
Philip had four daughters that prophesied -- one of the most remarkable households you get in Scripture! They would soon discern any counterfeits. They were a striking testimony to what Philip was. They are not called prophetesses. They brought in the mind of God, they prophesied. It is an immense thing with a sister to have power to bring in the mind of God. What a refreshing time it would be there (Philip's house) for the apostle's spirit! Doubtless they would compare notes as to how God used them in enlightening souls through the gospel. Deborah dwelt under the *palm* tree of Deborah; it would mean that she was victorious.
It is all to bring out what the Lord looks for -- love. At Caesarea there was love. Then there is a prophet, Agabus; he has liberty here. There is full scope for the Spirit in all these places. See the area in which the Holy Spirit was free! @Acts 21:11. That is the thing the Lord would say to us: Is there room for the Spirit? Nothing is of any moral value unless there is room for the Spirit in the company.
In 1 Corinthians 11, we have what is comely in domestic relations; it is God's order in creation which should be reflected in the man and the woman.
{379}
Paul says as to this, "If anyone seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God". @1 Corinthians 11:16. We accept the teaching of the passage. It is a question of comeliness before we come to the assembly, what is comely in creation, the order of God is presented. It is a question of the woman being in her place in relation to the whole creation; then too, "because of the angels". @1 Corinthians 11:10,
The question raised in what has been before us is: Is there room for the Spirit of God to speak in our respective localities? As we see in the composition of the assembly at Antioch, there should be no respect of persons amongst us; it is a question of spiritual stature, those who are spiritual are recognised. In @Acts 21:14, the saints submit to the will of the Lord. What they could not alter, they leave. This always marks spiritual persons. In Antioch you get "they ministered to the Lord"; it was priestly service.
{380}
PRAYER
@Luke 3: 21, 22; @Luke 5: 16, 17; @Luke 6: 12, 13; @Luke 9: 18 - 20, 28, 29; @Luke 11: 1 - 13; @Luke 22: 41 - 44; @Luke 23: 34, 40 - 43
At our afternoon reading we left off with the subject of prayer; and it is before me after much consideration to resume that subject this evening. In @Ephesians 6:18, the saints are enjoined to pray "at all seasons, with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit" -- a fitting end to an epistle that unfolds the whole purpose of God; for the more light vouchsafed, the more sense there is, in those who value it, of the need for prayer, especially in the light of the statement that God "is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think". @Ephesians 3:20. This is a great incentive to prayer.
Now in introducing so important and practical a subject, one would refer to the fact that the beginning of the great work of God in Europe was marked by prayer, as if the instinct were present that tremendous opposition stood in the way of its progress in that part of the world, hence the need is expressed in prayer. First, the man of Macedonia beseeches that extraordinary vessel of the light of God from heaven to come over. It was an urgent prayer to come over and help, then arriving at Philippi, Paul and those with him found a place of prayer, perhaps the first formal prayer meeting mentioned, not that collective prayer is not found earlier, but here we get a *place* for it. The apostle and his company are led to that spot, and in connection with it they find engaged in commerce, a woman of Thyatira, whose heart the Lord opened so that she attended to the things spoken by Paul. Light came into her soul, and having been baptised, she besought Paul to come into her house.
Then we are told that as they went to prayer, a female slave met them, as if the enemy was now
{381}
aroused, knowing what was involved in this form of service, and started to oppose. This woman had a spirit of python, by which, in prophesying, she brought much gain to her masters, showing that Satan was entrenched in the spirit of commerce in that part of the world, and would not have his domain touched, for a prayerful people would spoil that order of things. The building up of a commercial system is not compatible with prayer. Prayer gives God His place, who created all things and gives them to us richly to enjoy. They are sanctified by the word of God and prayer, but the great commercial systems of Europe and of this country are not sanctified by the word of God and prayer, and we have to be on our guard against them. One of the great snares of the present time is the world of commerce; it offers much attraction to young people, whereas they fail to see that Satan is entrenched in it; indeed, it is a remarkable fact that in the Old Testament the king of Tyre (Tyre being the great commercial centre) is a type of the devil himself. See Ezekiel 28. This female slave, who brought much gain to her masters, becomes the agent of the devil to oppose a people who were going to prayer. This really brought about the arrest of Paul and Silas, who were thrust into the prison, but we find the indomitable spirit of prayer there.
I refer to this because prayer lay at the root of the great work of God that spread into Europe, and eventually into this country, and it is doubtless the thought of God that the end should be as the beginning. The testimony obviously remained in Europe, and at the outgoings of Europe. There, in the ways of God, it has stood and will stand; and it is with that thought before me that at the end there should be a people characterised by prayer.
I wish to illustrate the great results of prayer from the blessed Lord Himself, guarding my remarks
{382}
with the thought that the Lord is unique, and that there are features in each instance that belong to Him exclusively. But there are also features which correspond with these results of prayer in each Christian. I have read these scriptures in Luke with this before me.
There are eight instances in Luke's gospel in which the Lord Jesus is seen engaged in prayer. In speaking of these my thought is to interest the young people here especially. In chapter 3 it is the Lord identifying Himself with the remnant of God's people; and it is your privilege to follow His example. It is not enough to have light in your soul in regard to your sins, or your eternal destiny. God looks for definite identification, on the part of every one having light, with His people. Moses, when he became great, chose to suffer affliction *along with* the people of God; that is the example the Lord sets here. All the people having been baptised, Jesus was baptised and He prayed. I wish to impress upon the young ones the thought that your entrance amongst the people of God must be marked, if you are to progress, by this. The Lord had come and definitely *identified* Himself with the repentant people of God. He was the Son and outside of this personally, having no sins to confess, but He identified Himself with them. All the people being baptised, He was baptised. He did not go in first. You see it is identification. He is not giving a lead here, but is taking His place humbly with a repentant people. He comes in last, but coming in last, He is morally first, for of Him alone it is said that *He prayed*. He did not take up His baptism lightly, but seriously. Unless we take up our position in connection with the people of God seriously and in prayer, we shall not progress. It is for the youngest to begin thus, not indeed necessarily in the assembly, audibly, you must begin in your closet. What was said of Paul in the Lord's great
{383}
introduction of him to Ananias was, "Behold, he prayeth", @Acts 9:11. If anyone seeks to identify himself with the saints, what I would like to know is what his conduct is in his closet. How does he get on there? "Pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly", @Matthew 6:6. He will give you power in the assembly.
Now what you see here is the Lord Jesus praying as He is baptised, and the heaven is opened. I should not like to be with the people of God except with the approval of heaven. You must, of course, seek the approval of the saints; one great principle in Christianity is reception, but the saints are particular as to their reception. It is said of Jesus, He was "received up in glory", @1 Timothy 3:16. Do you not think that heaven exercised the keenest discrimination in that reception? Indeed it did.
Though the Creator of the heavens, He was Man, and had walked this earth under the eye of heaven. He was "justified in the Spirit", we are told that He "has appeared to angels, ... has been received up in glory". @1 Timothy 3:16. *Received up*! So, if I am to be amongst the people of God, it is with the approval of heaven. How do I know that I have that approval? The Lord had it by the extraordinary opening of the heaven upon Him. Wonderful! The angels could look down, and the Father saw Him and announced His pleasure: "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", @Luke 3:22. You say, I cannot expect that. No, but for us heaven's approval is found in the assembly. I do not wish to be with the people of God without their approval. The saints normally reflect the mind of heaven, and you may be assured of this that if it can be said of you, as it was said of Saul of Tarsus: "Behold he prayeth", @Acts 9:11 you will find the approval of the saints.
Before I pass on to the next scripture, I would
{384}
say a word about the Spirit. I think the Spirit of God comes in in connection with heaven's approval. I would not care to be amongst the people of God without the approval of heaven by the Spirit, for it would mean I am unequal to the surroundings, for I am not a prince. God's thought is that you come in as set amongst princes, but not as a beggar. It would be a poor thing to be set amongst princes as a beggar. You are taken outside of that state, and set amongst princes *as a prince* in the reception of the Spirit.
In connection with the second prayer, the Lord is in the wilderness. Young believers do not care much about that place. They like to be in the crowd; one often dreads meetings like these for the reason that young people are apt to be governed by natural feelings among other young people, whereas the truly exercised soul wants to get alone, he wants to withdraw from the crowd. The Lord was in the wilderness in a desert place, but was praying there. The desert does not hinder prayer, it aids you in that exercise, for there is nothing in the wilderness to attract the flesh in us. The Lord was there as withdrawn from the crowds. I would urge that feature in regard to prayer -- the acceptance of the actual situation that the world is a *wilderness*. You may come to the meeting and be amongst the people of God on worldly lines. The Lord "withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed". Following upon this, He was teaching on one of the days and great men were present, Pharisees and doctors of the law, persons that would tend to overawe one, but "the power of the Lord was present to heal them". One, at times, awakes to a sense of the need that there is in this world, not only in the poor leper -- full of leprosy, who was avoided by everybody, but in these Pharisees and doctors of the law, these distinguished persons. The need is also there. Am I indifferent to it? Is it of God that one should have
{385}
the light of God in one's soul -- the knowledge of the cleansing value of the blood of Jesus, and the power of the Holy Spirit, and be indifferent to the fearful need in this world? No! The Lord would have us to be sensitive to all these things, and amongst them all to be in the desert place, praying. You may be sure of it that if you take things up thus seriously, the power of the Lord will be with you -- that power which was present to heal. Let us pass on to chapter 6. This scripture suggests that you cannot do things of yourself, even your ordinary prayers do not suffice; and so the Lord is seen apart on the mountain -- a whole night in prayer -- with a view to *selection*. One marvels at it. I have often said it, and practised it too, that the best way to spend wakeful hours is in prayer. I have not a doubt that God gives wakeful hours, orders them for us, so that we may pray. The responsibility of things is so overwhelming; but as you are with God, you find an outlet in regard to the need of men and the people of God. The Lord spent a whole night in prayer. In the morning He chose out twelve from His disciples whom He named apostles. You see the work is so great you cannot do it of yourself, even if you had the power of a Paul. This is one of the greatest lessons a servant has to learn. And so the Lord (not that I am limiting His power, but am speaking of Him as an example) would have twelve working with Him, for the need was so great. Then He descends from the mountain with them and stands on a level place. He is down where the need is, and with Him are the twelve vessels of His power. The point is to see the need, then there is the accompaniment of prayer, through which great results are brought about. As it says: "Supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest that he may send out workmen into his harvest", @Luke 10:2. I do urge the great importance of this. It is within the range of
{386}
every one of us to pray that the Lord may send out labourers into His harvest, and He will answer our prayers.
Now the fourth prayer is in chapter 9. You will see there is progress. What comes out in this scripture is, that as the Lord is praying alone, He makes enquiry of His disciples as to who men said He was. Abroad in Christendom there are a thousand and one thoughts about Christ which are entirely wrong, some of them are blasphemous thoughts. Can I be indifferent to them? I cannot. No one who is with God can be indifferent to anything that affects Christ. As He is praying here this question is raised; for it is important that the disciples at least should know *who He was;* and it is important that we, as surrounded by these thousand and one views, blasphemous most of them, should know who He is. Can you give a ready answer as to the Person of the Lord? Does it affect you as you hear Him blasphemed? If you love Him, it does. If you love the Lord, His very name taken in vain in your hearing is distressing to you. You resent it. It is remarkable that those who make so much of His mother dishonour Him in the use they make of His precious name. Is it nothing to you? If you are characterised by praying, it makes a great difference to you. If you have seen Him in His beauty in the sanctuary where God dwells, you would be distressed as you hear His name blasphemed by His creatures -- "Whom do ye say that I am?" Peter is ready with the answer: "The Christ of God". God has got Christ, the anointed One. He has One by Him who does all His will, the Vessel of His grace. Peter readily acknowledges that and confesses Him. We have nothing here about the revelation made to Peter. That is not the point. Here it is the knowledge of the Person of Jesus as the outcome of prayer.
In the next passage of this chapter you have a
{387}
change presented. If you know the Lord as He is, He is different from all other men. The great error of the day is to bring the Lord Jesus down to the level of other men so as to compare Him with them, but He is *different*. What you find is that it was as He prayed His countenance became different. You want to apprehend what this difference is. For example, if you go into the world and become defiled by it, you are like it, and hence the necessity for the red heifer. See Numbers 19. The *red* heifer suggests what is different; it is the principle of a different kind of man; it typifies Jesus who died, and by that death you are cleansed from assimilation with the world. It says in Romans 12, "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind". @Romans 12:2. How readily young people slip into the ways of the world, its customs and its sayings! The more spiritual you are, the more you abhor slang, and also the fashions of this world. They issue from the vilest city in the world. The divine idea is to be different, it comes out in prayer. I am seeking what corresponds in us as we pray. He ascended the mount to pray. "And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different, and his raiment white and effulgent". Applying that to the believer, I understand it to mean that in occupation with the Lord you become like Him. As it is said: "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit", @2 Corinthians 3:18. In result, you are amongst the saints, not as you were, you are different. One loves to see brethren changed in that way, and rejoices in having seen it. One would seek that it should take place in oneself: that there should be with us that constant change from glory to glory. We are thus different, we have taken on new features, and the saints discern it.
{388}
In Luke 11 the reference is to what is *local*, and again we have prayer. What I have said so far is general, but when you come to chapter 11, it is preceded (as already before us today) by the Lord's appointing seventy others also, and Bending them "two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come". So that now we are in the presence of truth that refers to a local company. If you are not exercised about your local company, you have no part in "the angel" of that locality. You will find that as you progress in the truth, you take up your local responsibility. One hopes that every person here has a sense of responsibility, for unless you take up the sense of obligation you are of little moral worth. The absence of moral obligation paves the way for the building up of clericalism and has led to the handing over of religious affairs to a committee of men. Here the Lord is praying, and *one* of His disciples said to Him: "Lord, teach us to pray". It is as if our local brethren need to be taught how to pray. As they pray, they will find abundance of local furnishings, which are really heavenly furnishings. The prayer has in view the bringing out of heaven into your locality what you know to be there.
So the Lord ends the passage with the thought that the Father who is *of* heaven (not *in* heaven as Matthew) gives the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him. I refer to it now in a general way as applying to a locality, for you cannot have things right in a locality without the Spirit. It is the Spirit, not for yourself exactly, but for the locality. You want the Spirit with all the brethren, and you must never rest till all of them are characterised by the Spirit of God. You will never have peace nor conditions for Christ locally, unless all the brethren are imbued with the Spirit of God. The way to reach this is by prayer; "how much rather shall the Father who is of
{389}
heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" In this way your local needs are met. You have
secured a place for the Lord, like David: "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for Jehovah", @Psalm 132:4,5 In order to have a place for the Lord, the saints in the locality must have the Spirit. You may say, Every believer has the Spirit, but you want to see the results of that in your locality. The Lord knows those who have the Spirit but the evidence of this is in the fruit of the Spirit. If you do not see this, ask the Father in heaven and He will give the Spirit. Get the right idea in your mind, and do not rest till it is realised in the fruit being there. It is realised through prayer. "Ask and ye shall receive", @Matthew 7:7.
Now in chapter 22 we have the blessed Lord in *suffering*. One would not hide from anyone that suffering belongs to our position as apart from the world. As set in this world, in the presence of the principalities and powers of evil, the universal lords of this darkness and spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies, you can not escape suffering, If Satan cannot seduce you, he will persecute you, he has the means to do it. He brought all his forces to bear on the Lord, I want to dwell for a moment on the manner in which He acted then. "He was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down". It was a serious situation. One refers to it with the deepest reverence. It is without a parallel. Though God in Person, it is as *Man* that Jesus was facing all the power of evil and praying. I put it to you, How can you expect to face the power of evil except by prayer? There is no other way. When Samuel prayed, he took a sucking lamb and offered it as one humble and dependent on God. At that moment the Philistines were arrayed against Israel, but the Lord thundered on them. See @1 Samuel 7:10.
{390}
You see, I am making deductions only here. I am not enlarging on the Lord's sufferings, for that would be too great a subject just now. I am speaking of your position and mine as meeting the forces of evil. We cannot escape them. But how are we to meet them? Only by prayer. He "kneeled down". Elsewhere we are told He prayed three times, and thus set us the example as to the limit of times. Here He prayed kneeling down, and so intense was the conflict, that "His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground". How much have we approached to agony like this? The apostle Paul says: "I would have you know what combat I have for you", @Colossians 2:1. What kind of combat? It was one of prayer for the saints. It is on our knees that we defeat the forces of the devil.
Now passing on to the last scripture, let us dwell on the marvellous grace that shone in Christ in the midst of the most terrible suffering! It should have its counterpart in us. You see it is a prayer, but unlike the former ones, it is a prayer for others. It is rarely we find recorded what He actually prayed as here, and in chapter 22 also, He said: "Father, if thou wilt, remove this cup from me", etc. Perfect, holy submission marked Him. What an example for us in suffering! The will of God is before Him. Submission to that will should also mark us in suffering -- absolute submission. Every kind of insult and imprecation was heaped upon Him, but there was no resentment towards His persecutors. "Railed at, we bless", @1 Corinthians 4:12. That is the counterpart of it. As you bless, as the spirit of grace shines in the midst of the sufferings, God will not fail to give you recompense. You will see something in the way of fruit as recompense.
I refer now to the thief. I have no doubt that as you find the prayer: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" in Luke only, so you
{391}
find the *repentant* thief in Luke only. The Father doubtless gave him to Christ as part of the spoil from His murderers. It was a wonderful transaction that interested heaven supremely. Aside from the precious sufferings and death of the Lord, what could be more interesting to heaven than the repentance of that precious soul, hanging by His side, a trophy of grace? May we not, as we maintain the spirit of Christ in suffering, look for such answers from God, encouraging us in our service?
In closing the word which I believe was received from the Lord, I would leave with you the impression that prayer is essential to the moment. There is no lack of light, but the realising of what is presented by the light comes about through prayer. As James says: "The fervent supplication of the righteous man has much power. Elias was a man of like passions to us and he prayed with prayer that it should not rain; ... and again he prayed and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to spring forth", @James 5:17,18. Do not forget that! The first book of Kings does not tell us anything about the fruit, but James does. There was fruit from the earth in answer to that second prayer. That is what we want. God gave rain from heaven, and the earth brought forth its fruit. We should not have it otherwise. We do not want heaven shut up, but if it is shut up, or appears to be, prayer will open it for spiritual ends. God will give the rain from heaven and the earth will bring forth its fruit. May God bless the word!
