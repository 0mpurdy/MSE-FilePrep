THE INTRODUCTION OF THE GOSPEL INTO EUROPE
@Acts 16:1 - 34
The point I want to call attention to is the way in which the apostle Paul carried on his service, a subject which should not only be of great interest to all who would labour, but to all Christians, whether labourers or otherwise, for it indicates the divine manner of approaching man with the gospel. God takes great pains to allay every prejudice in men; and when it becomes a matter of introducing the gospel to a new continent, this manner on the part of God is brought into evidence.
The incidents recorded in this chapter, as many know, mark the introduction of the gospel into the Western world; it was Paul's first visit to Europe. It recalls to one's mind the attitude of God as foreshadowed in the temple; the cherubim there were looking out toward the house instead of looking down toward the mercy seat as in the tabernacle, as if to take account of the need which was outside, and to meet it in grace. In that outlook God embraced men, for He has a very long look-out. When the prodigal was moving towards his father in @Luke 15, his father saw him a long way off, and so here one may picture God looking out towards Europe. He saw the end from the beginning, and that the introduction of the gospel there was to be of far-reaching consequences to the human race. He had His own chosen vessel, too, in Paul for this work, not one sent from Jerusalem, but as one might say, sent from heaven; he was a heavenly missionary. We have to bear in mind that Paul in his evangelical ministry worked from the full height of his commission, as he tells us in his epistle to the Ephesians, "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us". (@Ephesians 2:4).
{2}
As the chapter teaches, Paul is guided to Philippi. He was forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in Asia, and when he assayed to go to Bithynia the Spirit of Jesus suffered him not, and he was subject. A beautiful model for all who serve! Presently, as a subject vessel, he has a vision. There was need in Macedonia, there was need in Europe, a need perfectly known to God, but now already becoming known to a few in Philippi, for there was a spot there where prayer was wont to be made. I wonder if there is any one here who has a spiritual need, who is conscious of his absolute weakness in having to say to God, feeling his powerlessness, and who has the power of evil pressing upon his spirit, and it may be death before him. Is there any one here like that? If so, God takes account of it The man from Macedonia appears in the vision and says, "Come over and help us". It was a call, and the servant was subject, entirely subject, thus affording room for God to show what He had in His mind, and how He would reach the regions beyond. The divine horizon was far beyond even Paul's. Later on he spoke of going to Spain, of going to the utmost limits; he had that in his heart, but God had it in His heart before Paul. God had looked out and saw Europe. One cannot but dwell on that.
Now, God is not carrying on government simply for the sake of having government on earth, but on account of those who shall be heirs of salvation. It is said of angels, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" (@Hebrews 1: 14) We may reckon on that, and we should be concerned, as Paul was, with what is going on in the souls of men and women; and when I say women, I say it, because they are very prominent in this chapter. In two of them a work of God had already begun before Paul preached to them. In the third, a dreadful work of the devil proceeded;
{3}
sad, solemn fact! It may be that in this company, small as it is, there are those in whom an initial work of God has taken effect, but whose hearts as yet have not come into the good and blessing of the gospel; but, on the other hand, there may be one in whom the devil has begun to work, who has been employed by the devil in some way or other. The damsel with the spirit of divination said, "These men are the servants of the most high God". It sounded very nice; apparently she is a helper of Paul, but in reality she is an agent of the devil, and opposing the introduction of the light of grace. It may be there is one here who has come under the power of the devil; if so, now is your opportunity. The *mind* of God for you is exactly the same as it is for those in whom God has begun to work. The mind of God for this wretched woman was the same as for the others, for God has not two minds. Of the Saviour God it is said, "who will have all men to be saved". (@1 Timothy 2:4) His mind for her was grace, and so the demon was cast out of her.
But to refer for a moment to the first woman mentioned in this chapter, Timothy's mother; she is an honoured woman, she is said to be a "believing woman", for that is how it should read; a Jewess, but not simply one who had believed. To make a profession of faith on a certain day and then to go as usual does not constitute a believing woman. A "believing" woman is one who is marked by faith every day. Well, Timothy's mother was said to be such, she believed not only for herself, but for Timothy. Her mother, too, that is, Timothy's grandmother, we see also was a believing woman. The apostle in writing to Timothy said, "The unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice". (@2 Timothy 1:5) But I only speak of that to show how important it is for wives and mothers to be believing women; women
{4}
who bring in faith, who bring God into things, both in regard to their husbands and their children. As to Timothy's father, all that is said of him is that he "was a Greek". He possibly had a political status, but nothing spiritual is indicated in regard of him, and therefore this is a word for unbelieving husbands. Is there any husband here of whom all that could be said is, that he is an Englishman?
Timothy himself had a good report. We read, "which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium". Young man, young brother, what about you? What about the report that can be made about you in your district? That is a word for young brothers! You all understand that I am endeavouring to make a present application of the facts that are presented to us in this scripture, for, if we profess to believe the gospel, God looks for a life in accord with it. Timothy was such as to be worthy to be taken up by the great apostle as a companion and fellow-labourer; it is said, "him would Paul have to go forth with him". What a trophy of grace! One would appeal to those who have Christian parents as to the importance of following what has come to you through them, lest you should become a profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of meat, a mess of pottage, sold his birthright. One would speak to the young people who know the Lord, for God is taking the old ones home, and you will be called soon, if the Lord tarry, to occupy the ground and to stand for Him. One would desire that your report should be a good one from the Lord's people in the district where you are.
The next woman that we get is Lydia. What one notices in connection with her is that the apostle's desire is first of all to associate himself with that which is of God in that place. He did not take a hall in Philippi and start to preach. He found the place where prayer was wont to be made; he found
{5}
that dependence was already there, and he came into touch with it; he and those with him "sat down and spake unto the women"; and now Lydia comes into evidence. This woman was not of Philippi but of the city of Thyatira. She was a seller of purple, she had a trade; of her it is recorded that the Lord opened her heart, "that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul". Notice that! She attended to them, and they were taken into her heart and pondered over.
What about your heart? Simeon in the temple, when he took up Jesus in his arms, said that the thoughts of many hearts would be revealed in connection with that Child. The coming of Christ involved the testing of every heart. How about your heart? Your heart has to be taken account of by itself. The word of God has to be received there, but I would call your attention to what the Lord says in @Matthew 13, that while the word may be received, unless it is understood, the devil comes and catches away that which was sown in the heart. The apostle said "the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in heart". (@Romans 10:8) Now that is remarkable, because it shows that the word may be received, and yet if it not understood, Satan takes it away. One has seen many instances of that kind, where the enemy takes away the word, so that the man remains what he ever was, he is unaffected. I ask again, How about your heart? Has the word been received into your heart, and has it been understood? The word of God brings in what God is, and what Christ is, and so works effectually in those who believe. It is effectual only in those who believe. Lydia believed; she received the word into her heart, and then she opened her house to Paul.
Now I want to come to the jailor, because, after all he is the character of the chapter; he is *the man* of Macedonia, and I shall show you, if I can, the
{6}
beautiful manner in which God reached this man's heart, and what it involved for the servants of the Lord. One is greatly humbled when one thinks of Paul and Silas, and the great disparity between oneself and such men. Here are two men simply in the hands of God. It is God's work and they are prepared for the path of suffering. "For thy sake we are killed all the day long". (@Romans 8:36) And one trembles, and I say it truthfully, when one thinks of what Paul and Silas were, and compares oneself with such. Here are two men ready to be offered up for the gospel. The jailor was charged to keep them safely, and so in the ordering of God they are thrust by him into the inner prison, and their feet were made fast in the stocks. God would reach that man's heart, and God would reach your heart through the gospel. At midnight Paul and Silas sang praises to God. God had His portion in them. What a savour ascended to God that night from that dark dungeon in Philippi. Such is Christianity! They prayed and sang praises to God. God was showing Himself through His servants, through qualified vessels equal to the message. He was showing Himself to the jailor, and not only to the jailor, but to all in the prison; "and the prisoners heard them". (@Acts 16:25). God was approaching this jailor and the prisoners.
These servants began by prayer, and proceeded to praise. What energy there was! Their hymns are not preserved, but they sang a hymn of praise, and the prisoners heard; they were compelled to listen. How beautiful! What a moment it was! What a privilege! Think of that jailor being converted that night! Then God acted in power to further His work. "And suddenly there was a great earthquake". (verse 26) God acted, doubtless, by angelic means in that way, and now the jailor is moved. His first thought was to commit suicide, what great folly; that was his first impulse. Think of the heart of man! Suicide
{7}
does not take a man out of the presence of God; it takes him into it! The jailor drew out his sword and would have killed himself. Then he heard the voice of Paul, which was full of grace. "He cried with a loud voice" (verse 28); not only were the accents divine, as one might say, but the words themselves, "Do thyself no harm, for we are all here", were beautiful. God would preserve man; indeed He preserves the beast. "O Lord, thou preservest man and beast". (@Psalm 36:6)
Is there any one here who is pursuing a course of sin? To such an one I would say, The gospel is to do you good. Note how this poor man was changed. He sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas. He was evidently affected by the words of grace which fell from Paul's lips as from the Lord's mouth, for "they wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth". (@Luke 4:22) And so the jailor calls for a light; he felt the need for it, for his soul was dark; and so is yours if you are groping in the dark and have not come into the light of grace. He rushed in to Paul and Silas, for the light was really there, and he says "Sirs". (@Acts 16:30). He no doubt would have used the roughest terms before, but now his mind is changed about them. He would not have said that when he thrust them into prison, but he was changed. He had to do, no doubt, with the roughest of men, who did not deserve terms of respect, but now his mind is changed; it is the effect of conversion. His mind is changed about God, about Christ, and about the servants of Christ; he had despised them. The jailor now uses terms of respect, and they deserved it, for they are indeed God's noblemen. Young people are disposed sometimes to speak with disrespect of the servants of God. He says, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" (verse 30) May God grant that someone here may ask that question, if not
{8}
already done! Paul gives a simple answer, nothing could be more simple, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved and thy house". (verse 31) The jailor had a household, and the message not only embraces him, but those he loved. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, *and thy house*".
That is the message, and the man is reached, he believed, and as we see in the sequel, he was instructed in the word of the Lord. Paul and Silas "spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house". (verse 32) He is to know not only that the Lord has rights over his soul, but that He has a mind about him. The word of the Lord brings to you the mind of the Lord. It is an immense thing to know that the Lord has a mind in regard to me and to all His own; it is most important, therefore, to know the word of the Lord. This is a case where the word of the Lord was received and understood. In verse 32 we find that the children and wife were also instructed by the apostle, I am speaking now of his methods, for it was to *all* that were in his house that the word of the Lord was spoken; they were all to be instructed in the mind of the Lord.
Now I want to dwell upon what the effect upon this man was. It says, "he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptised, he and all his, *straightway*". He did not wait; mark, it was done "straightway". I would urge you, whatever the light brings into your soul, to act upon it immediately. He took them *the same hour of the night*, for the servants had stripes upon their backs. I would never put off baptism, either for myself or my household. It brings them in immediately. Joshua says, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord", (@Joshua 24:15) and that is what this man says in effect. He washed their stripes, and gave them meat; but he was baptised, he and all
{9}
his, straightway. Such is an outline of the manner of the introduction of the gospel into the Western world. I may note another effect of the testimony of grace being received. The man rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. God brings into our souls the element of rejoicing. It is said of the jailor, "When he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and *rejoiced*". There was joy in that house. I think it is very beautiful. It is not only that the jailor "believed in God" and "rejoiced", but he did so with all his house; it is 'householdly'; the word is an adverb, and it is intended to show that the joy was not only for the jailor himself but for all his house; what a marvellous result of the gospel! The man was genuinely affected.
May God grant to any of those who may have heard the gospel, to believe it, and may the joy that brings into our hearts be more known by us who believe, and may it be shared by all in the house. The households of the people of God should be scenes of joy.
May God bless His word!

PAUL AND HIS COMPANY
@2 Timothy 3:10,11; @Acts 26:12 - 18
My thought on this occasion is to say a word about Paul, to seek to make clear, if I can, the circumstances under which he was introduced and their spiritual significance, and then to show a little the main features of his doctrine and manner of life or conduct, and the accompanying features that are mentioned in the passage I read from 2 Timothy. I have chosen that passage because of its bearing on the last days. Timothy being the chosen servant to take up, and continue, and hand on to the saints that which Paul had ministered.
In speaking of Timothy I would call attention to what I think should be observed in regard of him, namely, that in the first letter he is said to have received gift through prophecy and the laying on of the hands of the presbytery, whereas in the second letter his gift is connected entirely with the putting on of Paul's hands, as if to impress upon him that, whilst he had to do with the assembly in order, as an apostolic delegate, and consequently the elderhood or presbytery had necessarily place and influence, now the time had come when Paul's impress must be emphasised. It is well that the elderhood, or presbytery should be observed, but conditions arise in which Paul, as the chosen and faithful vessel of Christ, must take precedence, and so Timothy is to re-kindle the gift of God which was in him by the laying on of Paul's hands. Then another feature in this second letter is that Timothy was to have an outline of sound words. I mention these, dear brethren, as things to be observed now by us, if we are to be here intelligently and rightly for Christ, He was to have "an outline of sound words, which words", says the apostle, "thou hast heard of me".
{11}
This involves Paul's doctrine. Paul's teaching was to be held in outline in the ministry of Timothy "in faith and love, which are in Christ Jesus". And then, thirdly, he is to pass on to faithful men the things which he had learned of Paul in the presence of many witnesses that they might "teach others also". Thus, in this letter, Timothy (or the man of God for the last days) is to be stamped by Paul's teaching and example. I bring these points forward at the beginning so that we might have in mind how matters stand at this hour, that is, in our day.
Paul and his ministry afford a great test for us in these days. The apostle says in chapter 3, "thou hast fully known [or, 'hast followed up'] my doctrine, manner of life, purpose". I mention this because of the importance of following things up from the outset, that we might have clearly in view what the mind of the Lord is. You will recall how Luke writing with method to Theophilus, "having been accurately acquainted from the origin with all things" began "from the very first"; (@Luke 1:2,3) hence the great importance of going back to the beginning; that is, of being in exercise, as Timothy undoubtedly was, in order that we should follow things up and miss nothing. And I may remark another feature in passing, namely, that you have in this letter Paul and his company as it appeared at the end, not as it appeared at the beginning. You will recall the word in @Acts 13:13, how that after Paul, having started out from Antioch with Barnabas, had caused blindness to come upon Elymas, the opposer of the truth, mention is made of "Paul and his company". The Spirit of God emphasises the place of this remarkable servant and those who were regarded as his company. That was the beginning, whereas this second letter to Timothy presents to us the company at the end, after having passed through the conflicts, the storms, and all the
{12}
efforts of the enemy to shatter it, and although discredited, marred and depleted, it remained true, for Paul was still the triumphant witness, and Luke was with him, with others mentioned honourably, and especially Mark. The case of Mark shows that, whilst the enemy had wrought for disintegration, the Lord had wrought in the way of recovery. The restorative grace of Christ is that which we may reckon upon, dear brethren, so that a man who "separated from them" as it is said of Mark in @Acts 13:13, "from Paul and his company", is now sent for, as one who is profitable to Paul for ministry. Wonderful triumph of the restorative grace of Christ! -- a grace, as I remarked, which we may rely upon, and indeed which we should always be in sympathy with, for the Spirit of Christ in us always aims at recovery, never at destruction; so that, although a brother may depart from the company, as Mark did, in the end he is serviceable for ministry.
Now I go on to the circumstances under which Paul was introduced, and what one may call attention to, and what is very well known doubtless to most of us, is the assertion at that juncture of the authority of the Lord. He comes in peculiarly *as the Lord* at that epoch, for it is a most memorable period in the history of the assembly; the enemy having stirred up a terrific persecution against the saints, Saul entered into the houses one after another, as we are told, and in his zeal dragged off men and women, delivering them up to prison, and now by permission of the priests at Jerusalem he sets out with his credentials to Damascus to carry out his mission of persecution and destruction of the people of the Lord. At that moment the Lord manifests Himself in His authority on behalf of the assembly. He had been made "Lord and Christ", and He is now interfering to assert His authority as such in the way of protection. I commend that simple
{13}
thought to you, dear brethren, it is a thought most important to us. The wing of Christ's protection is extended over the assembly, the object of His love; and so the Lord meets this man on the way, having allowed him first to traverse the road from Jerusalem to Damascus.
At this point I would call attention to another feature in the Lord's position; that is, that He had not only come from God, but He had gone *to God*. I mention that here so that you may see the setting of Paul's introduction. The disciples believed that He had come out from God (@John 16:30); that was a good deal to believe, but it was not enough; we must believe that He is gone to God, and I am not now speaking of His exaltation or His ascension, but of what was due to Him morally as having been here as a Man on earth for God's glory. Think of a Man going in to God in the dignity of His Person! I commend that thought to your consideration as the other side to the Lord's position. It may seem very simple, but it is of all moment for us to apprehend that He has gone to God; the truth of His Person is involved in it, but it refers to what He did as a Man here on earth. He went to God, as having glorified God as a Man here on earth. So He says to Paul, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest". (@Acts 9:5) He was the Man who had been known on earth, in whom God was glorified, and who could say, "I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do"; (@John 17:4) it is that Jesus, that Man, the One whom Stephen had seen in the glory, who had gone in to God. And further, dear brethren, I want to say here that the whole mediatorial system which was to come out and be developed in Paul's doctrine hangs on this great fact, that He has gone to God, a Man has gone in to God.
Now, not to dwell in detail as to Paul's introduction, I want to say at this point that whilst the Lord
{14}
Jesus revealed Himself in this remarkable fashion in bringing down this mighty agent of the devil, God also was at work at the same time; so the apostle tells us, in writing to the Galatians, that God revealed his Son in him. I shall say a word about that on account of the connection here. "But when God", he says, "who set me apart even from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations". (@Galatians 1:15,16) I plead for a moment for that feature, the Father's work, which is parallel with the work of the Son, and brings in the element of sovereignty, a most important element for us. Whilst the *Lord* acts from heaven, and speaks to Saul by name, and announces Himself to him as "Jesus", the Man, *God* revealed His Son in him. He revealed His Son *in* him; that is God's sovereign act, and I want to speak of that, because one feels the immense importance of the sovereign acts of God. Now in acting thus, God acts in relation to the work of Christ; Christ appeared from heaven to Saul, and God revealed His Son in him.
Referring now for a moment to @Matthew 16, we find the Father had beforehand revealed the Son to Peter. Peter confessed "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God", and the Lord said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens. And I also, I say unto thee that thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly". (@Matthew 16:16 - 18) Now "the Christ" was a feature in the revelation to Peter, although the major part of the revelation is the great fact that He is "the Son of the living God"; so that the structure to be reared up would be marked by an understanding of the fact that all things are accomplished, not by human agency nor by combination, but by *the Christ*. The Christ is the One by whom God effects everything, an
{15}
immense thing for us to understand, delivering us, as being in the structure of which this is the foundation, from all dependence on human agencies and methods; we apprehend that the Christ not only *tells* us all things, but He *accomplishes* all things for God; He is the Anointed. But then there is also in this revelation to Peter that which is *living*, and I commend to you at the present time the importance of this feature. The structure is to be replete with life, for it is composed of living stones built "on this rock", which is living; "the Son of the living God". Now we are said to have come to the *city* of the living God. This comes about, as I apprehend, through the testimony of the twelve; it is involved in the confession by Peter, but we have an additional thought in @Hebrews 12, namely, that we have come to the *heavenly* Jerusalem, "the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem", and this latter, I believe, is Paul's feature.
I might remark here that the Father; that is, God, acting *sovereignly* is, as I said, an immense thing for us, because it is a question of what He does at any particular moment. We read in the Old Testament that He lays "for foundation in Zion, a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation", (@Isaiah 28:16) but where is He laying His foundation now? It is for us to know, dear brethren, where He lays it, or rather, where He has laid it. It is quite clear that it is not now in Zion literally; it is laid in the souls of His people. According to His sovereign election He lays it, and so, in bringing in this fresh thought; that is, the Son of God, the Person revealed in Paul, we have suggested the dignity and liberty that belong to sonship. In the letter to the Galatians the apostle develops sonship from that point of view, not as a foundation exactly, but as that which occasions liberty in the souls of God's people, so that whilst the testimony is living,
{16}
it is also in liberty. It is dignified as being the heavenly Jerusalem; that is Paul's feature. "Jesus is the Son of God", he says; that is the first preaching by Paul, according to the scriptural record.
Now I come to his commission, in order to get some little light on how matters stood as he began his ministry, and I selected @Acts 26, because it is one of his own accounts of the occurrence. Chapter 9 is the account given by the Spirit, whereas the two other records are Paul's own accounts. On this occasion he is before king Agrippa, and it is quite evident that the apostle is moved in his soul in speaking of it. I mention that, not to occupy you much with it, but one does think of the importance of being moved in our souls. As the truth develops in us we become habituated to soul movement, and, as I might say, soul emotion. Let us not be without spiritual emotions Godward! Let us not be without true holy emotions as we dwell on the magnitude of the truth! The apostle here seems to be moved; he says, "At midday, on the way, I saw, O king, a light above the brightness of the sun shining from heaven round about me". His heart was affected as he goes on to speak of the light and what it was. Things seemed to have become enhanced in his soul. May God grant that the truth may thus affect us, for, as you will notice, he speaks here of the light in stronger terms than it is spoken of in the earlier record.
Now, passing on to the Lord's commission, He says, "I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister". To Ananias He had said that He would show Saul how much he must suffer for Him, but He does not say that to Saul himself, but "To make thee a minister [that is, an 'official servant'] and a witness". In chapter 9:6 he is told to "arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do". I want to dwell for a
{17}
moment on that, so that we might have before us the exact position. He is appointed a minister and he magnified his office; it was not that the office magnified him. If any one has any little bit to do for the Lord now, the thing is to magnify it, to magnify the service, so that it be not regarded as a common thing. We are apt to look at the things of God as common, as ordinary; they are not ordinary.
Now, Paul is a minister, and what I want to point out is that his ministry consisted of two parts; in fact there are two ministries, and they are definitely distinct, and this is indicated here, I believe, in what the Lord says, "both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee", including, I apprehend, the truth of the gospel and the great truth of the mystery. I would remark here that the ministry of the gospel (@Colossians 1:13) had reference to the bringing in of what God is in Christ to men; so he says, which "was preached to every creature which is under heaven"; a statement which shows that the whole creation was in view in the gospel testimony. Then he goes on to speak of the mystery, I am referring to @Colossians 1:24 - 27, and to say that he was a minister of it. The line he took in that service was not bringing God to men, but bringing *men to God*; hence he speaks of the mystery as "Christ in you [Gentiles], the hope of glory, whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect *in Christ Jesus*". What a marvellous conception Paul had of the bearing of his ministry; it was "to present every man perfect in Christ". It is not that I would seek to occupy you merely with the facts relating to Paul, but that we might see what it is to be in "his company", so to speak, to be thoroughly acquainted with his doctrine and the manner of his service, for
{18}
I apprehend that our position in these last days depends on cleaving to what is presented to us in him; so he says, "To present every man perfect in Christ". (@Colossians 1:28)
Now I would commend that to all who seek to serve, for the service is to go on. God has brought about changes in the world to a degree undreamt of by us perhaps, and yet the Scriptures indicate it. He has done it, and it is not in relation to a testimony to come, for He is acting in relation to the testimony that is *now*. That is what God is doing. Let us not be carried too far. God is acting for us at the present time, and He has moved and brought things to pass; He has weakened the world, in order that His people might come out of Babylon and be brought together as in Christ; that is the ministry of the assembly, but the ministry of the gospel stands also. I am persuaded that God would address Himself to every man today as at the beginning. These two ministries remain in the blessed light they afford us, and it is for every one who ministers to know how ministry was carried on at the beginning. On the one hand there is to be the communication of light, the shedding forth of light, in order that the elect might be brought in, might be saved; and on the other hand, the saints, the assembly, have to be awakened and separated, so as to be in the good of "perfect in Christ Jesus".
And now, dear brethren, let us think for a moment of perfection. Let us not drop to the level of the flesh or of mere mentality in looking at the things of God. The apostle had nothing less than perfection in his mind, and do you think the Lord has anything lower than that in His mind today? What I would say is that Christianity is full measure. Take the way John presents the truth of the Holy Spirit; he says, "God gives not the Spirit by measure", chapter 3:34. Think of that marvellous statement as

marking the present time! Then in chapter 4 the Lord says to the woman, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water". (verse 10). And then He says, "But the water that I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life". (verse 14) Is not that full measure? There are no limitations there, dear brethren. Think of the possibilities there are in the Spirit. Then in chapter 7 the effect publicly towards men is commensurate with this, that is, "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water". (verse 38) Think of that, think of the fulness of the measure of Christianity! Let us not lower the standard; let us have it before us. It is God's way of presenting the truth. He does not say 'ought to flow' but "shall flow". It is the full measure of Christianity, and that is what God is working up to, nothing less than that, and it is for us to have that in view, as the apostle had it in his service, "to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus". (@Colossians 1:28).
I would now just appeal to all as regards the company, the Pauline company, as I may call it, or in the language of Scripture, "Paul and his company". Is there anyone here who has separated from him and his company? Many, alas! have done it, and I would repeat that the great point for us to see is that there should be recovery. The Spirit of Christ is on that line, and so we get, "he that converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins". (@James 5:20) A great service that! And this leads me to remark for a moment on the principle of limitation. God in His judicial ways deals on that principle; sometimes in mercy and at other times in direct judgment. The lake of fire is a limiting principle, but it is limitation under wrath; hence there is no escape
{20}
from it, no outlet. But there are limitations in which there is an outlet, that is to say, limitations of mercy. What God did at Babel was a limitation, but it was a limitation of mercy in which there was an avenue left open for God to approach the nations, which He did in Christ, and an avenue open for men to return to God through Christ. Thank God! So God may limit any of us, but His present limitations are the limitations of mercy in order that we may find the way back; for if I am not in Paul's company, so to speak, or in the company of the Lord Jesus, in the happy fellowship of God's people, it is a mercy for me to be limited, so we have in the New Testament the principle of binding and loosing. Thank God for loosing, but the binding is equally valuable, for the binding is a mercy if it lead to self-judgment and recovery.
I am not speaking of what is official, but of a principle that should govern us in the house of God. Those who follow the ways of God will know that He continually acts on this principle, and the saints should be in accord with Him in it. We may be slow to exercise the loosing principle, as Peter was. The Lord gave him the keys of the kingdom, saying, "whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven", (@Matthew 18:18) but he was very slow to use them; but the Lord leads him to it. The sheet was let down in order to impress Peter with the importance of loosing, because the loosing would involve a wonderful thing, the going up to heaven and coming down from heaven. It opened up an immense area spiritually. If I am bound, I am limited in the enjoyment of the truth, but if I am loosed, I am introduced into the full scope of Christianity, and what is that? It is that which is eternal in character, for Christianity has no limit. It is like the feast of Pentecost, without any *time* limitation.
{21}
Thank God! It is the dispensation of the Spirit in that sense, and He links us up with that which is eternal. What a blessed thing to be loosed, but how solemn to be bound, even though it be by the mercy and judicial discipline of God.
May the Lord bless the word.

THE ONE MAN AND THE COMPANY
@Isaiah 3:1 - 3; 4:1; @Zechariah 8:23
God allows things to happen in the circumstances of His people and of man generally to turn men to Himself. All the happenings in the world are intended to turn men to God. @Isaiah 3 refers to this. God had in discipline removed the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water, and the mighty man and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, so that all might see that they were not to rely on men. That which we should naturally lean on is taken away; food and great men are removed; this clears the ground for chapter 4. In the sense of their need, those in want and reproach lay hold of one man: one man instead of many men. There is a sense of reproach; they say, "Let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach". Is there anyone here who, not knowing the Lord Jesus, is in need of Him?
The woman spoken of in @John 4 was in this state. She was under reproach; she had to come out to the well at a time when others did not come, but she met the *one Man*. She found One who could supply her with everything she needed spiritually; and not only that, but He could tell her what was in her heart. He says to her, "Thou hast had five husbands"; but in spite of this fact she had to draw water for herself. There was evidently no man to provide for her, nor could any take away her reproach. Being alone, and in reproach, she finds the Lord, and she speaks of Him as One who told her all things that ever she did; she has found the one Man.
This one Man is the only hope, not only for each of us, but for the whole world. The world is looking out today for a leader; conditions that have arisen have brought into evidence that governments are
{23}
unable to control the world, and when the man who is spoken of as the antichrist appears, he will be received. The only hope now for man is to accept Christ, who is presented in the gospel as the One who has effectuated the righteousness of God, and who gives the Holy Spirit. Moreover, God has appointed a day in which He will judge the world by this Man; but He is now presented to individuals. He is presented not only to be our Lord, that is to subdue us and to protect us, but to be our Head. The Head gives us wisdom. In this world, where Satan's power is, man needs protection, and he gets protection in the Lord. You lift up your head in the knowledge that Christ is in heaven and exercises all power on earth. But then you not only need forgiveness and the Spirit, which you get from the Lord, but you need a Head. Christ is my Head, He enlightens me and shows me the way out of the world. I am known here by His name. They say, "We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name".
How one's position is altered before men! Instead of being known according to what one has been, one is known by Christ's name. The woman of Sychar would henceforth spiritually be known as, related to Christ, as having Christ as Head. He not only tells me all things that ever I did, but He tells me all things that ever I should do henceforth. Henceforth, as a believer in Christ, I am to be called by His name and to be guided by Him. As unconverted men or women in this world we were spiritually under reproach; that is, as seen by heaven, and we need to have our reproach taken away. We must accept the fact that each individual has sinned "I have sinned". On the day of Pentecost, when Peter preached, they said, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" He replied, "Repent, and be baptised each one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
{24}
remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit". (@Acts 2:38) In that way one's reproach is taken away spiritually. Henceforth the believer lifts up his head with the helmet of salvation on it, as knowing the Lord, and His name is called upon him. He is told in Romans to put on the Lord Jesus Christ.
When we come to Zechariah, it is not seven women that are spoken of, but ten men. The thought of women is weakness, and the need of support. A man is, in a way, self-supporting. The allusion is to a believer who has come to recognise that he has the Spirit. Zechariah would refer to the believer as needing society or company, fellowship. Hence he takes hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew. A Jew is described in @Romans 2:28,29. As Christians we seek such men. I would ask the young people here as to what society they seek. The Jew here is one whose praise is of God, and who is circumcised in heart. Naturally speaking, young people like the society of those that are highly esteemed among men, whereas truly exercised young or old person seeks the society of those who are in favour with God. The ten men come out of all languages of the nations, we read. We see here prophetically that when God works among the nations in the future, in regard of Jerusalem, they come out of all the nations. National distinction shall disappear in that day; that is to say, there will be a recognition of Christ and the people of God.
Now this has its answer today in the house of God. The house of God is not a national, but a universal idea. It is what is called catholic; it is composed of those who have the Holy Spirit, whose praise is of God and not of men. I would again ask in regard of the young people: have those present any exercise as to finding the house of God? One thing that marks the house of God is that God dwells there. Here they say, "We will go with
{25}
you: for we have heard that God is with you". God is dwelling in the house by the Spirit. Now it will be noticed that these ten men lay hold of the skirt. Sometimes young believers like to be noticed and cared for. They should of course be taken care of by the elder ones; but do they take hold of the skirts of the elder Christians? That means that I act. I am not seeking for others to act for me I am acting for myself. There is no likelihood that this Jew referred to would resent his skirt being laid hold of. When the Lord was here, the woman with the issue of blood touched His garment. He did not resent being touched; He knew, however, that He was touched. He knew that virtue had gone out of Him, but He did not resent it. On the contrary, He said, "Daughter be of good comfort". The virtue that went out of Him healed her, and she was called a daughter. How blessed it is to know that the Lord accords to us a relationship of this kind! He said to her, "Thy faith hath made thee whole" (Luke 8:48). It was faith that led her to touch the hem of His garment. The Jew referred to here would have a character like Christ. So he does not resent his skirt being laid hold of; yea, rather, a true Jew or a true Christian loves to have others draw near to him in this way. It is wisdom for the young to keep near the Lord's people. They find love and care there.
@Isaiah 4 shows how a sinner's reproach is taken away and he has a Head in Christ, to whom indeed in @Romans 7 he is said to be married. In @2 Corinthians 11:2 it is said that we are espoused to one Man, to be presented a chaste virgin to Christ. Therefore the believer is henceforth in relation with one and that Man is Christ in heaven. He is also in relation with the people of God down here. We read in Acts that the Lord added daily such as should be saved. Here, however, the believers seek out those who know the name of the Lord and know where
{26}
the Lord is. Ruth said to Naomi, "Thy people shall be my people", (@Ruth 1:16) and they say here, "God is with you". That is the normal result of the gospel being received into the soul; we want to be where God is, and God is with those that are true Jews, who are circumcised in heart, and whose praise is of God. Paul said, "We are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God ... ... and have no confidence in the flesh". (@Philippians 3:3) We learn from that verse who the true Jews, the circumcision, are.
May God bless the word to us.
{27}
SYMPATHY WITH THE MIND OF GOD AS TO HIS TESTIMONY
Summary of Reading
@Jonah 1 and 2
This book helps us to see that God was not limited to Israel in Old Testament times, and we see here the way God educates His servants in order that they may be sympathetic with His mind at any moment. God turns Jonah's self-will to account, and disciplines him, so that in result he goes to Nineveh as having passed through this peculiar experience. The book shows that he fell short in his sympathies with God, yet ultimately he went to Nineveh as a man who had been through death in figure.
The apostle had to tell the Jews that salvation was sent to the Gentiles and they would hear; (@Acts 28:28). It comes to us through the true Jonah, the One who is in entire sympathy with God, who came preaching the glad tidings of peace to those who are near and to those who are far off. In such an One the gospel testimony has been presented to us.
The book gives us the foreshadowing of the gospel coming to the Gentiles through Christ. It is only a shadow, of course. Christ was the perfect Preacher. There are three great preachers in the Old Testament, Solomon, Nebuchadnezzar, and Jonah. Nebuchadnezzar preached to all his realm after his wonderful experience under the discipline of God. See @Daniel 4:1. "Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you". Then he proceeds to outline what had happened to him and in the last verse says, "those that walk in pride he [God] is able to abase". It is a wonderful message to send to all the inhabitants of the world by one who had been through things with God. A preacher *is* one who
{28}
has gone through things with God. This is necessary if God is to be presented rightly. How much the great apostle of the Gentiles suffered in order that the compassions of God in relation to all men might be developed in his soul! The word says, "I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake", (@Acts 9:16).
When we extend the thought to Christ, what a sense we get of what He has gone through, as, after all, He is the anointed Preacher, and the principle that comes out in Solomon is that the preacher is king. It is not that the king is preacher, but the preacher is king. Solomon is the outstanding preacher of the Old Testament, he is called such. One who is king has access to all, has right of way. The book of Acts shows how the king has acquired right of way. Satan aimed at the twelve, and in connection with the persecution by Saul, the enemy made a great attempt to blot out the testimony. But the Lord came in as King, meeting Saul and breaking him down as he went out of Jerusalem accredited by the high priest with authority to imprison all whom he found "of this way", as it says in @Acts 9: 2. The Lord came in in authority and subdued Saul, so that instead of his being any longer an opposer, he is employed by the King to preach. We can reckon on the Lord in heaven making a way for the preaching. This is seen here in principle in the way God uses the elements, such as the raging of the sea; all is to the end that the preacher may go to Nineveh.
So one is able to lift up one's head in the sense that the Lord is making way for us. "No one shall set on thee to hurt thee", He said to the apostle in @Acts 18:10. God saw to that; He guarded His servant. In @Acts 16 we read that Paul and Silas attempted to go to Bithynia, but "the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not". They must go *this* way, to Macedonia. "Assuredly gathering", they say
{29}
"that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them"; so that everything works for the accomplishment of the *Lord's* will.
It is remarkable that Jonah complains. We read of another who went down to Joppa, Simon Peter, and who had to be called away in view of preaching to the Gentiles; and we see the same principle that comes out here in the course God took to bring him into sympathy with His own outlook. It is noticeable that while God uses the Jewish apostles there is not the same sympathy seen in them with the work of God as in Paul. Things were in Jonah's favour, too. It is remarkable the sympathy the boatmen had with him. They tried to row to the shore, but God's power was greater than their oars. He would see to it that His servant should go back. It is wonderful that it should pleased God to take up such as Jonah. He could have sent one of the angels, and the message would have been carried at once, but it must be by Jonah.
We were noticing last night in @Nehemiah 9 how the priests and Levites speak to Jehovah, and address Him as "Thou art he", or "the Same". He had called Himself "I am" in committing Himself to them. He told Moses to tell Israel that He was "I am", the existing One, and in Nehemiah they respond, saying, "Thou art he". They had proved He was what He said He was. It is a God whom you have learned and proved that you present to others. Jonah had a great opportunity, because he had proved God in this wonderful way. He had been kept alive in the fish, and brought to land, and thus learned that "Salvation is of the Lord", (@Psalm 3:8). So it was for him now to present this. He would preach what was in his heart. So the power of God operates in you experimentally, before you can use it in service. Paul refers to himself as a vessel of mercy, the chief of sinners. And we are said to be
{30}
vessels of mercy. We present what is in our hearts. Paul said to the elders of Ephesus, "I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God", (@Acts 20:27). He kept back nothing. Obviously Jonah kept back a good deal, but God would not be thwarted. "And should not I spare Nineveh", He says, "that great city, wherein are more than six score thousand persons". Jonah should have thought of them, "and also much cattle". Jonah should have thought of the cattle. God had given him an opportunity of being sympathetic with all.
I suppose in coming to the point of paying his vow Jonah recognised he belonged to Jehovah, and would now yield himself to Jehovah; he would not allow his will to carry him away. It is like @Romans 12:1, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable [or intelligent] service". "Intelligent" would refer to what you have gone through. Christians do not make vows in detail, but you get the *spirit* of a vow in Christianity. The paying of a vow is very important. It is a question of whose I am. Am I wholly for God?
Jonah accepts the obvious judgment of God on him. The men would have rowed him to shore, but the waves were against him, and Jehovah knew that. God comes in when Jonah accepts this. No one is any good until he reaches this point; the judgment of God is accepted. What we see here is the righteous judgment of God on a man pursuing his own will; he must be cast into the sea; but when judgment is accepted, God comes in for him. When in a stormy sea it is well to come to it that God has a point to be reached, and the moment that is arrived at God comes in. The storm will arise and the waves beat until the judgment of God is accepted, and then it comes to light how God has
{31}
been working to preserve the man. But primarily his will has to be broken. "Now the Lord had prepared a great fish", the word says, "to swallow up Jonah". What stupidity of infidels to say that the throat of the fish could not hold Jonah! If God prepared the fish, he would take care of the size of its throat.
God is in supreme control. He would bring up this wonderful product from the depths of the sea. Did the sea ever send out such a product before? Never! Think of the sea giving up such a person, a man who could speak as he did, a *living* man who could praise God. "My prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple", Jonah says, and adds, "I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed". The temple is before him. The Psalms, and this is one, give the great result for God, they are the outgoings of the heart of a man who knew God. Jonah thinks of the temple and of sacrifice to God. So in @Acts 16 the prison is turned into a temple; the fish's belly is turned into that here. Priestly exercises went on there. Jonah thought of God, and prayed to Him, and came to it that "Salvation is of Jehovah". All this went on, and then it says, "The Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land".
One is reminded of Christ, Jonah's great Antitype, where He speaks of God inhabiting the praises of Israel; (@Psalm 22:3). From the depths of death He considered for God in His holy temple. What marks a priest, however dark the situation for him circumstantially, is consideration for God; and God's answer to that is that He *must* bring that kind of man out of death, for He needs him here in the testimony; hence when we think of Christ, all the affections that clustered around Him as Man were
{32}
operative in raising Him. He was raised by the Father's glory. He speaks only to God, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" but He goes on, "Thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel". That was God's place There is no complaint, but priestly concern for God Then, after all is accomplished, He can say, "Father into thy hands I commend my spirit". (@Luke 23:46) Earlier He had said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do". (verse 34) A priestly spirit is manifest all through His sufferings. The whole system of praise was present to His heart at that moment. In resurrection He brings in the assembly, not only that He inhabits the praises of Israel, but the assembly is introduced. We should not be satisfied with being preachers merely.
Let us be priests first. As to our order we are already priests, but am I a priest by intelligence? The Lord left a company of priests in the temple before He sent them forth as preachers. A stormy scene helps us; it is not against us; it is part of our education. There seemed no hope for Jonah, but God prepared a fish. *Swallowing up* is a very humiliating process. The ark of gopher wood which Noah made suggests dignity. Noah is in charge, and he goes in, then the others follow, but here the experience is most humiliating. Of Christ Himself it was said, "he was crucified through weakness", (@2 Corinthians 13:4). He was three days and three nights "in the heart of the earth", (Matthew 12:40). What a solemn side this presents. The fish swallowed up Jonah. How admirably fitted this creature was to bring about the experience necessary for Jonah! "Out of the belly of hell cried I", he says. It refers to the grave, I suppose. Then he goes on to describe his experiences. "Thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas ... ... all thy billows and thy waves passed over me", verse. 3. The waves of the 
{33}
Mediterranean were God's waves, showing how creation is utilised by God for His discipline.
With a priestly spirit there is discrimination as to each feature of suffering. It is seen here in Jonah, and when we think of the Lord, everything was felt by Him intensely and perfectly.
The second message tells Jonah again to go to Nineveh. It would seem as if God said, 'Now Jonah, I have not changed my mind', and the use of the word *preaching* in chapter 3:2 would suggest something. God assumes now that Jonah is fitted so that there can be preaching. We are not told what it was to be; we only know what he said. With Christ everything was told out.
{34}
HOW WE ARE EDUCATED TO HAVE SYMPATHY WITH GOD IN THE GOSPEL
@Luke 13:35; 14:1 - 23; 15:22 - 32
I want to say a word about the house of God as it is presented to us in the gospel of Luke. Luke has his own way of presenting the truth, as specially fitted of the Lord, and he invariably presents it as in relation to the gospel; that is, he presents the subject in relation to the service of the Lord Jesus Christ as the anointed One, according to chapter 4, for the presentation of the gospel. He writes, as he tells us, "with method", which is an important feature in ministry. He says, "it has seemed good to me ... . to write to thee with method, most excellent Theophilus, that thou mightest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed". (@Luke 1:3,4) He brings in households and opens up to us the conditions that existed in these households.
John, on the other hand, treats more of the family; he is concerned with the derivation of the saints; that is, they are God's children; not so much their public history, what they had been, but their origin, and how they were being educated by the Lord for their place in the Father's house, which He had gone to prepare. So John says the son abides in the house for ever; he has an eternal thought in mind, whereas Luke is concerned with what is provisional as connected with and supporting the gospel testimony during the period known or spoken of by the Lord and also by the prophet as "the acceptable year of the Lord". Luke, therefore, as I said, deals with households or houses, in which the various heads were responsible, having in view that they should have a part in God's house; in other words, whether it be a parent or child, the thing in view with each
{35}
of us in household culture and nurture is that we should have part in the house of God as it is set up here provisionally in relation to the gospel.
So in @Luke 4 we read, that the Lord enters into Simon's house, a man who was afterwards to have a very great place in the house of God, and the Lord finds Simon's wife's mother sick of a fever. He, standing over her, rebukes the fever. He did not rebuke her, because He was dealing in grace; He rebuked the fever; He would relieve her. The fever left her, and then He took her by the hand and raised her up, with the result that she served them, not only *Him*, but *them*. Now this is an item of importance, and as one might say, the first item of education in view of what the evangelist has in his mind. We have to learn to be free of the fever, whatever that may be in each case. It is a common malady spiritually, and we have to be free of it in order to *serve*; in fact we cannot serve if we are not free, for we have to be *served*. Thank God there are those who are free of it to serve those who are not, but His thought is that the house should be free of feverish, irritable, complaining persons.
Then in chapter 5 a man who is a paralytic is brought to the Lord; he needed to be served; he was not exactly irritable, but burdensome. He was brought to the Lord by sympathetic persons who cared for him. Luke does not tell us the number of men, it simply says, "men brought in"; but Mark says, that there were four. It says he was carried on his "little couch", for that is how it should read. It is a suggestive thought, there was a certain advantage in this man's case in regard to those who had to do with him, the couch was "little"; and the Lord in answering the thoughts and reasonings of His enemies says to the paralytic, "Arise, take up thy little couch and go into thy house". The Lord did not rebuke the palsy, neither did He stand over
{36}
the man, nor did He take his hand; for here it is a question of His authority, the authority of His word, the word of Christ.
As I remarked, the advantage of the little couch is obvious; he was evidently a little man, his circumstances were little, and of course, that has a spiritual meaning. It is dangerous to be big; even as unconverted, a great man is at a great disadvantage, and certainly a man should not be bigger or greater after conversion than before. It is not the Lord's intention that His people should spread out like trees in the world; His thought is rather that His people should be reduced in an external way; certainly if they are being educated to have part in the house of God, it is of all moment that they should accept that littleness is the divine thought; not littleness, surely, in a spiritual way; that is another matter, but littleness in regard of human circumstances; there is a great advantage in it. Og, king of Bashan, was a big man and had a very large bed (@Deuteronomy 3:11); but this man in Luke must have been a little man, for he had a little bed, suggestive of the fact that he was a man of little circumstances and no doubt for that reason, he came in for more sympathy in his soul's needs; for he is a type of condition of soul.
Then, later in the chapter Levi, who is no doubt the counterpart of the man with the little couch, invited the Lord into his house. He was evidently a man of riches, a man of means; but being the counterpart of the man with the little couch, he was not big in his own apprehension. He did not regard his means as adding to him in any wise; they never add to us; on the contrary, the tendency is for them to detract from a person spiritually unless he holds them in regard of Christ, as a steward and a good steward. Unless he holds them in that light, the tendency would be to detract from him spiritually. So Levi makes a great entertainment for Christ in
{37}
his house, and the kind of people that the Lord would desire to have, from Luke's point of view, were in the house, "a great crowd of tax gatherers and others". I am referring to that in a moral way, so that we might see how Luke would lead us on in our education, in order that we might have part in the house of God. We shall all have part in the Father's house; God will have us there; the Lord has gone to prepare a place there; but I am speaking for the moment of the house in its provisional aspect in relation to the gospel.
I am somewhat afraid, dear brethren, that we are forgetting the gospel. I believe it is the divine thought that an evangelistic spirit should be found with the people of God at the end. I say that advisedly. I believe God will bring that about, not only an assembly state in regard of Christ, but an evangelical sympathy in sentiment and feeling. Luke speaks of the year, "*the acceptable year*"; mark it is not only what was preached in the year, but that the year itself was preached. He says, "*to preach* the acceptable year of the Lord", as if it were glad tidings that there should be a long period of grace called "the acceptable year". That should be kept in mind; we are near the end of it, but it still remains, and the point is that there should be that spirit of evangelisation until all the elect shall be saved. I believe God will bring that about, and Luke has it in view.
So Levi makes a great entertainment for Christ and then he had the kind of guests in his house that the Lord would appreciate; not his rich neighbours or relatives, those who could repay him, but he gets together the kind of people that the Lord desired; there was a company of publicans and sinners there. This drew out a certain opposition and criticism, for we read, "But their scribes and Pharisees murmured", but Jesus said, "I came not to call the righteous
{38}
but sinners to repentance". Levi anticipated, or understood, the point of view, that it was the acceptable year, and the feast was in accord with it. He entertained Christ in that relation; it was not exactly a family affair, that is more John's side. Levi entertained the Lord in a manner in keeping with the acceptable year which had begun.
I have mentioned these three incidents of houses that we might have them before us as indicative of the educational line which Luke has before him in his gospel, to prepare householders for the house of God. Matthew speaks of the householder; he says that a scribe instructed into the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, who brings out of his treasure things new and things old; that is Matthew's point of view You can understand how Matthew would bring in the old things, the testimony of Moses and the prophets; the householder must have them in his treasury; the old things are there, not in the sense of cast-off things that are threadbare, but as antiques, things of value. There are such things in Scripture, and we must be on our guard not to discard the things of the Old Testament. They are kept in the treasury of every scribe instructed into the kingdom of heaven, and he brings them forth as he has opportunity; he delights in the antiques as one might say, but he brings in the new first; the things in the New Testament are brought in and developed, but he does not forget the old: he calls attention to the old things, how they all point to Christ. There are old things and new things, and they both go together, they belong to the treasures of the scribe who is instructed into the kingdom of heaven. That indicates Matthew's point of view. He is concerned about Christ as the Heir of David, and necessarily, all things that come down, as one might say reverently; the things are handed down that belong to the family and should be treasured
{39}
in the household, from Matthew's standpoint. But Luke is concerned about the sympathy, the evangelical sympathy, of the people of God.
Now there is another feature in chapter 10 as to Mary and the house of Martha, in Bethany. It says that Martha received the Lord into her house; the Spirit of God says that; she had the house and she had extended hospitality, genuine hospitality. Now we may be hospitable and yet not teachable. We have to acquire the habit of being taught of the Lord in our houses. Hospitality is spoken of in Scripture and valued in Scripture, but teachability is more important than hospitality. The Lord will teach us, and so it says, "Mary having sat down at the feet of Jesus, was listening to his word". That is how it should read. What a character she was! He was speaking, and whatever He said she listened to it; that is the true disciple; she was truly teachable, simply listening to whatever Christ had to say. Do you know anything about listening to Him? He is very varied in what He says. Whatever He said, Mary listened to it, but Martha did not. Martha owned the house; she extended hospitality and received Him into the house, and not only so, she served, she did the work; but one thing was needful and that was teachability. If we are not teachable, subject to Christ, receiving His word, all else will fail; so the Lord puts that right, so far as His word went; He said, "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things, but there is need of one and Mary has chosen the good part". He had the house of God in view, and the one thing that He spoke about was essential in the house of God, that is, to listen. Martha might be hospitable and active in her house, but in the house of God where would she be? She was not listening, she was occupied with the cares and things of her house.
The position in the house of God is, that the
{40}
Spirit speaks there, and Christ speaks in the house. If we have not learned to listen, it is quite evident that we have missed the gain of what is going on; and hence the great advantage and gain of acquiring the habit in our houses of listening to the Lord and being taught of Him, of becoming teachable. Well, Luke presents all these things, as I have said, in view of the house of God.
Now I come to chapter 13. The Lord says to the Jews, "Your house is left unto you". The word *desolate* in the authorised version should not be in the passage. We are now dealing with what had taken place in the house of God. "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!" And then He adds, "Behold, your house is left unto you". Now, dear brethren, how do we stand in relation to our local company? Is it your company, or is it God's company? Is it God's house? If it is yours, if you regard it in that light in any way, if you rule there, and your influence there, your example there, has in view that it is yours in any sense, then you are in danger of it being left to *you*. I suppose we might say Christendom sets before us a solemn example of it; what once had the name and the reality of being God's house is left unto them. They have arrogated it to themselves. Now *God* says, It is yours. God is not there, and it is all out of order if God is not there. "Behold! your house is left unto you, and I say unto you that ye shall not see me until it come that ye say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord". The Lord says a very solemn thing, that they are not to see Him until they shall say, "Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord". They will have to come back to divine authority,
{41}
divine order, for apart from these things they will not see Him.
Then the Lord proceeds to show how we are to be in the house of God. He begins by finding, in the house He was invited to, a man who had the dropsy, whatever that may be spiritually. It was some disease, and shows, that that which might have been helpful to the man, has, through some abnormal formation, rendered him inflated in the house. This man who might have been helpful to himself and to others is rendered an invalid in the house; but the Lord heals the dropsical man, and that is grace. We can reckon on the healing of the Lord; and I do not know of anything that is more encouraging, in having to do with the house of God, than this; where one is exposed to disease and will is not at work we can reckon on divine healing, the healing of the Lord. How could we go on without this? Where should we be? But the Lord comes in and touches this brother and that brother, and this sister and that sister; apart from this we could not walk together, but we can reckon on the Lord putting us right and keeping us right.
Then He goes on to note how certain ones chose the chief rooms. He says, so to speak, I have healed that man, but here is the certain road to disease. Should we not be wise and take the road that will save us from it? The Lord marked those who chose the first places, those who sought a place in the house of God, and, in His own way, while exposing the working of the flesh, He shows the wisdom of taking the lowest place. He says, You are placing your host at a great disadvantage. Why should I place my brethren in the position of humbling me? If they do not, the Lord will; it may take days, or months, or years, but he will do it; for He is over the house of God and nothing escapes His notice. Then He says, You will have honour in the presence
{42}
of the guests if you are only humble enough for it. The Lord has more pleasure in honouring a brother than in humbling him. "He lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes"; (@1 Samuel 2:8) that is His way. If we have to do with the house of God, we must be humble and take the lowest room. The house belongs to Christ and all the rooms in it are His. He must have *His* way, and He gives each of us our position according to His wisdom. He has His own prerogatives, and He gives each servant according to His sovereign will.
Then He says, If you invite, do not invite your rich neighbours. That is, you are not to do things for recompense in the house of God. The world in the very principle of it never does anything except in view of recompense -- a return; this is what marks the flesh. What the Lord enunciates here is that you are not to have that in mind at all; what you are to have before you is to reflect what God is, and what He has in mind, that is to say, the gates of Zion; "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob". (@Psalm 87:2) He is interested in every one of us. He loves the gates of Zion; that is really the assembly. It is the sovereignty of God. He administers according to His sovereign love and bounty; and so He loveth the cheerful giver, for such a one is in accord with the gates of Zion. So in making an entertainment you are not to have recompense in mind; you want to satisfy the love of your heart; you do not discriminate against the poor in favour of the rich, as the Corinthians were doing, but you invite those who cannot repay you, you act in love and grace. To such the Lord says, "Thou shalt be blessed and it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the just". You will have it then.
Then one of them that sat at meat with Him said, "Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom
{43}
of God". The man had taken note of what the Lord said, and he says in effect, I would like to eat bread in the kingdom of God, where things are regulated according to God. One has seen queues of people (especially on the Continent) waiting for bread and other necessaries to be doled out to them, but that is not like the kingdom of God; the kingdom of God is different from that. God says, "I will abundantly bless her provision, I will satisfy her poor with bread". (@Psalm 132:15) How the heart looks on to the time when this very earth shall be marked by that instead of the scanty provision! Not that one would say anything against the effort to secure just distribution, one is thankful for it; but I am only contrasting it with the kingdom of God. I suppose we as Christians can testify to what it would be to eat bread in the kingdom of God, the order of things which God administers, for as in it one feels that one is nourished by God Himself, "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning". (@James 1:17) He feeds us bountifully; it is all according to divine order. So the Lord, when feeding the multitude, made them sit down, and then He blessed the bread, then broke it, and they were all abundantly satisfied, and there were twelve baskets over. I only speak of the kingdom of God as it is put here.
Then in @Luke 14 the Lord opened up the parable of the Supper, which is so well known to many of us here. He says, "A certain man made a great supper and bade many". He uses the suggestion of a listener to bring out something that was greater than the kingdom; that is, God's celebration in His house of the death and resurrection of Christ. He shows, in the parable, God's delight in the work of redemption, in the accomplishment of righteousness. He would have all to have part in it. He first sends an invitation, and those invited refuse to come. Then He urges
{44}
some from the streets and lanes of the city to come in, and compels others. One would dwell on the means that God uses to compel souls to come into the house; He says, "Compel them to come in". That is how God looks at things; He never raises a doubt; He never raises a question of the possibility of their refusing. Those who were bidden refused, but with the other two classes the thought of refusing is never hinted at. God has His own way in bringing souls in.
I suppose everyone here can testify to the compelling grace of God in taking us out of the wretchedness in which we were and placing us in His house; not that we are in the house in that wretchedness. Other scriptures teach us how we are there; indeed, chapter 15 shows us how we are to be there; we are to be there in the best robe. The best robe is not presented as fitting us for heaven; it is a question of our place here, for the elder brother hears the music and the dancing. The house must be filled, and it will be filled with those whom God compels into it. Remember, all the education that went before is in view of the house, all these people who have been compelled to come in are not there without education, God sees to that. The point of view is grace; how the house will be filled, and how, as filled, it expresses the grace of God during this acceptable time.
Now just a word about the robe. When you come to the returning prodigal you get the word "Bring forth the best robe". It does not say from where the robe is brought forth; and although the best robe and the shoes and the ring were put on the prodigal, we are not told that he was brought into the house. In chapter 14 they were compelled to come *in*, but in chapter 15, the Lord does not say that the prodigal was brought in, the reason being that he himself was part of the house. In his not
{45}
being brought in, I apprehend the point that the Spirit has in mind is that as clothed in the best robe and shod and ringed we form part *of* the house; it is the dignity of it in chapter 15. The people who are there show us what the house is. Then following upon that we have the music and the dancing and merriment; and the elder brother comes up and hears the music and dancing.
The place that music and dancing have in relation to Christianity and the grace of God is very striking. In @Psalm 87 we read: "As well the singers as the dancers say, all my springs are in thee", that is, in Zion. They do not draw anything at all from the world, they owe nothing to the flesh; they draw everything from that blessed city called Zion. "All my springs are in thee". I think in that way we have the constitution of the house. By the presence of the Holy Spirit, and all that is involved in that presence, we learn the meaning of merriment. What incomparable holy emotions are felt in the house of God! Thus we are led on and up to it according to the lines indicated in Luke, and we learn to value those holy emotions, which have touched the spiritual chords of our hearts. The Holy Spirit produces the music and the dancing in the presence of God, whose delight is in those He has brought there, for they are there all according to Christ.
I do not add more; that is the line I had before me, and I hope it is plain to each of us that God would have us in His house in full sympathy with Himself in regard to the gospel testimony.
{46}
GOD STANDING ON THE ALTAR
@Amos 9:1 - 6
What is specially in my mind is the position in which the Lord is seen in this chapter; He is "standing upon the altar". One could speak of many positions in which the Lord is seen, using the term *Lord* for the moment as referring to Christ. He is seen at the right hand of God; He is seen walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks in Revelation; and Isaiah says, "In the year of the death of King Uzziah, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple", (@Isaiah 6:1). But here He is standing upon the altar. The Lord Jesus was upon the altar in another attitude; it touches the believer to connect Him with the altar. There are several altars spoken of in Scripture; one of the most interesting being in @Genesis 22, where Christ is seen figuratively bound to it. The ram caught in the thicket by its horns, being offered up, is the complete thought typically of Christ's sacrificial death.
There was nothing feigned about Jesus; however you view Him, everything is real, especially Gethsemane and the cross. Our sins were there, but He went forward; He bare our sins, we are told, in *His own body*, (@1 Peter 2:24). He *has* done many things through others, and He *is doing* things through others, and He *will* do things through others, but He did that *Himself*; He bare our sins in His own body on the tree. And not only so, but He was *made* sin; (@2 Corinthians 5:21). Let us take that in. Not only did He become identified with us in His death, but He was made sin for us. How thoroughly, therefore, sin has been dealt with, and it is "that we might become God's righteousness in him"; not only accounted righteous, but we become the thing itself.
But here He is standing on the altar. That is to
{47}
say, God is *standing* on the altar. That is His attitude, and although the setting related to God's earthly people, and will have application and has had application, it has application now. It depicts in a striking manner, to my mind, the present attitude of God in Christendom, for it has to be remembered that the gospel service today is almost entirely within the area of Christendom; within the sphere in which men and women profess nominal relationship with God. The name Christian *is* nothing if it is not that, and it is what this scripture implies that in spite of the conditions that have come about in the area of Christian profession, God is still standing on the altar. That is the position. It will not last long; the standing attitude intimates that it *is not* for a great duration. The sitting attitude *is* for duration, but this is a standing attitude and one whence God speaks in the most solemn manner to persons who are in outward relationship with Him, but void of any inward relationship, and therefore occasioning His most stern resentment. Yet the altar is there, the means of being in positive vital relationship with God are there. There can be none without the altar. And so I am here tonight as well as thousands of others elsewhere, standing up in this service to convey to you that God is still speaking in relation with the altar; but He may cease at any time, and without warning; indeed, He is full of ire in regard of the attitude and conduct of those who are nominally in relationship with Him. It is wonderful to those of us who know God, to see how patient He is, how He continues patiently in the gospel, in His gracious attitude towards men in the presence of such indifference, such worldliness, such disregard for His rights as are manifest generally.
Lately one has been dwelling on the history of Ahab. He represents Christendom. He is one of the worst men spoken of in Scripture, and his wife
{48}
the worst woman, yet God undertakes to help him and to save him. And so it is that in spite of the unparalleled wickedness of mankind as seen in Christendom, where despite has been done to the Spirit of grace, where the blood of the covenant has been trampled under foot, where Christ's rights have been denied on every hand and are being denied, where His Person has been blasphemed, I am here tonight to announce the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, that God is still saving, and that He is without partiality, for He would save even an Ahab. If so, why not you, however bad you may be? Before there is any mention of Jezebel, Ahab is said to be one of the wickedest of men, and to add to this he married her. It was in his days that Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho (@1 Kings 16:34); that is to say, the world as opposed to God, once overthrown, is set up again. Yet the man in whose reign that was done is an object of mercy with God! The Syrians attack him and God sends a prophet to him to tell him that he is going to help him. So I am here to tell you that God is ready to save you.
Possibly in the city of Rome the gospel is being announced; the gospel is announced in all the great cities of Christendom, where wickedness is at its height; all this is in keeping with God's grace to Ahab. The Syrians are outside his gates in multitudes. Today the power of the enemy is here; Satan in power is against men. But God says to Ahab, I will deliver you from them. Ahab says, By whom? And God says, "By the servants of the princes of the provinces", and Ahab himself was to lead. That is God! And so there are two hundred and thirty-two servants of the princes of the provinces and seven thousand of Israel -- a little handful in the presence of the multitude of the Syrians, yet God helped Ahab and delivered him.
Again the Syrians come up, and they say, God is
{49}
a god of the mountains, but He is not a god of the valleys; (@1 Kings 20:28). Is he not a God of the valleys? Has He not descended into death? Yes, He has, He that ascended is the same as He that descended and overthrew the power of the enemy in its own stronghold. That is what God has done in Christ, and that is the God we announce to you. He is here tonight to deliver your soul. He is not only a God that operates above; He operates below, He has a right of way everywhere.
And so the Syrians come man for man, and horse for horse, an immense army to attack Ahab. It may be some of you can put yourselves into Ahab's position; you have no merits whatever. None of us has any, and it is when you renounce all merit that you are ready for God's salvation. So the Syrians come with all their forces thinking that God is the God of the mountains only, but He is the God of the valleys as well. The Syrians did not know this. The gospel is to illuminate us. It is the light we need; Satan darkens. Ahab musters his army "like two little flocks of goats" (@1 Kings 20:27), and there they are, as we may say, in perfect weakness in the presence of the enemies hosts. But God gives deliverance; one hundred thousand of the Syrians are slain in one day. You see the power of God active at the present time in spite of the wickedness all around in the sphere of Christian profession, and that power is here tonight; He is making known His ire, His resentment of men's ways, but He is standing on the altar as it were, and announcing the gospel, and at the same time making plain that there is no possibility of escaping His judgment if you refuse it. You may go up to heaven or down to hell, He says, but He will find you.
He further says, "Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in
{50}
the bottom of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them; and though they go into captivity before their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall slay them", (@Amos 9:3,4). You see it is with *God* we have to do, but He is standing on the altar; He is not on the great white throne yet, but He is announcing what is imminent, His judgment from which no unbeliever can escape. Persons may exalt themselves to heaven, or descend to the depths of this world where the eye of their neighbour may never reach them; to the dens of this world whose guests are in the depths of hell. (@Proverbs 9:18) Some may seek out those places and think no eye sees, but God knows. You cannot escape the eye of God, and not only this, but He will follow you there. You may go to the pleasures of the world, that is to say, Carmel, which means a park, or to the depths of the sea, which, I suppose, is humanity in the sense of the democratic element where it is hard to find people, where there is no distinction, but God knows. In all the myriads of the dead, every one is known to God. He has books. He speaks in language that is intelligible to us and when He refers to His books, He implies that there is enough space to include an account against every name. Then in the depths of the sea there is a serpent. You may think there is something in mutual relations, the current drift of mankind, but there is a serpent in them. The beast comes out of that condition. But even here God controls in it; the serpent serves His will; the judgment will find you.
The opportunity is now given you to draw near to the light of the altar. "Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried and that he was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures", (@1 Corinthians 15:3,4) and through Him, "is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all
{51}
that believe are justified from all things" (@Acts 13:38,39). That is the gospel, and that gospel is going forth, but the time of grace is about to terminate. Where shall we be then? His judgment will still find us. It is a solemn scripture and I would urge every one here not to take any risks in regard to this matter. Take account of God's present attitude on the altar while you may, and have matters between your soul and Him settled. The great white throne means *no* hope, but the altar *means* hope. The harvest is *not yet* past, nor the summer *ended*, so that you may be saved. Will you not? God is waiting on you; He is waiting on you tonight as a Saviour.
He speaks about the land. He touches it and it melteth, and all that dwell in it mourn; and it rises up like the Nile. One has seen such things. It rises up like the Nile; it may be in prosperity, may be in some vaunting of its leaders, but *God* is doing it. Current happenings should be observed by us. God is not the God of heaven only; He is the God of the earth. He is operating in the governments of the world, and generally, He is over-ruling in all current movements. Thus there are risings up like the Nile and sinkings like the river of Egypt. Men are carried high, for instance in material prosperity. Values run up and run up, but then they go down, like the river of Egypt. They go down, down, down, and that is exactly what has recently happened. Do you think it is accidental? Not at all; God is seeking to get men's souls. He will shake the world to get at you. He may take away your wife, your children, your business, because He wants *you*. That is what God does. Are you not afraid of Him? Have you no thought of God from whom your breath comes? We all live by Him, as Scripture says. He would warn you through His word here tonight. But although He warns you
{52}
as to judgment, He says, "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else", (@Isaiah 45:22). He shakes things up and down so that men might think, that they might become serious and say, What are we to do? I believe the leaders of this world are trembling. 'Another great war', one says, 'will end civilisation'. Maybe it will end civilisation, as we call it, but in the present troubles God is seeking to get souls. As I said, He is saying, "Look unto me, and be ye saved ... for I am God, and there is none else". How impressive that is: "There is none else". When you come to the Jordan, that is to say, when you come to die, where is there any other help? Why not take advantage of the present, whilst you are well, and settle matters? God is waiting on you.
Then our chapter says, "It is he that buildeth his upper chambers in the heavens". Surely He has some purpose in that; He does not act in vain. Some of us are to be there, in those dwellings in the heavens. God builds His stories, or spheres in the heavens beyond the raging of the flood here. Do you think He is building in vain? I do not. I know that He is considering for me, and for every believer. The Lord Jesus spoke about going to prepare a place for us. There is "the gospel of the glory"; there is a gospel that contemplates heaven for believers. The apostle Paul writes to the Ephesians about their being raised up and seated in the heavenlies in Christ, and in connection with this says, "By grace ye are saved". (@Ephesians 2:5) What is salvation? Complete salvation implies that we are taken out of this world altogether; it is, so to speak, the salvation of *place*. Did you ever think of that? God has a place for the believer. Is that of interest to you? We would love to have you come along with us. We are going there; here we have no continuing city. We seek
{53}
one to come, also a heavenly country, and so it is said that God has prepared for us a city; (@Hebrews 11:16).
And then He has a vault on the earth. The word *troop's* in the authorised version is very vague; the better translation says that God "hath founded his vault upon the earth". That is to say, He not only has rights up there; He also has rights down here. The millennial day, I believe, will show the perfect relation between the heavens and the earth, and God will have a people on the earth in full relation with heaven. He will have a place for His earthly people, and there will be perfect relation between the spheres above and those below. But the gospel today is in relation to a place above, and so there is, as I said, the gospel of place. I believe this gospel is largely for Christians. Sometimes we assume that the gospel is only for unbelievers, but it is an entire mistake. The great gospel epistle, Romans, was written to Christians, and the epistle to the Ephesians, which speaks about the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of Christ, was written to Christians, and, as I said, it is that epistle that speaks about believers being seated in heaven.
And so I would suggest to the brothers and sisters here, the importance of the gospel of place. Some are justified, thank God; your sins are forgiven through the death of Christ, but you are not delivered from this world; your hopes are in connection with this world. What you need to understand is that God has a place for you infinitely better than this world. He would stir you up that you may not remain in this place; your hopes and desires are in relation to the wrong place. God never intended to justify you so that you should have your hopes in this world The Lord Jesus spoke about "that world, and the resurrection", in which He says, they "neither marry nor are given in marriage, for neither can they die any more, for they are equal to the angels, and
{54}
are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection", (@Luke 20:35,36). Is that not inspiring? I think it is. I think the gospel of a place in heaven is wonderful. God has a place for us up there: "Because of his great love wherewith he loved us, ... has quickened us with Christ and has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus", (@Ephesians 2:4 - 6). And then He says, "For ye are saved by grace, through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is God's gift". That is the thing.
Then there is another thing here; He "calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out of the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name". The sea is a symbol of many things, but one special thing said about it is, that it is God's and He made it; (@Psalm 95:5). I never go on the sea without that in my mind. He has "paths" in the great waters of the sea. But then there are the waters themselves, and our scripture says, He "that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth". He has resource; the sea is a symbol of this. He has used it for judgment, but He also uses it for the benefit of the earth. What would we do without the waters of the sea? Some of you here may not think of these things, but human existence as it is now on earth depends upon the sea. It is thus typical of His resources in grace. There is the system of grace, it involves the Spirit. The Lord Jesus was "full of grace", (@John 1:14). But now it has become a system in connection with the Spirit and in it there are wonderful divine resources. He has means of equalising so that there is fruitfulness; therefore He calls for the waters of the sea and brings them on the arid earth.
It may be some thirsty soul here tonight feels the need of God refreshing him in this way. Literally the water comes by the way of clouds. God said of
{55}
old, when we have clouds first mentioned. Whenever I put a cloud in the sky, I will put a bow in it (@Genesis 9); that is to say, it is for good. In Elijah's time there was a famine for three and a half years. God brings a famine into the soul, but it is limited. With Elijah there is the idea of prayer, he prayed and there was a famine; he prayed again and God sent rain from heaven and the earth bore its fruit; (@James 5:17,18). Where did that rain come from? From the sea, what God has here already. In the same sense, help comes into the soul now from what is here in the Holy Spirit. One desires that we should have our souls bathed in the abundant grace that there is in the divine system. So, although Elijah prayed, he had to get his face between his knees in the profoundest exercise at the top of Carmel. He sends his servant out once, twice, three times and so on, but the seventh time he looks out on the Mediterranean and says, "Behold, there is a cloud, small as a man's hand", (@1 Kings 18:44). That water is to be lifted up from the Mediterranean: it is coming up first in the size of a man's hand, but it falls on Palestine in volume. The land of promise, is thus to yield its fruits.
That is what God does, and so Elijah says, "Go up, say to Ahab, Harness and go down, that the pour of the rain stop thee not". And the heavens were covered with clouds and the rain came down. That is God! He is not only a God of judgment; He is a God of grace. The grace of God, we are told, carries salvation with it, and so it is He that calls the waters from the sea and pours it out upon the earth. And then it adds, "Jehovah is his name". Will you not draw near and trust in that name? It is a strong tower. All these things enter into it, especially the last; the wonderful grace of God waiting to greet you and to meet you in all your need. "The Lord is his name".
{56}
FORMATION OF THE FAMILY OF GOD
@John 11:5; 13:1, 33 - 35
There are many peculiarities about this gospel that might he spoken of with profit but I want now to confine myself mainly to that feature of it that suggests the formation of the family of God. That we, as believers in Christ have part in the divine family, is one of the most precious facts involved in our position here. I am not speaking of the place we shall have in the future, for then we shall be one family among other families, as we read in Ephesians. Speaking of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the apostle says "of whom every family in the heavens and on the earth is named". (3: 15) Thus we learn that there shall be many families and that we shall have our place as a family amongst others. I do not intend to speak of that, but of the place that we have now whilst here on earth, as John says, Jesus, "having loved his own who were in the world ... loved them to the end". This gospel takes account of the saints as here in the world as to our outward position, and it shows how we have this place with God as a family, and that the Lord Jesus is, so to say, Head. He is our Head.
Now I read the passage in chapter 11, in order to show how He, when here, could love a family, not exactly that which was His own, or of which He was Head, but that He could love and did love a family, for although Martha's, Mary's and Lazarus parents had evidently passed away, the family affections remained; not parental affections or filial affections, but the affections that belong properly to brothers and sisters. The circle at Bethany was evidently a parentless one: a family without parents. No greater calamity can befall a family than that it
{57}
should be deprived of the parents, and so this family at Bethany afforded an opportunity to Christ to show His affection, and how He could make up for the loss that existed. Luke records, that in the house at Emmaus the Lord took the place of Head; in the margin of our better translation you have the expression 'House father'. He took that place. He could very readily have disclosed Himself to the two as they journeyed on the way, He could have told them, but He did not: He had other thoughts: He caused their heart to burn on the way, but He waited till the meal was set in order that He should have the opportunity of disclosing Himself in this peculiar function; that is, the function of Head. Now I believe that at the present time that is where Christians are most defective. We are most defective, I believe in the apprehension of Christ as Head, and so He would seize every opportunity to bring Himself before us in that light, for a headless family is obviously not the divine thought. The divine thought is that families should have heads, all working up to the great divine idea that Christ should be Head, and that is the lesson to be read in every household. Adam is said to be "the figure of him that was to come", (@Romans 5:14) and Adam was head but he made a very poor showing, I need not say, in the exercise of his function, and Eve fell in the non-recognition of it. Had she observed the place that God had given to her husband in regard to herself, she would never have listened to the tempter, she would have replied to Satan 'Adam is my head, I am to get my instructions from him', but instead of this she listened to the tempter, and so, beloved brethren, Christians generally are exposed to the tempter because of the non-recognition and non-understanding of the headship of Christ.
Now you will recall how @Genesis 3 and 4 are both marked by the disaster that flowed from Eve's
{58}
disregard of the divine function placed in Adam; she figures in chapter 4, she names the children, and it is one disaster after another: a man, the progeny departing farther and farther away from God, until at the end Seth has a child born to him, and he called his name Enosh; that is, he comes to recognise that the offspring is of a poor failing, dying creature: he accepts the judgment and so it says, "men began to call on the name of the Lord". There is recovery there: recovery brings back to the thought of headship and so in the next chapter Adam and Eve are formally taken account of; God called their name Adam. God graciously takes into account recovery, and recovery to His original thought. He had never forgotten the principle of headship and He called their name Adam and so in the line of Seth, from the one who is recovered to headship, we have the line of life, and dear brethren, John is the life-line. In @Genesis 5 the life-line is seen; in it all die except one, and the exception, beloved brethren, establishes the line of life. One man in that chapter is pleasing to God, and mark you, the pleasure came in when he began to have a family; he begat a son; he became a parent, and from that moment he walked with God for 300 years. Depend upon it, walking with God, as he was a head of his family, he brought the influence of God into his household, and it was said of him, "he was not, for God took him"; God took him! It says in Hebrews "for before his translation he had the testimony that he had pleased God", (@Hebrews 11: 5) he walked with God. It does not simply say that God walked with him, not but that God did help him in regard to his affairs, but Enoch walked with God. That is the point for the present time. It fits in with John.
I think that chapter 5 places before us the opposite of what the apostle intends to present to us in that
{59}
regard; that is, the pool of Bethesda. The pool is a stagnant water which is the opposite to what John would present to us. You have meetings, that are only moved as an angel comes, so to say, and such a meeting as that is not in life. John would bring about life. "These are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name". (@John 20:31) A meeting of Christians in the light and good of John's ministry is not like the pool of Bethesda. The principle of the pool of Bethesda was that an angel came down at a period and it required some power to get the benefit, the poor man was moved, but he had no power, no energy, hence the pool of Bethesda is not the principle of John. The principle of John is rather running water, living water. He brings in living water in chapter 4, it becomes in the believer a fountain; that is, it moves of itself, it is the Holy Spirit. Do not wait for external influences; there are such and of the best kind, but the principle of John is what is internal: he presents to us the truth of the Holy Spirit as a self-acting power in the heart. Let us learn to wait, in the exercises of our soul, for the movement of the Holy Spirit; and I ask you, Are you ever conscious of the movements of the Holy Spirit? John says, "it shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life". (@John 4:14) Do we realise that the Holy Spirit is verily in us. If we do not, let us wait before God about it. As the apostle says, prove your own selves, see if Christ is in you. It is well to do that; that one should prove in one's own soul the reality and the presence of this self-acting power, the fountain of water, the power of living water springing up into eternal life, and then, as you have it in chapter 7, there are rivers flowing out for the benefit of others. These are suggestions as to what John presents to us; as I was remarking John speaks of
{60}
movement. The spring is the Holy Spirit. You are to move, that is the fundamental principle of Christianity, viewed as a living order of things down here, and I again repeat that everyone of us should find out, in his own soul, whether he has this self-acting power, and if you have not realised it, I would seek to urge you to turn to God about it. It should be acting in you, that is the divine thought.
I have thought of Caleb's daughter, she asks her father to give her springs of water, and he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs, and I would especially commend to you the nether springs, the Spirit of God in the Christian acting of Himself in your affections so that they might spring up, and move towards God. In chapter 4 they spring up, in chapter 7, they flow out. The Holy Spirit gathers the affections of the believer and fixes them on Christ in heaven, but then, as I was remarking you have to move. I have to move. You find in this gospel, as the Lord comes into touch with souls, and as they come into touch with Him, each one is moved. Now to give you a well-known passage in chapter 1, John stood. It was on the morrow, he had been working, but the Lord comes to him, and he says, "He it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit". Now John stands, as if to say 'the one who baptises with the Holy Spirit is on the scene, my work is done' and now he stands and looks at Jesus as He walked. What movement! What a walk that was! Enoch walked with God, but here is the walk of the Lamb. Think of the intelligence, of the affection, of the purpose and devotedness, think of all that entered into those holy steps of Christ, the Lamb of God. John saw that: the two that stood by apparently did not see it, but they heard him, they heard what John had to say. How important it is to listen. And they followed Jesus. They heard
{61}
John speak, and they followed Jesus; there was movement after Christ. The Lord says, as if to test what you have in your heart, in your movements, "Whom seek ye". They say, "Rabbi (Teacher), where abidest thou", and He answers, "Come and see". The principle is movement throughout, it is not a fixed state of things that John is presenting. The saints whilst down here are to be in the movement or energy of life, so He says, "Come and see", and they came and saw where He dwelt and dwelt with Him that day, and they began to move. Andrew finds Peter his brother, Philip finds Nathaniel, and in each case there is movement. Nathaniel is dubious about the Lord, and asks, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth" and Philip replies, "Come and see". You have to move, the principle is movement. And now the Lord seeing Nathaniel coming to Him says, "Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile", and Nathaniel says to Him, "Whence knowest thou me"? and the Lord answered, "before Philip called thee, when under the fig tree, I saw thee". He replies, "Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel". What results if we are prepared for our opportunities, and the opportunities are here in our midst.
I have been thinking today of the word the Lord uses, "say not lo here or lo there, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you". (@Luke 17:21) It is a mistake to be looking for something special: the thing is to use what is available and what is available is the kingdom of God, and it is in you if you have the Holy Spirit. So the Lord says to Nathaniel, "Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou. Thou shalt see greater things than these, henceforth ye shall see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man". What encouragement there is! There is no end to what He presents. Henceforth: the Lord holds
{62}
out before us a vista of glory! Thou shalt see greater things than these, and so right on. Nicodemus comes to Jesus by night and says to Him, "Thou art come a Teacher from God". (@John 3:2)_ He recognises Jesus come from God and so too the woman, as I have remarked, as the Lord spoke to her, she left her waterpot and went away into the city and the reason why she left her waterpot is remarkable instruction. We might say she might conveniently fill it and take it back with her. There is a spiritual significance: she acts in accord with the light the Lord had presented to her. She went back to the city and says to the men "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done, is not this the Christ". (@John 4:29) Again there is movement: she moved and urged them to move and they moved. It says they came to the Lord and they said, "Now we believe ourselves". Throughout you have this principle of movement, not the energy of the flesh, but the movement that is the result of the work of God by the Holy Spirit in the souls of His people.
Now coming to the family, the Lord shows in chapter 2, that He can have sympathy in what we might call a family affair, a marriage. He has His disciples there. It says He was invited and His disciples. He can be there and He is there in connection with His own family. Evidently the Lord had a place in this circle, so His disciples were invited and the result was that He became pre-eminent in the scene and His disciples believed on Him. He had in view the formation of His own disciples and the result, as I said, was He manifested forth His glory and His disciples believed on Him. So they became as one may say the Lord's portion. I do not stretch the scripture when I say that He calls them children, and to my mind this is a precious thought. We belong to the household of Christ. We are His household, but He shows in regard to other households
{63}
how He can love them, and is it not an encouraging thought for those of us who have households, who are heads of households, that He can love them? He can love a family, He has a peculiar delight in a family that is rightly ordered. Where the parents are in the affections of His own relation to the assembly and where the children are brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. He delights in a family like that. He never takes it as His family, it is always yours, and so in the circle at Bethany, He loves the household. You may ask, Why do you say so? Because it says He loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. It does not say He loved Mary, Martha, and Lazarus: He loved Martha, she was the owner of the house. I see in that the Lord graciously recognising her as the parents were not there. Now the Lord loved her, and her sister, and Lazarus; Mark says He loved her sister. He can love a household. But then it is all to lead us over to the side of His household, that we might have part in that, and so in chapter 11, Caiaphas being high priest that year prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation and then John the evangelist adds, and not for that nation only: he had in mind the family of God, he had in mind that the children of God should be gathered into one.
I want to call particular attention to the place that part of the truth holds in chapter 11. The evangelist adds immediately "and not for that nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad". Let us beware of national feelings; "not for that nation only". The principle of Christianity is that the children of God everywhere should be gathered. The house of God is a universal thought, not a national or international, it is universal, it embraces all the children of God and the Lord did
{64}
not only die for that nation, but that He might gather together into one; it is a remarkable expression, "the children of God scattered abroad". In chapter 13, the Lord, as I apprehend it, is acting as the Head of His family, having loved his own. Beautiful thought! Could anything in a way express His care more than that for "His own". You have an expression in @Acts 20:28, very similar in regard to God's affection for Christ; "the blood of his own", without saying who "His own" is. Jesus loved His own. Think of being amongst those whom He so regards! And then it adds, having loved His own who were in the world, for He takes account of us in that position, He loved them to the end. I am convinced that the Lord at the present time which is the end, as one may say, is bringing about family affections and I believe the Supper with all that is contingent upon it is the centre of those affections. It is not mentioned here in this chapter, but it was instituted at the same time, the same night of which this chapter reads. This chapter gives us more of what was going on in the Lord's heart than any of the other evangelists, and above all this expression that He loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end. Then He expresses that love in the service that follows. I do not dwell on that. I am concerned only to show how He brings about family affections. He serves them, and then He says, "if I therefore the Lord and Teacher have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet". You are to be without a head as regards your outward position in this world, but in spite of that you are to have the principle of mutuality amongst you: you are to wash one another's feet. It is not Peter should wash John's feet, or John, Peter's, they were to wash one another's feet. It would be mutual. Do you understand there are mutual obligations in the
{65}
household circle, and that no one is immune from them. These obligations rest on every member of the household, "one another's feet". He addresses them by His parental expression of children, and it is an expression on the part of the Lord that is taken little notice of. But it is only one who is in the position of a parent literally, or in a moral sense, who can employ such an expression, and so He says here in chapter 13:33, "Children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me ... ... I say to you also now". This intimates clearly that He was to be elsewhere and they were to be left by themselves.
I am not ignoring what is said in chapter 14, that He would come to them, but this passage intimates plainly that they should be in circumstances and He should not be with them, "as I said to the Jews, Where *I* go *ye* cannot come, I say to you also now". Now what? "A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another as I have loved you". That is how it reads. His commandment takes the place of Himself. Do you understand? How the commandment tests us! We are here, and He is there, but the commandment is here, and it is a new one. In other words, it is one that has special reference to the family circle. It is a commandment that implies mutual obligations; that is the best expression I know for the passage, it is not only mutuality, it is mutual obligations and I would press obligations. There is no Christian immune from obligations, and let us be on our guard against assuming to be a body of believers, to be a family apart from all the children of God, it is false and not according to the mind of God. One would say to any believer, whatever his position, 'You have obligations, the same obligations as I have. The new commandment is for you as it is for me, and His commandment is, that we love one another
{66}
as Christ has loved us'. That is the essence of family affections, feelings or sentiments. We learn from our Head to love. That ye love one another as I have loved you. And, how did He love them? You say the Supper tells us. He loved them in adverse circumstances: that is how He loved them. He never had any other kind of circumstances, as one might say, but adverse ones. At the institution of the Supper, He had to say, the hand of him that betrayeth Me is with Me at the table, and that did not alter it. What circumstances! Hence He says, "as I have loved you". Dear brethren, it was love in adverse circumstances, it must be, for there are no other as regards our outward position. We cannot allow for any other, they are the very things that bring out the love of Christ in us. A brother is born for adversity. Christ came into the world for those in adversity, and He has taught us how to love in adversity, and the thing is to learn from our Head: we love one another as He loved us. And then He adds, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", that you are of the stock of God's children. How testing it is as to what we have! As I remarked elsewhere, the Lord says, "Have ye here any meat?" (@John 21:5) I would change the expression and say, Have you here any love, brethren? It is a question of what we have in our locality, amongst ourselves. Have you got it? All the love of God in Christ and the love of God is in Christ, but it is to be in our hearts, it is shed abroad there by the Holy Spirit, and God looks that it should work out in us. What He proposes objectively is worked out in the way of fruit. It is so in material things, and it is certainly so in spiritual things. They are presented objectively in Christ, but have you it among yourselves, and is it the kind of love that God has expressed to us, the love in adversity. The Lord would have us to show
{67}
it in loving one another. The testimony is that we are His disciples in that we have this love. We are in that way a family giving a very real testimony to our Head who has taught us how to love, love in adversity.
May the Lord bless the word, and may the thought of a family be impressed upon us, that we are the family of God, and that the Lord is Head.

Pages 68 - 116 - "Spiritual Movement", Belfast, November, 1919 (Volume 45).
SPIRITUAL MOVEMENT
@1 Samuel 16:1 - 13
J.T. I had in my mind particularly the words in the 11th verse: "Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither". I suggested the whole passage because I believe the Lord may help us to see the bearing of the anointing; only I desire that there should be exercise about those words in connection with our coming together on the first day of the week; we are not to sit down, so to speak, until He comes.
Perhaps a feature of the general declension is seen in professed Christians sitting down in an outward order of things which does not admit of spiritual movement. People come and go without any thought of spiritual movement; whereas, the thought in coming together week after week is that there should be an exercise in waiting on the Lord, so that he is apprehended as with us. I think that is what marks those who know the Lord in the assembly, and those who do not; the former are marked by spiritual movement; the latter are not. There is a ready-made system of things in which people sit down and that is the end of it. Whereas the position of the assembly here in the absence of the Lord implies that there is to be movement. It is a significant fact that the Lord Himself coming in among the disciples after He arose, is not seen as sitting, but standing.
Ques. What do you mean when you say that we are not to sit down until He comes?
J.T. That there would be an exercise, a waiting, an expectancy.
W.K. I was wondering if you meant that there
{69}
would be the power of recognition when He does come in.
J.T. Exactly so. The passage here shows that David was recognised when he came in. The prophet had the right thought in this respect; they were not to sit down until he had come in.
Ques. Would you say this company was sanctified?
J.T. They were outwardly sanctified, but in spite of that, there was the recognition of natural features, even by the prophet, for he took account of the firstborn first, as if the anointing was to be on the line of nature.
Ques. You spoke of the Lord being presented in the Gospel as not sitting down. What do you mean by that?
J.T. It suggests that there was something beyond, into which He would lead them. Viewed from the divine side, as in @Hebrews 10:12, He is set down, but it does not follow that we have come to that in our souls.
W.H. We are led in there by Him; and this involves exercise and waiting on the Lord.
J.T. The Lord leads us in. After Samuel had anointed David, he went to Ramah; that is, his work was done. The firstborn may be a man goodly to look at; you have to find out that you are judging according to nature.
Rem. When we sit down our expectancy is met.
J.T. Yes, when things are in the Lord's hands. The point is, to bring Him in, to let Him in. His thought would be to lead us. There were no seats in the tabernacle. The principle is that we rest in the complete fulfilment of the mind of God. @Ephesians 2 presents this side of the truth.
Ques. Would you suggest what form the exercise would take previous to the Lord's coming in?
J.T. Well, I think we are very apt to be governed by natural principles and feelings. Even Samuel
{70}
the prophet was governed by natural principles, whereas the Lord had said to him as to Saul, "I have rejected him". That should have been a reminder to Samuel when Eliab came before him, for Saul was head and shoulders above his brethren, and if the Lord rejected him, He was not going to accept a man because of his outward appearance.
S.L. I take it that we ought to be free for anyone who may be used to bring out what is of God.
J.T. "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him; for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart". That is the principle that should govern us in regard to what may come before us in relation to the things of God. Then Jesse called Abinadab, one I suppose more in keeping with the divine thought, but Samuel says, "Neither hath the Lord chosen this". The various sects in Christendom are all on the principle of nature, but this one word applies to every one of them, "Neither hath the Lord chosen this". And so it works out in the assembly; if you come in from your own affairs the tendency is to be governed by natural principles, and the word holds good; "Neither hath the Lord chosen this".
W.K. I was thinking while you were speaking that it was Eliab's personal greatness that was presented, but that would not do. The Lord had refused it. Nature, no matter how much toned down, will not do.
J.T. The Lord is not going to accept what He has not chosen. He always reserves what He Himself chooses. It is not what *I* can present, it is what *He* chooses.
Ques. Do you mean for a centre of gathering?
J.T. He chose Zion, the centre round which His people can gather. All so-called churches are built
{71}
on the principles of nature, or what is acceptable to man's eye; what *they* have chosen, not what God has chosen.
Rem. Eliab would have been a remarkable man, no doubt.
J.T. Apparently the prophet was looking at his natural appearance; he was not thinking of God's choice. Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. The point is the exercise that took place; they had come to a deadlock; the secret was that they were not on right lines. Samuel did not try to cover it over, he halted. Jesse's resources are at an end, for he thought only of those seven, and the word was, "the Lord hath not chosen these".
J.M. They did not take David into account.
J.T. He was left out in Jesse's reckoning.
Rem. It is a serious thing in the different religious systems.
J.T. Yes; ordinary religious procedure is on natural principles, there is no thought of waiting on the Lord, or looking for Him to come, and so after the congregation has dispersed there is not the sense that the Lord had not been there.
Ques. Does not the Lord intend the memorials of His death to affect our hearts in regard to His coming in, so that we might be free from human conditions in every way?
J.T. One who truly loves the Lord is exercised on the line of divine choice, what God has chosen. There can be nothing according to God except what is on that line.
Ques. Would it not give the meetings a living character instead of what is merely systematic?
J.T. It keeps us from sitting down, so to speak, too soon. You are not going to allow your spiritual senses to settle down until the One whom God chose comes in. A spiritually exercised brother would be governed by Him. You might have nice hymns
{72}
and an outwardly correct service, and yet not a thought about what God chooses, and what is pleasurable to Him. The principle of the assembly is spiritual movement. The gospel of John is very interesting in this respect. I think the pool of Bethesda, being stagnant, and only moved when an angel comes, is the *opposite* of what this gospel would produce. The principle throughout is spiritual movement. The disciples inquire, "Where dwellest thou?" He says, "Come and see", (@John l:38,39). The woman in the fourth chapter says, "Come see a man". It is all on that line.
S.L. If we were exercised and expecting the Lord there would be a response to it, and we should have a wonderful time.
J.T. I think there is something very suggestive in Samuel's declaration that they should not sit down until David came. In keeping with this, we are to "tarry one for another" (@1 Corinthians 11:33); thus one is *always* exercised. The principle in Hebrews is that there "remaineth a rest" "Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest". (@Hebrews 4:9,11) In Hebrews Christ is said to have sat down on the right hand of God; in Ephesians the saints are said to have been made to "sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus". (@Ephesians 2:6)
Ques. Do we anoint Him, so to speak, when He comes in?
J.T. We recognise Him, and accord Him His place as Head.
Rem.. He is pre-eminent. We know Him by His "beautiful countenance".
J.T. You can understand that Eliab would feel reproached, and then the others in succession, as Samuel said, "The Lord hath not chosen these". Jesse was in confusion, and then Samuel says, "Are here all thy children?" And Jesse said, "There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold he
{73}
keepeth the sheep". And Samuel said unto Jesse, "Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither". It was a scene of humiliating exercise, all of which might have been avoided.
Rem. They should not have left David out.
J.T. No. God hath said He had provided a king among Jesse's sons, and they all should have been present. Perhaps Samuel should have enquired if all were there at the *beginning*.
J.M. We might assume the Lord's presence without the necessary exercise; that would bring about the result we see here. The fact of our coming together does not warrant that the Lord is going to be with us, but He answers to right exercises.
W.K. If the Lord has presented to us His thought that we should come together to remember Him, I think we ought to count upon His presence.
J.T. We are entitled to reckon that He will come to us. We reckon on the Lord's fulfilment of His promise, but that involves that there should be an exercise suitable to that promise.
Rem. We ought to have it as a fundamental thing in our minds, and unless there is some positive hindrance on our part, the Lord will be there.
J.T. The thing is to avoid a ready-made state of things in which there is a certain religious procedure, and no waiting on the Lord in order that He might manifest Himself to us, and be with us. The pool of Bethesda was stagnant until the angel came. John's gospel is intended to prevent such a state of things among the saints.
Rem. The coming together in itself will not furnish material to go on, apart from the recognition of the Lord.
J.T. We have to bear in mind that the assembly is on the ground of divine choice. Christ, and all that is of Him, are to be our choice too, and all else is to be refused. If we come together on these lines,
{74}
we shall not admit anything but what is of divine choice. In @1 Corinthians 12:12, we learn that the assembly is included in the anointing. "All the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is the Christ". The assembly is therefore on the ground of God's sovereign choice. How happy to be on this ground!
Rem. The recognition of the Lord's presence is very precious.
J.T. I think we reach it on these lines.
Rem. The exercise ought all to be on these lines; we have to get rid of natural principles altogether.
Ques. Would it be right to say that if those who take the lead are led of the Lord, they will help the whole meeting?
J.T. I think that is how God works. As to assembly privilege, all depends upon the Lord coming in and being recognised.
Rem. It is important to see that our coming together is in order that we might come into the good of the Lord's presence.
Ques. Would it not be well to have that settled before coming together?
J.T. Be in readiness, always remembering that God rejects what is after nature.
Rem. The firstborn was rejected. Many of us would look at the firstborn; that in nature which excels.
J.T. But that is what God rejects. You do not recognise what He rejects. There is that which He has chosen and you accept it. Colossians helps greatly as to this feature of the truth. Nothing is to be accepted but what is "after Christ"; "Christ is all and in all". It may be that the giving out of a hymn will lead to the Lord having His full place in the hearts and affections of the saints. When David comes in, the Lord says, "Arise, anoint him; for
{75}
this is he". It is also recorded that "he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to". The suggestion being that there was the energy of life.
Ques. How do we distinguish between looking on the countenance of the firstborn, and the One whom God has chosen?
J.T. Saul was a typical man after the flesh; the Lord says, as it were, 'I will let you have the man of your choice, and I will help him in every way'. The result was known to Samuel, and yet he looks upon the countenance of the firstborn. The lesson here is to refuse the natural product, however developed it may be. Education and refinement are often deceptive in this respect. Whatever my natural abilities may be, I come to see that "the Lord hath not chosen these". Thus I record progress in my soul's history.
J.McF. I have thought of Eliab as setting forth the principle in a State Church. They take up the ground that God is a universal Father, whereas God's thought is that we are taken up in the Beloved. The whole point is that those taken up in the Beloved come together with Him as the centre.
J.T. We are chosen in Him "before the foundation of the world", and we are "accepted in the Beloved". (@Ephesians 1:4,6) The principle of God's choice is somewhat different from the question of acceptance. Choice is a question of God's sovereignty; acceptance involves intrinsic value. He will not change His mind; we cannot say *why* He chose us, but the point is, that *He did it*, and He will not be diverted from it. How precious that He has chosen *me*!
Rem. You must discern between what is natural and what is spiritual in yourself.
J.T. It is a thing that goes on in the Christian's soul constantly. I have to be in line with what God chooses.
{76}}
Rem. No matter how many years one has been on the way, that principle abides.
J.T. When David comes in he is ruddy, that is, instead of a deadness, as in the Jewish system, Christ is known as living; and not only that, David had a beautiful countenance. The Lord showed Himself living amongst them after He arose from the dead.
Ques. What is the signification of "goodly to look to" (@1 Samuel 16:12).
J.T. I suppose it would refer to the beauty of Christ, which draws out our affections. The Psalmist spake of beholding the beauty of the Lord. To the Jews He was "without form and comeliness" (@Isaiah 53), but this is what He is to those whose eyes have been opened to know Him.
Rem. "My beloved is white and ruddy". "He is altogether lovely", (@Song of Solomon 5). Even the remnant in the end recognises this.
Ques. What is your thought as to being anointed in the midst of his brethren?
J.T. It was as a testimony. The Lord Jesus was anointed as a testimony to His Person. The defect lay in the fact that Samuel was judging according to nature, but God would have him anointed in their midst according to sovereign choice. What a lesson for Jesse's house! The Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. There is nothing recorded as to what happened after. Samuel goes to Ramah. When you come typically to Christ anointed the curtain drops. He is on the scene now as the Anointed. As the Lord has His place among us, we may leave things in His hand; but then we must be in accord with Him, so that He may lead us.
{77}
THE HOUSE OF GOD, THE PLACE OF SPIRITUAL ENJOYMENT
@Luke 15:22 - 32; @Ephesians 2:19 - 22
J.T. The house of God has a very special place in Scripture, in a great measure connected with human responsibility. I thought it might be helpful to look at it as the place of fellowship and enjoyment, where you find that which satisfies. It is well to remember that in the employment of such expressions as, *merriment, music, dancing*, Scripture conveys spiritual thoughts. We must become accustomed to understand things in a spiritual way. The subject before us would be, in a measure, confined to those who are spiritual, and yet within the reach of all. In the first epistle to Timothy the principles of the house are set forth, and it is presented on the privilege side in Ephesians. The apostle says, "Ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God". (@Ephesians 2:19) This Scripture sets forth what we are as viewed from the divine side. The chapter in Luke speaks of the house as the place in which you discern divine emotions; the Father was moved at the return of the prodigal. One would be very far from encouraging anything like natural emotions in divine things; but emotion was seen in the Lord when here, and also in the apostles; and so, spiritual emotions should mark the saints as they are in the presence of God and Christ. And as having to do with divine things, we are to be *living*; God is a living God, and we should be in accord with Him.
S.L. According to @Ephesians 2, the saints were to be at home with God.
J.T. We are not strangers, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; so that one is there in liberty, not as a slave; we have the liberty of the house.
{78}
Rem. The world is going in for its music and dancing, in a material way; if we have not spiritual enjoyment we are worse off than the world.
J.T. That is where young Christians are at a loss; they do not see the recompense there is for them in the household of God. The prodigal's elder brother heard the music and the dancing, but he *would not* go in. The Lord had spoken about those to whom He had piped; they had not danced; they were not able to appreciate the music of His ministry. You will remember how Barzillai the Gileadite, when king David proposed to him to go up to Jerusalem, said, "I am this day fourscore years old; and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women" (@2 Samuel 19:35). That to my mind is a very humiliating confession; old age had brought in a state in which there was no ability to appreciate what was of God. It was not that he was against it, he had to admit that he could not enjoy the things of David at Jerusalem. He was a great man in his own house, and in his own family circle; he could even entertain David, but when it came to David's food and maintenance, singing and dancing, he was not able to enjoy that.
Ques. Do you think there is a possibility that he finished brightly?
J.T. In spiritual things there should be no decline; old age should not cause you to decline spiritually. "Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing", (@Psalm 92:13,14). That shows where we are to be in our affections, where our living associations are to be; thus we are said to be fat and flourishing to the end.
{79}
Rem. We should always be in the sense of belonging to that circle.
J.T. The thing is to cultivate living associations there.
Rem. The tendency might be to settle down in our own line of things.
J.T. Make what is of God your chief interest, instead of your family and business.
J.McF. *Their* house would be left unto them desolate; that would be to those who did not respond to the music and dancing.
J.T. In @Luke 13 the house is left desolate; in chapter 14 the house is *full*; in chapter 15 it is the *merry* house.
Ques. Would you say that the best robe, the ring and the shoes, were to prepare the prodigal for the house?
J.T. Yes. He is one of the household; he is one of those spoken of in @Ephesians 2.
J.M. The house is where you are planted; you are of the household; your affections are there.
J.T. I suppose that is where God plants *now*. The Lord said, "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up", (@Matthew 15:13). It does not say *where* the planting is there, but *who* plants. Ephesians speaks of being "rooted and grounded in love". (@Ephesians 3:17) Roots draw up the sap which nourishes the tree. *Grounded* is that one is firmly set, so as to preclude rooting up; and the result is that one bears fruit in old age, and flourishes in the courts.
J.McG. Would you connect it with what we enjoy when we are together?
J.T. The truth of it works out in our relation one to another under all circumstances. You have the expression "the household of faith" in @Galatians 6:10.
J.M. It has a universal bearing here, and that works out in our relation one with another.
{80}
J.T. One would call attention particularly to *appreciation*; whether we appreciate what is in the house or otherwise. To those to whom the Lord piped, He says, "ye have not danced". He intimates their inability to respond. It was a question of the state in man; so with the elder brother of the prodigal, it was not that he could not hear the music and dancing, but he *would not* go in; his will was active.
Rem. The prodigal had come to an end of himself.
J.T. Yes, what one sees is the affection in the paternal heart towards the prodigal. It says in @Acts 10:44, "While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them which heard the word". It is energetic action of love laying hold of its object. That is the delight that God has in those that are secured for the house through the gospel. @Luke 15 corresponds with this. The prodigal's father "saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him". Then, having ordered the different things to be put on his son, he says, "Let us eat and be merry". Thus we are to have part in the joy of the house.
J.M. It is His delight in the result of the gospel that moves our hearts.
J.T. I think so. If we were more there intelligently, we should be more conscious of the delight that God has in us. In Luke it is His holy emotions on account of what the gospel produces. One is impressed with the great lack of intelligent emotion in the saints, with regard to what God is doing. If you keep your eye on what God is doing, your heart will be moved.
Rem. The question is, what line are we on?
J.T. It is the Spirit's day. That is, the Spirit is here in answer to Christ in heaven, and if our senses were more exercised we should discern what He is doing. "It was meet that we should make
{81}
merry", the Father says; so that God orders holy merriment in relation to what He is doing. The elder son did not go in, his will was active. We have to be on our guard with regard to our wills. Esau was in the *field*; that is, he made that his sphere instead of the house. The house is the Christian sphere. The house is God's people, but the field is a very attractive place to the flesh.
J.McF. There were influences there. I suppose chapter 16 shows the end of the elder brother.
J.T. It is very solemn. "He fared sumptuously every day, but in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments". There was entire want of sympathy with God. He refused the house of God, and remained in the field, and so he came to his end.
Rem. The elder brother's state is a more deplorable one than Barzillai's.
J.T. It is worse certainly, because his will was in it; like many young men and women who take their own way in self-will. There are certain restrictions in the house, the field affords scope for the flesh.
Rem. The principle of lawlessness is active in the field.
Ques. What is to be learned from the servants?
J.T. There are servants in the household; one of them spoke to the elder brother, but they were evidently in sympathy with all that went on.
Rem. The servant's message to the elder brother ought to have touched him. "Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf". He appealed to his affections, saying, *thy brother* and *thy father*.
J.T. No young man ever had a greater opportunity of recovery than this. His father *entreats* him to come in, and listens to his complaint, and then explains, "Child, thou art ever with me". God accredited the Jew, in grace, with all that belonged to Him, in order to induce him to come in.
{82}
S.L. What is the thought in "the fatted calf"?
J.T. That was Christ, but viewed as the very best; everything was to make the scene entirely delightful.
Ques. What would answer to the servant?
J.T. The first of Acts shows how the servant is active. The saints are first viewed as a company, they are thus the house of God, but then certain ones are taken up. The situation that has arisen is explained to the elder brother.
Ques. Would Peter answer to the servant?
J.T. Yes, and the ministry of Paul would answer, perhaps, to the Father coming out and entreating him. In Acts we see how Paul was taken up with the Jews; although he had written a letter to Rome, when in Rome he sends for the Jews, first; it is the grace of God keeping the door open that they might return. After the death of Stephen the Jews had an extended offer to the grace of God. He extended the period to the Jews, in order that the scattered among the Gentiles might have an opportunity of coming into the house. When Paul came to Rome they reasoned with him a whole day; and then he quoted @Isaiah 6, and they leave Paul, he having said to them, "the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and they will receive it". (@Acts 28:28) So they are no longer addressed as a separate people.
Rem. That is the attitude the elder son takes up; he reasons with the father.
J.T. He is entirely wanting in sympathy with the father.
Rem. Ephesians is an enlargement of @Luke 15, the Jew and the Gentile being brought together.
J.T. It specially emphasises the place the Gentiles have.
Rem. The household was there before the Gentiles were brought in.
{83}
J.T. It speaks of the house from a high standpoint, and then of the security of it: it is built on "the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone". There is what the house is in the way of privilege and security, and then what it develops into; it "groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord".
Ques. What is the thought in the chief corner-stone?
J.T. I think ornamentation and binding. The chief corner binds the whole building.
J.M. Christ would bind the affections of the saints.
Rem. "The beauty of the Lord" (@Psalm 90:17) is upon us.
S.McC. The corner-stone often had an inscription.
J.T. It is what is *seen*. The Lord is "the head of the corner", (@Matthew 21:42).
Rem. The stone that was set at nought by the builders is now conspicuous.
J.T. I was thinking particularly of spiritual emotions. I understand to some extent the forms and ceremonies used in the so-called *high church*; they take the place of spiritual emotion, but there is nothing for God in them. They are dead things, but God is praised by the living, as Hezekiah says in @Isaiah 33:19. Our consciences are to be purged from dead works to serve the *living* God; (@Hebrews 9:14). God is living, and He looks for the evidence of life in us towards Himself.
J.McF. Of Sardis the Lord says, "Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead", (@Revelation 3:1).
S.L. When we come together to the morning meeting, there is often an absence of real emotion.
J.T. Often there is very little for God. He is looking for movement of soul, in answer to what He presents to us.
Rem. You get spiritual emotions in @Acts 20; "When he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and
{84}
prayed with them all. And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him".
J.T. Paul speaks of Timothy's tears; (@2 Timothy 1:4). He speaks also of being beside himself to God; (@2 Corinthians 5:13).
Rem. I think what you call attention to is very important, and something that we should be greatly exercised about. I suppose the Song of Solomon is full of that.
J.T. Yes, both on the bride's side, and on the Lord's side. You want the senses moved intelligently and spiritually, in the presence of what God presents to us.
J.M. That is where spiritual discernment would come in.
Rem. The result would be enjoyment of what is in the house.
J.T. The apostle says, "Be not drunk with wine ... ... but be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord", (@Ephesians 5:18,19). There is thus a divinely appointed outlet for the joy the Holy Spirit produces in our hearts. Note, that the melody is to be made in the *heart* to the Lord. In the assembly Christ sings Himself. Indeed, all the singing there is regulated by Him. David made much of singing, providing for it in the house. He is a type of Christ in this respect. David is said to be "the sweet psalmist of Israel", (@2 Samuel 23:1).
Rem. You would not confine this music and dancing to the meetings?
J.T. I think @Ephesians 5 shows that it is to mark the Lord's people generally; but when you come to the assembly, in its true character, the Lord regulates the praise. The spirit of music and dancing should be always with us.
Rem. God is working to this end today.
{85}
POWER BELONGETH UNTO GOD
@Exodus 3:13 - 15; @Psalm 135:13; @Luke 4:14 - 22
I desire to speak on the anointing of Christ, with the thought of showing forth that all that God *is* necessarily enters into that anointing. I think it is necessary to dwell for a little on the anointing, in view of the general denial of the principle set out in it, namely, that "power belongeth unto God", (@Psalm 62:11). The power descends instead of ascending. It does not belong to the people, as is generally and persistently alleged; it belongs to God, and He has vested it in One who, having been proved, has shown Himself worthy of such a trust; the welfare of all mankind is bound up in it. Indeed, the whole realm of the worlds which God has framed is entrusted into the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ, who, having been proved, is qualified, and has now been formally invested with that trust. There are many witnesses to the effectiveness of His administration, which was announced by the prophets; it will continue until the time when He will deliver up the kingdom to Him who is God and Father.
Now one would appeal to oneself, as to every believer in this company, for witness to it. What have you and I found in that One under whose wings we have come to trust? Yea, rather, who has taken us under His wings. Each one can witness, and all may swell the praise that belongs to Him who "sits upon the throne". (@Revelation 4:9) It is necessary to be reminded that power is from on high, and that now it is committed to one who has proved Himself worthy. As the prophet puts it, "Behold my servant whom I uphold; mine elect in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him", (@Isaiah 42:1). And then the prophet goes on to say in the fourth verse, "He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth". What a
{86}
testimony! God asserting His prerogative, that power belongeth unto Him, has entrusted it to a proved One. The more you study the history, the more your mind turns to the perfection that is in Christ. A David, or a Josiah, or a Nehemiah may fail, but this Man shall not fail nor be discouraged till He have set judgment in the earth. The more spiritual you are, the more you will turn to that perfection which the evangelists present to us in the New Testament; the soul looks out for it. Simeon and Anna were expectant of it, and when the Babe came into the temple, Simeon, who had gone there by the Spirit, took the Babe into his arms. He had been expecting this, it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord's Christ; and so he takes the Babe, and says, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation", (@Luke 2:29,30). His heart could rest now, and he could depart, for the Lord's Christ was there.
I trust one speaks with a measure of sensitiveness as to what is involved, and I would commend to you the importance of being moved by divine perfection in Christ; it is sufficient to move every spiritual heart. So Simeon held the Babe, in a spiritual way, in his heart; Anna, too, coming in, is in harmony, for she "spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem", (@Luke 2:38). There was the spirit of expectancy for this divine perfection in a Man. When I speak of divine perfection, I speak of what He was personally, for it is ever to be remembered that He is not a creation, He brought all into manhood. Nevertheless, He was a Man, and moved about in this world as a boy, a young man, a full-grown man in divine perfection. His was humanity as real as any other, but divinely perfect, for "He knew no sin". "He shall grow up before him as
{87}
a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground", @Isaiah 53. He grew up before Jehovah, He was for Jehovah's pleasure. And so when He reached thirty years of age, full levitical manhood, He comes up out of the waters of baptism and the heavens are opened to Him. What a moment in the history of time! and as one might say, in the history of heaven, when the heavens open to a Man and a voice speaks to Him saying, "Thou art my beloved Son; in whom I am well pleased". How much does it matter if the Pharisees were not pleased! It is a question of heaven's approval; He is not to be the ideal of the populace, He is not to be a popular hero, He is to begin His public service as divinely approved. Paul thought it a small matter to be judged by man; to seek a place amongst men is wrong, for "that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination to God". (@Luke 16:15) The Lord began with unqualified divine approval, and in the approval there was the divine commission in the gift of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was there in a bodily form, and He abode upon Him. Such is the fact we read relative to the anointing of Christ.
I desire to say a word about the Name, for all that God is was there. There was the Father's voice, there was the bodily form in which the Spirit came, and there was the Son upon earth. God was there, God in unity, for God is one. I desire to show briefly from the Old Testament how the Name expressively speaks of what God is, as necessarily bound up with the anointing, and so I go back to Moses in the wilderness, for one must be in such circumstances in order to receive such light. He was in the backside of the desert, and God arrests him by a vision, and he turns aside to see what it is. God was in the bush, and Moses took note that while the bush burned it was not consumed. It was God's communication to Moses that He identified Himself
{88}
with a suffering people, and Moses was to be with God's suffering people. Paul says, "Ye have reigned as kings without us; and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you;" (@1 Corinthians 4:8) but the reigning time is deferred; it is now the suffering time. The apostle says, "We are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things", (@1 Corinthians 4:8,13). What words to describe the apostles of the Lord of glory! These words should search us in our day. God intimates to Moses that He would be in the midst of a suffering people. The bush is not consumed, the discipline of God is there, but the bush is not consumed. Discipline all the way through, but then it is discipline from God who is with us He dwells in us. He chastens us for our profit, that we might live, and be "partakers of his holiness", (@Hebrews 12:9,10).
God reminds Moses that this is to be the history of His people. Moses asks, What am I going to say? How am I going to commend myself? God says unto Moses, "I AM THAT I AM". "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you". I wish to dwell for a moment on that; "I AM" -- the self-existing One, yesterday and today and for ever, the Same. Then He says, "The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you; this is my Name for ever, and this is *my memorial* unto all generations". And so Moses is sent with that precious light in his soul. Then Jehovah says, "Go, and gather the elders of Israel together"; the responsible ones are to have the communication of Jehovah delivered to them. The Lord suggests the position in Exodus, and, I may say, the truth is there presented from the divine side. When you come to the Psalm which I read, you have the truth presented, not from the divine side, but from the side of experience. I think one
{89}
may say that the book of Psalms is the least understood of the books of the Old Testament. I understand the book of Psalms very little, but I take it to be the result, through God's grace, in man's heart of the testimony that *He* presented. You may be sure that, if God is presenting light to you, He is looking for results from that presentation. If fruit is not forthcoming, beware! Outward forms will not do, God looks at the heart. He is looking for results in the heart, and the books of Psalms is the result of the divine testimony in the hearts of God's people. And so you have the language of faith in verse 13. "Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations". That is not God's side. The book of Exodus is the divine side, the Psalm is the result.
Now let me ask you, What have you found out? The writer of this Psalm had found out in his soul that God was what He was. Have I found that out? The Psalmist is not appealing to Scripture, he is speaking of the experience of his soul, he knows God now. Do I know God in that way? He has disclosed Himself to us in Christ, not only as Jehovah, in His everlasting faithfulness, but as the Father, in His everlasting love. "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God", (@1 John 3:1). And so the Psalmist here, according to the light that is presented to him is able to look up, and say to Jehovah, "Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations". Where was the memorial? In the hearts of those who loved God. Let us not be content with the Scripture testimony, the memorial is to be in the hearts of God's people.
In @Nehemiah 9 the priests, Ezra and the leaders are assembled together in prayer to God, and they begin their recital of the history of God's ways with themselves, saying, "Thou art the same, thou alone,
{90}
Jehovah",(@Nehemiah. 9:6). It is not "*I Am*" now, it is "*Thou art*". What an outgoing as they review the history of a broken down kingdom! As they review all the failure of the people, their hearts turn to Jehovah, and they say, "Thou art the same". The failure had only proved to them that He was what He was. They go back to the beginning of creation, and say, "Thou art the same". There is no change with Him. What have you found in God for yourself? Do not tell me what the Scriptures say, the point is, experience; how much have you learned in your soul's experience about God? Let us face this question, Where am I in my soul in regard to God? The Levites, in Ezra's time, confessed where they were with Jehovah and that Jehovah was what He was; He was what He announced Himself to be. After the long years of humiliating history, they return to Jerusalem, and confess that they have found Him infinitely true and faithful. "Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever, and thy memorial, O Lord, unto all generations". Now this memorial necessarily enters into the anointing. It was now a question of that holy Name and memorial being taken up and cherished in a way that had never been seen hitherto; it was in the heart of Christ, who cherished it and would witness to it as no one else could. One can well understand Simeon saying, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word"; for all that was of God would now be preserved and testified to.
In the fourth of Luke it is recorded that, after the Spirit had come upon Him, "he was led of the Spirit into the wilderness". The blessed Spirit of God had come upon Him, and His presence is now signalised in that the Lord is *led* by Him. The Holy Spirit leads Him into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. The Lord would recoil from this, but the will of God required it, and He is led of the Spirit
{91}
into the wilderness. We should avoid evil unless the Holy Spirit leads us to deal with it, and this is rare. It is only in very exceptional cases that the Lord takes up a man and leads him to have to do with evil, and with Satan. After the temptation *He* returned, it was His own act, to take up the service for which He was anointed. *He* is acting now in the *power of the Spirit*; He is intimating that He is to carry on His service in spiritual energy, and so He stands up in the synagogue; and the Spirit adds, "where he had been brought up"; where His infancy and boyhood days were spent. He begins there. "He went into the synagogue ... and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias". He turns to the passage in chapter 61, and He reads it as the text for the day: "The Spirit of Jehovah is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord". The Spirit of Jehovah involves all that Jehovah is, and all that the Father is, for it was the Father's voice that spake *to* Him, and *of* Him; so much so, that He said elsewhere, "he that hath seen me hath seen the Father".
I desire to show that the anointing is based on the fact that the Spirit of Jehovah was there; the first representing what God is, the second representing God's prerogative. God's will enforces what He is, and how blessed that is! God uses His prerogative to enforce blessing in the human heart, hence the Spirit of Jehovah was there, involving all that Jehovah was in blessing and everlasting faithfulness. But, as I said, it was now not only Jehovah, but the Father; which name speaks of unmixed grace for men. The Spirit of the Father through the anointed Man
{92}
brings grace and good to every man. "He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor". Think of Him beginning His service as the Anointed in preaching the gospel to the *poor*! John asked from the prison, "Art thou he that should come?" The Lord says, "Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see; the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them". These were the results of the anointing. If you have the Christ, you have everything. The woman in @John 4 says: "When the Christ comes he will tell us everything". She was beyond John the baptist there! God sent His blessed Son to preach the gospel to the poor, and so the Lord announced it was the first great feature of His service in @Luke 4:18. How little is it true today! One would love to see a move on the part of God's people to preach the gospel to the poor. I refer to those who are poor spiritually.
The Lord goes on to mention in detail His services in connection with the anointing, and these go on to the end of this dispensation. He will rule the world presently, but throughout this dispensation He is carrying on the blessed service indicated here. There is a beautiful touch in @Acts 10:38. As anointed He "went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him". He was not limited, He went *about*, and that is the principle of ministry. The passage goes on to say, "to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord". That is what He is employed in, and that is the service He continues until the end of "the acceptable year of the Lord". He is not ruling, but He is doing these things as the Anointed of God, and He will do them. It is a question whether
{93}
we are prepared to let Him serve as indicated here, and whether, according to the measure He has apportioned to us, we are with Him in the service. To this end the saints are also anointed, see @2 Corinthians 1:21; @1 Corinthians 12:11. I suppose we are sometimes bruised in spirit, so much so that we are unable to say a word among our brethren or to move spiritually; the Lord is anointed to heal and deliver us. And, further, "to preach the acceptable year of the Lord". There is a definite period in which God is receiving men and women, in grace on the principle of faith, and that period cannot be shortened. We are still in that year, and one would not wish it to be shortened; one would rather suffer than have it cut short.
I do not wish to proceed further, one can but call attention to the peculiar effect of all this on the hearers. He closes the book and He sits down, and it is recorded that "the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him". He is the attractive centre as anointed, and sitting down He speaks, saying, "This day is the Scripture fulfilled in your ears".
How many things are fulfilled in our *ears* that are not fulfilled in our *hearts*! You will find that it was not fulfilled in their hearts. How easy it is to have our ears pleased, but it is the heart that is the soil for the Word, not the ear. If it is only in the ear, Satan will take it out of the ear; indeed he takes it out of some hearts too, if it is not understood there; (@Matthew 13:19). If the work is to be effective, it has to be heard and received into the heart and understood there; I mention this particularly. And then the passage says, "They wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth". So that He is attractive as the Person anointed, and attractive in His speech. May the Lord bless His word!

SPIRITUAL RICHES
@2 Corinthians 8:9; @1 Corinthians 14:26
In reading these Scriptures I want to bring before you the thought that God seeks in us a certain spiritual prosperity, so that we may always have something with which to minister to others. God looks for practical answers in His people to the great wealth with which He has enriched us in Christ. In Ephesians the gospel is said to be the gospel of "the unsearchable riches of Christ"; (@Ephesians 3:8) and obviously it is not simply to make known these riches, but that those who believe should have part in them. The passage in 2 Corinthians shows how it is possible for us to have part in them. The Lord, having been rich, became poor on our account; it refers to His incarnation and death, "that we through his poverty might become rich". The fact that He became poor is one of the most touching that can be spoken of. That He came into poor material circumstances is a fact; it is also evident, when the question of tribute was raised, that He did not possess money.
There is another sense in which He was poor. It is said in the Psalms, "this poor man cried" (@Psalm 34: 6) -- one having no outward means of help. He came into these circumstances in grace. What can touch the heart more than that? Think of the Lord of glory becoming poor! Poor, not only in material things, but in the sense that there was no outward means of help or support. Jehovah heard Him, of course, but that is another matter, outwardly He was poor. So we have, "Blessed is he that understandeth the poor", (@Psalm 41:1). On the cross, I suppose, it was seen in its full measure, when He cried, and there was no help at all. He was without support. He was alone. We cannot measure that,
{95}
we can only refer to it with feeling, one trusts, and in a worshipful spirit. He was pleased to be found thus in order that we should be rich, "that we through his poverty might be rich". How touching that is! The Spirit of God brings in these thoughts of poverty and riches, because He is going to speak of giving, in a material way, for the help of the Lord's people. God employs these words and one is touched by them; and, as I say, they are most blessed!
What one would remark on is that we should be rich spiritually; God loves to see the wealth that He has enriched us with in Christ worked out in our souls, so that we move about here in a certain spiritual dignity and magnanimity. God looks for these things; He hates the smallness and niggardliness which belong to the flesh. As regards Paul, he was "as poor, yet making many rich". There was a largeness of soul in him, and so he says, "ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections", (@2 Corinthians 6:10,12). The principles of the world had got amongst the Corinthians, and so they had become narrowed in their affections. Even the philanthropist, so called, of the world is small, he has in view his own greatness; whereas, in Christianity, it is what God is, it is the greatness of God expressed through His people; and so the apostle looked for spiritual expansion amongst the Corinthians.
Through these letters, he labours to bring that about, and in @2 Corinthians 8 and 9, he deals with this subject of giving, and brings in these words, involving what is so touching in regard to our Lord Jesus Christ. At the end of chapter 8 he speaks about those who carried the bounty of the saints; he says, "whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow-helper concerning you: or our brethren be inquired of, they are the messengers
{96}
of the churches, and the glory of Christ". What a touch as to the merit of what is in view! although the thing is material in itself, it expresses what Christ is; "the glory of Christ". In that simple service there was the shining out of what Christ is now in all His wealth, "the glory of Christ".
To go back to the riches with which we are enriched, I would remark on the working out of it in the assembly, and so in chapter 14 of the first epistle, where he speaks of the order of the assembly he brings in these remarks. "How is it then, brethren? when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation"? I call attention to the word *hath* in the verse; we are supposed to have something, when we come together, according to the riches, or the prosperity, of our souls. And so the question is raised in my soul, What have I as among the people of God? One hopes it would be raised in each one of our souls.
In the Old Testament we have abundant foreshadowings of what is in the mind of God; in the history of creation we see how He arranged things, that although He could create out of nothing, yet His thought was that the earth should bring forth fruit, so that man and beast should have food. "The cattle on a thousand hills" (@Psalm 50:10) were indirectly the product of the earth; and vegetables too, of all kinds. The idea, on the part of God, was that the earth should bring forth, and that man should be sustained by what the earth yielded. The manna was an exception; manna suggests that there was no fruit on the earth, for the wilderness was a sterile place, and in it there was nothing for man or beast, but the manna came down from heaven. The thought of God is that something should be developed in the way of fruit; He gave His sunshine and rain to water the earth. In @Hebrews 6 it is said that
{97}
"the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God". God has delight in the fruit coming up, and He adds His blessing. The writer is speaking to the saints, as those who have received ministry from Christ, from heaven, and fruit was expected.
God looks for results. When you come to Exodus you have the same principle: God could easily have provided means to meet their requirements for the tabernacle but it must come through the affections of the people; and it is very cheering to see how the people responded; there was an excess. The tabernacle was made according to the pattern, but the material came in the way of a heave-offering from His people. And so today God's thought is to work through the spiritual gifts of His people. They did not all bring the same thing for the tabernacle; but in result the material was all brought and there was abundance.
And so in Leviticus, where you have God dwelling amongst His people, he speaks of offerings. There were burnt offerings, meat offerings, peace offerings, and in each case the people were supposed to have *something*, a handful of meal if nothing more. There was a variety of gifts, so that the rich and the poor could each contribute. Mutuality is a great thought in Scripture; that is, that each one has part, either in contributing to what we are brought into or receiving of it. God blesses each of us, the rain comes upon us all, and hence God looks for fruit, even from the very poorest spiritually, so that no one is shut out. "Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ", (@Ephesians 4:7).
And then in @Numbers 7 we have a most remarkable evidence of spiritual giving; that is, in the *princes*. The princes each gave the same, and it was bountiful giving. Princes are men who are spiritually great;
{98}
they are spiritually well off. We were remarking on the apostle Paul, how in writing to Philemon he uses his means for the benefit of another; so these princes gave freely of the wealth they had, and in result it expressed the practical unity that existed in Israel. There was no rivalry between them; their gifts expressed their practical unity. They all had the same love for Christ and for His people, we may say. They provided wagons for the Levites who had heavy burdens to bear; they gave with a measure of intelligence as to what was needed. In the book of Numbers, as I said, these princes express the practical unity that should be seen among the people of God, in the way of spiritual giving. Then we may refer to the giving of David. In first Chronicles we read of the wealth with which he lavishly, one might say, and with intelligent affection, provided for the house of God; and on the part of the people also there was abundant giving for the house that was to be built. Read @1 Chronicles 28 and 29.
In the New Testament you find the importance of giving constantly, and in @1 Corinthians 14:26, you see a certain variety of spiritual contributions which could be made as opportunity offered. The chapter affords instruction as to how they should be made. There is a variety in the unity that marks the things of God. I am speaking now of the wealth that God looks for amongst His people, and the question is, What have we? Has one a doctrine? It is something that one has in one's soul by the Spirit. A psalm is an experience that one has with God, so that one gives it out for the benefit of others; one expresses the experience of one's soul with God. Doctrine is the intelligent apprehension of the mind of God; that is important among the people of God. And so on, one has a tongue, a revelation. We do not look for these now, but I speak of the
{99}
principle and the general need of having something, so that one may contribute to the edification and comfort of the saints, as opportunity offers.
God would have the riches with which He has blessed us developed amongst us, as we are together in fellowship with one another. May it be so in the power of the Spirit!
{100}
THE GATES OF ZION
@Psalm 87
In turning to this scripture, it is my desire to set out, in so far as I am enabled to do so, that system of things in connection with which the gospel stands, and is presented to men. In using the word *gospel*, as seeking to preach it, the heart is touched, for it is that which prominently marks the present time.
The Lord, standing up in the synagogue at Nazareth, having spoken of the things that He had been anointed to do, in the preaching of the gospel, ends by saying, "to preach the acceptable year of the Lord", (@Luke 4 18,19). In the acceptable *year*, the mind is directed to *time*. The period of grace, on the part of God, extends for a whole year spiritually. A year is a long period in contrast to an hour, or a day, or a week, or a month. It is the longest period of time that is regulated by the sun, and it is my privilege to say to you tonight that, although the acceptable year is running out, we are still in it -- it yet remains. I may say at this point, that all the happenings in this world under the government of God, have this year of acceptance in view, as though God would accentuate it. By allowing woes to come into human circumstances, He intends to impress men with their need spiritually, and as they discover their need, they find that they are still within this glorious year, called "the acceptable year of the Lord". Thus I would remind you that, although it is fast running out, it has not yet run out, it still remains, and as your soul turns to God now, you find that He is prepared to accept you, having devised (as He alone could) a means for your returning to him. When you do return, you will find Him ready to accept you. That is what marks the acceptable year of the Lord. Much history has taken place
{101}
from man's point of view, but from God's point of view it has continued to be an acceptable year.
I desire, first of all, to speak about His foundation. "His foundation is in the holy mountains". We are not told in the passage *what* the foundation is, the point is, *where* it is, and the soul is at once assured as to this; it is "in the holy mountains"; in other words, "the foundation of God is sure". Do you understand it? When Luke wrote to Theophilus, his apology for writing was that Theophilus might be sure about the things in which he had been instructed. We can thank God for every bit of instruction that comes to us in regard to Him. If as little ones, we are brought up under Christian influence, and if we are instructed by our parents in the things regarding Christ, we may, I repeat, thank God for every bit of such influence, and such instruction. God would have parents bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Children ask questions, and Scripture provides for their questions. In the books of Moses you find that parents are furnished in view of the questions of their children, so that they should know how to answer them. Luke discovers spiritually what Theophilus needed; he needed to be sure about the things that he had already received, and in which he had been instructed. Now are *you sure* in regard to those things? Have you a settled sense of security in regard to God? Are you *sure* in regard to judgment to come?
Luke and John are the only evangelists who explained why they wrote. John says, "these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God". One hears of young souls being converted to God lately. Thank God for every one such. As converted they believe something. It may be in the forgiveness of sins. Thank God
{102}
for that! I have often said when talking to souls, that even a handful of meal (referring to the type) is sufficient to give a soul a status with God. The handful of meal typifies the smallness of faith that one may have in the Person of Christ, but it is a real faith. A real faith in Christ's Person suffices for God, but then God has not done with such believers. John says, "These are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name", (@John 20:31). He wants you to have, not only forgiveness, but *life*.
We have been speaking of David being ruddy when he came into the midst of his brethren. He was not ill-fed, there was in his countenance the evidence of life. Look out for that! A believer in Christ has life. You do not need the life that this poor world affords you, if you have life in Christ. It is said of the wicked woman in the book of Proverbs that "her house inclineth unto death", (@Proverbs 2:18). Hence the great necessity for young believers to know something about life. The gospel not only announces forgiveness; it also announces life and so John says "that ye might have life in his name". My natural life down here is held in regard to the will of God, but then I hold spiritual life in the Name of the Lord Jesus. I am not to be deprived of it; and it is further said, it is *in* Christ. I commend this to young Christians. I want to see a ruddy countenance (the evidence of spiritual life), and that you have a constitution for God. I have often thought of that in connection with Jairus daughter. The Lord raises her up, and delivers her to her parents, commanding that something should be given her to eat. As converted, as forgiven, as having the Spirit, you need to eat; you have life, and that life must be sustained.
I turn to God's foundation: "His foundation is
{103}
in the holy mountains". The foundation, as I remarked, stands, it is sure. Are you sure, I ask again, in regard to God? Are you sure that the foundation on which you are resting for eternity is immovable? It cannot be shaken, not only is it laid in the mountains, but in the "*holy* mountains". The Lord Jesus, hanging on the cross, said to God, "Thou art holy". He recognised that the holiness of God necessitated His being there. He was there that you should never come into judgment. His being nailed there involved a foundation which should be immovable, for it involved the righteousness of God being fully met. The Lord Jesus Christ as bearing the judgment, looks up to God and says, "Thou art holy". The holiness of God against sin required that Jesus should hang on the cross. He died there, He laid down His life, and all your sins and mine were attached to Him by God. He was *made sin*, and He died a sacrifice for sin. He laid the foundation of God, as it were, in the holy mountains. The foundation is laid in that which is immovable.
The Psalmist further says, "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob". Now the gates are very suggestive here, and they remind one of what is presented in the book of Acts on the day of Pentecost. God, as it were, opened the gates of Zion. I am speaking of them, not as that through which you go into privilege, but as that in which blessing is administered. The Lord Jesus says, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water", (@John 4:10). Jesus was administering divine bounty, and so, on the day of Pentecost, Peter stands up, as one might say, in the gates of Zion, and announces the gospel. He says, "having received of the Father the promise
{104}
of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear", (@Acts 2:33).
What a moment it was! "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob". There is administered that which is wholly according to His own heart -- the gift of the Holy Spirit through the finished work of Christ. How God loves to pour blessings into your soul! Zion refers to God's sovereign mercy, for blessing is poured into our souls on that principle. How it humbles one! Are you humbled as you receive the mercy of God? I love Mary's word, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word", (@Luke 1:38). And so with every one of us, as we rightly receive what is administered through the gates of Zion. It humbles us, and that is God's desire; we are not inflated, for we do not deserve it. "According to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour", (@Titus 3:5,6). The more the gospel is understood, the more the soul is humbled in the presence of God and of Christ. One would desire to be in accord with the gates of Zion when announcing the gospel. It makes nothing of me, and everything of God and of Christ. Everything on the principle of sovereign mercy humbles one, and the more humbled one is, the more blessing one receives. God is a giving God; He loves to give, and He loves "a cheerful giver". Let us, who are Christians, remember that! Do I understand that I am linked up with the city of God, the city whose gates are marked by blessing, on the principle of sovereign mercy? How humbling and yet how blessed! The Lord loves those gates, He loves to see the administration of bounty, as it is received on the part of men down here. What a desire on the part of God, that in this acceptable year of the Lord there should be these gates of
{105}
Zion, through which He administers His sovereign bounty!
The Spirit of God now turns to speak of other cities and countries, Rahab, Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, Ethiopia. He speaks about birth-places, for in Scripture it is not only *the day*, but *the place* of one's birth. The Scriptures attach importance to both time and place. For the moment I only speak of place. Where have you been born as a Christian? Under what influence? Many true Christians are deformed and they are devoid of spiritual dignity. They are deformed because of the circumstances of their birth, they are wanting in dignity because of ignorance of their parentage and the place of their birth. The Spirit says, "I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me; behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there", (@Psalm 78:4). Do you talk about being an Englishman, or a German, or an American? Is there anyone here who has such a thought in his mind? There were heroes in Rahab, Philistia, Tyre. In Scripture the king of Tyre is likened to Satan himself; he must have been a very notable man in his day.
And so, as one scans the history of the nations, certain men stand out prominently in connection with each, and the nations make much of them. You will find in every country memorials of the heroes of that country. But, "of Zion it shall be said, this and that man was born in her; and the highest himself shall establish her". Paul was born there, and Peter was born in her. I have seen in a museum the memorials of the great men of the world, including Peter and Paul, and the Lord Himself. His Name put up alongside that of wicked man! But He is not accredited to this wicked world. The sixth verse of our Psalm refers, I believe, to Christ; He is accredited to this great system in which God
{106}
delights, and in which He administers His bounty. "This man was born there". May I not rejoice in spirit, as I think of the blessed fact, that I am connected with that in which He is the living Head?. When the full result of redemption is seen, it shall be said of Him, "That he hath done this", (@Psalm 22:31). Do you understand that as a believer you are born there? "The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people". Think of that for a moment. God is going to make a census!
There is a book called the "Who is Who" book. You will find it on the Atlantic steamers. It is a book in which the names and particulars of people of note are written. God has got His "Who is Who" book, God writes up the people. Think of my name being put down by the blessed God! Think of your name being written, young Christian! You may be counted as nothing and despised because you believe in Christ. Your fellow workers may look upon you with scorn. Just think how your name is to be written up! "The Lord", it says, "shall count". Shall He omit one? He will not omit one; even the hairs of your head are numbered. What a glorious system the Christian belongs to! The Lord stands related to you, and "He upholds all things by the word of his power". He "was born there". I say this so that you might be encouraged in starting out on your Christian path. "As well the singers as the dancers shall say, All my springs are in thee". There is enjoyment in Zion, for there are the "singers" and the "dancers". You will remember how the elder brother in @Luke 15 heard the music and dancing. God has everything in this blessed system for the satisfaction of the saints. The singers and dancers say, "All my springs are in thee". They do not draw from the world's source, they find all their springs in Zion. The springs originate in Him who established Zion.
{107}
I would commend these things to you for your encouragement, that you may see, that as you begin you are to proceed, and to be instructed in the gates of Zion. "Every good gift, and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning", (@James 1:17). He is "the same yesterday, and today and for ever", (@Hebrews 13:8). And so we receive of His heavenly bounty "good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over". (@Luke 6:38) It is all within the reach of the believer, and you belong to a system which is associated with the glorious Name of Christ. The soul is detained in His presence. In @Hebrews 12, it is said that "ye have come ... to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant", the One who will make it good in our souls.
May the Lord bless His word, for His Name's sake!
{108}
GOD'S ACTIVITY IN THIS DISPENSATION
@Luke 15:20 - 24; @Philemon 8 - 19
Perhaps nothing is more difficult than to retain always in one's mind the character of the day in which we live: that it is a day in which God has a free hand through accomplished redemption, and is active in love, for the blessing of man. His heart is in it, and He is loth to abandon this day. With this in view I call attention to the passage read in @Luke 15, it being one that pre-eminently presents this thought to us. And in that connection I would speak of the results God seeks; indeed, not only what He seeks, but what He *finds*, for God is not labouring in vain. In regard to the creation of the earth, it is said that He created it not in vain, or empty, but in order that it should be full of intelligent, responsive people. So, wisdom being with Him at the beginning, as we are told in @Proverbs 8:31, rejoices "in the habitable part of his earth", and its delights were "with the sons of men". God's activities have results in view that are obtainable. His activities are not in vain, nor shall they cease until every one of the elect obtains "the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory". What an excess! the elect are to obtain "the salvation which is in Christ Jesus *with eternal glory*". (@2 Timothy 2:10) What a thought God had! and these activities still go on whilst the Holy Spirit remains on this earth, so that one is reminded of the words, "This is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it", (@Psalm 118:24).
I want to show the results that He seeks, and the results that He obtains. In the first two parables in this chapter we find the results definitely stated. The sheep is *found*; but then you do not put the best robe on a sheep; the figure does not fit, nor does it fit as to the piece of silver; but when we come to
{109}
the son, whom we call the prodigal, it is put on him. In the prodigal you have inward movements which are not seen in the sheep, and, of course, not in the piece of silver. The movement there was that the woman should sweep the house; and so in regard to the sheep, the movement was altogether with the shepherd; but when you come to the prodigal son, you find, not only movement on the part of the father, but movement in the prodigal himself: "he arose and came to his father". The sheep, as a figure, would come into the first of Genesis; it belongs to the animal sphere, which, although it has affection, has no conscience, the lower creatures are said to be "living souls", though they have no conscience; but when you come to man, he has a spirit which God has given him, and also a conscience.
Every man, woman, and child has derived something directly from God; you do not get your spirit from your parents, you get your spirit from God, and the spirit that God has given you is the link between you and Him. You have also a conscience, which the sheep has not. I am not speaking now of what the sheep may represent otherwise, I am just drawing attention to the difference when you come to the prodigal. The parable of the sheep does not touch the truth of man's responsibility to God. The prodigal is a being who has a link with God, even although his associations are with wicked men; even though he wasted his substance, yet he had that link in his spirit that he had from God. "The spirit shall return unto God who gave it", (@Ecclesiastes 12:7). And so the movement begins with him, according to the parable.
If there is one here who has wandered from the sphere of light, and who may be in associations, other than such as are commendable, God has a link with you in the spirit He has given to you, and in the conscience He has given to you. The
{110}
spirit was given from God in @Genesis 2, the conscience in @Genesis 3, and these two things remain with every man, woman, and child, and we may thank God for them.
In view of that the gospel is announced, and so there is a possible movement: it says of the prodigal, "when he came to himself". I apprehend that he came to a sense that he was a responsible man before God; his spirit had been received from God and one's spirit, in this respect, is oneself; and when you come back to that, serious and happy results follow. "When he came to himself"; what a moment in the history of that young man's soul! and then he assays to move: he says, "I will arise". The sheep could not say that, nor could the piece of silver; the young man said it. He talked with himself, and really that is how blessing begins in the soul. When one begins to reckon with oneself, in the presence of God, as responsible to Him, there is hope; there is the evidence that a work of grace has been begun in the heart. No matter how you may hide yourself in associations, and dull your senses in sinful practices, you cannot definitely forget your responsibility to God; so that when grace works, the first effect is that there is a sense of this responsibility, as was the case with this young man, who says, "I will arise and go to my father, and say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee".
Let us not be afraid of the word *resolution*. "I will arise and go". That is the resolve of responsibility; you determine to go. He knew in some measure what his father was; he had not forgotten him; he knew what was in his house; he had *some* light. It is doubtful if there is anyone in the whole realm of Christendom who has not *some* light. "The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart", (@Romans 10:8). And he arose and came
{111}
to his father; this brings out the divine side, the father's activities, "When he was a great way off"; there is a very great distance yet, spiritually, between one returning thus and God; but it is soon removed, for the father *ran*, and fell on the prodigal's neck and kissed him. But the removal of the distance is from the divine side; as to the prodigal's state, much had yet to be done to make him fit for the house. What follows answers to this, but there was nothing imputed to him; the father kissed him before he made his confession. The confession of verse 21, was right, it was due to the father, but the kisses preceded it.
Is there anyone here who has been away from God? Perhaps you have turned your back on the light, and on the privileges involved in Christianity, and find yourself in associations of evil, where there is dearth, where there is no spiritual food. I would appeal to you in regard to movement, for movement is essential on your side; it is a moral necessity; I would encourage you to resolve in your heart to move out of the way of the world, and come to God.
Now I want to speak to you about *God's* movements: "When he was a great way off". When the Spirit uses the word *great*, He means it. There was as yet a great moral distance between that young man and God. So God would shorten the distance. God is ready to do it now. The "great way" is looked at from His side; God, as He looks into your heart, knows just how far you are away; but He would remove that distance. I have often thought of the position of the cherubim in the tabernacle and temple. In the tabernacle they looked down on the mercy seat; there they saw the *blood*. In the temple they looked toward the house, or, as we may say, straight out. God has found satisfaction in the death of Christ, every claim of His throne has been met, and so in the temple, the cherubims look straight
{112}
out. The whole human race has come into the view of God; Simeon spoke of "a light for revelation of the Gentiles", (@Luke 2:32). The veil is taken off and God looks out, without any discrimination, on the whole human race, and wherever one moves toward Him, He would run, as it were, to meet that one. Is that not blessed to your soul? It is to me; it is wonderful to me that that is the blessed attitude of God now. We were speaking about divine emotion, and we have it here. We have become so familiar with @Luke 15 that it hardly moves us; this wonderful presentation of God *should* move our hearts. He leaves the government of the nations with angels, but He does not leave it with the angels to attend to a returning soul. "There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth". It is God's own joy. Here God is moved; it says, "The Father had compassion"; and, having compassion, He runs to meet the returning son; and then His love is expressed in the kiss. These are the kinds of divine movements that characterise our dispensation. Every Christian can give some account of the manner of *his* reception as he returned to God.
Now, God would have this returning, repentant one suitably attired. We should know how we are to be clothed, as received and forgiven; how we are to be attired; how we are to be in the house. "Bring forth the best robe"; one is to be there in the best robe; let us not shrink back from the *best*; it is the divine thought for us. God is going to surround Himself, through the gospel, with men who are clothed spiritually in the very best. How do we appear before God? You may have a correct religion, attend the meetings, and yet be far short of this. We are to be before God as Christ is, for it is said, that "as he is, so are we in this world". (@1 John 4:17) Only thus could we be of the "household of God". We are to be there attired in the very best. The grace
{113}
thus shown is overpowering, when rightly understood, but it exists for us to appropriate and enjoy. We were speaking today about this; when Cornelius expected Peter he invited his relatives and his near friends; they were all invited to the house, and Peter comes and preaches; and it says, "While Peter yet spake these words the Holy Spirit fell on all them which heard the word", (@Acts 10: 44).. It was God embracing the returning Gentiles; He would have them to know His love; He would have them to know He delighted in their company; that was His welcome. He did not leave it to Peter to welcome them. He said, as it were, "I will let them in myself". This is what God has done. Peter simply commanded baptism; but the Gentiles were already received, they were now fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God.
I would put it to the young people here, some of you have been converted only a short time; you have turned to God, and yet there is possibly a sense of distance between your soul and Him. I want you to know that God would have you with the best robe on, a ring on your finger, and shoes on your feet; and He would have you to enjoy the merriment: He says, "Let us be merry". Every Christian is included in the house. God would graciously include every one of us. He would have us rejoice with Him in the great results of the death of Christ. It says, "they began to be merry". Have you begun to be merry? You must have something for your soul to feed on; you may rejoice in the light now, but if you do not come into the blessing that is in the house of God, your light will grow dim. The world will offer you its pleasures, but God would have you begin to be merry spiritually now, and then the world will have no attractions for you. Your salvation, in a practical way, depends on this. If you do not find satisfaction for your soul in the things
{114}
of God, in His house, the world will influence you, and you will become a victim to it. The Father says, "Let *us* eat and be merry". God would have us all to participate in the joys of His house.
The apostle Paul was entirely in accord with the spirit of the house. An aged man and a prisoner of Jesus Christ, he writes to his dearly beloved and fellow-labourer, Philemon, on behalf of a young convert, Onesimus, and now a brother beloved. He might have boldness to *enjoin*, but for love's sake he would beseech Philemon for the dear brother he was now sending to him. How much do we do, dear friends, for love's sake? He does not say, "the love of God", but just "for love's sake"; that great thing that has come to light in the death of Christ. "Hereby we have known love, because he has laid down his life for us", (@1 John 3:16). Paul was entirely unselfish; he was in keeping with God, and so he writes a letter "for love's sake". Onesimus had fled from his master, but he came into Paul's arms, into the arms of love, for Paul was in accord with God. I think that is a point young Christians should understand. The house of God down here is in accord with God; love is there; and the apostle Paul represented that, and now he writes to Philemon on behalf of Onesimus, whom he had begotten through the gospel, in his bonds. He states that Onesimus had been unprofitable, but now he was profitable both to Philemon and the apostle. In a word, Onesimus is sent back as "a brother beloved". This shows what a change the work of God had brought about in Onesimus. Am I a brother beloved? Are you? If not, then neither of us is rightly formed by the gospel. Paul says, "That thou shouldest receive him for ever; not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved ... ... If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that
{115}
on mine account". The evidence of love in all this is most touching, but it is, in measure, what each young believer may count on in the house of God now.
But what a result, in the apostle, of the revelation of God! God has met, in Christ, the liabilities of the sinner; Paul, in his measure, undertakes the liabilities of "a brother beloved". I cannot undertake the sinner's debt, only the blood of Christ can meet his liabilities; but I can help a brother; I can undertake, in a measure, his liabilities. Such is Christianity; it is the reflection of God in Christ. Thus, in our measure, we may help the young. One great thing at the moment is to retain the young. Satan is after them, and God is seeking them; He turns their hearts towards Himself, but now there is that which they need down here in the way of service, and the apostle Paul sets before us an example. One is to undertake the liabilities of others; God enables us to do it; so the apostle says, "If ... he oweth thee ought, put that on mine account". Paul had a good sized balance with believers! Have I a good balance with the brethren? It should be an exercise if I have not. Paul can write a cheque, as it were, to Philemon. He says, "I, Paul, have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it; albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides". He had a balance, as we may say, and he could use it for Onesimus; but he undertakes to repay, and in this way the brother beloved would be relieved of liabilities and also would be free in his relations with his master.
Evidently the apostle had a doubt as to whether Philemon would celebrate, as the father of the prodigal did, the occasion of the return of the one who had left him as a slave, but was now, through God's grace, a "brother beloved". So he gently suggests that Philemon might be in accord with
{116}
@Luke 15. Let us then who are spiritual, and have spiritual means, employ them for the help of our brethren, so that they may be as "brethren beloved". And to the young I would say: have it before you to be that. As believers it is your privilege to say, 'I am now a brother, I am of the Father's household, the Father's love is mine, and I have the love of the brethren'; for, as the apostle says, it is "for love's sake"; each one is to act in the house "for love's sake". If I have not love, I am nothing. Obviously we must possess love; as "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts" (@Romans 5:5) it works out in love towards God and towards the brethren.
My word is to impress you with the thought that we can be, as the product of the gospel, "brethren beloved". May God bless His word!

Pages 117 - 190 - "Revelation -- General and Special and the Holy Spirit in relation thereto", Hampstead. June, 1919 (Volume 46).
REVELATION -- GENERAL AND SPECIAL
@John 1:18; 17:26; 20:19 - 23
In what I have to say, I desire to point out the distinction that has to be made in the things of God between that which is *general* and that which is *special*. The declaration of God spoken of in @John 1 is general, whereas that referred to in chapter 17, and amplified in chapter 20, is special. My impression is that Christians generally are content with the former, and, indeed, it is in a very limited way, that even that is understood. Now what is general is very wonderful in itself, for the revelation of God extends to all in this present dispensation, and will extend to millennial times in the future. It is not said to be made to any class in particular, it is for all. John tells us, "the only begotten Son ... he hath declared him", without saying *to whom*; but when you come to chapter 17 the Lord is speaking to the Father, and the chapter, which stands by itself, discloses to us the breathings of His heart, not as regards the world, but as to those given to Him out of the world. He is thinking specially of them, and He ends by saying, "I have declared unto them thy name". It is not simply "declared", as in chapter 1, but "declared *unto them*": and then in chapter 20 He enlarges upon this, when the hour of it arrives; that is to say, the enlargement or development of it is in spiritual surroundings in the upper room in Jerusalem. The difference in this way lies between what is in the upper room in Jerusalem and what is public.
The thought of the revelation in @John 1 is typified by the sun in the heavens, and one would love to
{118}
know more of it. It is impartial, for it shines on *every man*. No one in the good of the revelation of God could be a partisan; he would be in accord with God and therefore impartial. In this sense locality is nothing to him; he is not concerned about his own locality more than others; of course, local responsibility has its place in another connection. I say this, because of the great disposition of our hearts to be local. If you consider the development of church history and the Romish system, the latter claims to be catholic, whereas the very conception of it is local. Rome is a locality dominating a much wider area; that is the idea, but no locality on earth is great enough to dominate the house of God. The Son of God in heaven is over it; this is the thought presented in Scripture. Christ is Son over God's house. Romanism is local in the conception of it, and is thus not in keeping with the revelation of God.
In @John 1 we have that word, "The true light was that which, coming into the world, is light to every man". John the baptist was not that light; he was a burning and a shining light, but his ministry, although it witnessed to Christ, was local as having reference to Israel. He was greater than all who went before him, but his light had reference to that nation. Hence he was not the *true* light. "The true light was that which, coming into the world, is light to every man". *That* light was not partial, it was not local or circumscribed, but general. It takes account of every man, and shines for all; so the Spirit of God goes on to say, "No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". It does not say to *whom*; it is the plain statement of the all-transcendent, wonderful fact that the God, who had never been seen at any time, is now declared. The sun shines not only on every country, but on
{119}
*every man*; and the knowledge of God in a man renders him a light, and no one is really such who is merely local in his feelings and aspirations.
Now it is in this connection that the house of God stands, and it must be that in which God shines out universally. It is not only a place in which He lives, but it is also a place in which God shines. It is said of the heavenly city that it "lieth four-square", (@Revelation 21:16) that is, it is universal. It has the glory of God; it comes down "having the glory of God", (verse 1) and that must not be restricted. So the house is in the light of the revelation of God. It is not formally treated of in local epistles, it is a general idea; it is not centred in any locality, it is centred in heaven. It is spoken of as the "*gate* of heaven", (@Genesis 28). In "the gate" we have set forth all that is in heaven. The first mention of the house is in connection with a ladder set up between earth and heaven, giving the thought of communication with heaven. Jacob, when he awakes, says, "How dreadful is this place". (verse 17) His statement indicates the state he was in, but he also says, "this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven". Heaven would have a means of communication with earth, and on earth man is the chief object. Therefore in 1 Timothy, prayers in the house have all men in view, kings and all that are in authority, "for God is one". As revealed, God has not one thought for this nation, and another for that. "There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time", (@1 Timothy 2:5). That is what should mark the house, and I speak thus that in our souls we may be catholic, that we may emerge from being merely local; that while maintaining local responsibility we may have love to *all* the saints, and have all men in view for blessing. Paul speaks of the Colossians and Ephesians as having love "to *all* the
{120}
saints"; so in Timothy the prayers enjoined indicated that those who prayed were sympathetic with God as dwelling in His house. Therefore we are neither to be local nor national, but catholic. I use the word *catholic* advisedly, as it expresses the idea that is in my mind; every part of the house is dominated by Christ, and each part is of interest to Him, He supports in His sympathy every one in it. He is the great Priest over the house of God in order that He may maintain our souls in accord with God; it is a great thing that we should be enlarged in our affections.
Now in @John 17 the Lord is speaking, not of the world, nor of all men, but of His own. This is intensely interesting, involving, as it does, what is special, and it is not connected with any particular locality. It is general in the sense that it belongs to all that class of persons that the Lord has in His mind; that is, the apostles, and including "them also which shall believe on me through their word".
In @Matthew 16 He had raised the question with Peter and the disciples as to who He was; a question that tested their hearts. The Lord's questions are generally intended as tests; He knows what answers will be given, but He propounds questions as tests by which our state and measure are disclosed. The test is as to where I am, and my speech indicates where I am. "Whom say ye that I am?" the Lord inquired. It was a question that no one but Peter could answer, and the explanation of his ability to answer it is, that *the Father revealed it to him*. There never had been such an one as he on earth before, a man who could be designated *Peter*. He was able to answer this momentous question, "Whom say ye that I am?" He said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". It was a perfect answer, and the Lord immediately responds, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and
{121}
blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven". It was a revelation; it was not a general revelation, but a private one, and we have to understand this, we have to understand what it is to receive light in our souls as to Christ from the Father. The revelation constituted Peter a stone, material for the building. His answer was unequivocal. "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". It is as if he said, 'I see a man through whom God can effect all His will, and in whom His power is set forth'. Have you seen Christ in this way? John the baptist said, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" (@Matthew 11:3) but Peter virtually said, 'He is *before* me'.
The woman in @John 4 said, "When he is come he will tell us all things", and the Lord said in reply, "I that speak unto thee am he". The Father did not tell her that. You may say it was a revelation; but no, it was the statement of a fact: it was light by the *Lord's word* as to the Person before her, but not a revelation from the Father; she was not constituted a stone by that. Peter's case was unique. When John the baptist saw Jesus coming unto him, be said, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world". In that blessed Man coming to him he saw in prophetic vision the One who takes away the sin of the world. Jesus was fulfilling all righteousness, and John sees in Him the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world. That was the light, I repeat, in which Christ appeared to John when He walked *towards him*, as "he sees Jesus coming to him".
Then the next day John "*stood*". The Christ had come, the One through whom God would accomplish all His will had come, and John stands. He says, as it were, 'my work is done, the Son of God has come, *He* will do everything now'. The woman in @John 4 said, "he will *tell* us all things", but John
{122}
implies by standing that He will *do* all things. Then in chapter 3 John is *listening* to Christ; he was standing and *hearing* Him, but all this did not constitute John a stone, and this only emphasises the unique nature of the revelation to Peter. The revelation to him indicated a new beginning in which the Father took the initiative; He laid the foundation of a new structure. "The Christ" implies that God has in a Man one through whom He can effectuate all His thoughts; "the Son of the living God" is the vessel and expression of His power. The gates of hell cannot prevail against a building reared up on this foundation. "The Son of the living God" suggests the power of life.
There is nothing that abounds in Scripture more than this great theme of life; what exercise of soul must an Old Testament saint have gone through as he saw king after king and priest after priest die, sacrifice after sacrifice slain; one continuous course of death, death, death! The time of life had not arrived, but now Peter can speak of the "Son of the *living* God". What a moment was this for Peter! This was a private revelation which he received, and it constituted him a stone. Peter's confession represented the revelation he had received, and the Lord names it "this rock" on which He would build. His assembly. The Lord recognises that the revelation had been effective, and He takes account of Peter accordingly. Redemption had to be accomplished and the Holy Spirit had to be given before the truth spoken of here could become fully effective. The rock must be taken account of by itself. The Lord says, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee". It is not now as in @John 1, "the only-begotten Son ... he hath declared him", it is, "revealed it *unto thee*". There is first the revelation, and then Peter, as the one to whom it was made, is constituted a stone. I only mention this in order
{123}
to distinguish between what is general and what is private or special. @Matthew 16 was not general, it was not made to the eleven, but to Peter alone, and through him became light for all. Nothing could be more interesting, and the importance of it is what I would lay stress on, so that our souls might be on this rock, "the Son of the living God". "Hades gates", the whole system of satanic power, cannot prevail against it; it is invulnerable.
I pass on now to @John 20. I would desire to show how the declaration of chapter 17 has a *spiritual* connection. "I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it", the Lord says; it is a lovely thought and the Spirit in chapter 20 connects it with what is peculiarly spiritual. John's record has in view the establishment of a spiritual state of things among the people of God, that which is perhaps most lacking among us. Matthew in his gospel gives us political accompaniments of the resurrection; we have an angel with his *countenance as lightning*, which carries the thought of God acting on behalf of His people against the world. In Mark we get a *young man* on the resurrection morning, suggesting the energy in which the testimony is rendered and promulgated in this world. Luke gives us two men in shining garments, a heavenly and priestly suggestion; God had reached His thought of "good pleasure in men". But John has no man in his record, he speaks of *two angels*, "one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain".
It is noticeable that there is no reproof recorded in @John 20; and while John speaks of Peter and of himself going to "their own home", he mentions a good deal that denotes a certain spiritual element with them, and then goes on to enlarge on Mary, placing her first in reaching the tomb while it was yet dark, and drawing attention to her running to
{124}
the others. She was in line with the "hind of the morning" (see heading of @Psalm 22), and was in a position to receive a manifestation of Christ. Her *affection* led her into it. It may be said that she had not very much intelligence, but instinctively she was led into position. Shall we be in position when the Lord comes at the rapture, or shall our hearts be in the world? To be in position is to be apart from the world. May we be found watching! Mary is set before us as John's great character, so to speak, and there she is at the sepulchre before it is day; she is not seen with the others, she is alone, as John is occupied with spiritual elements, and she sets these forth. In verse 2 she runs, as already said, to the two disciples, and then they come to the tomb, and they go in first; she was a sister, and brothers lead. They see the linen clothes lying and the handkerchief folded up by itself, all suggestive of the dignity of the occupant, but when Mary looks in, she sees more than they do. She wept, it says, and looked into the sepulchre, and saw the two angels in white sitting. The two disciples did not see the two angels, for they did not *wait*.
There are *grades* of spirituality, and Mary was more spiritual than the two disciples; she had more affection. The angels address her. They say, "Woman, why weepest thou?" But now, note what it says in verse 14, "she turned backward". She heard what they had to say, but turned away from them; she placed the angels, one might say, in their own position, something else was before her, *they* were not what she sought. She is not affrighted as in Mark, she is spiritual and acts with intelligence. She "turned herself back"; it is a spiritual scene, and then she saw Jesus standing; she knew not that it was Jesus, but she saw Him standing; the fact is stated. Mary's act in turning herself backward, as I understand it, was an act of spiritual instinct,
{125}
and *how* important, if we are to have *special* light, that we should have spiritual instincts! The angels here, as I said, did not terrify Mary, they did not disconcert her; she turns from them, and then she sees Jesus. What a moment for her!
I just touch on this in connection with the setting of the private declaration of which the Lord speaks. He makes Himself known to Mary, and then says to her, "Touch me not", and immediately furnishes the reason, "for I have not yet ascended to my Father". In the garden He places a barrier between Himself and her, and goes on to say, "But go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God". Thus we find Mary constituted, through her spirituality, a messenger in the spiritual area: it is not a question of assembly order, or what comes under the public eye, it is the spiritual area, and so the Lord says, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God".
I would couple with this for a moment the scene in @Acts 1, where Luke, having told Theophilus of the Lord's charge to the apostles, adds, "to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days". We know how the Lord came in and stood in the midst of the disciples, the doors being shut. He came in amongst them, and the doors did not open. He did it in order to *suggest the spiritual*. Thus He came in and went out among them for forty days, appearing to individuals and to the company, and what for? To impress them with the great fact that a living and spiritual order of things had been established, and they were to have part in it. The Father and the Son and the brethren of Christ indicate what had come to pass, the great and blessed relationship opened up and established.
{126}
How wonderful! I would say again, this is all private and special. "I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it", and to what end? "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them", in other words, they were to be constituted vessels for the Father's love. Think of that; that the love wherewith the Father loved Christ should be in us, and Christ in us!
Well, this is what I had before me, and I have no hesitation in saying that it is a very great exercise with me that saints should become accustomed to what is special, and the special thing about the assembly is that it is brought into relationship with Christ in heaven as being itself heavenly; all this is obviously spiritual. Matthew, Mark, and Luke deal with what is more public in recording the facts of the resurrection of Christ, but John is occupied with what is private and spiritual. It is a family state of things that is contemplated, and the Lord comes in, the doors being shut, and does so in this way, in order to impress His people with the fact that things are to be spiritual. Man in his natural effort and ability is outside of all this; it requires what is spiritual; so the apostle says, "we have received ... the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God". He also says, "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard ... the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit". (@1 Corinthians 2:9,10,12) He has given to us His Spirit that we might know these things, hence it is through being under the control of the Spirit that we can participate in a spiritual order of things.
{127}
THE LIVING WATER
@John 4:1 - 15
J.T. We might consider the way the Holy Spirit is presented in the gospel of John, and I suggested this scripture, to begin with, as indicating how the need of the *individual* is met, so that he might be qualified for testimony in chapter 7; then, in the section from chapters 14 to 16 inclusive, we have the Spirit presented mainly in the character of Comforter, in relation to the *company*. And in chapter 20 He is not presented formally as the Person, it is the Spirit *characteristically* that is prominent. Christ as the last Adam breathed into His disciples and said, "Receive Holy Spirit"; the reference is to the lungs, so to speak.
In chapter 1 the Spirit is introduced by John in a general way, saying, "*he* it is" (referring to the Lord) "who baptises with the Holy Spirit". Baptism with the Holy Spirit conveys the idea that we are merged or covered in Him; it is a remarkable expression. "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body", (@1 Corinthians 12:13). So that, as baptised, one is, so to speak, merged in what the Holy Spirit forms here, and in that sense out of sight by the Spirit. This is of very great significance when considered in the light of what Christ does in taking up each of us and affecting us in this way, in baptising with the Holy Spirit.
M.W.B. Suggesting that He is the One who pervades everything through the Spirit, and is thus marked off as the Son of God.
J.T. He has power in that way to effect everything, so that all is merged in the Spirit. Baptism with water means that one is put out of sight. The idea of being baptised with the Holy Spirit is put over against John's baptism. In his case it was
{128}
baptism with water, in contrast to what Christ would do, in baptising with the Spirit; the latter is an immense thing for us. The former is negative, having reference to the judgment of sin, the latter is positive. In Corinthians the application of the baptism of the Spirit involves the truth of the body. "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body ... and have been all made to drink into one Spirit"; the double statement in the verse refers to the two ordinances, baptism and the Lord's supper, but making the thought spiritual. @John 1 brings Christ in, as the One who baptises with the Holy Spirit, so that finally the whole scene will be so characterised.
A.M.H. And will stand in relation to Christ as the One who does baptise.
J.T. Yes. The baptised stand in relation to Him.
A.M.H. Water is dissociation, while baptism with the Spirit links all with Christ.
J.T. In the application of this passage to Christians, the baptising with the Holy Spirit, the body is brought in; the principle in the millennium will be the Spirit pervading all; all will then, in some way, come under the Spirit, and will, therefore, be in accord with Christ. It is an immense thing, bringing in as it does the glory of Christ, and fitting in with @John 1, which deals with that. John minimises what *he* is doing himself. He affords us a model, a key to the gospel in this way; he was one who had great opportunity of exalting himself; none had greater; and yet he refused to take advantage of it. 'No', he said, in effect, 'I am going to make much of Christ; that is my mission'. The test he is subjected to brings that out; in his own estimate, he is just a *voice*. As to anything *I* am doing, he would say, it is not to be considered; it is what *Christ* is doing that is of moment. He is speaking of the insignificance of his work in comparison
{129}
with what Christ was doing. Of course his baptism was of great importance in its own place.
M.W.B. He says, "I must decrease".
J.T. Yes; it is the consummation of humility; his setting sun goes down with joy, so to speak, in the light of Christ. "*He* must increase"; so John disappears, not in any disconsolate way, but in joy. He is a remarkable model for us in these last days, and shines, too, in intelligence, as evidenced by his words when he sees Jesus coming to him, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world".
Rem. He had the Holy Spirit from his birth.
J.T. John the evangelist does not tell us anything about John the baptist's failure, showing, I think, that he has some special object in view in introducing him as he does.
H.N. He represents the beginning of what is spiritual.
J.T. Yes. He is introduced abruptly as a man sent from God and the Spirit immediately states, "He was not that light", as if to say, Do not be mistaken, he has come as a witness; but he is not *that* light, the true light has yet to come. John was partial in his outlook, but the Lord was bringing in what was universal.
J.H.W. John receives direct communication as to the Spirit; he says, "but he that sent me to baptise with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptiseth with the Holy Ghost".
H.N. With reference to baptising with the Holy Spirit, how would you connect, or contrast, it with the anointing of the tabernacle? Are they kindred thoughts?
J.T. The anointing is for *dignity*, and brings in what God is. Jesus was anointed; it does not say
{130}
that He was baptised with the Holy Spirit, but He was anointed. It gives dignity and qualification for service. Being baptised with the Spirit carries the thought of *being merged*, so that one's individuality is lost; it is what is effected through the Holy Spirit; the Spirit is *dominant* in the body.
P.L. You get this thought all through the gospel of John. You see it in Mary, Joseph, and Nicodemus. They are not heard of after a certain point. The history in detail of persons is not taken up.
J.T. So with Lazarus after chapter 12.
P.L. Is that the thought of merging? You have *brethren* at the end; their names are not given.
F.F. In chapter 10 we get "one flock" and "one shepherd".
J.T. Yes; the man in chapter 9 receives sight, but he is merged in the flock in chapter 10. Mary Magdalene would be merged in the brethren in chapter 20.
A.M.H. Does it touch reconciliation on Paul's line?
J.T. Yes, in Ephesians. I am pleasing to God as in relation to the body of Christ; "That he might reconcile both unto God in *one body* by the cross", (@Ephesians 2:16). Christ is the One on whom the Spirit descends and abides; all the pleasure and satisfaction of God are seen there. One gets a sense of the intense delight of God in this Man. First He is seen walking *to* John, suggesting His death; then the Spirit records that He is walking, without saying where to, "As he walked". According to Ephesians, we are reconciled as merged in the body.
P.L. Is the thought in one case His pathway into death, and the other His Person?
J.T. The former refers to His death; His coming to John suggested that; He was fulfilling all righteousness. Then it says, "And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of
{131}
God". It is an expression of admiration. What must the walk of that blessed Man have been to God! The two disciples apparently did not notice the beauty of that walk till their attention was called to it, showing perhaps the value of ministry. There are many things we do not see till our attention is called to them.
J.H.J. Christ is presented in regard to what He will effect for God, before reference is made to what is effected in us.
J.T. Yes. This is a wonderful chapter, seven or more different titles being employed to designate the Person of Christ. Baptism with the Holy Spirit is an immense thing in its bearing.
Rem. You inferred that the thought was carried on to the world to come. Will you say in what way?
J.T. You get it referred to in Joel, as quoted in @Acts 2, when the Spirit came and sat upon each of them. That is the public side of it, and Joel's prophecy received a partial fulfilment on that occasion. In @Acts 10 it is said that while Peter was speaking the Holy Spirit fell on all them which heard the word, and in recounting the incident, Peter says, "Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptised with water; but ye shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit". The same word *fell* is used in @Acts 10:44 as in @Luke 15, where it says the Father fell on the prodigal's neck; the Holy Spirit fell on all them which heard the word. It involves energetic action, not simply the ordinary thought of the word. The Holy Spirit, so to speak, takes charge of that company. While Peter is speaking the Spirit falls on his hearers, and in the next chapter Peter says, "And I remembered the word of the Lord ... *ye* shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit".
M.W.B. Peter recognised this action of the Spirit as being similar to what took place on the day of
{132}
Pentecost. "Even as upon us also at the beginning", he says.
H.N. Have you any thought as to why the baptism of the Spirit is linked up with the reception of the Gentiles?.
J.T. I think it shows the great interest the Lord had in the Gentiles. It is illustrated, as we were saying, in @Luke 15; God being so delighted with the returning Gentiles, He expressed His delight in this way. While Peter was preaching, God was, we may say, looking into the hearts of the audience, and He recognised what was there. The Holy Spirit would be given in reference to what was within, and now they would be characterised by this. So that @1 Corinthians 12 would have reference to it: "by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body"; hence the body is the vehicle for the moment by which this truth is exemplified.
H.N. 1 Corinthians would prepare for the anointing.
J.T. Yes. It is "the Christ".
Ques. Would baptism of the Spirit be the moral preparation for dignity?
J.T. It is presented there, "so also is the Christ"; and it brings in the thought of representation here. Dignity is placed on the vessel; it is the anointed vessel; (@1 Corinthians 12:12).
A.M.H. Is it Luke's line rather than John's? "The Spirit of Jehovah is upon me". (@Luke 4:18)
J.T. John speaks of it too, but Luke gives the anointed Vessel; (@Luke 4).
A.M.H. What is the thought of the anointing in John?
J.T. Independency of man in the sufficiency of the Holy Spirit. "Ye need not that any man teach you"; it saves you from antichrists. Luke gives the anointed Vessel for service here; "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
{133}
power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him". God stands by what He anoints. In Christ there was no disparity between the Vessel and the anointing. A vessel in whom there is discrepancy occasions sorrow, but the "oil" must be recognised.
M.W.B. God's vital system is always marked by what is comely.
J.T. Yes; the moral precedes the official. The Lord was anointed at the age of thirty; He was qualified according to what He was as Man. He came up from the water praying, and as He prayed, the Holy Spirit came upon Him. Then it is said that He "was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being forty days tempted of the devil". The Spirit took the initiative, which we can understand, and it was right that this should take place as regards the Lord, in having to do with Satan. If I have to do with evil, or if you have, it should be because the Holy Spirit leads us to it, otherwise we shall be damaged.
H.N. The Lord was *driven* by the Spirit into the wilderness according to the gospel of Mark. (@Mark 1:12)
J.T. Yes; the energy of the Spirit alone should lead one to take up evil. If I read a bad book or go to the playhouse, etc., it will do me harm, but if the Holy Spirit calls me to deal with evil, that is another matter; very few, however, are called to this.
Ques. Does Mark give you the controlling power of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. The Holy Spirit takes the initiative. Becoming Man, the Lord was subject, and so was *driven* into the wilderness; but after the temptation had ended *He returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee*; it is His Own action now. And then He stands up in the synagogue, turning formally to the text in the prophet Esaias and reading it, as if to
{134}
say, 'This is the text for the moment'. Luke seems to delight to expatiate on the grace of the anointed Vessel, and to record that the people "wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth".
M.W.B. Contrasting that with @John 1, we find His personal greatness attaching to what He did there.
J.T. It is His own personal dignity in John; it is what *He* does. He baptises with the Holy Spirit. He gives living water. As the other gospel presents Him, He is subject to the Spirit, and a pattern for us, but John gives us specially the personal glory of Christ.
J.H.J. Chapter 4 treats of the Spirit given to us.
J.T. All is set out there as what the Lord can effect. When we come to need in a man's soul, which chapter 4 presents, and the Holy Spirit in that connection, the woman being a representative case, you find the Spirit presented on the side of *gift*; in chapter 7 it is a question of *reception*. "This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should *receive*". Here in chapter 4 it is, "If thou knewest the *gift of God*".
M.W.B. What is the difference?
J.T. Chapter 4 is from the divine side; chapter 7 from the side of reception by the believer.
A.M.H. Is there a measure of state assumed in chapter 7?
J.T. The fourth chapter simply gives the divine gift, and is connected with the *Giver*, whereas chapter 7 emphasises the *receiver*.
A.M.H. "Living bread" precedes this, suggestive of the building up of a constitution.
J.T. The point in chapter 7 was not that He could *give* living water, but that any one who believed could *receive* it. It gives a sense of the greatness of the believer, and indirectly of the greatness of Christ as it is a question of the one who believes on *Him*.
{135}
M.W.B. There is a kind of royalty attached to the believer.
Ques. What produces the state that has been referred to?
J.T. First, there has been new birth (chapter 3); then living water (chapter 4); the power of the Son of God (chapter 5); and finally the Son of man as bread from heaven (chapter 6). There is thus brought about in the believer a state corresponding with chapter 7.
Rem. There is a moral order no doubt in the way these things are presented.
J.T. The greatness of the believer is drawn attention to, not indeed to occupy us with that, but to emphasise the greatness of Christ. 'Whatever you may think of Me', the Lord said in effect, 'even from a believer in Me flow out rivers of living water'.
P.L. Would the thought of "flow" refer to fertility, while the believing would have reference to Christ glorified?
J.T. I think that is right. The thought does not go beyond what is here; what is arid here is made more fertile with this influence. The Spirit is here in the way of general refreshment. The thought of rivers is a great one; it carries you back to @Genesis 2, and suggests influence and refreshment.
P.L. It is a primary and eternal thought.
J.T. Yes; but the point is *one* believer in Christ has rivers of living water, "This spake he of the Spirit", it says. It is the effect of the Holy Spirit coming from Jesus glorified, from heaven.
J.H.W. Christ, according to @Isaiah 32, is reproduced here. "As rivers of water in a dry place".
J.T. If we saw that, we should think the believer a person of some importance, and if we get a number of such persons we have what is greater still.
H.N. Believers meetings of that character would be all right!
{136}
Ques. The thirst in chapter 7 would be of a different character from that in chapter 4?
J.T. Yes. "Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink". (@John 7:37) It is thirst as to greater things I apprehend, and thus different from chapter 4. It supposes an intelligent state in believers.
H.N. Chapter 4 would be the result of the administration of chapter 3.
J.T. Yes; it shows the greatness of the administration. The Father loves the Son and gives everything into His hands, and this is the result, He gives living water.
M.W.B. Is the issue of chapter 4, the springing up, greater than that of chapter 7?
J.T. It may be greater for the believer, but morally rivers are greater, greater for man. Chapter 7 includes chapter 4.
M.W.B. I wondered if chapter 4 were priestly, setting forth the holy priesthood, and chapter 7 royal.
J.T. Yes; perhaps it would bring that in, and what you see in the two chapters is the unlimited character of what is of the Spirit. "God giveth not the Spirit by measure", chapter 3 tells us. Then in the next chapter it springs up into everlasting life, so that it touches what is eternal. We should consider the greatness of the believer as indicating the greatness of Christ, and when we think of the aggregate of believers in the heavenly city, we have some sense of the place it will fill in the universe of God.
A.M.H. Does the thirst in chapter 4 arise from lack of good, and in chapter 7 from having tasted good? You want more on that line, so that morally it is an advance.
J.T. Yes. You get the thought in Scripture of hungering and thirsting after righteousness.
{137}
M.W.B. Why is the term "living water" used and not "the Spirit"?
J.T. A thirsty soul appreciates water; nothing appeals to such an one more than water.
P.L. Would the fountain of living water meet conditions *in* the believer, and the "rivers" meet conditions *outside*?
J.T. Yes; hence the latter thought is greater. The lower affections are in view there; these are to be actuated; "out of his belly shall flow rivers", and we read of "bowels of compassions" (@Colossians 3:12). It is the taking account of man here in his need and showing mercy.
A.M.H. For that there must be stature.
F.F. Living water is connected both with God and with Christ in chapter 4, and with Jesus glorified in chapter 7.
J.T. Yes. *Jesus* suggests what He is as Man, the Head of man, and this is how He meets the boundlessness of men's need, through men like themselves.
W.C. This is the antitype of the feast of tabernacles when every need was met, and the widow and fatherless provided for.
J.T. Yes; it takes the place of that.
Ques. Does the position the Lord takes in chapter 7 have any bearing on our subject? They sought to kill Him. In chapter 4 we find Him coming to the woman and meeting need; in chapter 7 He is rejected, and the Jews feast of tabernacles is made prominent.
J.T. Yes, that is right; so in the next section that we shall consider, He gives the Holy Spirit as Comforter to be with His people, but here it is compassion more.
Rem. The feast of tabernacles should have been a time of joy, but they sought to kill Him.
J.T. It all serves to bring in the grace of the Spirit being given consequent on Jesus being glorified,
{138}
and it works out in those who receive Him, and thus the Christian is a benefit in the world, It is not a question of what we are to one another, but of rivers of water flowing out for the benefit of all.
Rem. It is greater than all that preceded it in God's ways.
J.T. Or anything that succeeds. It is the greatness of *Christianity*.
J.H.W. We are reminded of the spirit of David, anointed in the midst of his brethren. All got the gain of this.
J.T. Yes, even Nabal. That illustrates how chapter 7 stands. The believer affords God a vessel in which He can express His compassions to all men, and we are to be here in that light, not local, or national, but on the line of meeting need universally. It is what makes a man morally great.
Rem. "All the rivers run into the sea". (@Ecclesiastes 1:7)
J.T. We look to see the rivers, that is the idea. It is not here that they run into the sea, but the influence they exert on the plain, the fructifying effect on their way to the sea. The idea of a river is fructifying power. The primary suggestion is plural. "A river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads" (@Genesis 2:10) or "main streams". God influenced every part of the earth and refreshed every part. Rivers would suggest *volume*. The bearing of the rivers in Genesis was universal.
A.M.H. "There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God", (@Psalm 46:4).
J.H.J. The flow of the rivers in @John 7 would be more in view of the scene here than in view of the saints.
J.T. The bearing is *general*; we want to keep that in view. "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely". (@Revelation 22:17) The saints are always supposed to be evangelical.
{139}.
CHRIST AS HAVING COME FROM GOD AND GONE TO GOD
@John 13:18 - 20; 20:17,18
J.T. I suggested reading those two verses in @John 20 because one would wish that perhaps at the end we might see the distinction between *going* to God, *going* to the Father, and *ascending* to the Father. It may be worth pointing out that in the gospel of John much is made of the Lord's relation with God before incarnation, and also as having become flesh. It is said, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was *with* God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning *with* God", (@John 1:1,2) and "The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". (verse 18) His relation with God, with the Father, is emphasised.
Ques. Would you say a little as to what that relation was?
J.T. I should not like to define it beyond what is stated. The only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father refers to Him as having become flesh, but I would not like to go beyond that. All that is stated of Him before is that He was "with God", without defining or naming the relation.
Ques. Would it be right to say that the names under which the Lord is spoken of in Scripture as Man refer to Him as having become flesh? There is no name by which we can speak of Him as previous to that, but certain things are predicated of Him.
J.T. That is right so far as I understand it. We can speak of the Word, but then that *refers* to what He was *here*. It is *used* to speak of Him as in the past, in eternity, "In the beginning was the Word". The Spirit of God seems to veil what special relation there was, and it is therefore wiser to leave it there. The Lord speaks in chapter 17 of the "glory which
{140}
I had with thee" (referring to the Father) "before the world was", without saying what that was, but what is emphasised is the fact that He was "with God", and I think that has a moral significance as bearing on revelation, so that He comes out from God as having been with Him.
M.W.B. That is why you emphasise it as seen in the gospel of John?
J.T. I thought the Lord's position as having been with God should be called attention to, as to the force of it.
D.L.H. Then you are giving what one might call a moral force to the idea of coming from God and going to God?
J.T. I think that is justifiable, and as faith apprehended Him. Nicodemus says, "We know that thou art a teacher come from God" (@John 3: 2), and the disciples in chapter 16, as put to the test of their faith, say, "We believe that thou camest forth from God". They believed that, but these verses in chapter 13 show that His coming out from God is not all, for He also goes to God. The setting of these verses is very significant in view of what He does afterwards in washing their feet. It is a wonderful service that He rendered. The last passover, being about to take place, all this came into view. There is finality in what is stated as regards His service in testimony here. "He was come from God, and he went to God"; He had been in the world, and He was going to depart out of it to the Father; He had completed His testimony, and He goes to God. It is not here *how* He goes; we know that it was through death, but the point is that He goes *to God*.
Ques. What is the significance of going to God in this chapter and going to the Father in chapter 16?
J.T. You have going to the Father here, too; that is the first statement. "Jesus, knowing that
{141}
his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father". I think the two statements are to be distinguished; that is, His going to the Father out of the world, and then His coming out from God and going to God. The world is set over against the Father; coming out from the Father (@John 16:28) must carry with it more the thought of grace than coming out from God, and going to the Father involved in a way more for Him, because demonstration is brought to the world of righteousness, on account of His going to the Father. That a Man should go to the Father as having been here is very wonderful; it was a matter of righteousness.
M.W.B. What would you say is the primary thought connected with coming out from God? Is it revelation?
J.T. Yes; it is revelation, it is the "true light". "There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the light", but he was not the true light, and his testimony was partial in its bearing. "The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man"; it is impartial; and it greatly aids in regard of the revelation to see that God acts towards *all*, it is universal. The true light sheds its light on every man; instead of being limited to Judaism, it was universal, so that coming out from God is to make God known to all. It is not that every one has something revealed specially to him, but the revelation is there. So it says, "No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him"; His position in relation to the Father marks it, and is spoken of in connection with the declaration of God.
Ques. Would you say that He could not have received that which was given unto Him unless He came out from God and went back to God?
{142}
J.T. All things are said to be given into His hands here. We read, "Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands", so that all administration is in His hands.
Ques. Would you say the character of the Father and the heart of God are set out in this chapter?
J.T. I think what the Father is is involved. I mean, that the Father is the One to whom He has gone, involving righteousness, and then, too, He came out from God and went to God; that is, on the one hand, God is revealed, and on the other, a Man is with God, according to all that God is, so that going to God corresponds to coming *from* God, and His administration is based on it; the mediatorial system, and all that is ever to be seen publicly in this world, are based on it. What there may be specially for the assembly is not so much in view here: the whole mediatorial system and what flows from it is based on His going to God.
Ques. Do you mean that if revelation is toward all, His having gone to God necessitated that He should be the point of attraction for all?
J.T. It involves that, it is stated in the previous chapter, that as lifted up from the earth, all men should come to Him, He should draw all men to Him. What is stated here is that He knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands and that He was come from God and went to God, He riseth from supper.
D.L.H. There is a question arising here, and that is, that the Lord seems to make this statement about coming forth from the Father and so on, the preface to His acting particularly in regard to the circle, not exactly to men at large, but this particular circle that had been given to Him out of the world. Would you say something in regard to that point?
J.T. I think that their position here must correspond to the great truth of His position, as having
{143}
come from God and going to God, and they must be taught how to act. In all the dignity of what He knew, He laid aside His garments to wash their feet, having in view what they should be here, and that they should have part with Him; it had in view what they should be in this world, out of which He had gone publicly; they were to be marked by love among themselves, that all men might know that they were His disciples. To wash one another's feet, to take up this position that He indicates, requires losing one's dignity. He had laid aside His garments to perform it. "If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet". It is in all the dignity of what He knew that He laid aside His garments. I think that in rendering this service to one another in love they would be marked off as His disciples.
D.L.H. Was it in view, not only of their own association with Him in the new sphere which He was opening for them, but in view likewise of their position in relation to the world and their bearing in regard to it?
J.T. Yes, I think that is an important feature of this passage, that they should be marked off as *His disciples*.
D.L.H. But then "part with him" refers to the heavenly part, if we may so say, I suppose?
J.T. It may, if you introduce chapter 20 into it, but I think what we are now speaking of does not go beyond what we are here in this world, as being in a scene of defilement. It does not view us wholly in spiritual relations as chapter 20 does.
M.W.B. Would you say it is in view of it all?
J.T. We have to read chapter 20 *via* chapter 13, but I would connect chapter 13 with the Lord's supper, which brings in another line of things; it is parallel with the Lord's supper, which is a public matter.
{144}
D.L.H. Then the force in that case of "part with me" would be, as I understand, association with Christ in this present scene, identification with Him in rejection and suffering?
J.T. Yes, exactly. We are regarded as here where defilement is, but our spiritual relations with Christ, as chapter 20 suggests, do not contemplate us as in the scene of defilement, but rather as having part in what is heavenly.
J.J. How do you understand the necessity for the washing of the feet, if part with Me is down here?
J.T. It is important to have our feet washed. It is a distinct feature of God's testimony that He would have a people on this earth; He will also have a people in heaven. The two positions apply to us, we have part in both. This chapter has relation to us as here where Christ has been, and where defilement is, and it provides for the defilement so that we might be here according to Him.
M.W.B. Would it be right to say that chapter 13 commences a series of chapters, which regard the saints as taking Christ's place here, not so much spiritual blessing, but what is here?
J.T. Yes; that is the point. It is more the question of revelation here, and what flows from it, and then Christ *going* to the Father, not *ascending*, but *going* to Him and going to God, and that there is a people here according to Him, known as His disciples.
M.W.B. You lay emphasis on that verse. "By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if ye have love one to another".
J.T. I think chapter 13 is an immense thing for God, that He should have a people here according to what He is as revealed in Christ, and according to what Christ is as having gone to Him. We are connected now with the mediatorial system, which
{145}
Israel will come into, only, of course, we should grace it and magnify it in view of the greatness of our calling; but we are in that position provisionally. The Lord's supper and what we get in this chapter run together and have in view that we should be here according to what God is as revealed in Christ, and also according to what Christ is. The chapter shows what He is morally, One who in dignity can take the lowest place and serve others, so that God is rightly presented here in a Man, and that is an example or pattern for those left here in His absence.
Ques. Do we express love to one another in the action of stooping down to wash one another's feet?
J.T. Yes. In this way He teaches us how to serve one another by love. It is only a great man that can be small. The Lord shows here, not simply the fact that He was going to God, but knowing that He was going to the Father out of the world, that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He came from God and was going to God, in the dignity of all that He lays aside His garments, so that it is a truly great person that can be really small in service. Our position is to be, that we are out of the world as to our soul's apprehension, in the fact that He has gone out of it, and the Supper involves that. Baptism takes us out of the world positionally, and the Supper sustains our souls as we apprehend it, so that we are out of the world morally, yet in it publicly in testimony. We have part with Christ as having left the world, but it does not say where He is to be when you have part with Him here, it is simply that you have part with Him, but it is stated that He is going out of the world to the Father.
E.R. The idea of washing really is that you get abstracted from the scene in which you are, so as to have part with Him.
J.T. Yes, but it contemplates that you are in
{146}
that scene, whereas Ephesians contemplates your being raised up together and sitting down together in heavenly places, which is a spiritual matter and runs parallel with @John 20, our special privilege. This chapter 13 has in view a people provisionally for God, and we are to be kept from defilement, so as to be in accord with Christ and according to His pattern. Although @John 20 does not view us in heaven like @Ephesians 2, yet, being the brethren of the ascending One, our place is there.
Ques. Do you connect "part with me" with the thought of sharing in divine affections?
J.T. It is an important feature to have part with Christ, and I do not limit it in any way. What I would emphasise is the fact that we are found in a defiling scene and passing through it; that is one side of our position; the other is that we have part in heavenly things. @John 20 contemplates this latter; there we are viewed spiritually not as in this world, but as in Canaan; that is another matter which belongs also to us, but that there should be a people here in Israel's position is a matter of great importance with God and this is chapter 13.
W.G. Is it not the case that we must be in the enjoyment of divine affections to express them? "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves".
J.T. I think God teaches us to love one another. The Lord sets the example here of how love is to be expressed, and it is in service in humility. "By love serve one another".
Ques. In @John 20 you get resurrection. What would you get in this chapter?
J.T. Resurrection is not in view in this chapter, it is the wilderness position, it is the saints viewed in a defiling scene, and provision made for them in view of their being here after Christ. @John 20 is ascension.
{147}
Ques. Would you say that Peter made a mistake in associating defilement with washing?
J.T. I think defilement is suggested in washing. What the Lord did Peter did not understand, but he would understand afterwards.
J.C. You were speaking of His leaving the world and the Father giving all things into His hands. Is that the foundation of His service here?
J.T. I think in this sense that it suggests the great dignity that was there. He knew these things. We can easily understand that He knew them, but the Spirit emphasises that He knew them, and then in all that dignity He laid aside His garments, as if to suggest that in that moral dignity we are to serve.
J.C. In that way the object of the Lord's service here is to maintain His own in correspondence to what is true in Himself.
J.T. To maintain us *here*, I think, not exactly to fit us for heavenly places, though we cannot separate them, but to maintain us here in a public way.
H.H.S. Is the point that for us as found in a scene of defilement love is in danger?.
J.T. Yes. The great end is to have love among ourselves, and love is promoted by the continuation of this service.
D.L.H. Is your idea that the administration of all things being put into His hands by the Father, the Lord begins by administrating in regard to His own, so as to secure what is suitable to Himself during His absence?
J.T. I think so. It suggests to us the manner in which administration is to be carried on here. I suppose, the apostle Paul is the greatest example of it in the lowly, unselfish way in which he carried on his service.
D.L.H. And that was to mark the disciples, and in that way to be a testimony to Christ during His absence. In that respect the assembly, or the
{148}
saints when they are together for the Supper, present a very remarkable thought, that they are the only portion of the world of bliss that is as yet brought into relation with God. Is not that true?
J.T. Quite.
D.L.H. And that has to be maintained, hence the feet-washing; the moral thought has to be maintained.
J.T. If we studied Paul's ministry, or his manner of life rather, we should discover in a man of like passions to ourselves how the thing comes to pass, how it takes form. His letters to the Corinthians are marked by humility. A man, who was the means under God of enlightening them, becomes displaced in a measure amongst them, but he humbly waits on the brethren in grace, bringing in the water in the most skilful way, and in doing it, calls attention to the absence of love, and emphasises the great necessity for it. He brings in, in the abstract, in chapter 13 of the first letter, love in all its characteristics, as much as to say, 'It is not amongst you in this way'. He patiently works with them in order to bring about the result that the Lord had in view, that there might be love among themselves.
Rem. In love there is power.
D.L.H. Then in that love the saints are to have part now, and I suppose where love is in exercise you find the spirit of Judas goes out.
P.L. Here you have His hands in activity. It is His administration, activity in an administrative way. Then in @John 20 He shows them His hands; His hands are not active there. Is that rather in view of a scene of rest?
J.T. The hands and the side of Christ correspond with the stones taken out of Jordan and placed at Gilgal. You are in another position there, where defilement is not contemplated. It is a question of relationship with the Father, hence the Lord says,
{149}
"My Father, and your Father; my God, and your God". The position is changed, it is different, we are there in heavenly circumstances, and, of course, that is our great privilege; but here the Lord is thinking of God and all that would be the result of His having come out from God and having gone to God; that there should be a people here according to Him. This service is introduced by Him, so that there should be the maintenance of it, for the service is to be carried on among themselves.
D.L.H. Is your idea that Paul, in writing his rebuke to the Corinthians, in his lowly service that you have spoken of, and his ministering divine truth in regard to love, was really using the water and the towel?
J.T. I think 1 Corinthians may be regarded as the water, and the second letter as the towel. The first brings about cleansing, and the second brings in comfort and restfulness, for it brings in the ministries that set up the saints with God in perfect restfulness. Paul is able in that second epistle to say, "Confirm your love toward him". (@2 Corinthians 2:8)
Ques. Does the apostle in 1 Corinthians lay aside his garments, or anything corresponding to it?
J.T. I think so. He might have gone to them with a rod and authority, but instead of doing that, he writes a letter and sends Timothy. He did not desire to go with a rod, so he sent a letter, and he sends it by Timothy. He calls attention to Timothy as his beloved child and faithful in the Lord, who would bring them into remembrance of his ways which be in Christ. He was like him, his own child, and they would discover in Timothy what Paul was like.
Rem. The house of Chloe had been exercised about the condition of things at Corinth and had written to Paul.
J.T. Christianity as representative of God here
{150}
is to be marked by outward littleness, by contentment in obscurity, and by a readiness to be or do anything that would tend to promote the interests of the Lord and His people. I think that our position here, as provisionally representing God in this world, should be marked by these features. I think it is a very significant fact that, when Barnabas went down and brought Saul to Antioch, and they continued there one year ministering among the saints, it is said that at that time that the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch, as if to imply that the presence of Paul and his service had yielded that. I do not say that it is formally stated, but that is the setting of it; the universal position of the saints as related to Christ is first mentioned at Antioch, they were no longer to be regarded as a sect of the Jews, but followers of Christ.
Rem. It is at Antioch that Paul is first brought forward; Saul is afterwards called Paul.
J.T. As if to suggest what he was in manner and spirit, a man of no consequence in his own eyes, as he says, "less than the least of all saints". (@Ephesians 3:8)
D.L.H. In @2 Corinthians 10 the apostle says, "I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ, who, as to appearance, when present am mean among you, but absent am bold towards you". It suggests very much that kind of going down and ministering in meekness and lowliness.
J.T. That is a very good scripture as covering what we are saying, and there is no value in putting these things out unless one is exercised about them. Christianity is that publicly. It is a question of being anything and doing anything that will promote the Lord's interests; no matter what others think, that is what we aim at.
Rem. It should be a matter of serious concern with us that there is so little power for the recovery
{151}
of those who have slipped off the line. Would not this help us?
J.T. I am sure it would. I think the apostle helps us in his letters to the Corinthians. They are recovering letters.
E.R. In Corinth there was a very serious evil.
J.T. Yes. I am not ignoring that, but I am only speaking in a *general* way.
E.R. In regard to the Corinthians it was a question of discipline, not mere defilement.
J.T. I am only treating of Paul's manner and spirit, and the skill with which he dealt with the evil and the results accomplished. In regard to the Corinthians things were very serious, but towards them on this line he says, "though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. But be it so". (@2 Corinthians 12:15) That is the attitude he assumed.
Rem. It is very encouraging to see what may be brought about.
J.T. The great object should be to recover all. It was said to Paul, "God hath given thee all them that sail with thee", (@Acts 27:24). Love in us would embrace *all* the saints.
Ques. We get preservation here rather more than recovery, do we not?
J.T. This service preserves the company.
D.L.H. I have often been struck with the fact that in @John 13 the thought is not that the disciples had done anything particular one way or the other, but there was the defilement inevitable in passing through such a scene, and the ministry that the Lord Jesus undertook in such lowly grace was just the right kind of service to cleanse from the defilement in passing through such a scene; and, if that is so, it should reach over to what we were speaking of just now in regard to departure and recovery. The same kind of spirit should characterise all.
J.T. I am sure that is the way to look at it;
{152}
one would like to get the exact teaching there is in this chapter, and I think it is well to get the general bearing of the service of love, which was to continue in the company.
E.R. True happiness is to be found in this service, "happy are ye if ye do them".
D.L.H. Is it not the case that a ministry in divine love of this character has a wonderfully preserving effect upon saints, for it separates them. If Christ is ministered, the soul is morally separated at once from this scene. It produces that kind of moral effect, as the soul receives this gracious ministry. Then such an one would be a help to others on exactly the same lines.
Ques. Do you suggest that the thought of the Lord here is not only to keep His own individually right in relation to Himself but that there should be a certain capacity in that circle in line with that service, that His own should be preserved and maintained?
J.T. That is it exactly. The service is to be continued by them. In 1 Timothy the widow, if she is to be put on the list, is to have this mark; "If she have washed the saints feet". (@1 Timothy 4:10)
Ques. What do you link with our doing this service? The Lord coming from God and going to God? Is it that we are to be in keeping with that?
J.T. Yes; the service is that we should be kept in the light of these great facts, and be maintained in an out-of-the-world state of things. It is an immense triumph that people should be carried thus through in presence of the evil, and kept out of it, not taken out of the world, but kept from the evil in it.
D.L.H. And anything that ministers and fosters divine affections will do that. Is not that the case?
J.T. Yes, indeed. "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest
{153}
keep them from the evil". (@John 17:15) That is the position in John.
Ques. Will you give us a word or two now as to your thought in connection with @John 20?
J.T. I think John in chapter 20 emphasises the spiritual side. He makes very little reference to any defectiveness or want of faith in the disciples. It is alluded to in Peter and John and in Thomas, but he makes little of it, and rather emphasises what was of God; he enlarges on Mary, and he mentions that John believed, though he went away again to his own home. In coming into their midst there is no reference to any defects, and in fact, according to this record, things are quite normal, and as the Lord would have wished it. He says, "Peace unto you". They "were glad" when they saw Him, and then He said again, "Peace unto you", as if He would confirm that state in them. As He comes through closed doors it is a spiritual thing that is before us, and I think it is all in view of the great position that they were about to come into by the message sent to them through Mary, because it says definitely, that she came and told the disciples the things which the Lord had spoken unto her.
Ques. Does that prove that she was in the good of the revelation?
J.T. I should say so in measure, but the record does not make much of that beyond that she carried the message. She is merged in the company, and *they* seem to be in the good of it.
M.W.B. In regard to chapters 13 to 20, in what position does chapter 14 come in, "I will come to you", and the manifestations, and "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you"?
J.T. I think it was all to confirm them on the positive side. Chapter 13 is more negative; chapter 14 is more positive, bringing in the Comforter, and
{154}
the Lord Himself. In chapter 14 the Spirit is spoken of as the Comforter; another divine Person with them, an immense thing for us as in this world. When you come to chapter 20 and compare it with @Ephesians 2, the divine thought is reached, "he has raised us up together" (mark *together*) "and made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus". We value that, if we love one another. It is God's thought that we should be there together. But that is another thing altogether to what we get in chapter 13 and has to be understood spiritually; the latter is that we should be here together before the world as disciples of Christ.
Rem. There is no mention of the Comforter or the Spirit in the first part of @Ephesians 2.
J.T. No; it is what God has done Himself because of "his great love wherewith he loved us", and what is peculiarly touching is that we are raised up *together*.
Ques. Is that the difference between the ascension and the going back to the Father?
J.T. I think so.
P.L. The thought of His brethren is connected with the ascension.
J.T. Yes, and then it is a question of coming out in a heavenly spirit, "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you". There you come to a complete representation of Christ. It is not the Comforter here, but the Spirit of the heavenly Man breathed into them, and they sent out by Him as the Father had sent Him.
Ques. Do you make room in chapters 13 to 17 for the thought of heaven, or is it entirely down here?
J.T. I think these chapters have the position of the saints on earth in view; what we are down here, so that after instructing them He prays for them, and He prays definitely not that they should
{155}
be taken out of the world, but that they should be kept from the evil; but chapter 20 has in view our part in heavenly places. I do not know of any greater triumph than that people should be enabled to go through this world and yet not be of it; it is true sanctification. (@John 17:17 - 19).
E.R. You are looked upon as in an out-of-the-world heavenly condition.
J.T. But in saying we are in an out-of-the-world state, I was not thinking of Canaan; that state strictly would be Canaan, but the Lord's supper contemplates us though in the world, as out of it morally.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the Lord when He had washed their feet? He took again His garments and sat down.
J.T. I think He returned to a position of dignity, setting Himself before their hearts, in the way He had acted, so that they might have Him before them as an example. He says, "Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord". He would impress them with His dignity.
Rem. What He taught them could not be preserved among them in any other spirit than that which He had shown.
J.T. It could not be carried on in any other spirit.
D.L.H. The greatest person in Christianity is the one who goes lowest down.
{156}
THE COMFORTER
@John 14:15 - 17; 15:26,27; 16:7 - 14
J.T. What came before us in chapters 1 to 7 was the truth in connection with the Spirit, as it applies to the *individual* believer; the individual is in view in that section of the gospel. We dwelt on chapter 1 and the baptism of the Holy Spirit, as suggesting the way in which the believer is merged in that which the Spirit forms, as is seen in the epistles. "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body". (@1 Corinthians 12:13) The general position of chapter 1 is brought in to establish the greatness of Christ; *He* baptises with the Holy Spirit; while in Acts it is, "*ye* shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit". (@Acts 11:16) The *fact* of baptism is emphasised in the latter scripture, whereas in the former, it is the *Person who does it*; and the bearing of it is towards the whole universe. For the moment, however, the baptising takes form in regard to us in the body, so that we lose our individuality, and are merged in the body, the vessel in which Christ is to be expressed. Then, in chapter 4 we have the Spirit on the divine side as *gift*, meeting the need of souls; the woman being a representative case, sets forth one who having failed to find satisfaction in the world, finds it in Christ. We read in chapter 3 that the Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hands, and in chapter 4 what that involves is set forth. The administration committed to the Son involves the gift of the Spirit as meeting thirst in a human soul, and the setting up of that soul here in independency of everything else. Living water is given, a fountain within, so that one has resources in oneself, and *satisfaction* is known; and thus the affections are led outside of the channels of sin into holy channels, complete deliverance being in view, with no limit as to result; "springing up
{157}
into everlasting life". Then in chapter 7 the Spirit is presented from the side of the believer's *reception*. What the believer in Christ *receives* is spoken of, and the effect on the receiver in public testimony, refreshment working out through his compassions. The lower affections are in view, "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water"; the thought referred to in this way being the expression of kindness, bowels of compassion and consideration for all men; so that the Holy Spirit in the Christian answers to what God is to all men in the way of consideration. Briefly, that is what we had before us last night.
A.M.H. You remarked, that reception supposes a certain amount of stature to take advantage of what Christ has given.
J.T. Yes. Chapters 5 and 6 in that way tend to build up the constitution. In the former Christ is seen in His power as Son of God, the extensiveness of that power, not merely for the saints, but for *all*, being set forth. There is no evidence that the man at the pool was wrought on morally, but he got the great benefit of Christ's power. Even the wicked dead are brought out of their graves as hearing His voice. It is a great item of faith in the soul of the believer as having to do with adverse power now, that *Christ's* power is supreme. Then in chapter 6 food is provided to sustain the soul in life, and chapter 7, as has been said, supposes a certain receptive state which enables one to come and drink. The general teaching of the Old Testament in regard to water finds its fulfilment in this way in the believer; a great matter in face of the pretensions of the Jews.
W.C. What is the thought of the Spirit quickening in chapter 6:63?
J.T. "It is the Spirit which quickens". Chapter 6 exposes flesh. The flesh profits nothing, but the Spirit quickens; it says in @2 Corinthians 3, "the
{158}
letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life". Hence we are dependent upon the Spirit for quickening. It is set over against the flesh.
W.C. Would it lead to the state referred to in chapter 7?
J.T. Yes. It is an important point that the flesh profits nothing; we may as well be done with it.
A.M.H. It is the taking of it up as the result of a measure of experience; it is not only a matter of light.
J.T. What we get in chapter 6 is intensely spiritual; "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life", as if to shut out all that pertains to the sacerdotal system. It is shocking to contemplate what has been built up in a material way upon what this chapter suggests. So we see in result that a believer as being in the good of what precedes chapter 7 would be spiritual, and his affections, as acted on by Christ, would go out in compassion toward all men.
A.M.H. What is the thought of feeding on Christ? One would like to get some more definite understanding of chapter 6.
J.T. This food tends to build up a constitution that would enable one to think nothing of oneself as regards position in this world. It is a *going-down* principle. The bread "comes *down*". The Lord Jesus coming down and dying, in order that the world might live, opens up a wide range of thought as to what I shall become if I eat that food. It is a question of going down and dying here; that kind of constitution is brought about, and one lives spiritually as a result.
A.M.H. The thought of feeding on Christ is very precious, but when we try to define it, we are made to feel we do not know much about it. How are we led on to the next section?
{159}
J.T. Much is taught in the intervening chapters which we can hardly touch, as we are dealing with the Spirit. We may say, however, that in chapters 8 to 10 the believer is led out of the world and set in the "one flock". When we come to the next section, which commences with chapter 13, what is suggested is that the saints are not seen in their individual capacity, but as related to one another, so that chapter brings in the principle of mutuality, the thought of serving one another, and Christ is brought before us as the great example of service. "Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; he riseth from supper", etc. Emphasis is laid on the fact that He *knew* these things, not simply that they were predicated of Him; the thought being the sense He had of the dignity of His position. In the consciousness of it He laid aside His garments. He is not to serve the saints in official dignity, all that is laid aside, and in that way He affords us an example, the effect of His service being that a company was brought about marked off as disciples of Christ down here, in mutual relations serving each other.
M.W.B. It is striking that the chapter should commence in a similar way to what we read in chapter 3, namely, that the Father had given all things into His hands. It seems to be a fresh beginning.
J.T. The great point in the chapter is that it provides an example for us as to how we are to serve. He is a great person who can cheerfully and happily become small in order to serve all. Laying aside His garments suggests that the Lord would divest Himself of everything that would give Him an official place.
M.W.B. Conscious greatness enables one to take a small place. The Lord was pre-eminently first in
{160}
this wonderful stoop. Nothing as a servant could ever equal what you are as a saint.
J.T. If things worked from the other end, we should make ourselves great because of our service. This is what marks official Christendom.
W.C. What is the application of the thought of coming from God and going to God? Is it personal to the Lord?
J.T. All service emanates from that. It is a great thing to bring in the divine element, "Knowing ... ... that he was come from God and went to God". This section does not deal with spiritual privilege; it is not "*our* God" and "*our* Father"; throughout these chapters it is "*the* Father". We are not brought on to the ground of association with Christ in heavenly relationship until we come to chapter 20. It does not say we are His brethren here.
H.N. Could you open out the line of these chapters as to our position in contrast with chapter 20?
J.T. Our position in this section flows from the revelation of God, and what Christ is as going to God, and is thus the outcome of what God is in Christ towards us, and what man is in Christ towards God. Going to God involves the latter. It is not a matter of family relationships, but of a people known to be His disciples and the furnishing of them for that position.
H.N. Would it involve priesthood?
J.T. Yes.
P.L. Would reconciliation be the thought as applied to us?
J.T. Yes; it involves that we are reconciled.
M.W.B. You emphasise that the saints are presented as occupying the position Christ previously had, therefore the Spirit is given as Comforter.
J.T. Yes; the disciples have learned from Christ. He sets the example before them in chapter 13, so
{161}
they are to be of His order, like Him in their relations one toward another down here.
M.W.B. Is there any instruction in the fact that the Spirit is not spoken of as Comforter in connection with the individual? It seems to be a collective idea.
J.T. One can see the working of that. Personally He is with the company. As regards individuals He is with us state-wise; that is, as meeting our state, overthrowing the flesh, and producing what is agreeable to God, but He is with the company personally. The book of Acts shows how the Holy Spirit as a divine Person acted in a sovereign way in the ordering of things. He said to Philip, "Go near, and join thyself to this chariot". (@Acts 8:29) In Antioch He directed that Barnabas and Saul should be separated for the work to which He had called them. He is there operating as a divine Person, as I have said. In chapter 14 He is introduced in the way of comfort and support in view of the position we are to occupy here "that he may abide with you for ever". It is more the thought of His companionship in this chapter, not what He effects publicly. The word *Comforter* signifies that He takes hold of and manages the affairs of the saints; an immense thing as a resource in the absence of Christ. The chapter does not go beyond sympathy and support privately, but chapter 15 widens out to testimony publicly, while the Spirit in chapter 16 brings about the conviction of the world; brings it about demonstratively so that it cannot be denied. Any one can see that it is an immense thing in testimony and conflict, that the enemy should be publicly exposed to be in the wrong. How much has been written during the last five years to show that Germany was in the wrong! It makes no difference, one might say, to the cannon balls, but it makes a great *moral* difference. So chapter 16 establishes the fact that the world's attitude is wrong.
{162}
J.H.J. You mean it is established among the saints.
J.T. Yes. The presence of the Holy Spirit here demonstrates the fact that the world is wrong. He convicts the world "of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment". The demonstration is against Satan, and in favour of the saints. It is not implied that the conscience of the world is convicted, but that a demonstration of its guilt is there, so that it cannot be denied.
A.M.H. The world is weakened in its spring. A man can maintain a fighting attitude as long as he thinks he is right. Chapter 14 implies, that up till then the Lord had seen them through, now the Spirit is to take that place.
J.T. The word *another* would bear that out; later, both in chapters 15 and 16, it is simply the Comforter, showing that the Lord would make provision for the loss sustained by His departure.
Rem. This other Comforter would not leave them.
J.T. No; leaders come and go, but this other Comforter would abide. It is not simply that He was to be on earth, the point is that He will "abide *with you* for ever". It is the thought of companionship, and the companionship of One who would take account of their affairs, and look after them divinely. If we only took that in, what a great thing it would be for us! You get the word in Haggai, "My Spirit remaineth among you". (@Haggai 2:5)
H.N. How would you link this with "I am coming to you"?
J.T. It is an accentuation of companionship, and is special. I suppose verse 18, which you quote, applies to what marked the beginning of things among the saints. The Lord came to them; it was His attitude. A week might intervene, but @John 20 shows that that was the attitude He took up. One
{163}
has remarked that the history of the assembly is made up of weeks, but private individual history is marked by days. The saints would understand that the Lord would act as He did at the beginning in coming to them on the first day of each week.
H.N. Would we be justified in linking it with the Supper? It is not the thought of heavenly association.
J.T. That is later. "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me ... ... and I will manifest myself to him". This alludes to the failure of the assembly, and the proof of love now is in keeping the commandments of Christ. A manifestation is granted to the one who does that; the whole thought being to support us in our position here. These are wonderful provisions for us, but the Lord is not dealing here exactly with heavenly privileges.
M.W.B. Unless we are rightly sustained here, we have no capacity for entering into our true spiritual position.
J.T. All depends on spiritual power.
M.W.B. We are set together as those who are to take the place of Christ during His absence. It is essentially assembly ground, though the word is not used. Why is the promise of the Comforter based on "If ye love me"?
J.T. That describes the qualification of the vessel. The Holy Spirit would not come unless there was a state of soul suitable to receive Him. The state must be in correspondence. So the Lord says, "If ye love me". It would raise the question with the disciples, Do I love Christ? If I am to get the benefit of the Comforter it is on that line.
A.M.H. *Another* Comforter would hardly be valued unless the Lord had His right place. If they valued the Lord as with them, they would value the Comforter as sent by Him.
{164}
J.T. Saints in general get the benefit of these provisions made for the sustenance of the assembly. The whole assembly in some sense gains, but many do not take up the special privilege accorded to us, This chapter gives us the provision made for the position, and every one to some extent gets the benefit.
F.F. The revelation of God is maintained and continued by the Spirit, "he shall bring all things to your remembrance". It would seem as if the hearts of the disciples were secured in chapter 14.
J.T. Light would soon disappear if not sustained by the Spirit.
F.F. The heart is secured and held in peace by the light of the provision made.
J.T. The Lord would revive the thought of what is universal among us, so that our exercises might take form accordingly. These provisions made for the company in the absence of the Lord involve universal benefits. One is exercised in regard to *all* saints, and in regard to all *men*. We are apt to be too local. The sense of local responsibility has been revived among us, but it may be worked out to the detriment of the universal principle. The saints are *all* precious to Christ, and what is outlined in these chapters shows that all are to be benefited in some way.
P.L. Is that why the thought of locality is absent in this section of John's gospel?
J.T. Well, probably it is. Chapter 14 emphasises that the Comforter would be with the saints, and that the Lord Himself would come; in chapter 15 the position is changed. He said, "Let us go hence". He takes a public position now. The Spirit would testify of Christ, and the apostles would also bear witness, and fruit-bearing is in view. Chapter 16 is the battle-ground, and conflict is contemplated.
M.W.B. Seclusion marks chapter 14.
{165}
J.T. What we are contending against is exposed in chapter 16. "Earnestly contend for the faith", (@Jude 3) the word says. The great point is to make sure that what you contend against is exposed. If things are exposed, they have no moral weight with those whose consciences are exercised before God.
W.T. In what way do you mean?
J.T. The word *demonstration* conveys the thought. In an exhibition, for example, you get all kinds of demonstration as to what things are. It is not that the world is convicted in itself, but the thing is exposed for those who have eyes to see.
Rem. As at Pentecost.
J.T. The issue was between Christ and the Jews, between Christ and the world, and God decided the issue, and the decision was that the Holy Spirit came out from Christ to the disciples. This could not be denied. Thus we see that God had decided against the Jews.
Rem. It comes out even at the cross in the testimony of the thief, "This man hath done nothing amiss". (@Luke 23:41)
J.T. Yes; but this is more positive.
H.N. The Lord's thought is that His people will be formed so that they are clear of the world as thus exposed.
Rem. The Spirit convicts of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.
J.T. The Jews were guilty in regard of sin, because they did not believe on Christ, and guilty in regard of righteousness, as the One they rejected was accepted with the Father. He goes to God in the right of His own Person as Man. His being with the Father is a proof of His righteousness, and the Holy Spirit witnesses to that, and also to judgment.
A.M.H. These are three great indictments which
{166}
the world has to answer for. One could take up this ground with any one.
J.T. That is right, the exposure is there.
W.T. We should be more effective if we were more spiritual, if the Spirit had more His way with us.
A.M.H. If there were more travail the "*Man*" would be brought into the world.
J.T. Quite so. At Pentecost the power of the Spirit was so evident, that it could not be gainsaid. "We do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God". (@Acts 2:11) It may be regarded as a judicial or court scene; Peter's address was, so to speak, a summing up, and it brought conviction.
M.W.B. Take a case of discipline, when a man seems insensible and is not prepared to admit the evil, would conviction be carried home to his conscience if this state existed among all?
J.T. No doubt it would. "Them that sin rebuke before all". (@1 Timothy 5:20) The force of that is not that you administer a formal rebuke, but that every one present knows that the person is guilty; the foundation of his position is thus sapped. The Holy Spirit is with us to help us in all these things, and he *remains with us*.
F.F. Chapter 14 would give the thought of peace; "my peace"; chapter 15 "my joy"; and chapter 16 power.
M.W.B. All these chapters presuppose a state of love among us, which would secure the recognition of the Spirit as Comforter.
J.T. So we value one another, and come together to get the good of the Comforter.
Rem. What is the thought of the "Spirit of truth"?
J.T. Truth is a sort of key word in John. His writings are marked by the idea of being true, "his testimony is true". (@John 21:24) The truth carries the thought of complete measure. The "Spirit of truth" is spoken
{167}
of in chapter 14, then in chapter 16 it says, "when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth". That is another thing.
J.H.J. He is mentioned as the Spirit of truth in chapter 15:26, also. In connection with the witness, is it to establish our hearts in the position of Christ in glory?
J.T. I think so. "And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning", showing the abundance of testimony there would be. The Spirit's testimony would involve Paul's ministry.
H.N. Does Paul's ministry come out in a peculiar way in chapter 16 to unfold to the saints all that lies in the Spirit? Would chapter 14 set forth John's ministry specially; chapter 15 Peter's; and chapter 16 Paul's?
J.T. I should think so. "Ye too" would carry Peter's feature, for, in a sense, he represented the twelve. Compare @Galatians 2:7,8. Then it says in chapter 16, "he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come". This would involve Paul's ministry.
A.M.H. Does it carry the thought of finding a way through the maze of this world, in relation to the testimony? We need constant application of light in order that we may find a way in the midst of confusing elements.
J.T. What has concerned one often in considering ministry is, Is the Spirit of truth behind it? There may be true things in what is ministered, but the point is, is the Spirit of truth there?
A.M.H. Will it lead anywhere?
J.T. In the Spirit of truth there is adjustment. Saints get clear, fogs disappear, and questions vanish.
M.W.B. There is a moral necessity that the Spirit's demonstration to the world should precede
{168}
the guiding into all truth. If not clear as to the world we cannot be free to be led into the Father's things.
J.T. Yes; we want to be in the sense of the moral victory brought about by the exposure. Guiding into all truth involves what is new; that which would be introduced by Paul's ministry.
P.L. The demonstration is incidental although most important; the objective lies beyond.
Ques. In chapters 14 and 15 there are conditions attached to the coming of the Comforter, but here in chapter 16 it is simply privilege; "he will guide you into all truth". How would you regard it?
W.C. Would it be development in the truth.
J.T. At the end of chapter 16 the Lord turns to their exercises and sorrows, as they are about to enter into that new phase of things; He brings in the Father as having affection for them, and says also, "At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God". Things seem to clear for them as He announces that He is going to the Father, and they respond, "Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb". He deals here with the prospect of immediate sorrow, but the general thought is that we can ask the Father, and can surely say, as having loved the Lord Jesus, that the Father loves us.
M.W.B. There is no condition here. Chapters 15 and 16 bring in a conditional state. Here provisions are bestowed freely and gratuitously.
J.T. The Lord is dealing with their sorrows. He shows them peculiar compassion and consideration in view of their being left here in a scene of suffering and conflict.
{169}
THE SPIRIT IN RELATION TO OUR HEAVENLY POSITION AND RELATIONSHIPS
@John 20:19 - 23
J.T. I suppose all will know that our subject is the Holy Spirit as presented in the gospel of John. It may be noted at the outset that the term used in chapter 20 is simply "Holy Spirit". The Authorised version gives the article, but it should be omitted, as it is the character of what we receive, more than the Person, that is presented in this chapter, in order that we may be impressed with what is spiritual.
W.G.B. Like the early verses of @Romans 8.
J.T. I suppose so, only what precedes the operation here is that "he breathed on them"; that has to be taken into account. Christ viewed as having ascended, imparts to His brethren His own breath. It is what may be called the highest order of life, for life in Scripture is graded. Certainly, in the material creation it is so. Compare @Genesis 1 and 2.
A.M.H. It is what is enjoyed together: "Receive Holy Spirit".
J.T. Yes; it is what the new race, so to speak, enjoys.
T. The same as in @Genesis 2.
J.T. Yes; the reference is to that: only here it is a Man breathing into the disciples, and doing so as last Adam. I mentioned the thought as to "Holy Spirit" being characteristic as a help; but in order to understand the bearing of the chapter aright, we must view it as a whole, as the facts narrated in regard to resurrection suggest that the Spirit is occupied with what is of God in the disciples, and not with their unbelief. In the other gospels their unbelief is emphasised, but not here.
{170}
M.W.B. This chapter gives the purest heavenly blessing that saints have power to enter upon in association with Christ, the setting being thus in contrast to chapter 14 where it is a question of the support and sustenance of the Comforter down here.
J.T. The position in that section of the gospel from chapters 13 to 16 flows from the revelation of God, what God is as revealed, and what Man is as seen in Christ. It is *His* Father in these chapters, or *the* Father, not *our* Father; whereas here it is His Father and *our* Father, His God and *our* God.
M.W.B. The setting of those chapters, generally speaking, corresponds with the idea of God known in our responsible relationships.
J.T. Yes; a people here knowing God, and having learned what man is as suited to God: "and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". Chapters 13 to 16 give us what furnishes us for the position down here, it is our equipment; but in chapter 20 our special spiritual privilege is more in view, so that things are presented more formally; "as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you"; the ground is somewhat formal. In apprehending Him as the One who has been sent of the Father, and receiving the Spirit of that Man, we are to represent Him, so it involves what is heavenly.
P.L. What is the distinction between going to God and ascension?
J.T. That is worthy of special attention. In the earlier chapters, while the Lord speaks of going to God, He never uses the word *ascend*. It may seem trivial to mention this, but it is not so; "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God", is of special importance in view of what we have before us, as it involves our greatest blessing and privilege. In these earlier chapters what we have is God revealed in relation to Christ; as already said, it is not as *our* Father, but as the
{171}
Father, or Christ's Father, that He is spoken of. Revelation is general, not *specially* for us. We come into the effect of it in believing the gospel, and it is in keeping with this, that the Lord sets forth what believers should be to one another in service. Besides, the bearing of revelation goes on to the future; the Father will be known, and God will be known in the millennium; but now we have this peculiar place in relation to Christ, that we are His brethren.
H.N. Would the highest thought in connection with revelation be "that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent"?
J.T. Yes; revelation is a question of what God is as seen in Christ, and what man is as seen in Christ. The passage you quote, @John 17:3, does not go so far as this chapter 20.
H.N. The climax would be eternal life, but when we come to ascension, family relationships would be developed and this would correspond with Ephesians.
J.T. Family relationships and privileges come in here in @John 20. Ephesians says, "who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ". (@Ephesians 1:3) There it is not so much *what* the blessings are as *where* they are. It is wonderful!
Rem. Ascension is the platform in Ephesians.
J.T. "Hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"; (@Ephesians 2:6) that word *together* refers to one another; one is not to occupy that place alone, but with the brethren. This chapter is intended to emphasise what is heavenly and spiritual, so it is "Receive Holy Spirit"; *that* kind of Spirit. We get excess here, and the chapter shows how we are formed to occupy this new and great position. According to the accounts by Mark and Luke the disciples were marked by the most extraordinary state of unbelief as to the Lord's
{172}
resurrection, not only in regard of the Scriptures and His own words, but in regard also of the testimony of persons with whom they were well acquainted, and whom they would not have doubted ordinarily, such as Mary Magdalene and the other women; "their words", we read, "seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not". (@Luke 24:11) This suggests what flesh is, even in the presence of the most unprecedented advantages. When we think of all they had seen in Christ, and the power of resurrection demonstrated in His works, which works they were witnesses of, it seems extraordinary to find them thus unbelieving on the resurrection morning. The Lord had a great work to accomplish in them, in order to establish their souls in a state of faith, to lead them to apprehend life out of death, and to bring them into spirituality. But the Lord accomplished it, and we find these same men, after the Lord's sojourn with them for forty days, not only believing, but spiritual and intelligent. The Lord "showed himself alive" to them. That would be in order to impress them with what was living outside of death. And that was not all, for what we have here is an advance on that; following up His message to them He showed Himself to them in spiritual conditions, coming and standing in their midst, having entered through the closed doors; and now what comes to light is that *they* are spiritual, as viewed in this connection; there is no evidence of their being disconcerted in any way, whereas in Luke they were. There, we are told, they were terrified and affrighted. My exercise is, that we might see how this gospel leads up to heavenly-mindedness and spirituality, and the Holy Spirit is presented here in that relation to bring this about. The breath of the heavenly Man was to be imparted to them; the thought is the principle of their life, of their existence.
{173}
Ques. What is the difference between this and @Acts 2?
J.T. In the latter it says the Spirit "*sat upon* each of them". (verse 3) It is for public testimony. The disciples were all together, and there came a sound like as of a rushing mighty wind, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. The point there is public witness. Joel spoke of it prophetically. So Peter says, "he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear". (verse 33) He does not say, which we enjoy, but "which ye now *see* and *hear*". But *this* in @John 20 is not to see and hear, though it would result in that, of course; it is a private and intimate transaction, involving the vital principle of their being.
H.N. Acts would give more the *official* position.
J.T. Yes; here it is what Christ is inherently, what He does Himself as the One who ascends.
H.N. As last Adam infusing the breath of life, and thus constituting the disciples heavenly men.
J.T. Yes; made heavenly in their spirits, in the principle of their being, so that there should be no disparity between them and their position. They are made equal to the position announced in the message.
H.N. Is "I will come to you" in view of what you have been saying as to coming into the midst?
J.T. In this chapter the reference is entirely spiritual. In verse 19 the text, I believe, should read "where the disciples *were*". It does not rightly say, assembled, for it is not the outward public position. This serves to confirm the thought that it is an entirely spiritual matter, not the assembly as seen in 1 Corinthians.
M.W.B. There seems to be a twofold thought, then, in regard to the assembly. We are gathered together, in divine order, men being distinguished from women and the company taken account of as actually on earth in the wilderness. In that place
{174}
the Lord comes to us, but in order to conduct us to a spiritual region outside.
J.T. Yes. The latter is seen here. These people are great in the Lord's account, and He comes to where they are. His presence is apprehended in a spiritual way. They are not here viewed as orphans. In chapter 14 He promises to come in view of their position here in His absence?
M.W.B. Will you explain the distinction between the Lord's coming to us on earth where He died, and the way He comes in here as apprehended by the spiritual man.
J.T. He does not speak of the effect of His coming in chapter 14. His coming to them there is an additional provision for the position they were to occupy. In chapter 20 they are His brethren and their greatness is in view. It is the *need* side in chapter 14.
H.N. Would we be justified in linking chapter 14 with the Lord's supper?
J.T. Yes; here He says first, "Peace be unto you", then they rejoice, and then Jesus says again, "Peace be unto you", as if to confirm and establish them in the first effect of His presence. So we find they have gained something by the apprehension of Christ.
P.L. His presence in support, according to chapter 14, is promised, but here it is the sovereign movement of His love.
J.T. In grace the Lord subjected Himself while here to certain limitations that governed creation, but in resurrection He is no longer bound by these; and this chapter is intended to impress us with the region outside of the laws of nature, a spiritual region, so the doors being shut, He enters. The Spirit presents that side here to show the effect of His ministry.
{175}
Rem. Would chapter 14 suggest the position of the saints at the Supper, and chapter 20 the spiritual outcome, what is beyond the Supper, but which properly it leads on to?
J.T. Yes; the Supper is a testimony to the fact that the Lord is not here; it is a remembrance of Him.
M.W.B. These three chapters, 14, 15, 16, are necessarily introductory to chapter 20. We could not omit these intermediate chapters.
J.T. Rightly apprehended they lead to this, but we must see that this is wholly spiritual. We get, too, in the main what is of God in the disciples, so that there is correspondence in them to this movement of Christ, and thus they are equal to the visitation.
Rem. Mary is one in the good of chapter 14.
J.T. She behaves well as a sister. She waits till the two disciples look into the sepulchre, and then she looks in; and in doing so she gets the benefit and sees the two angels, sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain. The Person who had lain there was divine, and reverential respect is to be shown to the spot where He lay. Mary says, "they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him". Having said this, she turns backward, thus turning away from the angels. There seems to be spiritual instinct in this action: the angels were not the ones to lead in spiritual thoughts. In turning, she sees the Lord. It was He who could instruct her in what was spiritual; this He proceeds to do, telling her first not to touch Him, then He entrusts her with the wonderful message, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God". And Mary, without any questioning, goes and tells them, and there is no evidence that they disbelieve her.
{176}
P.L. She says, "Rabboni", *my* Teacher. Is He to instruct her now in relation to the spiritual?
J.T. Yes; that is how it stands.
P.L. Instinctively she seems to anticipate the greatness of the company to which she belongs in the new position; she realises that the dispensation of angels was eclipsed for her.
A.M.H. We want to go on to what is spiritual rather than to manifestations of angelic power.
H.N. "God is a Spirit".
J.T. That is a great feature, giving character to this gospel.
Rem. The two disciples turned to follow Jesus in chapter 1. Mary turns here.
J.T. It is a great thing to turn at the right moment.
P.L. With Mary it is a question of leaving earth in principle and anticipatively. We do not require angelic care in heaven.
J.T. John in @Revelation 1 turned to see the voice. He had been occupied with what was heavenly, but what he was to take account of had reference to earth; whereas Mary turns the other way to the heavenly.
M.W.B. Comparing this with chapter 16, where we have "for the Father himself loveth you", there seems a further development of thought as to the Father. Here it is "my Father and your Father".
J.T. We want to distinguish between "*the* Father", the thought in revelation as expressed in "one God, the Father", and *our* Father. Paul generally, indeed almost habitually, speaks of *our* Father: his thought is to bring man in to God in the relationship of son; so he says, "God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father". (@Galatians 4:6)
H.N. "Access by one Spirit unto the Father" (@Ephesians 2:18); would that be revelation?
{177}
J.T. Yes.
H.W. Does the thought of family relationship lie behind our having access? Is it built upon it?
J.T. "That he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross" (@Ephesians 2:16) is properly connected with revelation. Access has reference to our position down here. The second section of @Ephesians 2 treats of what had been brought to pass upon earth through the testimony of God.
H.N. What scriptures would you use to build up the thought of family relationship?
J.T. @John 20, @Romans 8:14,15, and @Galatians 4:6. In Romans the Spirit enables us to cry "Abba, Father"; in Galatians *He* cries "Abba, Father" in our hearts. See also the opening verses of Paul's epistles. "Grace be unto you, and peace from *God our Father*". All these, and other scriptures, enable us to take this ground of relationship with God.
H.N. Would "the Father" be the universal thought, and "our Father" more what is private, what is for the family?
J.T. The declaration of God is general; the declaration of the Father's *name* is special. In @John 1:18 it says, "The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him", without saying to whom; but in chapter 17 He says "I have declared *unto them* thy name"; that is special. When made to some person or persons the revelation is effective; when it is general, it may not be effective in all.
In verse 21 it says, "Jesus said therefore again to them, Peace be to you: as the Father sent me forth, I also send you". The "therefore" seems to connect with the rejoicing of the previous verse; it alludes to the joy; so the Lord says *again* "Peace", in this way sealing and confirming it. Then He comes on to their commission. "As the Father sent me
{178}
forth, I also send you", and this is followed by the breathing into them, thus indicating His concern that there should be confirmed peace and a right spirit in them as representing Him. This is important with us. The palsied man who was sent to his house would have a sense that he was sent there by Christ, and in consequence he would have a sense of his responsibility to represent Christ there, and the Lord would have us marked by a right spirit as representing Him down here.
{179}
THE VICTORY THAT OVERCOMETH THE WORLD
@1 John 5:4,5
There is one word used in this scripture which expresses what I want to speak about this evening, and that is the word *victory*. I would like to show how God affords victory to His people, and how they come into it. John speaks much of it; he speaks of overcoming and of victory. Paul also speaks of it; in writing to the Corinthians, having enlarged on the subject of resurrection, he finishes by saying, "Thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ". *God* gives it to *us*; that is, to Christians and in writing to the Romans also, he says, "And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly", (@Romans 16:20) an assurance that victory would be theirs, although for the moment they might be suffering. He tells them "God ... ... shall bruise Satan under your feet", and it is well that saints should have that in mind, especially those who are in any way storm-tossed by the enemy's power. The Lord Jesus Christ is spoken of prophetically in @Genesis 3 as bruising Satan's head; Satan would bruise His heel, but He would bruise Satan's head; that was foretold of Christ and it has come to pass. I want to dwell on this, and I mention it here in connection with Paul's allusion to Satan being bruised under the feet of the people of God. "Under your feet"; it is a most ignominious kind of subjugation, reminding one of the conquest of Canaan, when Joshua said to the captains of the men of war, "Put your feet upon the necks of these kings". (@Joshua 10:24)
When the people came out of Egypt they celebrated their deliverance, and I would remark here that it is very important to celebrate what God achieves for us. I do not know if we are much accustomed
{180}
to celebration; the world goes in for it, and we should be ready to celebrate divine intervention for us; so, as I was saying, when the people of Israel came out of Egypt, they celebrated their deliverance not indeed that it is exactly attributed to them "Then sang Moses", it is said, "*and* the children of Israel" (@Exodus 15:1). The element of faith which had begun when they started to march across the Red Sea was seen with them (@Hebrews 11:29), and having crossed they celebrated their deliverance. "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea ... ... The Lord is a man of war", (verses 1 - 3) and so on. They are carried on in their song of celebration to Canaan, "Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance"; (verse 17) they see nothing but victory right on to the end; that is, they are in faith for the moment, and it is only in faith that we recognise the victory and celebrate it. This, however, is the only celebration we get recorded, save that of @Numbers 21, where they sing unto the well. The next act of faith coming before us, as referred to in @Hebrews 11, is that of Rahab. She comes into view as hiding the spies which Joshua sent to Jericho, and speaks of what Jehovah did at the Red Sea. She had heard about it by the hearing of faith, we may say; she had heard of what *Jehovah* did at the Red Sea, and of what the *people* did to Sihon and Og. She was in the light of victory belonging to these people, in the light typically of what God did in Christ in raising Him from the dead, and in the light of the Spirit acting in the people of God.
Now to refer again to the conquest of Canaan; when Joshua directed that the feet of the captains of Israel should be placed on the necks of the kings of the Canaanites (@Joshua 10:24), I have no doubt
{181}
that this is what the apostle alludes to when he says, "God ... ... shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly". I mention it, as I said, because of any who may be storm-tossed owing to the enemy's power. Satan, we are told, goes about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. It becomes a question of who his victim may be, he knows those whom he can devour, he has learned this by experience. He came to the Lord, and found that he could not touch Him. "The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me",(@John 14:30) the Lord said. Satan could not touch Him in this way, so here, "he that is begotten of God keeps himself and the wicked one does not touch him". Satan knows that, but he is looking for *some one* whom he can devour, and the exercise is, Am I that one? Am I exposed? The apostle goes on to say, "whom resist, stedfast in the faith". I wish to speak of faith, and to emphasise it, because without faith it is impossible to please God; it is impossible to get the victory without faith; it is impossible to resist the enemy without faith; indeed, without faith it is defeat at every step of the way. The dispensation in which we are is a dispensation of faith (@1 Timothy 1:4); hence the great importance of having faith in our souls.
Now, coming to this passage in the epistle of John, we have, first of all, "whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world". We have been dwelling in our seasons together on the manner in which the Lord Jesus brought about a state of faith in the disciples. This could not have been accomplished apart from the work of God in them; the Father had wrought in them all except Judas. There had been the work of God in them as the Lord intimated in @John 3; new birth, which was of God, had become a fact in them, that element was there. But there was another element in them, the deceptiveness of which as yet they did not know, it was the
{182}
flesh. The work of God was there, and what He does remains; that in itself is a victory over the world, but then there is the flesh to be reckoned with. Peter was truly a subject of the work of God, and yet he had not discerned what flesh was; so, while what was born of God triumphed in him in result, he was moved to do most disgraceful things in the presence of the enemy. And why? Because he had never judged the flesh. "Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world", but what is born of flesh *is* flesh, even in a Peter, even in a Paul! It *is* flesh, and unless discerned, judged, and disallowed in the power of the Spirit, it will one day bring about, as it did in Peter a shameful defeat in the presence of the enemy. So the Lord on the resurrection morning had to encounter in Peter and in the others a state of unwarrantable unbelief, unwarrantable in view of all that they had witnessed in His ministry, and yet alongside of that, thank God! there was that work in them which was indestructible, that which ultimately triumphed and enabled them to become vessels of that system which is called "God's dispensation, which is in faith".
This leads to the next statement: "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith". I would, on the one hand, lay stress on that which is born of God, "whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world"; it has to be taken account of in the abstract, alas! with most of us, but nevertheless it is there. I look at the saints, and myself amongst them; I am entitled to look at them in the light of the wonderful fact that they are born of God, "begotten of him". I am entitled to look at them in the light of this truth, that what is begotten of God is, as I might say, unovercomable in this world. In this light the saints are bound to triumph. That is one side, but on the other hand there is in the disciples the sad spectacle of men who had the most wonderful
{183}
opportunities and yet, who, through not discerning flesh in its nature as inherently opposed to God, and not subject to the law of God, became unbelievers in connection with that wonderful and glorious truth, the resurrection of Christ, and this notwithstanding the fact that it was borne witness to by persons whom they had no reason to doubt. Let us beware of flesh, lest we be found unbelieving in regard to that which is most precious, and which too would minister to our deepest enjoyment!
"This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith". I want to dwell on this. We accept the Lord Jesus as our Saviour, we recognise the Holy Spirit, and are brought into that which is in *itself* a victory. It is called a victory, "our faith", and hence what the Lord proposed on the morning of resurrection was the bringing about in those disciples that had seen His wonderful works a *state of faith*. This the Lord accomplished; and not only did He bring about in them a state of faith, but He brought about in them a state of *spirituality*. We get an instance of this in @Acts 1, where Peter, standing up in the midst of the hundred and twenty brethren, describes the fall of Judas, and then goes on to say in effect, the Holy Spirit enjoins that another should be appointed to take his place, and one of the qualifications for the position, the chief qualification, is that the successor must be an *assembly man*; "of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us ... ... must one be ordained". This was a spiritual statement, and thus we see that the disciples came not only to believe in resurrection, but to see what was befitting to the new order of things that was established. Peter as spiritual says, as it were, The man who is to be our companion in apostleship must be an assembly man. I wonder if we are all assembly men in that sense! Note, it says, "companied
{184}
with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us".
Then in the next chapter, they were all together in one place; together as we might say in assembly: not in the temple now, as is stated in @Luke 24:53, but simply "in one place". Previously this "place" was the "upper room", and undoubtedly this would be the same: the upper room suggests a spiritual idea. A large conspicuous place under man's eye would not be spiritually suitable. The principle of Christianity is to be out of sight, simply nothing in men's eyes as a "little flock". So those who saw the Lord taken up to heaven returned to the upper room, where were staying both Peter, and James, and John, and all the apostles with them; they were in spiritual surroundings, we may say, in an out-of-the-world state of things. That is spirituality. It is not heaven yet, but a place in which they were withdrawn from the world; there they were together in the recognition of the authority of Christ as set forth in the apostles, and in the enjoyment of mutual bonds of affection.
It was in those days before they had received the Spirit that Peter rose up to speak, and spoke "as oracles of God". He was spiritual. I adduce it now to testify to the wonderful service rendered by the Lord to the apostles and others during the forty days of His resurrection, when He undertook to bring about in them a state of faith and spirituality. To such a company the Holy Spirit came in @Acts 2. There was developed through the apostles a wonderful system of truth. They took, in this way, the place of Moses. Of those who believed it was said that "they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers". Those who had faith forsook that which stood for the system of Moses (we read that the scribes sat in Moses seat) for the authority vested in those twelve men who were taught of Christ.
{185}
The Holy Spirit brought in a system of truth which they developed, and it was in faith; it was that which in the Scripture before us is called *our faith*; "this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith".
What a wonderful triumph has been brought about! That which Christ taught, and the apostles spoke of, became living in souls, so that those who believed were subdued, and "continued in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers". There was a living system of faith set up in the souls of the apostles, and their teaching appealed to the people, as we see when Peter stood up with the eleven. In @Acts 1 we are told he stood up in the midst of the brethren, but in chapter 2 he stood up with "the eleven", indicating the official position he occupied on this latter occasion. He stands up and addresses the people, and his preaching is such that it brings conviction to the consciences of his hearers; they were "pricked in their heart", we are told; the word appealed to their hearts as well as to their consciences. Such was the testimony at the beginning! Peter as I said presented the word in such wise as to bring conviction to the hearts of those whom he addressed, and their inquiry was, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" There was no question as to the authority of the truth presented. I would commend to you, the power that was in the testimony presented by Peter, and in it for this reason, that it was in faith and in the power of the Holy Spirit. The convicted ones inquired, What shall we do? And Peter, it may be remarked, was not slow to say what they should do.
We should always have in view the element of responsibility attaching to those who hear. We are sometimes disposed to say, All has been done for you; but Peter did not say all had been done. As regards the atonement, it *is* all done, thank God!
{186}
but Peter told them what to do, and they were to act as he prescribed; "Repent, and be baptised each one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit". As receiving the Spirit they would be brought into victory; so the passage goes on to say, "they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers". They were connected with that living system of things set up in faith, which was in itself a victory over the world.
None of the efforts of the enemy has succeeded in the least degree in overthrowing this: it remains. It is not a question of the Thirty-nine Articles, nor even of the Scriptures, though the Scriptures give us the doctrine; but it is "*our faith*"; for that is how the truth is held in our dispensation. Moses lays things down in *writing*, but in Christianity things are preserved in the souls of God's people. "The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of *faith*". (@Romans 10:8) Christianity is not exactly laid down in writings; the latter come in to confirm and preserve in accurate terms and in divine authority what already existed. The victory was there already, and it remains for you and for me to be in it, and I would repeat that this can only be on the principle of faith. It is all very well to come into fellowship, but where are you as regards faith? That is what counts, and *nothing* else. "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"
I would refer now to the gospel of John to show in a brief way how this great fact comes out. You will recall how Peter had a revelation made to him in regard of Christ. The Father revealed to Peter "the Christ, the Son of the living God", but I do not dwell on that, for that is something by itself, which speaks of the Father's sovereign right in laying
{187}
the foundation of the assembly, followed by Christ building on it. What I want to refer to is in John's gospel, to show how this truth of which we have been speaking came to light, and how a soul comes into it. In chapter 9 the Lord propounds this question to the man who had been blind, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" It is a great question, and I connect it with the statement at the end of chapter 20; "And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name". This is spoken of as the result of the signs recorded in this gospel; it is not a question of the revelation of the Father. The signs are intended to establish our souls in faith, so that believing on Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, we have life in His name. If we have life down here in the name of the Son there can be no question as to its security. Now, to go back to show how the truth of the Lord's sonship comes to light. The man in @John 9 is brought face to face with the Son of God, and the question is put to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" He replies, "Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?" and the Lord announces Himself as none other than He, whereupon the man rejoins, "Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him". Wonderful goal for him to reach! The Lord, in taking up that man from the beggar's seat, blind as he was, had in view that in his heart there should be this wonderful light of the knowledge of the Son of God. Is that light in all *our* hearts? "We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life", (@1 John 5:20). The Lord had that in His mind when He took this
{188}
man as He passed and opened his eyes, that He might conduct him to this point; and that man had victory over the world. The world had cast him out, it had the victory to that extent; but now he can look back and in the light of the knowledge of the Son of God can say, 'I am victorious, the world has no claim, moral or otherwise, on me now'; with the knowledge of the Son of God in his soul the man was independent of the world and superior to it. This was victory.
So too, a Christian can look back on the world as having overcome it. It is not only that it has been overcome by Christ, but it is overcome by the Christian who is in the light of the Son of God. From passage to passage in the gospel of John the Holy Spirit opens up to us what the Son can do. He is "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead"; it is not His own resurrection that is alluded to, but that of others. So the Lord says to Martha at the grave of Lazarus, "If thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God", and this glory was seen in the bringing of a man by name uttered by the lips of the Son, out of his sepulchre. The glory of God shone there, and all was manifested in the presence of the disciples. Then in chapter 12 the Lord is troubled as He contemplates death and the awfulness of it. He says, "Now is my soul troubled". The Greeks had come up and desired to see Jesus and now all the blessed results of His death come before Him: "The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified". With what definiteness, with what intelligence He speaks! I believe the Lord would bring home to our souls the sense of victory which these chapters impress upon us.
John wept in @Revelation 5 because no one was found worthy to open the book, and one of the elders said to him, "Weep not: behold, the Lion of the
{189}
tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof". He brings in the light of victory to the weeping prophet, and the Lord would do that for us, dear brethren, for we cannot really suffer with Christ except as in the light of the victory He gives. God could prevent the suffering; it is in His power to alter things, but it is a question of His will, and if we are to know suffering with Christ, we can only take it up as victors, as those who know victory with Christ. So the Lord says, "Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me". There is nothing to hinder Christ from gathering His people, unless, it may be, the working of the flesh in us; *that* hinders; the flesh linking us with the world hinders, but as regards any power exercised against Christ, nothing can stop Him. The victory is complete. "This he said, signifying what death he should die". He would go into death, but even in that which might be regarded as an expression of weakness publicly, for He was "crucified through weakness", even in being lifted up on the cross He is victorious, for it becomes the means, as He says, of drawing all unto Him.
In chapter 14 the wicked one comes and the Lord says, he "hath nothing in me". There was nothing in Christ that the enemy could touch: in virtue of what He was, He was absolutely immune from satanic influence; so the enemy has to go, and it says here, leading us on to that very thing, "he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not". I would urge upon you the importance of connecting yourself, in your soul's apprehension, with that which is of God in you. Flesh is incorrigible; do not trust it; but *do* trust what God has effected, for that is unassailable
{190}
by the wicked one, and the Holy Spirit would maintain you as under the influence of the Son of God, immune from the influences of Satan. Believing on Him, you have the victory, as it says, "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"
I would commend to you again, before closing, the thought of victory. There will be victory at the end literally, but Christianity is victory at the beginning, and that is what lends all the power to it. Victory is accorded to us at the beginning, so that we might go out into the world *only* for the will of God. If we go into it for anything else we are sure to be damaged. The Lord said in @John 17, "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil". Actually, we are in the world, but we are to be out of it in sanctification. May we go through it victoriously! I have had in my mind the constant occurrence in John of the thought of overcoming. It is intimated that there would be overcomers, and what remains for us, is to see that we are overcomers in these days.

Pages 191 - 249-"Spiritual Increase", Devon, 1920 (Volume 47).
INCREASE FOR GOD
@1 Peter 2:4,5; @Ephesians 5:18 - 20
What has been exercising me in view of this meeting is that there might be something to induce spirituality. We are, alas! and I speak for myself, in large measure materialists; it requires only that we should analyse our daily experiences to prove that; whereas we are called to what is spiritual. God being a Spirit has a spiritual order of things in His mind, and He seeks to bring us into accord with that spiritual order of things; indeed, we are essential to it. The material was at best only intended as an index to the spiritual, and so my exercise was that there might be something to induce spirituality if there is none, and where there is spirituality, an increase of it. You will remember how it was said of the Corinthians that, although they had the Spirit, the apostle could not write unto them as spiritual. He was, therefore, limited in what he had to present, and there can be no doubt, dear brethren, that the limitation in what comes to us is due to the limitation that is in us. As the apostle said to the Corinthians, "Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your affections". (@2 Corinthians 6:12). The straitening was not due to him. So that the limitedness of what comes, and we ought to own it, is in no sense attributable to God, or to Christ, or to the Holy Spirit; it is due to the straitness of our minds and affections in that we are governed by natural and material things.
To illustrate this I would refer you to a passage in @Luke 19:11 in which we read of the Lord as having entered into the house of Zacchaeus, and having spoken of Zacchaeus as a "son of Abraham", giving him in that way a spiritual status, and having said that "the Son of man has come to seek and to save
{192}
that which is lost", that "as they were listening to these things, he added and spake a parable". The Lord was ready to go on if they were, and He spoke a long parable; He added to what He had already said, blessed and full as it was, because they were listening. Hence the importance of keeping the ear and the heart circumcised, for if there is readiness to hear there is always a readiness with the Lord to speak.
So the apostle says, "Our month is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is expanded". His mouth had been in a measure shut to them because of their state, but now he says, it is opened. His letter had brought about an enlarged capacity in them so that his mouth was opened and his heart expanded; but he was not yet content as to them, and he adds, "For an answering recompense (I speak as to children), let your heart also expand itself", (@2 Corinthians 6:11 - 13). That is a line the Holy Spirit would take, I believe, at the present time, so that there should be increase. I look for increase; not perhaps outward increase, but inward and spiritual increase. It is a time of the Spirit's activities, and the fragments that are over are seven large baskets full; the Holy Spirit shows in that way the abundance that there is. Let us not despise the day of small things, but let us not be content with the small things, because there are greater things. The Lord said to Nathanael, "thou shalt see greater things", (@John 1:50) and that may always be said from our side.
And so in regard to sacrifice; a word that is very simple and intelligible in the ordinary sense, but I want to speak of it in a spiritual sense. Peter speaks here about "spiritual sacrifices", and these are offered by "a holy priesthood". I am aiming at that which, by the Lord's help, may become a means of leading us on to a point yet unreached by us on this line. In speaking of sacrifices one's mind naturally
{193}
turns to Leviticus, for that book furnishes us with the law governing sacrifices. It is well to have the law, for if we do not have the law we shall not be kept right. Leviticus opens with the fact that God was dwelling in the tabernacle, and it was a suitable dwelling. A wonderful scene is presented to us at the end of Exodus; the tabernacle set up in every way according to the commandment and the pattern, and anointed with oil, and the cloud over it, and the presence of the Lord in it. Wonderful scene! And the book of Leviticus opens with God there, and now He says, "If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord". (@Leviticus 1:2). It is what the man does; God affording full scope, as dwelling there, for the affections of His people to move toward Him. It is as if He said, Now who has any love? Let him show it; I am here to be approached, and I have an ordained priesthood available in the court. The result would be normally that this and that one would come up out of the camp with his bullock, or his sheep, or his goat, or his fine flour, and Jehovah would look out, so to speak, and see the man coming up, and would have pleasure in him. But it was voluntary; it was to be of his own voluntary will. Although when he came God asserted His right as to what kind of offering it was to be. There must be nothing there that would in any way misrepresent Christ. God has always Christ before Him, and He would say virtually by His requirements, that there must be nothing in what you bring that would be in any way incongruous or misrepresentative of Christ. The offering must be without spot or blemish, but in a general way it was to be voluntary. In other words, God left it with love, reserving the proviso that there must be nothing in the offering that would misrepresent Christ. That is God's only reserve when it is a voluntary offering; it must be according to Christ.
{194}
Now having referred to Leviticus I would also take the liberty of referring to Numbers, because Numbers also speaks of sacrifices. When we come to Numbers He does not leave it with the people; He says, "My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season", (@Numbers 28:2). God has His claims now. You will remember that this comes in after the gift of the Holy Spirit typically. The Holy Spirit is typified in the springing well of chapter 21. The people drank at that well in the light of the uplifted serpent, the judgment of sin in the flesh. Henceforth they were typically no longer in the flesh, but in the Spirit. They were spiritual, at least from God's side. I wonder if every one here knows that the positive statement of Scripture is that "ye are not in the flesh, but in Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you", (@Romans 8:9). That is a statement you should let sink down into your soul; it is, "*if so be* that the Spirit of God dwell in you". Think of what you are, and what I am, and what all the saints are who have the Holy Spirit! One loves to look at the saints as in the Spirit, and one is entitled to do it, for God says it, and He refused to allow Balaam to look at them in any other wise. Woe be to the man who does look at them, or speak of them, in any other way! God will not allow it. He opens Balaam's eyes so that from the top of the rocks he sees them in the vision of the Almighty. Think of the Almighty! He that can call things which be not as though they were!
If God has given you the Spirit, He has power to bring you, spirit, soul, and body, into conformity to that. That is what God can do, for He is the Almighty. As seeing the vision of the Almighty, Balaam is compelled, for God put a word in his mouth, to bless the people. What he said with his
{195}
mouth was in keeping with the sight of his eyes, and all was of God. What he saw was the order and beauty and fruitfulness of the people as typically having the Holy Spirit. We all need to see that wonderful sight; then we should never speak ill of the brethren nor leave them. Typically they had the Holy Spirit; that is the secret of it. Sin in the flesh has been condemned in the death of Christ; God has done that; and now we have a people in the Spirit who can be viewed in all the beauty and order and fruitfulness that the Holy Spirit puts upon them. There is power, too, for "the shout of a king is among them ... ... He hath as it were the strength of an unicorn". (@Numbers 23:21,22) But it is all God's work; "According to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought"! (verse 23) What is He doing now? It will be the sum total of His blessed work when He shall have put us into heaven in every way according to Christ, answering to Christ, as the apostle says, "made the righteousness of God in him". (@2 Corinthians 6:21)
Then we have the numbering of the people by God in order that, as having the Spirit, they should have the land of promise. That is the second numbering; God now takes account of them as fit to enter the land. They are typically spiritual, and as spiritual they are to inherit the land of promise. And then in chapter 27 the fact comes out that there was an appreciation of the inheritance which God had proposed to give them in the daughters of Zelophehad, representing the subjective appreciation on their part of what God in His love had given to them. All that precedes chapter 28, and then God says, I have given you an inheritance, and I have fitted you for it, and I see that you value it; now what about My offering, and the bread of My sacrifices? He says, I claim that, and He does not claim from us what we cannot supply. He knows what we have,
{196}
and He lays claim accordingly. God will never put you into bondage by His claim. They are now a wealthy people, and it is as if God said, I have given you an inheritance, but you are my inheritance. God has given us an inheritance in Christ, but we are His. Think of that, dear brethren, that we are the inheritance of God! "The Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance". (@Deuteronomy 32:9) What a fact that is for my soul! He seeks a portion in His people, and so in Ephesians the apostle prays that we might know "the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints". What a change it makes in one's apprehension of things when one awakes to the fact that one belongs to those who are the inheritance of God. What can be an inheritance for God who is love, save those in whom there is love? No material things could be an inheritance for Him; it must be something that answers to what He is. God is said to be a Spirit, and He is said to be love; therefore the inheritance must be spiritual, and it must be in love; hence it must be in those who have love.
He says, "My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season". (@Numbers 28:2) It is not now when you please, or at your voluntary will; it is "in their due season", for God has His own blessed needs, as one might say, the necessities of love. Think of that! God seeks the satisfaction of His own heart in our offerings, and in the bread of His sacrifices, and so they are to be "in their due season". There was to be a lamb every morning and a lamb every evening. In addition to that there were to be two lambs on the sabbath day; *in addition*, mark, for God does not cancel anything that you have been giving by additional requirements. If there is a yield from Romans, or from the state that Romans produces, that is not cancelled by the yield
{197}
from Colossians; Colossians is something additional. If I am led on in the apprehension of Christ as in Colossians, that does not diminish what I yield according to Romans. If I present my body a living sacrifice to God, that is never to be recalled; but Colossians implies more than that. In Romans the body is given as a living sacrifice; that is, as indwelt by the Spirit it is actuated by love. It is an intelligent service. But when we come to Colossians there is an advance in the truth, Christ is presented in another way, and that presentation is intended to produce a result in me, and that result is to be added to the previous one.
So we find in @Numbers 28 beside the continual burnt offering and all its accompaniments, not one of which must be omitted, there is also what is additional. There is an accumulative process going on in the soul of the Christian until he is conformed in every way to Christ. For in regard to sacrifice Christ must be the standard as in all else; God has nothing lower than that before Him. So we get the standard in Christ, and one would feed on it. With Christ everything was entirely the outcome of His devoted love to His Father; everything was for the Father. "Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared me a body. Thou tookest no pleasure in burnt-offerings, and sacrifices for sin. Then I said, Lo, I come (in the roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will", (@Hebrews 10:5 - 7). He says, "thou hast prepared me a body"; in that body it was His delight to do the will of God, and that carried Him on to the cross, and through all that the cross meant to Him. But what underlay the cross, and all else, was the unswerving devotedness of the holy love of Christ to God, and God has nothing less than that before Him. He aims at bringing about correspondence with Christ in the saints. Let us not put it aside
{198}
from us; it is His thought for us; He has nothing less before Him than that. So we have in Peter and in the epistle to the Hebrews the thought of sacrifice. Peter says, "A holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices"; that is the divine thought.
Now to turn for a moment to the Psalms again, we have in David's psalm of contrition, (@Psalm 51), a reference to material sacrifices. He says, "for thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it". He had the means of doing so; but faith says, "the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise". He brings in these thoughts in contrast to material or legal sacrifices. I refer to it because it is well to understand how God takes account of sacrifice. That is, it is unseemly, and not acceptable to God, to assume to be sacrificing spiritually if one is not right in one's soul. God says, No, that will not do; that is not what I regard as sacrifice from you; you do not belong practically to a holy priesthood. If there has been sin or crookedness, if you are out of communion, what I look for in you is a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart. That is what God looks for under such circumstances, and He calls it a sacrifice. I think that is what is needed where there has been disregard of divine order, assembly order. When saints are found in that which is iniquitous, in human organisations, you do not talk about spiritual sacrifices there. What God looks for is a broken spirit and a broken and contrite heart in regard of that, or anything akin to that.
But then David goes on to say, "Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem", (@Psalm 51:18). Now we come in principle to the assembly. I am not saying this is the assembly, it is only the thing in principle; David knew nothing about the assembly. In fact we have authority for saying that he, and the prophets, did not know
{199}
properly of what they spoke; it was revealed to them "that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things", (@1 Peter 1:12). But the Holy Spirit knew as He employed their hearts and lips, and it is for us to understand what the Holy Spirit meant. There is something that answers to Zion today, and we have to understand what God is doing for Zion. Zion is the centre for God, and if God does good to that, and builds the walls, and we have a return to assembly principles, then we can talk about spiritual sacrifices. So he says, "then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar"; but do not talk about that if there is need for brokenness of spirit and contrition of heart. When these take place in us, then we come to see that God has a centre of interest here with which His sovereignty and His love are connected. He does good to that, and builds up the walls, and then we have the conditions under which a holy priesthood can offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
Now that is what Peter has in his mind, and he sees it in the saints; but the saints viewed as newborn babes who have first of all laid aside "all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings". He views them as growing up to salvation, having tasted that the Lord is good, and then he says, "To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious, yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", (@1 Peter 2:4,5). That is in Zion, as we may say; indeed the passage goes on to speak about Zion, "Behold, I lay in Zion a corner stone". The house is there, the conditions are there; "a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices". Do we understand these things, dear brethren? What we are called to in the house of God, viewed as a spiritual
{200}
house, is to offer to God His offerings and the bread for His sacrifices in their due season.
I read in Ephesians because it, of all other sections of Scripture, develops the state which answers to that of which I have been speaking, response to God, and God's inheritance in the saints. So it says, "Be not drunk with wine", That is a negative exhortation, for what excites the flesh must be abstained from. The positive thing is, "but be filled with the Spirit". God looks for completeness. Then it goes on, "speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ", (@Ephesians 5:18 - 20). That is what I understand to be the offerings of God. It is to be *always*; in the chapter referred to in Numbers we have daily, weekly, and monthly offerings, and then after that the set offerings, the Passover, Pentecost, and Firstfruits, and the day of atonement; all these come in as occasions of fruit for God. The chapter is worth studying; there is food in it, especially as indicative of what God is seeking in His inheritance.
In Ephesians we are exhorted to be *filled* with the Spirit; then there will be no room for the flesh, and there will be a constant yield for God. As God looks into your heart, what does He see in it? Is it full of the Spirit? If so, you will not be speaking to yourself about the things of the day. They may have to be referred to in the way of righteousness, but your heart is not in them. You will be speaking to yourself "in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord". That is what God looks for, and what He sees in spiritual persons. And it goes on, "Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ". It is to be a
{201}
continual thing; it is to mark us at all times. That is practical Christianity, and that is what God looks for. It is a spiritual people here on earth, presently to be in heaven, but as here on earth the inheritance of God.
May God bless the word to each of us!
{202}
FAITH AS LEADING TO SPIRITUAL INCREASE
@2 Thessalonians 3:4; @John 2:11
I desire to speak about faith. I was endeavouring to show last evening at Teignmouth how God, being a Spirit as the Lord tells us, looks for spiritual results. I would now add that these results necessarily depend on faith, the dispensation being a dispensation of faith. So the ministry of John, calculated as it is to induce spirituality in the saints, emphasises the need of faith; and he specifies what that faith which he aims at would involve. For if one has faith one should know and be able to give account of what it is to him, what it involves for him.
We are apt to be extremely vague in regard of faith, but John specified what he expected to be the result of what he wrote. Having written his twenty chapters, the last one being an appendix, he adds, "Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name", (@John 20:30,31). Hence such an one as profits fully by John's book would be able to give an account of his faith, not merely the articles of it. The necessity for writing out a creed only indicated and confessed that faith had waned. Faith is not what is written as the articles of a creed; it is what is held as a matter of light in the souls of God's people. So John says triumphantly in his epistle, "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith"; that is, a system of truth in regard of God and of Christ held in the souls of God's people as a matter of light was the victory. The necessity for writing a creed only admitted that faith, for those who needed such a creed, had ceased to exist.
{203}
The gospel of John comes in to re-establish what has ceased to exist in the public body. What we are faced with all about us in the public body of nominal believers in Christ is that which appeals to the natural eye, the natural mind, the natural imagination; faith has ceased to exist.
I read these verses from Thessalonians because the apostle could speak there of the beloved Thessalonian believers as not only having faith, but increasing in it; the time of decrease had not yet come. At this point I would raise the question with each one here as to whether he is on the increase or on the decrease? Many of you will remember that Matthew, who treats of the kingdom of the heavens, and the assembly in relation to the kingdom of the heavens, speaks about decrease in fruitfulness of the seed from a hundred to sixty, and from sixty to thirty, whereas Mark reverses the order, and speaks of increase from thirty to sixty, and from sixty to a hundred. That is, @Mark 4 presents increase, and @Matthew 13 presents decrease. Now which is it, beloved brethren, with us? Of the Thessalonians it is said that their faith grew exceedingly, and their love one toward another abounded.
In @Numbers 29 we have an account of the feast of tabernacles, according to the light in which that feast is presented in that book. It is also presented in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, but it is presented in a peculiar way in Numbers, where the number of bullocks with which the feast was to begin was thirteen, as if the Spirit of God would call attention to the full result of the testimony in His people, a large result for God. But I would ask you to notice that the number decreased day by day until it reached seven; a very humbling consideration, and yet is it not what one finds with many of the people of God? A bright beginning, a full result for God, and then, alas! decline after decline until that number is reached below which, if we go, we have to be regarded as on
{204}
the line of apostasy! For if we go below seven we have lost spirituality altogether; we have lost what is divine, and have fallen to what speaks of man and his power, the number six. Let us be on our guard as to that. If you get down to the number six you are in dreadful company, for that number multiplied is the number of the beast. Thank God the number seven saves us from that; and if there is one here tonight who is on the verge as it were of giving up the seven and descending to the six, I would both warn and encourage you. I would warn you as to the descending line on which you are; and, on the other hand, I would encourage you to make the most of what you have in your soul, however little it may appear.
The Lord says, "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed"; He encourages the disciples by that; much more can be accomplished by that than the Antichrist can accomplish, although he may control the navies and armies of the world. For by that faith which is as a grain of mustard seed the Lord says, "Ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove", (@Matthew 17:20). I would encourage you, therefore, to use the little faith that you have. But John is not content with that, nor is any one who seeks to serve Christ; he wants increase. The Lord looks for increase, and the Thessalonians are commended in that it could be said of them that their faith increased exceedingly, and their love one toward another abounded. I would dwell on those words, exceeding increase and abounding love! Do we not see something like the thirteen bullocks in these beloved Thessalonians? They had the apostle for three sabbath days, and this was the result! Faith increasing exceedingly, and love toward one another abounding! What a result that was for God! How well the apostle understood what he meant in writing
{205}
to them as "the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father"! There was a portion for God in that company. The gospel of John is intended to produce such increase as that.
In speaking of faith, I would remark, just for a moment, on the correspondence between those who have it and the tabernacle in the wilderness, as to their external position in this world; and the correspondence of such with the building of Solomon as to their apprehension of what is before God. These two things run together in the history of the Christian. The first letter to the Corinthians presents to us what corresponds to the tabernacle in the wilderness. There is nothing outwardly imposing in that position; inwardly all is infinitely precious, but externally it is weakness, it is despicableness. The apostle went to Corinth and he found there Aquila and Priscilla, and he allied himself with them because they were of the same craft, they were tent-makers. Now what are we to look for to earn the respect and approval of the world if the vessel of the light from God is just a common tent-maker, and if he identifies himself with those of his craft? He made no effort to avoid the humility of such a path; on the contrary he identified himself with the two that he found there who were of his craft; they were craftsmen, not professional men, as we speak, but ordinary tradesmen.
Now what are we to expect from the world if the vessel of the light by which we are to be governed, is nothing more than that? The apostle, whatever education he had, determined not to let it be known there, in order "that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God". (@1 Corinthians 2:5) It was a question of "your faith", and he would not bring in anything that would recognise the flesh, or that the flesh could recognise. Then again he says,
{206}
"Consider your calling, brethren"; whom has God called in your city? God had chosen the foolish things, the weak things, the ignoble things and the despised. But what were those things? The Lord had said to Paul, "no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city", (@Acts 18:10). They were the people of the Lord, they belonged to Him, and they were in the mind of the Lord, the material for the tabernacle; that which should stand the pressure of the enemy, and hold things for God notwithstanding it. And the apostle further says, "God hath set forth us the apostles last ... ... for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men". And he also says, "We are made as the filth of the world, and are the off-scouring of all things unto this day", (@1 Corinthians 4:9,13). Think of that for a moment! How it dissipates all pretence to be anything in this world! And all that was in order that the faith of the Corinthians should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. The power of God should be there in spite of the fact that they were the most despicable lot, as one might say, that could be culled out of the city. Not, indeed, but that there were some noble; he says "not many noble", for God always reserves the right to be sovereign, and the nobility are men and women as much as the common people; nevertheless these are the facts.
When we come to the second letter the apostle says, "I know a man in Christ ... ... such a one caught up to the third heaven", (@2 Corinthians 12:2). What a change from tent-making. He is a man in Christ there; he belongs to the system that God has in His mind, that God has set up in Christ. He is, so to speak, a "cedar"; a man in Christ is fit for the building in the land, and that is not outwardly despicable; it is "exceeding magnifical". The first letter to the Corinthians induces the acceptance of littleness in
{207}
this world outwardly; the second induces faith as to the greatness of things before God, and that you are essential to that greatness, you are a part of it. Think of "a man in Christ"! The apostle knew such a one as that; and he says, "of such a one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities". As regards what he was doing here he would be in keeping with the position of the tabernacle; but as regards what he was before God he would glory in it, for it was "a man in Christ". He had said earlier, "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new: and all things are of God", (@2 Corinthians 5:17,18). That is what faith lets us into.
As regards his outward position, Paul says, "I will not glory, but in mine infirmities". But then in the acceptance of these infirmities, the power of Christ rests on him. The shittim wood, so to speak, would be there, the power of endurance. If you look at the list he gives in @2 Corinthians 11, of the things which he endured, you will see what power of endurance there was in that vessel. He ends with this, "in a basket I was let down by the wall"; think of the humiliation involved for the flesh! And so he says, "I escaped his hands". That is the principle of the tabernacle; you escape from the power of the enemy. But how? In extreme littleness and despicableness. He remained, so to speak, intact for the service of God, but he was let down in a basket. These are truths which the flesh has no relish for. I know that in myself and in learning it in myself I know it is true in you. The Holy Spirit would bring these things to bear upon us, for that is what Christianity involves. It is an order of things of outward littleness, but inwardly the saints are connected with a vast and blessed system of things in Christ which will remain when all that is about us
{208}
shall have passed away, for the works of God remain while the works of men disappear for ever.
So, as I said, John writes his gospel in order that the saints should have faith, and faith that involves that they apprehend the Christ and the Son of God; and that there should be a definite result from that faith, namely, that they should have life in His name. And so we read, "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him". His disciples had already believed in some sense; the passage does not tell us to what extent they believed on Him through this miracle. The extent of their faith is not specified; but I dwell upon this as the initial sign, so that you may from this one trace out the others. This is the initial one, and it is marked by the result intimated by the apostle, namely, that the disciples believed on Him. Now I wonder if we have believed on Christ in such a way as to get something definite by it, or have we believed on Him in a general way?
The scene presented in @John 2 is well known to most of us; it is a marriage scene, and what marked it was that there was a deficiency. Many of us here can bear witness to that which is testified in the passage, that there is a deficiency. But what I would call attention to is that at the outset, in connection with this primary sign, the Lord repudiated natural claims. Now I urge upon you that natural claims war against faith. Unless we take up and hold natural relations in faith, they war against the faith we have. If light comes into my soul, God intends that light to govern me in every relationship in which I am set; no relationship must be allowed to militate against faith. If you allow your family relationships to militate against the faith you have, you are in a serious plight. The faith you have is to govern you in your family relationships, and in your business
{209}
relationships as well. Faith dominates nature, otherwise nature will quench faith.
At this marriage, we are told, that the mother of Jesus said, "They have no wine". But did He not know? Is nature able to add to what is spiritual, to what is of faith? No; the Lord says, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?" He was not on the ground of nature. He says, "mine hour is not yet come". The resumption of His relationships with Israel must be deferred, for "he came unto his own, and his own received him not". (@John 1:11) So His mother submits; and she "saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it". Thank God for that submission of nature! Nature became subordinated to Christ; that is the divine order. She takes her true place, and she suggests to the servants that His word is to rule. Have you come to that? If you are to be in the good of John's gospel that is where you must begin; He must rule.
Now we are told in @John 2 that "there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim". They acted on His word. Whilst His relation with Israel is deferred, the blessings of Israel, and much more beside that one would love to trace, the blessings of the millennium, are already available to those that are subject to Christ. What they will have, we have now; but how? By the disallowance of nature and submission to the word of Christ. The word of Christ is to take effect in my soul, for that answers to the waterpot of stone, and it is to be filled up to the brim; that is, Christianity is a time of fulness. In the Lord becoming man all fulness dwelt in Him; He was "full of grace and truth"; and Christianity is to be marked by that. The waterpot is to be filled up to the brim, and as it is filled it
{210}
becomes wine. You get millennial joys already in the acceptance of the word of Christ.
This was the beginning of signs, and it sets forth the bringing in of millennial joys before the time, on the ground of the disallowance of nature, and the recognition of the authority of the word of Christ. It was a manifestation of the glory of Christ. "He manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him". The signs were done "in the presence of his disciples". Why did He do them in their presence? Why not in the presence of the world? Ah! He wanted to have disciples who had faith. There are very few real believers; there are believers *and* believers. John seeks to bring about a state of faith which is expressed in this, that the one who has it, apprehends the Lord Jesus as the Christ and as the Son of God; and, in apprehending Him as such, he has life, but he has it in Christ's name. I have life in my soul in His name; it is not held independently, it is held in His name, but it is held in the faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.
I would urge on you, and on myself, the importance of seeing the place the gospel of John has in view of bringing about increase in the last days. It meets the tendency to decrease; so that I believe in the end we shall have the seven full baskets of fragments; that is, the full result of the ministry of the Spirit in those who have faith in the Lord as the Christ, the Son of God.
May God bless the word!
{211}
THE SPIRIT'S OPERATIONS IN VIEW OF THE WILL OF GOD AND THE INHERITANCE
@Romans 8:13 - 17; @Numbers 33:50 - 54
I am exercised, dear brethren, to speak about the Holy Spirit, especially in the operations by which He leads us into the enjoyment of our inheritance. He is the earnest of our inheritance. The subject of the Holy Spirit is necessarily a very extensive one, covering every part of the truth; indeed, there is a remarkable statement in John's first epistle, where the Spirit is said to be "the truth". (@1 John 5:6) So that He is to be regarded in relation to every part of the truth. It is quite clear that one could not deal with all that in a short address, but I desire to speak of His operations in connection with the believer's state, leading up to having part in the inheritance. It is well for us to bear in mind that Christianity stands publicly in relation to the Spirit, as well as to the Father and the Son; so that one may be quite free to speak of the Holy Spirit in this definite way. Indeed, the chapter in Romans from which I have read is occupied with this great subject of the Spirit of God, according to what He is to the believer.
I would add to these preliminary remarks a word about 1 and 2 Corinthians, and the general bearing of these epistles on this subject. The first epistle, among many other things, may be viewed as setting forth the limitations which the will of God concerning the saints necessitates. God has seen fit to impose certain limitations on His people, viewed as His assembly. The epistle is marked by directions and commandments; and the test of one's spirituality is the recognition that the things which the apostle wrote are the commandments of the Lord. That is to say, the Holy Spirit in the saints here works out entire conformity to divine limitations. The Holy
{212}
Spirit can never be in any movement amongst believers which transgresses the Lord's commandment. The Lord said, "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me". (@John 14:21)
The Holy Spirit in the believer operates on the line of producing complete conformity with all these ordinances, directions, and commandments. It is indeed the glory of the saints that they conform to these commandments. It is said in @Psalm 19 that "The heavens declare the glory of God"; but in the incarnation; that is, the Son becoming Man here, we have the glory brought down to earth. In that psalm the sun in the heavens is likened to a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoicing as a strong man to run a race; he makes a circuit of the heavens. Then in verse 7 we get the law of the Lord; this was taken up by Christ as having become Man. He took it up, delighted in it, magnified it, made it honourable; so that the carrying out of the will of God, which marked the heavens, has now been seen on earth. The glory shone in every step of Christ, as He moved on in the path of God's will, but that will involved certain limitations here. The Lord in grace came into them, accepted them, and moved within them, and in so doing He glorified God. There was entire correspondence between the great and blessed truth that He was the Son of man in heaven, and the fact that He was here in the most humble circumstances. In @John 4 He is seen sitting "as he was" on the well. He was weary, and the will of God involved that. He says in that chapter that it was His meat to do the will of the One who sent Him, and to finish His work, and throughout His whole course the Lord moved in submission to the will of God, and delighted to do it. There is food in it for us; it is indeed the manna, the mighty's meat: "Man did eat angels food". (@Psalm 78:25). What is that food? It is Christ here in every circumstance of
{213}
life, moving in relation to the will of God, which involved certain limitations, which He accepted. He came down from heaven; indeed, He was "the Son of man who is in heaven", and He could return there, but He came to do the will of God.
Now in 1 Corinthians we see what corresponds with this in regard to the assembly. There are certain limitations made obligatory by the will of God, and the spiritual man observes them, they are not irksome to him; they remain in all their authority as the commandments of the Lord, and as a lover of Christ he has them and keeps them. The Lord manifests Himself to such a one as that, and the Father loves him. The whole point, as to our position here, is that we are for God's will, whether individually or viewed in relation to the assembly. The Holy Spirit would ever maintain us in accord with that, and in us He also links us with that which is outside the bounds of time; the second letter to the Corinthians presents the accompaniments of this. In it, you have such expressions as, "We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal", (@2 Corinthians 4:18). One has often remarked, and it is worth repeating, that the feast of Pentecost in Deuteronomy is not bounded by time like other feasts, because it refers to the coming in of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit recognises all the bounds which are set about us in the time conditions by the Lord's commandments, and the spiritual man recognises and keeps them all, but the Holy Spirit is also the link with what is outside time; He is the link with eternity; and so the apostle says, "If our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens ... ... He that has wrought us for this very thing is God, who also has given to us the
{214}
earnest of the Spirit",(@2 Corinthians 5:1 - 5). We have the thing already in the way of earnest, and in the power of the Spirit we may enter into eternal blessedness.
Now I want to connect these verses in @Romans 8 for a moment with that. In 2 Corinthians Paul develops the accompaniments of this outlet from time limitations into eternal blessedness. Chapter 5 states that "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new: and all things are of the God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ". That is wonderful to think of; if any man be in Christ he is not only a new creature, but he is in a new creation, and in that new creation all things are of God. So in the power of the Spirit one may pass out of time limitations into eternal blessedness. Hence the apostle says further on, "I know a man in Christ". He had the experience fourteen years before of being caught up to the third heaven, to paradise, to the place of eternal blessedness. Think of being caught up to that! He was let down the wall in a basket at Damascus, and in the next statement he can speak of being caught up to the third heaven. It was a man in Christ; he was not bound by bodily conditions, for he was quite unconscious whether in the body or out of it. But he knew something of the place; it was paradise, a place of supreme blessedness. That is the prospect for the Christian, and the Holy Spirit is in him in order that he may know something of it whilst he still has part in time limitations.
The verses in Romans that I have read treat of life. John does not in the main take us off the earth it is a question of God coming here, and having His children here, who, as in the faith of the Son of God, have the victory, and are clear of death. So we do not get John employing the word *sons*, with one
{215}
exception in the Revelation; whereas Paul is occupied with the thought of sons, because he would bring us to God; he would lead our souls to God in suitable dignity. So he first speaks here of life; he says, "if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live", and then he goes on, "ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption [or sonship], whereby we cry, Abba, Father". You have received that Spirit, he says, and by that Spirit we cry, "Abba, Father"; it is not simply the employment of words; we cry, "Abba, Father" by the Spirit. Paul must bring himself in when it comes to enjoyment; he says, "*we* cry". You will recall that in Galatians the cry is the Spirit's; the Spirit of the Son coming into the believer turns to the Father and cries, "Abba, Father". (@Galatians 4:6) Then you will observe in this chapter, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God". Romans gives us the operations of the Spirit in the believer, and brings in the thought of the Spirit leading, and that those who are led are sons of God.
Now I want to connect that with Numbers, and to touch on a point or two in that book. Most of you will recall that the Holy Spirit is viewed as having been received by believers typically in chapter 21, and it is in the light of that chapter that all that follows should be read. Hence when Balaam sees the people, he does not see them in relation to God's tabernacle; he says nothing about God's tabernacle; he sees the people in *their* tents; it was a question of what they had severally. It is the saints viewed as having the Spirit; their tents are worth looking at now. "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel". (@Numbers 24:5) He saw them as having the Holy Spirit typically, and abiding in their tents according to their tribes. May God help us to lay hold of this! It is a question of families. The family
{216}
feature is what the Spirit would emphasise. In the early part of the book the tents of the tribes stood in relation to the tabernacle of witness. That had its place in the early part of the book, but there is nothing said about that here; they are seen dwelling in their tents according to their tribes. It is the saints viewed as having the Holy Spirit; not in the flesh, but in the Spirit. Balaam sees them without a discrepancy; how beautiful! "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob". Sometimes we speak of Jacob as a poor, crooked, failing man, but he is not so seen here. I understand Jacob to speak of man here as he is set up through redemption and the gift of the Spirit; whereas Israel is the man of purpose.
You remember how the Lord speaks in @Luke 18 of two that went up into the temple to pray, and says that the one returned to his house justified; that is, he took righteousness back into his house. His house would be marked now not by crookedness and corruption, but by righteousness. Israel would speak of a man wholly in the Spirit, a man whose name is changed; one who was bringing in all that was of God into his tabernacle, and governed in it by what God is; an imitator of God, walking in love, as Christ also hath loved us. That is what you would look for there. Then he goes on to say, "As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters", (@Numbers 24:6). What a view, dear friends! let us not put it away in the distance. The Spirit of God would bring this picture before us. The saints are viewed now as having the Holy Spirit; the tabernacle is not in view, because it is not now a question of being occupied with what is objective in heaven, or the great system that has been inaugurated on the ground of redemption. It is another side, which is connected with the Spirit.
{217}
When we come to @Numbers 33 the spiritual geography is very pronounced; it is, "in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho". I wonder whether we know this territory, dear brethren? Aaron has died, and Moses can go no further; the lot is just over Jordan, the rich inheritance of God. And the word is, "Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan". What is now in view is their being led by the Spirit in regard to the inheritance. I am not referring to the leading of the Spirit in connection with the passage of the river; all that Christ is to us in love comes into that, and the surrender on our part of all that is natural. His love led Him there, He went down beneath those waters and drove back death, so that it disappeared altogether. There is nothing to dread or to conquer there. The passing over Jordan is typical of what we have in Colossians; it is entering into this, "Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead", (@Colossians 2:12). But all that is simple light, and I am occupied for the moment not with the light, but with the Holy Spirit in the believer in relation to that light. Then, further, when they had passed over they should "destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places", but I am not now occupied with that. I want to go on to the inheritance, and to show you that it is to be divided mutually. I want to show you how the Holy Spirit in the saints forms us in relation to one another, so that we think of each other in love.
Do we understand, dear brethren, the principle of mutuality? I think the Lord began with the Supper. I think He has set before us in that institution the mode in which the saints should be together in family relations. He had no thought of large congregations;
{218}
although the Israelites had to go up to Jerusalem to keep the passover, because Jehovah's name was there, yet they kept it family-wise. It was not one huge congregation keeping it; it was a family affair, if one might so say. The Lord kept the passover with His disciples, and it was after the passover that He instituted the Supper, and in the institution He intimated His thought that the saints, during His absence, should retain these family relations, and that in these relations there should be mutuality. He never thought for a moment that there should be saints eating the Supper together unknown to each other. They were to be known to each other; every one in the company should know all the others. How could it be otherwise, if the relation is to be that of the family? A large congregation does not admit of that; there are many we do not know; they come and go, and we do not know them. The Lord's intent was that there should be circles of brethren, of disciples, small enough for each to be known by all, and that each should partake of one loaf and one cup. For it is *the* cup. He says firstly, as to the passover cup, in @Luke 22, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves"; it was to be mutual. There is no evidence that He handed it first to Peter or the loved disciple, but He says, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves". He says again, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves". That is mutuality. I am speaking for a moment of the position of the saints viewed in relation to the Lord's supper. The principle is mutuality. It is the very essence of the assembly's position here. We are to have love amongst ourselves.
In @Numbers 33:54 he says, "And ye shall take for yourselves the land as an inheritance by lot according to your families". You see it was themselves; *they* were to do it. It is not *here* Jehovah
{219}
giving the inheritance, or Moses, but they were to take it for themselves on the principle of mutuality. "To the many ye shall increase their inheritance, and to the few thou shalt diminish their inheritance where the lot falleth to him, there shall be each man's inheritance; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye take for yourselves the inheritance". Dear brethren, what a rich inheritance is ours! The Spirit does not enlarge on the inheritance in Romans, but He brings in the thought that we are heirs, "If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ". But the passage in Numbers runs on to Ephesians because it speaks of the inheritance not yet possessed, but about to be possessed, and when possessed it is to be shared on the principle of mutuality; that is, I love the brethren, and all that I have I want them to share. The lot brings God in, but the passage has in view the love that the saints have one for another. The presence of the Holy Spirit brings about these mutual conditions.
Then I would remark, that it is to be "according to the tribes of your fathers"; that is, anything that we have in the nature of a spiritual inheritance is not simply for the few near to us, it is for "the tribes". The division of what we have must have all the saints in view. We must not be narrower in our affections than the whole assembly. The good things that we have in the Spirit are the common inheritance of all the saints, and so the Ephesians are said to have love for all the saints. The division of the inheritance is to be according to their families, according to the size of the families, and according to the tribes. The word *tribes* suggests much to faith. God never had anything less before Him than the twelve tribes, nor did ever any man of faith have anything less before him. Nor will any man today who has the Spirit and walks in the Spirit, think of anything less than *all* the saints of God. They all
{220}
belong to the assembly, and what we have in the Spirit we share with them, according to the size of the families, as it says.
The Holy Spirit would produce this in us. It is important that we should have love one to another, and that unalloyed by any selfish considerations, and as walking in the Spirit, and loving in the Spirit, we should embrace all the saints. Whatever we have in the way of spiritual gain and blessedness is to be shared with them all. Divine love in us leads to enlargement, so that we embrace them all in our affections. May the Lord bless His word.
{221}
WHAT THE ASSEMBLY IS TO CHRIST, AND WHAT IT IS TO GOD
@2 Corinthians 11:2,3; @Genesis 49:1,2; @Deuteronomy 33:1 - 5; @Psalm 122:3,4
I want to say a word about the assembly, in regard to what it is to Christ and what it is to God. The subject is necessarily large, but I shall confine myself to certain features which I trust may be of present service to the saints, and what I would remark at first is the object the apostle had in his service in Corinth. John the baptist heard the voice of the Bridegroom, but he did not undertake to bring in the bride for Christ. That was not his service. It remained for the Lord to make His own selection as to who should bring in the bride by his ministry. So Paul comes in especially for this service. And in going to Corinth he had this in his heart; in ministering to the Corinthians he had before him to espouse them to one Man, that he might present them as a chaste virgin to Christ. He had other thoughts, but evidently this thought was nearest to the Lord's heart, that their affections should be undivided, and that they should be a chaste virgin to Christ.
The Lord had said to Paul at the outset of the work in Corinth, "I have much people in this city", (@Acts 18:10). He had, like the master of a multitude in @Song of Solomon 8:11, much people there, and would form those people into an assembly; for the master of a multitude in the Song of Songs is the former of assemblies in Ecclesiastes. The Lord would have the much people that He had in Corinth formed into an assembly, and this the apostle had before him in his service; and that assembly was especially singled out as God's assembly. But then at the same time these saints were taken up and regarded and served by Paul as specially belonging to Christ. The great
{222}
point is that we should not be of double heart, that the heart should be undivided; one Man is to control it, and the heart being His, one is kept in regard of Christ in a virgin state.
The apostle expresses his anxiety as regards the Corinthians, and well indeed he might; he says, "I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, so your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ". He was jealous, and the Lord is jealous; you will recall that in @1 Corinthians 10 it is said, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?" (verse 22) These questions refer to our relations in our several pathways of responsibility in this world. The Lord's supper is a challenge to our hearts as to where they are; in other words, the Lord would say to us in it, This is what I have done for you, now what are you for Me? Can I trust you in My absence? It is His absence that is the test.
The book of Proverbs refers to the marriage relation, as the book of Ecclesiastes refers to the assembly. The preacher in Ecclesiastes is a former of assemblies, but the speaker in Proverbs is a man of love. He is nurtured in his father's and his mother's affections, and he says, "Who can find a woman of worth?" (@Proverbs 31:10) In Ecclesiastes he intimates that such a woman had not been found. Proverbs raises the question as to who can find her, and I think that when Paul went to Corinth he had in mind to find her, and that he certainly found her at Ephesus; a woman of worth, whose price is far above rubies, one of whom it could be said that "the heart of her husband doth safely trust [or confide] in her". (verse 11) The question is, Can we be trusted? I often say, Can I be trusted when I am not in sight of the brethren? Am I true to the fellowship? I am to be true, and not to compromise them in any way by my associations or conduct.
{223}
But then there is more than that in the fellowship. The love of God is in it. "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?" (@1 Corinthians 10:16) What is that blood? It is the life of Christ which He has given up for us. God has given it up. Can I trifle with that? "My dearly beloved", he says, "flee from idolatry" (verse 14) -- FLEE from it. Anything that disputes the rights of God in my heart is idolatry. The love of Christ in the Supper is a test to us. "The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?" He took that body in order to carry out the will of God, and that body has been devoted to us, for He died in that body. The love of Christ is in the fellowship; and then finally the love of the brethren is in it. "For we being many are one bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread". (verse 17) Now where are we in our affections? He says further, "Ye *cannot* be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of demons". And then he adds: "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?" (verses 21,22)
These are solemn questions. One would love to be able to put them to every professed believer on earth, for they refer to every such one. Jealousy is the rage of a man. We should see that there is nothing to provoke Him to jealousy; that we might be as those that are espoused to one Man: that the heart should he undivided; that there should be freedom from corruption, and that we should be a chaste virgin for Christ. That is, I believe, what the Lord is set for now; that at the end of the days the assembly might appear in its virgin state. Let us seek to be among the wise ones, by the recognition of the Spirit, and the avoidance of all that which would provoke the Lord to jealousy. Let there be nothing that would in any way dispute His rights in our hearts.
Now in turning to the Old Testament, I want to
{224}
show that we have in the parental interest of Jacob a foreshadowing of the Lord's parental interest in the disciples. The gospels afford much evidence of His parental interest in and care for them. Indeed, the institution of the Supper was in connection with a household position. The Lord was in the position of a householder; He was the Head. And so I call attention to Jacob for a moment; he says, "Gather yourselves together". Our position here is a very humble one as regards this world: we are disciples of a rejected Christ, and it is as such we come together. At the institution of the Lord's supper, the Lord was, as it were, the Head of the house, but He was going to die. Do we take that to heart? Murder was outside, the air was rife with it, and within the traitor's hand was on the table. Think of the dreadfulness of these circumstances, but yet there was parental interest in the heart of Christ for His disciples, and that remains.
Jacob called his sons, and said, "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father". You will notice that he speaks of gathering twice: first, "that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days". The Lord has left nothing untold. The history of the assembly involves much that is painful in the extreme, but it has all been told. Do we know what He has told us? He that has an ear, let him hear. But the second verse says, "Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father". The word *gather* in that verse is really *assemble*. It suggests our position in the assembly, and in the assembly we are to hear, we are to hearken. The preacher says, "Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools". (@Ecclesiastes 5:1)
{225}
The first verse of @Genesis 49 is what Jacob would say to them as to what would befall them in the last days. In love the Lord has told everything beforehand, and it is a most humiliating record on the one hand, but on the other hand it is fraught with every encouragement, because the history recounts what He is to the assembly. Were it not for that, she could never come out at the end as she does. For the end is that "the Spirit and the bride say Come". That is, there is full affection and intelligence in the assembly at the end, in spite of the terrible things the Lord had to speak of. But then there is also "Assemble yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father". I would urge on you the importance of listening to what the Lord is saying. "Hearken unto the voice of Israel your father" is suggestive of the parental interest that marks the Lord's care for the assembly. Let us pay attention to that. He that has an ear, let him hear what the Lord says, and what the Spirit says. Here it is what Jacob their father says, but it is the voice of Christ typically, and the sons are to hear. Let us have exercised ears. Many are unable to distinguish sounds. You remember how that when Moses and Joshua came down from the mount and merriment was going on in the camp, Joshua said, "There is a noise of war in the camp". (@Exodus 32:17) He had an unexercised and an inexperienced ear. But Moses said, "The noise of them that sing do I hear"; (verse 18) he discerned the idolatrous voice in the camp. I refer to that because of the great importance of having exercised ears, so that we might discern the Lord's voice, and what He says.
When we come to Deuteronomy we have the other side; that is, to the period following upon the gift of the Holy Spirit typically to the people. And so it is said that, "Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob". I invite
{226}
your attention to the reference to the law in that passage; it is a spiritual reference. The law is holy, just, and good, and it is regarded as the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. @Psalm 119 is the appreciation by the godly man of the commandments of the Lord. "And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together". They were now typically in assembly order, and viewed in that light Christ is King in Jeshurun, that is, He is enthroned in the affections of the saints. As Mary says, "They have taken away my Lord"; (@John 20:13) that is, affection's Lord. Not *the* Lord, but *my* Lord. And so Thomas says, "*My* Lord and *my* God". Do we regard the Lord in that light?
In @Psalm 122 you have the saints together typically in assembly order in relation to God. These psalms are called "Songs of degrees"; they refer to certain spiritual movements in the people of God. You observe it says, "Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together"; and then it says, "the tribes go up". Now I take this to be spiritual movement. In @Deuteronomy 33:5 the Lord has His place in our affections as gathered together. I wonder whether we know anything about that? And then, further, do we know what it is, as gathered together, to move upwards, to move Godward in assembly order? I do not think for a moment the Lord ever gives up the thought of the assembly; nor does God. So when I come together with the brethren, I would have the thought of the assembly before me as the Lord has it before Him, and I would be there, so to say, in the order of the tribes. The words "unto the testimony of Israel" may be read "Israel's custom". What is the assembly custom? Well, the Lord inaugurated a custom: "When they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives"; (@Matthew 26:30) they went in a certain spiritual order.
{227}
Luke says, "he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives", (@Luke 22:39). It was an ascent. It was a movement the Father understood. There are customs the Lord has enjoined to govern us, and which should not be disregarded. They are spiritual customs which are not our own. As we are spiritually educated we understand them, and we go up "to give thanks unto the name of the Lord". (@Psalm 122:4) That is what God looks for. I believe that today there is a revival of things as they were, in measure, and I refer especially to what is due to the Father. It is a custom that the Holy Spirit has revived and would revive, and I hope will be maintained, that Christ and the Father may have their portion in the saints in these last days. May the Lord bless His word.
{228}
FELLOWSHIP AND THE LORD'S SUPPER
@1 Corinthians 10:15 - 22; 11:23,24
J.T. The Lord seems to have called special attention to the Supper in recent years, and it would seem that He has in view that the varied features of the assembly should be revived, so that in result the Spirit and the bride may say, "Come". My thought in suggesting these scriptures is that we might see that in the first the Spirit emphasises communion, or fellowship; and in the second the love that is suggested in the Lord's supper. The love of Christ. The emphasis is on the fact that it is in the blood of Christ. The new covenant is in it; but it is, as the Lord says, "in my blood".
Ques. Why the communion first?
J.T. To regulate the saints in their walk and conduct, and to save us from idolatry. If idolatry is admitted there is no hope of the Lord's supper being truly reached.
Ques. Is the Supper the result of the communion of chapter 10?
J.T. Well, it can only be enjoyed as the communion is kept. The subject is introduced by this "Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry".
Ques. When he says, "I speak as to wise men", would it be as those who have answered to that exhortation, who have fled from idolatry?
J.T. He addresses them as being wise or intelligent persons. The Lord's supper is not for a congregation merely; it is for an assembly, which suggests that it is composed of intelligent persons. With that in view wisdom would come in. The Supper is for the assembly.
J.R.K. Would you say that the term communion involves obligation?
{229}
J.T. It does; obligation to God, to Christ, and to the brethren.
Ques. What is idolatry? How does it affect us?
J.T. Anything that disputes the rights of God in the soul, and God as revealed in the death of Christ. "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?" It is what God is in that blood, and anything that disputes that in your heart would be idolatry.
C.A.C. We see in @Psalm 16 a blessed Man who was entirely apart from idolatry, and His delight was in the saints. Does chapter 10 look at the saints as being on that line?
J.T. Yes, I think so.
J.H.L. What verses are you referring to in @Psalm 16?
C.A.C. "Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips". (verse 4) He was entirely apart from idolatry, and He said to the saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent, "in them is all my delight". (verse 3)
J.T. That greatly helps this passage. I was remarking the difference between a congregation and an assembly. "I speak as to intelligent persons". That suggests the assembly, or, I should say, those that compose it.
Ques. Does it involve that they are intelligently identified with the name of the Lord?
J.T. I think so, and that what is presented is taken up in a consistent way, a consistency based on intelligence as to what is presented in the elements. "Judge ye what I say" is an appeal to the intelligence of the saints; the next chapter is rather an appeal to our affections.
P.L. Would you say that, regulated by the authority of divine love, we can give ourselves to the desires of that love? Chapter 10 brings in more
{230}
our regulation, and chapter 11 our availability for the desires of that love?
J.T. In chapter 11 the heart is appealed to by the exact words and voice of the Lord Himself.
C.A.C. Is that why you connected the Lord's supper with bridal affections? Is chapter 10 rather moral suitability?
J.T. I think so. In chapter 11 there is the presentation of what the Lord did, and His death appeals to the affections in a peculiar way; the answer to it is, I think, seen in the address to Philadelphia. The Lord promises to the overcomer there, "him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God ... ... and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God ... ... which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and my new name". (@Revelation 3:12) It seems as if the Lord assumes that an overcomer in that period would value the things which were *His*, especially His God. The gospels are a testimony of what His God was to Him. You were remarking the beautiful reference in @Psalm 16 to God and to the saints; we see there the refusal of idolatry. The Lord assumes that the overcomer would value that. I think that as the gospels are studied, or rather, as we feed on them, we acquire an appreciation of what God was to Christ here. It is His God, the temple of His God, the name of the city of His God, and finally His own new name.
Ques. What is the new name?
J.T. The emphasis is on the word *new*; we have to learn what is new in the name by what we get in the gospels and the epistles.
Ques. Would you say that overcoming according to the verses you quote involves separation from the world and idolatry? Is it answering to the obligation imposed on us in connection with the Supper?
J.T. I think Philadelphia runs parallel with the revival of the Supper.
{231}
J.R.K. So that in the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup we commit ourselves to a course in which the name of the Lord is preserved in our minds.
J.T. Yes; the love of Christ is presented to us in the Supper, and then what Christ is as Man in entire devotedness to the will of God is presented in the loaf, and the unity of the saints is added to that.
J.R.K. And to answer to these obligations to God and to Christ and to the brethren is equivalent to overcoming.
C.A.C. The overcomer would take character from Christ, who is the Holy and the True.
J.T. I think the connection with @Psalm 16 is very good indeed, because as you consider the path of Christ as presented in the gospels, you see His unswerving devotedness to God. He was holy and He was true; He was not only true to God, but He was true to the saints. He held them and carried them through. He said to His enemies, "If therefore ye seek me, let these go their way". (@John 18:8) I think that this threefold obligation is of all importance for us if we are to overcome, and it is not exactly here a question of commandments, but of consistency. There is an obligation to God, to Christ, and to the saints. And then an additional thought comes in, namely, that if untrue we have the Lord to contend with. If we provoke Him to jealousy we have to contend with Him; we are at issue with Him.
Ques. Would not being true to your baptism preserve you from idolatry?
J.T. The question of consistency is more emphasised in connection with the Lord's supper than with baptism, although consistency is in connection with each. It is in relation to the Supper that he says, "I speak as to intelligent persons: do ye judge what I say". And what does he say? "The
{232}
cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?" You have part in that; now what about your outward relations? Are you trifling with idolatry? If I understand rightly, in taking the Supper we come under obligation in the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup. We have to be true to that. In John's epistle we are said to be "in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ". (@1 John 5:20) He was the true One.
C.A.C. lf we cherish the thought of the One who was here for the will of God, it morally necessitates that *we* should be here for that will.
J.T. Jesus Christ is the true One who unswervingly carried out the will of God, and the loaf speaks of that; and hence the obligation is ever with one to be true to that. The gospels afford much food for the soul; one has to feed on Christ as the One who carried out the will of God.
Ques. Would it involve consistency with His death?
J.T. Yes; it is really consistency with Christ, including His death, because it is a question of what He was here. These things would serve to bring out the features of Christ in a formative way in the saints, so that there might be conformity to Christ. The book of Proverbs brings in the woman of worth, one who can be confided in when the husband is away. The question comes to me, Can I be trusted in the absence of the Lord, or we might say, in the absence of the brethren? "The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her". (@Proverbs 31:11) When we come to @1 Corinthians 11 we have what is collective. Chapter 10 is the bearing of the Supper on the individual, as to whether I am true; and one can understand how the Lord watches the saints to see the development of this element of holiness and truthfulness. In chapter 10 I am obligated in regard of all the others as to my movements; it is a question of my
{233}
considering for them so as not to compromise them by my actions or relations. But when we come to chapter 11 it is the collective side; we sit down together, and in doing so one always desires to hold oneself in relation to the whole assembly.
C.A.C. You mean that your heart cherishes the thought of the whole company.
J.T. That is what I was thinking; the Lord has nothing less before Him than that.
Ques. Does that word, "This is my body, which is for you", embrace the whole assembly?
J.T. That includes every one of the saints, and *you* want to include them all too. I have been greatly interested of late in the thought of the tribes. I think there is a danger of discrediting the Old Testament, but it is written for us. The way the tribes are spoken of helps us in regard of what is in the mind of the Lord about the assembly. "This is my body, which is given for you", necessarily includes all the saints, and so as we sit down together we are in assembly relations; we think of the tribes. Moses "was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together", (@Deuteronomy 33:5). They are seen there typically, so to say, in assembly order, and in that order Christ is enthroned in their affections. And that is what the Lord's supper is intended to effect.
In sitting down to the Supper we are in assembly relations; it is an assembly function, and we are to hold ourselves in that relation; and in holding ourselves in that relation we are holding ourselves for Christ; we are for Christ as He has been for us. I was speaking yesterday of Jacob's appeal in @Genesis 49:1,2: "And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel your father". In verse 2
{234}
the word is changed; it is really "assemble yourselves". It may seem a small difference, but the word is changed. We come together, that is our act, but as together we are in the light of the assembly, and in the assembly we are to hear what the Lord says, and the Supper has a voice.
J.R.K. Would you say that if we are duly affected by the Lord's love we cannot leave the saints out of our affections?
J.T. You cannot; you want all the tribes. "The tribes of Israel were gathered together". Now the point is to hear what the Lord has to say. So the scripture read in @1 Corinthians 11 begins with the saints in assembly. It is not a congregation where some human leader speaks, but the assembly in which Christ speaks. He appeals to us, and every one is addressed as an intelligent person. It is in assembly that the Lord would open His thought, and heart to us.
J.H.L. How far can that be taken up today, considering the condition of the assembly in ruin?
J.T. Well, if you hold yourself in the light of the whole assembly the Lord speaks to you; you get communications and manifestations as at the beginning. Present conditions of course necessarily modify this in a certain way, but the assembly remains here, the object of Christ's affections; and the Supper being revived, the Lord would have us, as partaking of it, to hold ourselves in assembly relations, and to clothe ourselves with assembly thoughts.
C.A.C. You have really found the assembly according to what it is in the heart of Christ; you have found it there.
J.T. I was going to say in regard to the high priest's breastplate, and the names according to the tribes being in it, that if we get near to the Lord we find that the whole assembly is in His heart. The Lord says, "At that day ye shall know that I am in
{235}
my Father, and ye in me, and I in you", (@John 14:20). The Lord has great pleasure in Christians, however few, holding themselves for Christ in relation to the assembly. While no company, however large, can say that they are it, saints can hold themselves in that relation. You save yourself from any pretension to be it by holding yourself to be in that relation.
Rem. It must be a great joy to the Lord that the saints should hold themselves thus.
J.T. I know it is a great joy to His heart, because it brings the features of the assembly before Him. He addresses Philadelphia as if He were speaking to the assembly: "I have loved thee ... ... I will keep thee". (@Revelation 3:9,10) He had nothing less than the whole assembly in His mind in speaking thus. @John 14 emphasises the individual, but that individual would think of the assembly.
J.R.K. Would you not say that there would be enlargement of heart in that?
J.T. I think the Lord will bring about enlargement of affection, that we may have all the saints in our hearts.
C.A.C. And love to all the saints is really the basis for Colossian and Ephesian truth. Where there was love to all the saints there was a condition to which the truth could be opened out.
J.T. I think if we hold to that, if we cling to the brethren, the Lord will grant them to us; if we cling to them, they will not turn away from us.
J.R.K. It is interesting that the name is Philadelphia, which means brotherly love.
J.T. I believe there is a meaning in that.
C.A.C. You mentioned earlier in the meeting the emphasis which the Lord put on the words, "My God", "the city of my God", etc. Had you in mind that the Supper has in view the setting of the saints in those blessed relations with God that are so precious to the heart of Christ?
{236}
J.T. I think that is very beautiful. "My God and your God". (@John 20:17)
C.A.C. Is the cup really leading on to that?
J.T. I think the Lord brings in what God is to us.
C.A.C. That is what I meant.
J.T. Yes; the life was in the blood. God from the outset claimed the blood. It had in view the life of Jesus, for that was the only life worth claiming. God claimed it, but He gave it up for us; it was poured out for us. Hence we see the love of God. I greatly value the reference to @Psalm 16, what God was to Him, it was His God.
J.H.L. Are you thinking of the expression, "I have set Jehovah always before me"? (@Psalm 16:8)
J.T. Yes, and there are one or two other beautiful expressions. "The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons. I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore". (verses 5 - 11) That was what God was to Him, His God. It is in the temple of that God that the overcomer is to be made a pillar.
C.A.C. It is really the joy of the Lord to set His saints in the blessedness of knowing His God.
J.T. Yes; He can say that the saints that are in the earth, and the excellent, are all His delight. He views them as set in relation to His God. And should not that find an answer in us as regards the
{237}
saints? And the Supper is the centre of all this: all these things centre there.
C.A.C. I do not think there is anything more precious, or that more affects my heart, than to see how all Christianity centres in the Lord's supper.
J.T. With regard to the tribes in @Deuteronomy 33 Christ is seen typically as supreme in their affections. Then in @Psalm 122 the tribes are seen going up to Jerusalem. "Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel [or, Israel's custom], to give thanks unto the name of the Lord". It was Israel's custom that the tribes should go up. The Lord is the originator of every Christian custom, and it is well to note these customs. The Supper is a custom, but there is something else goes along with the Supper; that is, the going up of the tribes. That is, I think, suggestive of what follows the Supper. The Lord inaugurated a custom when they sang a hymn, and then went to the mount of Olives. That would be a custom which the spiritual would ever afterwards remember and take note of.
P.L. In @Psalm 15 we have the thought of ascending, have we not? Would you say @Psalm 16 shows the features of those who could ascend, and now in @Psalm 122 we find them ascending together?
J.T. Yes. In @John 8 the Lord went to the mount of Olives alone when the others went to their own homes. That is why I think it is linked with heaven; it is where He found His retreat. But afterwards "He went according to his custom to the mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him", (@Luke 22:39). In @Psalm 122 there is much intelligence, much recognition of what is in Jerusalem. "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren
{238}
and companions sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good". I think that is something like the language of a Philadelphian overcomer. The tribes of Jehovah would represent the assembly in its own order before God: a company that ascends, and gives thanks to His name.
Rem. I suppose the character of what follows the Supper should help the saints to go up.
J.T. I think one who gives the lead in a spiritual way greatly helps. It does not say who suggested the hymn, but I have no doubt the Lord did.
Rem. So the Supper puts us together in view of going up.
J.T. I think so. As assembled together we have the custom of going up.
C.A.C. You would not begin the meeting by addressing the Father?
J.T. No. It is important to have intelligence in what one does; one should act according to the light that governs the position.
C.A.C.. I have observed that if a meeting has started by addressing the Father it descends instead of going up.
J.T. There should be a gradual ascent. At the beginning we assemble ourselves, but as together there is something additional; we are set in such relation to one another as to be assembled from the divine side. We are together in assembly then. In coming together we hold ourselves in that relation, yet there is an influence that sets us in the assembly from the divine side, and there Christ is supreme; He is King in Jeshurun. A hymn to the Lord is very becoming then; we recognise Him as Lord coming amongst us in view of our being in the good of His headship.
J.R.K. When in the good of that, would He lead on to the Father?
{239}
J.T. As King in Jeshurun He is supreme in our affections, but soon becomes Head with us. Then it is a question of letting Him have His way, and the movement upward would be through Him to the Father.
Ques. Would the title "Lord Jesus" convey the same thought as King in Jeshurun?
J.T. It would. It is an affectionate reference to His place of authority. No one can say Lord Jesus except by the Spirit. "The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed" is an affectionate reference to Him.
{240}
GLORY IN THE ASSEMBLY
@2 Corinthians 8:23; @Ephesians 3:21; @Judges 1:12 - 15
I want to say a word about glory; glory is a very great and blessed subject, so great indeed that one could not undertake to deal with it in an address in any comprehensive way. I only wish to touch on it as seen in the assembly; that is, as it is seen in ourselves. It is always well, in speaking of the assembly, not to be too abstract. In some connections we have to be abstract, but we should also have the concrete thought of the assembly ever in view; especially when in some sense it is available in that way. So that, in speaking of glory as connected with the assembly, I speak of it as connected with ourselves. Indeed, in the passage in 2 Corinthians the glory of Christ is connected with two or three brothers who were engaged in carrying the bounty of the assemblies to meet need where it existed amongst God's people. We can, therefore, readily connect the thought with the saints.
Now one desires for a moment to refer to glory according to its source. God is said to be the God of it, the God of glory. "The God of glory", (@Acts 7:2) we are told, appeared unto Abraham; and in @Isaiah 51: 2 we read that God said, "I called him alone, and blessed him", showing how God can take up one as a vessel of glory, but He had much more than that one in His mind. I like to think of God saying to Abraham, Now look at the stars, can you number them? Your seed shall be like the stars for multitude. And "one star", Paul says, "differeth from another star in glory". (@1 Corinthians 15:41) Think of the variety in that respect! We read of astronomers finding the stars, this one and that one, and giving them names, but God knows all the stars by name; He knows them all so that one is led to contemplate a vast variety of glories as one thinks of them. He that turns many
{241}
to righteousness has such a glory as is seen in the stars. "And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever", (@Daniel 12:3). The stars have their varied glories, one star differing from another star in glory; and the aggregate is seen by David in connection with the whole firmament. "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handywork", (@Psalm 19:1). You can see, therefore, what a subject the glory of God is, how diversified, and yet how it is seen, as one might say, relatively *in one star*.
The God of glory appeared to Abraham; He called him alone and blessed him. God can connect His glory with one or with myriads, and hence with the assembly, with which God specially connects His glory. In saying that, I am not overlooking that it had a peculiar place in connection with His earthly people. The apostle Paul, in speaking of his love for Israel, says "Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises", (@Romans 9:4). These things were not partially connected with Israel; they were connected with Israel in completeness, for the article precedes each of them. But although the glory pertained to Israel, alas! Israel was not a vessel suited to it.
The book of Ezekiel becomes a very instructive study for the believer in this respect. It is the book of the son of man, and he has visions of God, and these visions are mainly connected with the glory. He sees the glory, but he sees it ascending from the city, lingering over it before it left, and we have pictured to us the image of jealousy. The city had become idolatrous. The glory had been there, it had come in as in the tabernacle, it had come into Solomon's temple and filled it; but now the hearts of the people were turned away from Jehovah, and
{242}
the prophet is taken in the visions of God to Jerusalem, and there he sees all this dreadful wickedness. And though the glory lingered over the city, it had to leave it. But the glory pertained to Israel, and Ezekiel pursues the subject until he sees it returning from the way of the east, and entering again into the city and into the house in Jerusalem. God has not given up His thoughts in regard of His earthly people, for the glory pertains to them and on the ground of redemption, will yet return to them. But Ezekiel has to see it ascending from the city. The prophet John sees it coming down not to a city but *in* one; indeed, the city as it descends is said to have it; a very beautiful reference to the abidingness of the glory, to the permanency and fixedness of it in the assembly.
Well now, having said so much as to its relation with Israel, I want to show how it is connected with the assembly which is the glory of Christ, and in speaking of the assembly, as I said at the beginning, we are speaking of ourselves. Now glory is first of all a question of subjection to Christ. The woman is said to be the glory of the man, and on that account she is to have a mark of subjection. Dear brethren, may I ask where we are in regard of subjection to Christ? The assembly is subjected to Christ; God has placed her in that position. The man was not "created for the woman; but the woman for the man", (@1 Corinthians 11:9). The assembly was made for Christ. Do I know that in my soul; that I am set here in subjection to Christ in relation to all the saints? The assembly is subjected to Christ; that is her place, and to move away from that place is to be lawless, for that is the place in which God has set her. That is the first principle of the assembly's position. How is she to be held there? The Lord nourishes and cherishes her; that is His side, for she is to be held there through her affections. Hence,
{243}
the Lord's supper is the full expression of the love of Christ for the assembly: "This is my body, which is for you"; it is His devoted love for the assembly. He has given Himself for her, and in the Supper He sets before us in a continuous way a testimony to that unchanging love. It is what He is to her. He would hold her in the relation in which God has set her, for God gave her to Him. God has given us to Christ.
The first great type of the assembly is very wonderful. God Himself discerned the necessity for Eve; Adam did not ask for her. God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him", (@Genesis 2:18). Then He brought her to the man and Adam named her. God set her in relation to Adam, but how could Adam hold her in that relation? The next chapter only too sorrowfully details how she lent her ear to the tempter; exactly what the apostle feared in regard of the Corinthians, in regard of the whole assembly. He says, "I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ", (@2 Corinthians 11:3). Eve lent her ear to the tempter, and left her place. As in her place she was Adam's glory, but she left it, and the result was that Adam's glory was gone. What a dreadful result, dear brethren, especially as it applies to the assembly! The assembly moving away from the place given her by God in relation to Christ has resulted in the Lord for the moment losing His glory in her. Christendom presents a terrible picture; we do well to ponder it; that which had been set in relation to Christ, subject to Him, has moved away. Is it because there is anything wanting in the Lord? Ah, He remains, as the word says, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever", (@Hebrews 13:8). The Lord's supper remains as that which witnesses to His unchanging love. Now,
{244}
dear brethren, are we subject to Christ? It is in subjection to Christ that His glory shines in us for in subjection to Christ we come into all the benefits of His ministry, the service of His love, so that we are nourished and cherished.
The assemblies of which the apostle speaks in this second letter to the Corinthians were in accord with Christ; that is why I read the passage. Certain needs existed elsewhere, and the saints were moved by the love of Christ to render help. They sent money by the hands of certain brothers, and the apostle said, If any inquire about these brothers they are "messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory"; that shows that the principle of giving which is the outcome of love can be taken account of as the glory of Christ. The assembly, as set here in His absence, was intended to reflect what He was; and so the apostle said to the Ephesian elders, "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive", (@Acts 20:35). Giving is the reflection of Christ; that is to say, the exercise of love towards one another is the reflection and the glory of Christ.
Now, I want to show at this point how, that in the picture we have in Othniel and Achsah, the intelligence of the assembly at the beginning is foreshadowed. I apprehend that Achsah is a type of the assembly in her Ephesian aspect. She comes in in the body of the book of Joshua, as many of you will remember, and the book of Joshua corresponds with the epistle to the Ephesians. It is the book which describes the people entering into and taking possession of their inheritance; and in no case is the interest greater than when Caleb takes possession of his allotment. The history of Caleb is intensely interesting as representing the intelligent faith that marked the assembly at the beginning. So he takes Hebron, dislodging the giants, and then he says, "He that
{245}
smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife"; and Othniel, his nephew, undertakes to take the city, and he succeeds.
There can be no doubt that Othniel represents the prowess of Christ in the way in which he overcame the world of books, for Kirjath-sepher (city of the book) represents that. Books have had a great deal to do with the downfall of the assembly; they have a great deal to do today with the corruption of the people of God. There are good books, for Daniel understood by them, and had divine knowledge by them. And the New Testament contains books, and John said he supposed that if all that Christ did were written down "even the world itself could not contain the books which should be written". (@John 21:25) There is plenty of material for books of a good kind, and we may thank God for every one of them, those that nourish and instruct the saints. But Othniel took a city which speaks of books of a bad kind, and I have no doubt that there is a strong connection between that incident and the triumph of the gospel in the city of Ephesus. It was there that books were brought by their owners, not confiscated, but brought by their owners, and burnt. Evidently the truth had laid hold of their minds and eclipsed, for them at least, the contents of the books. The books were brought and burnt; they were not sent to second-hand stores; they were not fit to be sold or read by any one. If a Christian cannot read a book profitably, then no one can read it profitably; let it be burnt.
Othniel undoubtedly foreshadowed the great triumph of God by His apostle in the city of Ephesus, and in that city the assembly came out in its heavenly character. The assembly in Ephesus represented that which was according to the desires of the Lord. He unfolded all His mind to the Ephesian saints; as the apostle said, "I have not shunned to declare
{246}
unto you all the counsel of God", (@Acts 20:27). In other words, he disclosed to her all the divine thoughts. What a heritage! But the question then was as to continuance, and when I say continuance, I mean not only in intelligence, but in freshness; and to this I want your particular attention. Achsah, we are told, moved her husband to ask of her father a field, but she alights from the ass herself and says to her father, "Give me a blessing, for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water". That is what the assembly needed, dear brethren, springs! for the point is to continue in freshness, in youthfulness, to continue in the energy of life.
Now, on that point, I may remark that the heavenly city, at the end of a thousand years, is as fresh as she was at the beginning. She is seen coming down, and she is called *New* Jerusalem. That is after a thousand years, but she is still "as a bride adorned for her husband". (@Revelation 21:2) She has lost none of her youth, none of her freshness; she is still without "spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing" (@Ephesians 5:27); that is what she is in heaven. You may depend on it that the vital element is there. But how about it *now*, dear brethren? What about Ephesus? The Lord, when writing to her afterwards, having spoken of all that He could commend, her works, labour, patience, how she had tried those who said they were apostles and were not, and had found them liars, said, "I have against thee that thou hast left thy first love", (@Revelation. 2:4). She was true to the doctrine, but she had lost her love; she had left her first love; that is, the freshness and vigour of it; she had lost that. Why? Ah, she had not used the springs. Achsah had asked for springs, and that is what we need; we need that which maintains us in freshness. I commend that word to you. The Lord looks for freshness. There are the upper springs and the nether ones; it is for us to find out what these are
{247}
in a spiritual way. Whether they are upper or nether, they produce freshness, or rather they maintain us in freshness, and the Lord looks for that.
The Lord, at Sychar, spoke about a spring, a fountain. It is very remarkable that that should be found in John and in none of the other evangelists. I think it is intended especially for us. "The water", says the Lord, "that I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of water". (@John 4:14) One recognises, in the presence of the Holy Spirit in one's own soul, a continuous spring, "springing up into everlasting life". In the recognition of that there is continuous freshness, and I would urge upon you and upon myself the necessity of taking account of the Holy Spirit in that relation as the means of maintaining us in freshness for Christ, in freshness of spiritual affections. One would greatly deprecate in one's ministry, or in one's speaking to God, anything stereotyped. I recognise spiritual customs, but I would urge the necessity for freshness.
As I remarked, there is a continual presentation to us in the Lord's supper of the love of Christ in all its infinite depths towards us, and now He looks for the freshness of affection that can only be the product of the Holy Spirit. Every true believer has the Spirit and must see to it that the affections that he gives expression to are fresh and vigorous; that the words are truly the expression of genuine response of heart to Christ. Achsah discerned that that was what was necessary, and so it is remarkable that you have this incident not only in the body of the book of Joshua, but in the beginning of the book of Judges. Any man of faith afterwards would look back to this remarkable woman, and see the necessity of continual freshness. You see that things began to wane when the old men died. "Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua", (@Joshua 24:31). However
{248}
long they may have lived, in the end they died. We cannot rely on the elders; what we need to look for, while respecting the elders as long as they live, is the fountain in each one, which maintains continuance of affection and continuous fruit for God. I would, therefore, commend to you the desire of this remarkable woman for these springs. She says, "Give me also springs of water. And he [Caleb] gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs". What I have been speaking of has reference, I think, to the nether, although I do not attempt to define it.
Now I want to refer to @Psalm 87, "As well the singers as the dancers shall say, All my springs are in thee", that is, in Zion. In other words, in the assembly. The reference is an exclusive one, if you understand me. The assembly is very exclusive, and those who form it are exclusive, and particularly the singers and the dancers; that is, those who say this were supplying the music. We do not draw from the world, all our springs are in Zion. Do you understand that? Any one going out into the world for his supplies soon vitiates his music; it loses its touch. We have to draw upon the resources of Zion; there is enough there; the singers and the dancers say, "All my springs are in thee". The Lord has placed in the assembly all that is necessary; it is for us to use what is there, and as we do so there will be the continual song, and the continual dancing. In @Luke 15 we have music and dancing; that was as things were at the beginning. In @1 Corinthians 10 we have a reference to @Exodus 32, in which it is said that the people were practising idolatry. They "sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play". Their springs were not in Zion; their energy had its source elsewhere. I would urge the importance of recognising where our springs are; all our springs for singing and for dancing are in Zion; they are in the assembly, and they are exclusive of other
{249}
elements. I would commend that word to you. If all our springs are there, then we exclude the world; we do not recognise it nor any of its arts or devices.
Now just a word in regard of the glory of God in the assembly. I have been speaking of the assembly as Christ's glory, and how there is continuance of freshness as we are subject to Christ in the light of the Supper, feeding on His affections and recognising the Holy Spirit. But now the epistle to the Ephesians speaks of the assembly as the vessel of God's glory, and it is not exactly what is displayed, but what it is to God. The apostle, having bowed his knees to the Father, ends with this. He bursts out into what may be called worship in the light of what the assembly is intended to be and shall be. "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages. Amen", (@Ephesians 3:21). What a thought that is to have before our souls! It is one of the many rich thoughts that this wonderful letter affords for the saints, and, in remarking on it, I would urge the importance of reading Ephesians; it is the inheritance. The book of Numbers enjoins that the inheritance should be divided mutually, and, as we enter into what is presented in this wonderful letter, how we love to divide it! The more we are in Ephesians, the more we shall embrace every saint of God in our hearts. I would like, if I could, to tell every saint on the earth what I know of Ephesians, and I only know very little of it. I should love to divide the inheritance with them, and I believe many here would love to do the same. The assembly in Christ Jesus is to afford glory to God for ever and ever. Think of that, what a thought it is to feed upon! I would like to tell every saint on earth, You belong to that in which God's glory shall be secured, and in which He shall have it for ever and ever.
May God bless the word.

Pages 250 - 347 - "The King in His Beauty", Detroit, 1920 (Volume 48).
THE KING IN HIS BEAUTY (1)
@Matthew 2
W.B-s. Is this the "man child" in @Revelation 12?
J.T. Yes. And in view of the prevailing conditions, among other things, I thought it would be helpful to consider the Lord as thus viewed; that we might have the *King* before us. We are living in democratic times and it may help to look at the early chapters of this gospel so that we may see in them what marked Him.
W.B-s. What is the difference between the "king" and the "man"? We get both in @Isaiah 32, "a king shall reign in righteousness", and then immediately afterwards we read: "a man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind".
J.T. The "king" suggests the thought of *authority*, and the "man" *sympathy*.
W.B-s. Would you say it is the King in Matthew; in Luke more the Man?
J.T. Yes, I think so. "A king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. And a man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind". (@Isaiah 32:1,2) The latter is the sympathy side. I think Matthew brings in the king and the princes. The Lord at the end meets the disciples in Galilee, on the mountain, and speaks to them as a King would speak to his princes, to his council.
W.B-s. You mean in Galilee?
J.T. Yes, not at Jerusalem, but Galilee, showing it is a period in which Jerusalem is forsaken, nevertheless, the King reigned and princes ruled.
W.B-s. Does that apply at the present time?
J.T. Surely. That is the point, that we should
{251}
apprehend the King and be, so to speak, among the princes. That is what Matthew brings in. It is an administrative gospel.
W.L.P. Do the princes represent the assembly?
J.T. Well, the saints viewed in that way, as those who are dignified. The economy of Israel was set up in relation to the King and princes, because Moses was king in Jeshurun and there were twelve princes in Israel. (@Deuteronomy 33:5).
C.A.M. You made a remark as to power being in His hands, and that is alluded to in the last chapter of this book.
J.T. Yes; "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth". And then He says, "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". (@Matthew 28:19) This passage helps us to understand how the matter stands now, because baptism involves that the King is not reigning publicly. He is in rejection, but He is still to be known and obeyed.
B.T.F. It is said that David's sons were "chief rulers".
J.T. That helps. In @2 Samuel 8 you have a list of officers, and in the end it is said that his sons were the "chief rulers". (verse 18) They would influence the kingdom in general. They were the princes, as the margin reads.
W.C.R. Then in @Numbers 7, you get princes who are sympathetic with the testimony.
J.T. Yes, there are twelve of them and what marks them is, that each offers exactly what the others offer. They all offer alike, showing they were marked by unanimity in appreciation of Christ; united sympathy in the testimony. They had the means, too, to supply what was needed.
W.B-t. Would it be correct to say that there are four different classes found among the people of
{252}
God; princes, priests, Levites and the common people?
J.T. I think that is right; that is, the saints may be viewed in these aspects.
W.B-t. @Numbers 7 brings in the princes, there are twelve of them, and what they gave to the tabernacle.
J.T. Numbers begins with the princes, then you have the priests and the Levites; and then in chapter 7 the princes are seen, not according to their official position but according to their appreciation of Christ in their offerings. Their offerings indicate how much they appreciated Christ, typically, and what is noticeable is that they all offered alike. There was no disparity between their offerings, showing it was unanimity in appreciation of Christ.
W.B-t. How would you connect that with Matthew?
J.T. I think Matthew brings in the King and the princes. The Lord sends a message to them after His resurrection, that they should meet Him in Galilee, and meeting Him there, He speaks to them in royal dignity. There is nothing of the sympathy that you see in Luke. It is a sort of speech from the throne in Matthew.
B.T.F. Speaking from the throne?
J.T. Yes, using that figure, as to the end of Matthew.
W.B-s. That agrees again with @Revelation 12. He was caught up "unto God, and to his throne".
J.T. Yes; and then He shepherds the nations with a rod of iron. The rod of iron is safe in the hands of a *Shepherd*.
C.A.M. Matthew and Luke both give the commencement of things in the birth of the Lord Jesus. What is your thought of the birth of the Lord Jesus in connection with this gospel?
J.T. I thought that first of all we might see the
{253}
*genealogy*, the place He holds; because that is important. The person who is to be King is authenticated by an accredited genealogy, because it is the legal side in Matthew, and what is to be observed is, that it is not son of Abraham, son of David, but "son of David, son of Abraham". David is the prominent one, being the king. Then you have the fourteen generations from Abraham to David; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon; and from the captivity unto Christ, fourteen generations in each period. The royal personage is in that way marked off unquestionably, and Joseph is addressed by the angel as "son of David". All these facts help us to see what is in the mind of the Spirit in this narrative.
W.B-s. So that *Joseph* is prominent *here*, whereas *Mary* is in *Luke*.
J.T. Luke presents, I think, the *seed of the woman*, which of course the spiritual mind can readily apprehend. The spiritual, prophetic mind would look for the seed of the woman, but on the other hand, you would look for the seed of David, the King.
W.C.R. Is birthright connected with David?
J.T. Yes, exactly. It is the male line, and this gospel establishes that Christ is legally the Heir to the throne of David.
B.T.F. I suppose that brings in the kingdom, what in one sense characterises Matthew?
J.T. It is the great theme in Matthew. Although we get the assembly in Matthew, it stands in relation to the kingdom.
C.A.M. Is that why Israel has such a large place?
J.T. I think so. So you have here in chapter 2, the *Gentiles* recognising the "King of the Jews" and "*the land of Israel*". These are two features of a wide spiritual field. The fact is presented that the
{254}
Jews do not recognise Christ, but the Gentiles do, which is the situation today. "The land of Israel" in verse 20, indicates what is immediately before the mind of God.
W.B-s. Significant that Egypt comes in here and the land of Israel too, the two points where Israel was.
J.T. Showing that God is tracing the whole course of Israel's history again, but the King is taken up in relation to it, so all is now secure. It is God taking up everything now in the King. "What can the man do that cometh after the King?" Nothing but that "which hath been already done", (@Ecclesiastes 2:12).
W.C.R. You said that Matthew was kingly, and yet the Lord goes down to Egypt and retraces all the history of the children of Israel. He was in the wilderness as they also were, and yet sympathy is connected with the man.
J.T. I think He identifies Himself with them as King. "In all their affliction he was afflicted". (@Isaiah 63:9) The identification of the King with them in the whole course is most touching in this gospel.
W.L.P. That would be characteristic of a true King, would it not?
J.T. I think it would, and so the true King must be a true Man. Therefore Luke supports this, because Luke gives you the Man; the Man is sympathetic, so you get "the glad tidings that *Jesus* was the Christ", (@Acts 5:42).
E.H.T. Seeing that Israel had the records which indicated that Jesus was the King, why did the Gentiles come to know Him through the heavens?
J.T. Is that not how *we* discover Him? Christians arrive at the truth via heaven. The *old* things are in the documents; the *new* things come from heaven. We understand all the old things by the new. Would you not say that?
{255}
E.H.T. Yes. I was just thinking of your first remark in connection with the Gentiles.
J.T. All that preceded is necessarily understood only rightly through the heavenly truth; that is, Paul's doctrine. We were speaking about the fact that the wise men got their guidance from heaven, which is suggestive of Christianity. As the hymn says: 'And heavenly light makes *all things* bright'. (`12:3) We arrive at every thought of God via heaven; so that Israel's position, and Christ's relation to Israel, is only rightly understood as we understand Paul's doctrine, the truth of *Christ and the assembly*.
B.T.F. In Matthew we get more the history of the introduction of the King, would you say, and in Luke more of the moral features in connection with it?
J.T. Yes, it is the seed of the woman in Luke, so a great deal is made of Mary. Here it is Joseph, because he is the son of David, and much is made of the fact that he was a righteous man, and that he was subject. What he was told to do he does without question.
C.A.M. Referring to what was said of the wise men, they did not belong to Israel any more than we do. They were from Babylon and they got heavenly light as to what was written in the Scriptures for Israel, as we do.
W.B-t. They saw "his star", but they had prophecy too, did they not? I thought perhaps they got prophecy through Daniel.
J.T. But they did not refer to that. The point they make is the *star*. "We have seen his star", they said. They went to Jerusalem. It is questionable if they should have gone there, but the star guides them, after they leave, and leads them to Jesus. So it is the *heavenly light*.
W.B-s. Their going to Jerusalem served to bring out the usurper that was on the throne, Herod. I was wondering if the star might have had reference
{256}
to Balaam's prophecy; if they might have gathered something from that writing?
J.T. It is difficult to *define* what it was that led them. God must have helped them. They have no doubts about it. It is, "*His* star" "Where is he that is born King of the Jews?" They do not ask if such a thing had happened; they assume that He was born, and they want to see Him.
W.C.R. They got the report, and the report was "mixed with faith", (@Hebrews 4:2) like the Queen of Sheba. She heard a report and came from afar off.
J.T. I think that is very good. It shows there was faith there. The report they had was "mixed with faith".
W.B-t. Is your thought that the star represents the present energy of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. I think it represents Paul's doctrine, the light of the heavenly position; Christ in heaven and the assembly's relation to Him there. Stephen looks into heaven and he sees Jesus there, but he does not unfold a system connected with Jesus there. Paul does that and that is the light that governs the Christian.
A.A.T. At the beginning you made a remark as to the contrast between the kingly thought and the democratic thought. Has the democratic thought gained any headway in Christendom?
J.T. It has indeed. It is gaining everywhere now, and it occurred to me, although it was not the main thought in my mind, that it was well we should have before us the King and what marked Him as He came into this world; the circumstances of His introduction into this world. We get them in this chapter, and the first is that He is definitely authenticated. He is not a usurper. He does not come in His own name. The king that Daniel speaks of does come, according to @2 Thessalonians 2:4, in his own name, and he sets himself up, "showing *himself*
{257}
that he is God". He has himself before him. As the Lord says, "If another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive". (@John 5:43) But here is a King coming in and God is doing things for Him. It is "the little child with Mary his mother". Not a word is said about the mother beyond that it is indicated that she is caring for Him. He is in her charge.
A.A.T. Is it not remarkable that in spite of His being so well authenticated, He comes in such a humble way?
J.T. It shows that the royal position today is one of suffering and littleness. It must be so because the testimony that He carries with Him involves the complete overthrow of all that exists, and that will not be recognised here. It is inevitable that it must involve suffering, hence the purple of the tabernacle denoted the royalty that was within. That is, the thoughts I have in my mind about Christ, in regard to this world, mean the complete overthrow of it. How can I expect anything else but suffering in the world if I am true to that?
R.L.C. Is that not in keeping with the smooth stone of David's that overthrew the giant?
J.T. How can I expect this world and its leaders to recognise me if I cherish the rights of Christ in my heart? If it is the secret of fellowship, how can I expect Christian fellowship to be in popularity?
W.B-t. I have sometimes thought the world looks on the thoughts of a Christian as unfair, prejudiced and narrow.
Rem. In @John 15:37, the Lord says, "To this end was I born".
J.T. "Art thou a king then?" and the Lord says, "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth". And the apostle Paul in referring to that, says: "who before Pontius Pilate witnessed
{258}
a good confession". (@1 Timothy 6:13) That is, He did not deny the truth. He bore witness to it.
Rem. That would be in the face of rejection, and Christians today should accept rejection with Him.
W.L.P. Suffering in Christianity today is occasioned by the condition the world was and is in. That is the reason that what is of Christ is nothing in the world. The world loves "its own", (@John 15:10) but it hated Him.
J.T. If those we have to do with only knew all we are holding in our hearts they would not think highly of us.
W.L.P. What did you mean by democracy?
J.T. It is spoken of in Daniel, symbolised as "miry clay". (@Daniel 2:43) We have to be on our guard that we are not interfering with national claims, but, speaking of it spiritually, it is not reconcilable with royalty.
W.B-s. Is not the thought of a King absolute authority?
J.T. That is the idea of a King.
W.B-s. In the passage you quoted from in @1 Timothy 6:15, God is called the "only Potentate"; the word of a despot is absolute. When He has spoken there is no other one to speak.
J.T. The apostle had charged Timothy, "before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels"; and then he goes on to speak about "the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords". He says that Christ Jesus witnessed the good confession before Pilate, (@1 Timothy 6:13 - 15).
W.C.R. That is the One that is to rule with a rod of iron; whereas in the democratic thought it is iron *and clay*. There is no stability connected with it.
J.T. They do not mix. It says so in Daniel.
W.B-s. Democracy implies the rule of the people.
W.L.P. It is very beautiful to think of "the
{259}
blessed and only Potentate". He has absolute authority and He will use it for the establishment of good. Earthly potentates have used authority on the side of evil.
J.T. When we read the gospel of Luke we are assured that the sceptre being in the hands of that Man is good tidings.
W.B-s. At the same time human rulers are ministers for good.
J.T. The epistle to the Romans balances us in regard to that. "The powers that be are ordained of God". (@Romans 13:1) Whilst His King is concealed in heaven and, as in hiding, carrying on a spiritual ministry here on earth, God has not given up the reins of government among the nations. Of course, it is a very important balance, that the epistle to the Romans enables the Christian to move on here and recognise everything that is of God. "The powers that be are ordained of God".
B.T.F. I suppose you would say it is most important that in the naming of the King in Matthew, the name Emmanuel is given, meaning, "God with us"? (@Matthew 1:23)
J.T. It has been said that the voice of democracy is the voice of God, but that is far from the truth. As our brother was remarking, democracy is the rule of the people, but the voice of the true King is the voice of God. It is Emmanuel, God Himself with us in a kingly way.
A.A.T. Was it not God's original thought that Israel should have a King?
J.T. Well, the idea of a King of course is provisional. It was to meet conditions that prevailed. He was King Himself, as the book of Judges teaches us. That was His idea. See @Judges 8:23 and @1 Samuel 8:7
A.A.T. But He did not continue to get the place.
J.T. The situation was that after the wilderness Moses was "king in Jeshurun", which I think means
{260}
he was king in the affections of the people. It is a very happy thing when the Lord has His place in the affections of the saints, and that principle was to continue. God was to rule the people through a mediary in some way, but they would have a king "*like all the nations*". That was their error, they would be like the nations.
D.R. Would you say, if the Jews had received the Lord in the way in which He comes into the world here, as the wise men regard Him, that they would have been delivered from the spirit of democracy, and His voice would have been heard amongst them as the voice of their King?
J.T. It was their opportunity, and the fact that Jerusalem had the announcement from the wise men from the East is very remarkable. It should have had the light itself; but the fact that it did not, only shows the state existing there.
E.H.T. Does the fact of a king necessarily indicate that there is an adverse condition?
J.T. No; I think the king in Jeshurun means that he ruled in the people's affections; but in a general way the necessity for a king arises from opposition, I think, because the kingdom in the sense in which Christ holds it, comes to an end when He delivers it up to the Father. (@1 Corinthians 15:24 - 28).
W.B-s. The reign of the king spoken of in @Psalm 72, is very beneficent. The poor are thought of. There is a wonderful description of God's King in that Psalm.
C.A.M. I was thinking in connection with what you have said about Israel and your allusion to Moses, that what you have historically there, the Christian, in principle, has now. You alluded to the commencement being in weakness, and it is very interesting to me that that commencement of things is spiritually known now.
J.T. I think so. Our position is in identification
{261}
with Christ as presented in Matthew, and one of the thoughts I had in mind was that we might see how the kingly order comes into the world, and in how far do I correspond with it? The King of the Jews is born, and, instead of being announced by cannon, like other royal persons, for the birth of the King should have been announced at Jerusalem, Jerusalem is asleep as to it, and yet there is a form of piety in Herod ordering that the Scriptures should be searched. But the King of the Jews had actually been born; yet neither Herod, nor the people of Jerusalem, knew anything about it. That is how matters stand today; but those in the secret of heaven know about it, and they not only know about it, but they want to see Him.
Rem. There was exercise with Herod as to Christ. The exercise comes from one in authority, that it should be brought before the world.
J.T. I do not think God was working with Herod. There is an accredited religion in the world and they do recognise the Scriptures to some extent, but there is nothing moral in that. Their inquiry does not lead to anything but murder.
Rem. But it leads to the exercise of God's people sometimes.
J.T. Oh, yes, but it does not here. The Scriptures may be employed with murderous intent. They found out where He should be born, but what does it lead to?
C.A.M. Do you not think that is what emphasises the remarkable value of spiritual men? The words of Scripture need a heavenly interpretation, do they not?
J.T. I think that is what you see here. The wise men proceed and they find the Lord, find Him in affection. They love the Lord. They have it in their hearts, at any rate to *find* Him; whereas
{262}
Herod is actuated by murderous intent. David said of the ark, that he heard of it and *found* it.
W.L.P. The wise men had heavenly guidance.
J.T. And then they went and *found* Him. It says, "And they having heard the king went their way; and lo, the star which they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood over the place where the little child was. And when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy". That is one side of the picture, a very beautiful side, and it ought to appeal to every heart that loves the Lord. That is Christianity, you might say. These men are guided by heavenly light, but their hearts are in it, and when they see the star, again they rejoice with exceeding great joy. And they come into the house. That is one side of the picture. The other, is what is going on in Herod's mind.
E.H.T. You spoke of affection, but the very fact of the adverse conditions bring out affection for the King.
J.T. Yes, we want to find the "little Child". I mean, the Lord. They know that He is born King of the Jews, but the Spirit says, "the little child", an object of tenderest affection. Then they express their affection in the taking out of their treasures: "And having opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh". They had more in their treasures than that from now on; they were like scribes instructed in the kingdom of the heavens.
B.T.F. Would you attach importance to the thought that God in a providential way used these wise men, and these offerings, so that the parents of Jesus might be able to take Him to Egypt? That is, there was the gold for instance.
J .T. Then what you will notice is that the responsibility of the child is placed on *Joseph's* shoulders. It is the male side. It would not do to
{263}
say to Mary that she should go. It is said to Joseph, "take to thee the little child and his mother". He was responsible; that is the point. I think in Matthew you get the persons who are responsible.
W.C.R. The giving of the gold, frankincense, and myrrh would be similar to those who came to David, and said to him: "in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel"; and then they anointed him. That is, their affections were with him; (@1 Chronicles 2:2).
W.B-s. These are the finest things you can think of, gold, frankincense, and myrrh: gold signifying, no doubt, the glory seen in this Person; the frankincense all that came out in His life here; and the myrrh in His death; all a sweet fragrance to God; fit offerings for a King.
W.L.P. All that followed the worship that those wise men brought.
J.T. Quite. So you would inquire whether one has had any of these things in one's treasures.
E.H.T. In the early part of the meeting the question was raised as to the application of this in the present day, and you spoke of Paul's gospel. Would you say we get this same state produced in us by studying Paul's doctrine? They, no doubt, studied the heavens and the result was they got light as to Christ.
J.T. There is what may be called spiritual astronomy. John is astronomical in his way of thinking, but it is not to call attention to what is in the heavens in John so much as to show the relationship of things on earth with heaven. Righteousness is that one is in one's orbit. But David says: "When I consider thy heavens", (@Psalm 8:3) you might take that up spiritually. And then he says: "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handywork". (@Psalm 19:1)
{264}
C.A.M. Speaking of spiritual astronomy, it is very wonderful. I was just thinking of the fact that Matthew says in connection with the Lord's glory, "his face shone as the sun". (@Matthew 17:2) The other gospels describe it otherwise, but this seems to be in keeping with @Psalm 19, for instance.
J.T. It is in keeping with Matthew.
W.L.P. In @1 Corinthians 15 Paul refers to the glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: one star differing from another star in glory.
J.T. All that helps as to what is in the heavens in a spiritual way. Stephen, it says, "looked up stedfastly into heaven". He looked up stedfastly into heaven, "being full of the Holy Spirit". That is the power of it. "And saw the glory of God, and Jesus". And then he says, "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God". (@Acts 7:55,56) It is very remarkable, that being under the Spirit's power, he should be guided, not to say I see Jesus, but "the Son of man". It brings to mind the book of Ezekiel, the position of the Son of man; Israel now being in the act of rejecting, not only Christ but His messenger; but Jesus is now in the position of the Son of man, who stands in relation to *all men*. Stephen is guided to mention that. Now that they are rejecting Him, He is to act as Man in relation to all men, but He was still waiting on them. He was *standing*.
C.A.M. The allusion to Stephen is very beautiful. It seems to be a parallel thought. There was a small beginning, a beginning in weakness, but it was the birthplace of Paul's line of things.
B.T.F. Would you say an important point regarding the King is the word, "Out of Egypt have I called my son"? That is, the Lord goes down into Egypt, and then it is out of Egypt God has called His Son, so that the King is the Son.
{265}
J.T. He is not only the Son of David, but the Son of God.
S.T. Christ as King according to Melchisedec stands in contrast to this. He is *born* here. Would you say something as to the contrast?
J.T. Well, Melchisedec refers to what is millennial. There is no thought of humiliation in Melchisedec, but the opposite. He appears as "King of righteousness, and King of peace. Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life". The greatness and dignity of Christ are seen in Melchisedec. He shows what should mark a King. He is King of righteousness and King of peace. That is what should mark a King. The apostle says: "Being by interpretation King of righteousness", (@Hebrews 7:2). He calls attention to that.
E.H.T. Why is the Lord as King introduced here in obscurity?
J.T. It is in keeping with conditions in the world. What existed at Jerusalem is an explanation of it. How could God bring in Christ in royal splendour into a condition like that? It would be morally impossible. Hence he is born in obscurity.
C.A.M. God begins by setting forth power in weakness. Only God could do such a thing.
J.T. This second chapter is very touching because it is like the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat. It is a protection that God afforded Christ in weakness; for He was the Ark of the covenant. God "delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand". (@Psalm 78:61) That was all there in Christ, God's power and glory, but it was for the moment in outward weakness, and so the cherubim of glory overshadowed it. Hence the word "Take to thee the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt". And then when Herod dies the further word comes to Joseph in Egypt: "Arise,
{266}
and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life". It is not a question of what Mary was personally, but the *mother* is best fitted to care for it at that time. Later on the mother would not be necessary. "And he rose and took to him the little child and its mother, and came into the land of Israel; but having heard that Archelaus reigns over Judaea, instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he went away into the parts of Galilee, and came and dwelt in a town called Nazareth; so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, He shall be called a Nazaraean". All that is under divine direction.
W.C.R. And yet how very naturally everything works out.
J.T. That is what strikes you; there is nothing outwardly miraculous about it; but God was there watching over His Son with infinite care. "The little child and its mother" presents what is very simple. That a Jew, his wife and child should migrate to Egypt was without outward significance; but nevertheless all under the eye of God so that nothing untoward should happen; indeed nothing *could* happen.
W.C.R. It was the fulfilling of Scripture.
J.T. Quite, and that is a feature in Matthew.
W.B-s. Bereaved mothers wept and wailed for their children. That was there to be seen and felt.
J.T. That was the public effect in Israel, and I can understand that God began to operate among the nations governmentally in view of things that had happened.
R.L.C. The angel says in chapter 1, "Joseph, thou son of David". He is a true representative of David. There was the carrying out of God's will.
{267}
The facts recorded of him here show that he was a righteous man and a subject man.
E.H.T. You spoke of God acting governmentally in connection with the nations.
J.T. Things began to happen. Before the birth of the Lord, Augustus decreed that there should be a census made; he had his own reasons for that, but God was behind the movement so that Joseph and Mary should go to Bethlehem to be registered there, and that Christ should be born there to fulfil Scripture. Thus God acts governmentally to accomplish His own thoughts.
C.A.M. And do we not get in that what will happen when Christ is manifested to Israel in the day to come? There will be movement amongst the nations in that day.
J.T. You can see how everything necessarily focuses in the Man that is born; what happens in the world must converge there, must have that in view; and if we see that, it quiets our spirits in regard to current events. Angelic agencies are moving there, but must necessarily have in view the precious testimony of Christ in this world. That is the one thing God has His eye on.
W.C.R. Leaders of the world think they are very wise and rule in a way politically, but they little know that *God* is ruling *them*. He holds the hearts of kings, it says, in His hands.
J.T. It is beautiful that the chapter which records this part of the history should end with this: "So that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, He shall be called a Nazaraean". Now there is not one here who could find the word *Nazaraean*in the prophets. The other reference to the Scriptures in the chapter, I think, each refer to some prophet; it is not one prophet; it is the prophets, because this feature of suffering, and humility, and reproach marks the testimony of the
{268}
Christ *throughout the prophets*. If you look at your margin the comment refers you to @Isaiah 53, and you could not get a much better passage to speak of the humility and suffering of the Lord than that, but it is not the only one. It is the testimony of the prophets that the Messiah should suffer.
C.A.M. You are not exactly tied down to the literal words of Scripture. You recognise the meaning too, but that is the value of being spiritual.
W.B-s. I have often thought of this passage and tried to find some specific scripture; but the view you take, that it was general in the prophets, gives a good explanation. There is the word by Paul in @Acts 20:35, "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive". You do not find that, but it seems to come out something like this.
C.A.M. And the Lord in quoting Scripture quotes from a translation not literally very correct.
J.T. He quotes, I suppose, from the LXX; but you must not encourage us to be incorrect.
C.A.M. *Every word* has its meaning.
J.T. The omission of one letter proved a point. "He does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed; which is Christ", (@Galatians. 3:16). So that accuracy in Scripture is very important.
B.T.F. Have you any thought as to the similarity of the words *Nazarite* and *Nazaraean*? Both are beautifully true of the Lord.
J.T. They have different meanings. Nazarite is separation. "Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk", (@Lamentations 4:7). A Nazaraean is a sufferer, one in reproach.
W.C.R. Did not one whom the Lord call say, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" (@John 1:46)
J.T. That was Nathanael. That shows what was in their minds; but it is very pointed there that the
{269}
Scriptures are brought in in regard of what did come out of it. "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth", (@John 1:45). The account that Philip gives is striking. It is not primarily the One who came from Nazareth, but the One of whom Moses wrote, and the One of whom the prophets wrote; and then, he adds, "Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth". Philip knows the Scripture, so Nathanael's question, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" is answered. If Nathanael had been spiritual, he would have inquired at the outset, What did Moses say? What did the prophets say? But his mind was Jewish and natural. Philip had spoken of what Moses and the prophets wrote.
C.A.M. He had come into the good of the millennium before the time. He was really sitting under his vine and fig-tree, was he not?
J.T. Notice that it was when he began to move that the Lord designated him. It says, "Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile". It was not the one sitting under the fig-tree, but the one *coming* that was truly an Israelite, showing that movement is a feature in John.
D.R. Would it not give us great pleasure to take account of the time when authority will be set up in One who is a Shepherd; and in connection with the Lord as King to take account of Him as our Shepherd and Bishop, the One who will keep us together?
J.T. Quite. You can rest in assurance, notwithstanding it is a rod of iron, if it is in the hands of One who exercises it as a shepherd. It says, He shall *shepherd* the nations.
D.R. And God intended that everyone who came
{270}
in the royal line should exercise their influence as a shepherd, did He not?
W.C.R. Explain that a little -- "Who shall shepherd all the nations with an iron rod?" (@Revelation 12:5).
J.T. I think that is the principle. He keeps them together, cares for them. The shepherd's rod is not to *beat* the sheep; it is employed to guide them into the way.
W.B-s. There seems an incongruity with a shepherd and the rod of iron. Iron is destructive; it is powerful anyway in the way of destruction.
J.T. It reminds of the power that He has, I suppose, but it is in the hands of a Shepherd. It is used for shepherding.
W.L.P. It could be used as destruction to those who would injure the sheep.
J.T. You cannot think of flexibility in divine rule. Human governments have to give way to people, but divine rule is not flexible. Rule as in God's hands is absolute. The bottom principle of divine rule is that there is no toleration of man's will whatever.
W.C.R. "A sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom", (@Hebrews 1:8).
C.A.M. It is remarkable that David got his training as a shepherd.
J.T. Shepherds were abominable to the Egyptians; (@Genesis 46:34). Man in the flesh is not capable of appreciating the spirit of a shepherd. "And thou shalt call his name Jesus: for *he* shall save his people from their sins". That is what marks *Jesus*. And then it goes on: "Now all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord, through the prophet, saying, Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel". And then we are told what the meaning of that is: Isaiah does
{271}
not tell us, but Matthew does: "which is, being interpreted, God with us".
C.A.M. That sign was given to an ungodly king, was it not?
J.T. It was very wonderful that God should propose that to a man like Ahaz. Ahaz would not ask for a sign, but it was faith's opportunity to look for a sign, and the sign was given, and this is the sign, a Babe, but Emmanuel.
C.A.M. This wonderful sign involves the whole universe.
W.C.R. God works through that which is weak outwardly.
J.T. Yes, and then you see in that part of Isaiah, that directly Immanuel is introduced the whole scene changes; (@Isaiah 7). The Assyrian comes up to the attack, but it is Immanuel's land and he cannot overthrow Immanuel. That is what we get in Matthew. The presence of Christ means that Satan shall never prevail now; he cannot overthrow what is of God. If he could we would not be here today!
{272}
THE KING IN HIS BEAUTY (2)
@Matthew 4
W.B-t. Does this bring out the manner of Man who was the King?
J.T. It does. That is the point in it; how He came into the world; how He recognised what was in it; and what He Himself was.
W.B-s. Is it necessary for a King to have a forerunner? The forerunner is in chapter 3, is he not?
J.T. Yes. "Now in those days comes John the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea". He prepares the way of the Lord.
B.T.F. How do you connect the thought of King with the Lord in His character as the dependent Man in the wilderness?
W.B-t. He that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city.
J.T. That is seen perfectly in Christ here. Adam failed in it. Adam was given dominion over everything but he could not control himself. If one cannot rule one's self by self-control, it is obvious that he cannot rule others. Noah failed specially in this and he became drunk.
W.B-s. The thought of subjection here is entire dependence, and He knew what it was to be under authority, to be under orders. He would not do a thing Himself. A king has to know what it is to be under authority in a way, does he not?
J.T. Yes, quite, and the king was to be subject to the word, you know. The law of Moses provided for the king, as we get it in @Deuteronomy 17:19. The king was to "Keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them". The Lord is clearly on Deuteronomy ground here.
W.B-s. So the headship of Christ, and being
{273}
subject to God, is a great thought for us now. I do not know that it comes in here, but "the head of Christ is God", (@1 Corinthians 11:3) therefore, He is subject in that way.
J.T. But chapter 3 has an important place as introducing the forerunner, and what marked his ministry. He was preparing the way of the Lord: those that recognise the coming One must disallow the flesh. A point of chapter 3 is, I think, that in coming into this world the Lord did not intend in any way to honour the flesh. It says, "And John himself had his garment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey"; and further, "But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce therefore fruit worthy of repentance. And do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father". (@Matthew 3:4,7 - 8).
W.C.R. The fact that baptism is introduced is significant.
J.T. Those that would join Him must accept that God's judgment is on the flesh, and not rest on the fact that Abraham was their father. That is the baneful thing that built up the world, who a man's father is, but the Lord is not going to pay any attention to that. It is a new order of things, and it is now a question of the relation in which we stand *to Him*, to the King.
E.H.T. Is it not true of all ministry that it is to make room for the Lord?
J.T. Yes, and to bring down all natural pretensions.
J.S-t. Being led by the Spirit does away with the flesh.
J.T. Yes, this makes way for the Man who is anointed with the Spirit. Chapter 3 makes way for that. The disallowance of natural claims is what this
{274}
chapter introduces; "And do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father". (verse 9) There is so much that we say *within ourselves* that we do not say publicly. God deals with what goes on within as well as what we say publicly.
B.T.F. Would you say the Lord was looking for a spiritual generation?
J.T. That is it, and John would prepare that.
C.A.M. So the preparation was moral?
J.T. Yes, and his ministry was marked by, "All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field". That is what the voice says; see @Isaiah 40. The outward form of baptism has no meaning unless what we are saying within ourselves agrees with it. You baptise a king and he remains a king. When the Roman missionaries went out they baptised the kings of the Gentiles. The commission to the twelve was, "Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations". (@Matthew 28:19) *Make disciples* of them. How can a man be a disciple today and rule a kingdom? Paul says, "Ye have reigned as kings"; (@1 Corinthians 4:8) but, if they did, they reigned without Paul. The idea of baptism is not to leave things as it finds them here.
C.A.M. So we have present conditions here? I mean the day to come is the day of display.
J.T. Yes, that is right. If you go out to Christ it is a question of not claiming anything in yourself; saying, I am different from this one and that one. Baptism is a leveller as regards my position in this world. It levels things. It is a question now of what the Lord is going to do, being baptised in view of Him, so that all distinction must come from the King. It is not what those that went before Him accord. It is what *He* was going to do.
W.C.R. Moses was a prince in Pharaoh's court but the time arrived when he came into the faith of his baptism and he associated himself then with his brethren.
{275}
W.B-t. Then, as you said this morning, he became king in Jeshurun. I understand you are indicating for us that, while you give up things according to the flesh, if you wait upon God, He will distinguish you, Moses becomes king in Jeshurun.
J.T. "As many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus". If I am baptised unto Christ, it is a question of what Christ will do with me; but then it says, "As many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised *unto his death*", (@Romans 6:3). You must blot out all previous history. It does not count. It is a question now of what I am to be as baptised to Christ.
W.L.P. Christians should have those wonderful principles before them.
J.T. Quite so, in one's household and as regards one's self. What am I saying within myself? We are all baptised, and all brethren; but what am I reserving?
C.A.M. That is an interesting thing, as you said, about Moses, if you think of him as a king. Really the thing came about on the same principle as this, and I suppose the same thing took place with David; you have the lowly heart there also.
J.T. The Lord will distinguish you in His own way, and you will get a place in the affections of the saints; and no one needs to push himself, because in due time the saints accord you the place the Lord fits you for. Moses thought the people would recognise that he was a deliverer, but they did not at first, and he has to go into the wilderness for forty years and then he comes back a deliverer, and in effecting the deliverance he becomes king. He acquires a place in the affections of the saints and that is a far greater thing. David said to Michal, who, of course, had a lineage, being a king's daughter, that he regarded the respect of the maid-servants of Israel. They were among those who said, "Saul
{276}
hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands". (@1 Samuel 18:7) The saints recognise what a man is and you can leave it there; but the old history has to be wiped out. The ruin of the church, the ruin of the public thing has been by admitting previous history. Men have come in on the ground of what they have been instead of accepting baptism in its full meaning.
W.C.R. Whereas, as a matter of fact, the church has no past history.
J.T. It is the new thing and therefore everything in it must be of Christ; what one is there must be determined by Him.
Ques. Would you say Moses started from the burning bush?
J.T. He had his discipline before that, forty years of discipline. The burning bush indicated his gift; it is the manner in which God revealed Himself to Moses and that became the power in his soul for his ministry afterwards.
W.C.R. He received his commission there, and the light of what God was going to do.
J.T. The bush was not consumed although it burned. That was the principle of the wilderness, indeed of God's ways in discipline.
W.B-s. I thought his beginning was in the river. He was "drawn out". (@Exodus 2:10 note b) That is the meaning of his name. I thought that was his baptism.
J.T. That was his parents side; his experimental history with God began later.
W.B-s. His baptism signified death, did it not?
J.T. Quite, but all he went through in the forty years in the desert was to bring him back to that.
C.A.M. In connection with his service for God, he had the sense at the bush of what God was going to do.
W.L.P. Did the burning bush apply to Christ? There was nothing there burned; the bush was not consumed.
{277}
J.T. It refers to what is of God in the saints. Discipline goes on all the time and yet the saints survive. If applied to man in the flesh it would burn him to ashes. There would be nothing left at all. That which is of God survives in spite of the fire.
W.C.R. It says, "Our God is a consuming fire". (@Hebrews 12:29)
J.T. Yes, so we are to serve Him with reverence.
W.B-t. There is a very great principle in the bush not being consumed.
J.T. The people survive in spite of the discipline.
E.H.T. The Lord in speaking to the Sadducees, when questioned on a certain line of things, said, "Have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him?" (@Mark 12:26) It was at the bush.
J.T. He is the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, not of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto Him. That shows what was in God's mind at the bush. It is not consumption, but life.
W.B-s. "The good will of him that dwelt in the bush". (@Deuteronomy 33:16)
J.T. Yes, that is a very beautiful remark.
W.B-t. Going back to chapter 3, where John is introduced: in Luke it says, "to turn hearts of fathers to children, and disobedient ones to the thoughts of just men". (@Luke 1:17) I have never understood that, and now that we are speaking of John, would you help me a little on it?
J.T. I suppose the fact that fathers hearts are alienated from their children would indicate apostasy; natural affection had been disregarded. I think a great point with God in the recovery is to bring about recovery of the household. It is a primary thought with God, the household, to have parental and filial affections, conjugal affections. All these are things that need to be regulated. In the East it was well known that they had become entirely deranged. Polygamy, and all that went with that, was the
{278}
complete demoralisation of the family idea, and it was a great point with God that in the recovery the household should be restored.
W.C.R. Relationship between God and man being broken, every other relationship was broken.
J.T. Yes, it was very noticeable in the household. The Lord says in regard of divorce, "From the beginning it was not so". (@Matthew 19:8) In the recovery God would revive all primary institutions. He is not going to allow any thought to which He has given expression to lapse; so the household, and all that goes with it, must be reinstated. Hence you find the Lord constantly working in relation to households in His ministry, and John the baptist prepared for that.
W.B-s. This class of people here are spoken of as Pharisees and Sadducees. They have a standing of their own somehow. Does that class of people exist yet, the Pharisees and Sadducees; I mean in character?
E.H.T. Is not the idea of chapter 3 to bring into view the order of man that is to come in?
J.T. Chapter 3 is most important as regards what we may be here in this world. It deals with all that, whatever you may be or have. Hence John says, "The axe is applied to the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire". (verse 10) The axe is already applied and it is only a question of God's patience, and giving each an opportunity to cut himself down.
C.A.M. Applying it to us, possibly our trouble would be hiding under a religious status without the moral state for it.
B.T.F. Would you say that what the Lord says about the axe being applied to the root of the trees, is much on the same line as what is said to Nicodemus; "Ye must be born again"? (@John 3:7).
J.T. Yes, Nicodemus was thinking he had a
{279}
place in Israel, and the Lord swept all that away in saying, "Ye *must* be born again".
W.B-t. So a man could cut himself down: the axe was there?
J.T. John's ministry was in order that they might do that. The axe would be what God was going to do. It was a question of what God was going to do to every tree not bearing good fruit, the point is good fruit. Anyone not bearing good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire. The time had come for that and therefore John's ministry and baptism were a mercy, so that men might escape the judgment of God.
A.A.T. Baptism is a negative thing. What is the positive thing here?
J.T. The baptism by the Holy Spirit. John goes on to say: "I indeed baptise you with water to repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not fit to bear; he shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire". That is the positive thing. In the water I am submerged. That is, all past history is blotted out. I cannot bring it into the assembly.
D.R. Would you say that the garments John wore, and his food, indicated he was in the good of his ministry and baptism?
J.T. Yes, he was in keeping with his ministry in his manner of life. As Paul says, "Thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life". (@2 Timothy 3:10). But when you come to water baptism, it is that you are buried; you are put out of sight and all past history is blotted out; but Christ baptises with the Holy Spirit. That is the positive thing.
A.A.T. That is not Christianity.
J.T. Yes, it involves Christianity; Pentecost was the baptism of the Spirit.
A.A.T. I thought resurrection comes in as a positive thing.
{280}
J.T. Oh, surely, but as regards the position of the saints here in this world, as baptised they come in for the good of the Spirit.
W.B-t. I like that thought about baptism; being baptised of Christ brings in what is positive. The Lord now can use me according to His pleasure.
J.T. That is the point. Baptism means that I am available to Christ. That is what I am for now. I am baptized to Christ, and therefore I am available; it is a question now of what He will do, and so He takes us up. He poured out the Holy Spirit on the early disciples, forming them into the assembly. The baptism of the Spirit implies, I think, that one's individuality is merged in the company.
W.L.P. Baptism is simply negative in itself, but what follows on baptism, the Lord taking one up, is positive.
J.T. But there is the baptism of the Holy Spirit, that is the positive side.
C.A.M. But in the water of baptism you are baptised to something, otherwise you would come to an end. Even Israel was "baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea". (@1 Corinthians 10:2).
W.B-t. People say to their children, You are baptised and because of that you cannot do certain things, but I see a further thought, that is, you are baptised to Christ so that He can use you. You are available for Him now and you must not do that, because that belongs to something which should be ended by your baptism.
J.T. Whereas, the idea of baptism as conveyed by the Roman missionaries in Western Europe falsified it, because the baptised persons were allowed to remain as they were. It was simply a rite that had no moral force, whereas, the point is that the baptised ones are available to Christ. What will He do with them?
D.R. Would you say baptism comes in as a
{281}
foundation principle in connection with the kingdom of the heavens? "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh". (@Mark 1:15).
J.T. Yes, I think so, and it makes room for Christ who baptises with the Holy Spirit. It says: "Then went out to him (John) Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round the Jordan, and were baptised by him". That is what they would come into according to John's preaching. They would come into the baptism of the Holy Spirit. That was the legitimate result of their coming out.
A.A.T. But only one hundred and twenty came in.
J.T. That is an historical fact; but this is how the matter stands: that the One who is in their midst was such an One that John was not worthy to bear His shoes. He is one that will baptise you with the Holy Spirit. "He shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire". That was the proposal.
W.C.R. But you do not get household baptism here.
J.T. No, it is the general position of baptism in connection with the coming in of Christ.
W.C.R. Our brother was saying that it would be more believer's baptism; but when a child is baptised, like Moses, the time comes when he comes into the faith of it. He is not responsible for it at the moment.
J.T. Household baptism stands on this principle that the head says, "As for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah", (@Joshua 24:15). I hold myself and my house for the Lord. All is available for the Lord. Individually the children may not be, but that is the principle of it.
W.B-s. The same as with Ittai, they passed over, he and his little ones, (@2 Samuel 15:22).
J.S-t. Would the ten virgins not illustrate what we have been talking about, the negative and positive? I suppose baptism puts you in the position,
{282}
but it is that you may receive the Spirit. The five foolish were in the position but they had not the condition suited to it. The five wise had the Spirit.
J.T. Yes, it is only by the Spirit that one can maintain one's self in the light of baptism; because it is by the Spirit we "put to death the deeds of the body". (@Romans 8:13). We need the power of the Holy Spirit to maintain a walk in keeping with our baptism, so it says that you may "walk in newness of life", (@Romans 6:4) and that can only be by the Spirit.
W.L.P. Is the fire the judgment of the flesh?
J.T. It was seen at Pentecost. The Holy Spirit, whilst it brings in the blessedness of what God is in the soul, is not going to honour the flesh. That is the point in the fire I think.
E.H.T. The Lord comes to John's baptism. Why?
J.T. "To fulfil all righteousness". The passage states, "Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him; but John urgently forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptised of thee; and comest thou to me? But Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". This is the King; He fulfils *all* righteousness.
S.T. Baptism would prepare subjects for the King.
J.T. Quite, and He was coming in with them. In the temple spoken of in Ezekiel, the prince, under certain circumstances, comes in with the people and goes out with them. In other circumstances He comes in by himself. Now this is an indication that the Lord, personally, comes in with the people. He takes His place with them, and in taking His place it is a question of righteousness. He says, in effect, It is not simply that it becometh Me to fulfil all righteousness, "it becomes *us* to fulfil all righteousness". He is graciously identified with John, and indeed with all the righteous ones.
{283}
W.C.R. No need of disassociation with Him, but of association; identification, as you said.
J.T. He was identifying Himself with them, as they were in the path of righteousness, showing He would have part in that.
C.A.M. So He identified Himself with Israel in Egypt, as we saw previously, here, in the wilderness.
J.T. In chapter 2, it is God tracing the way. He goes down into Egypt; is called out of Egypt, as they had been; but now they are moving themselves. They are being affected by the testimony. Hence now it is a question of righteousness, and it is not simply the King acting in righteousness, but "it becometh *us* to fulfil all righteousness".
W.C.R. The movement baptism produces?
J.T. The movement John's preaching produced. The light of the testimony here was presented by John, and there is a movement, and the King is in it. He is identified with His people.
B.T.F. Would you say it is the King personally we have here, not officially?
J.T. What He is personally. The Antichrist will not do anything like this, he comes in his own name, he exalts himself and tramples others under foot but God's King personally identifies Himself with the repentant people. It is a very touching scene. "It becometh us", the Lord says, "to fulfil all righteousness". I would call attention to that word *all*; it is His mind that every item of righteousness has to be fulfilled. In chapter 5:13, we are told that He comes from Galilee. When we saw Him there last He was to be called a Nazaraean. That is where He had been all the time apparently. You can see the whole countryside moving to John, and here is a Man coming from Galilee. Jerusalem and Judaea had already come, but here is a Man coming from Galilee, where He had been in reproach, and humility, and obscurity, but He finds His way to
{284}
join the movement; not indeed because there was anything personally in Him requiring it, but it was righteousness. It was a movement towards God and He is to be in it. "Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him". The Spirit records all that: where He came from, where He came to, to whom He came, and what He came for.
Now the Lord is graciously pleased to give place to John. He goes to John. Think of the grace that is in that, the humility of the Lord! Although King, He goes with all the countryside to the Jordan to be baptised. It was wonderful grace; and then, through John's remonstrance, the truth comes out. John says, "I have need to be baptised of thee", but the Lord says, "Suffer it to be so *now*; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". It was to link John on with Himself in the ministry, and what a wonderful vista of service must have opened up to him! It is a very affecting picture; and so the truth comes out; the Man who loved righteousness appears, and then heaven intervenes. It says, "Jesus, having been baptised, went up straightway from the water, and lo; the heavens were opened to him". It is to *him* they are opened, to the Man who is able in His grace and greatness to take the low place with all the others when there is a movement, and He is recognised in heaven. Heaven is opened to Him, and the word is, "He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him: and behold, a voice out of the heaven saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". Notice, the heavens opened to Him, and he saw, but the voice is to others. It is not, *Thou* art my beloved Son, but "*This* is my beloved Son". God is honouring Him in the ears of the public.
W.B-s. So this chapter is really taken up with John's service, whereas chapter 4 begins with the Lord Himself.
{285}
J.T. The Lord is introduced to us directly in chapter 4, in His own service.
W.B-s. I was thinking what a moment this must have been after four hundred years of silence since Malachi.
J.T. What must it have been to heaven!
S.T. The chapter brings in the light of heaven.
J.T. It is now not simply a star moving as a guide, but the heavens opened to Christ.
E.H.T. Would you say that all the Deity is in activity in connection with this movement? It is a movement of righteousness.
J.T. Yes. The voice is the Father's; the Son is seen, and the Holy Spirit; so we have revelation. God is revealed here.
A.A.T. Immediately afterwards Jesus is carried into the wilderness. Is there something in that?
J.T. In @Matthew 4, He is "*carried* up into the wilderness"; in @Mark 1 He is *driven* into it; in @Luke 4 He is *led* in it; all pointing to the fact that He did not go voluntarily into it. No Christian should take up evil voluntarily; nor attempt to handle it. If God leads you into it He will sustain you in it, and so we have a Pattern here, I think, in Christ. He was *carried* into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
W.B-s. So in the prayer we get, "Deliver us *from* evil".
J.T. Yes, quite. There are very few brothers capable of taking up evil things and dealing with them.
W.C.R. It is defiling.
A.A.T. Naturally, I suppose, we would go into the wilderness without having to be urged to go. We would slip right into it.
W.L.P. "Lead us not into temptation", is in this connection.
J.T. Yes. You look to God that He should not
{286}
lead you into temptation: you are so *much* afraid of yourself.
W.L.P. You want Him to preserve you from it.
A.A.T. He may lead you into it for discipline.
J.T. He moved David to number the people. That was a serious matter.
A.A.T. Do you mean to say that God would put a man in the way of being tempted?
J.T. We are told that He "moved David", but in Chronicles, that Satan "provoked David" to number the people. The word says *Satan* did it, but God was behind Satan doing it. Compare @2 Samuel 24:1, and @1 Chronicles 21:1. If David had prayed and been dependent on God he would not have been allowed to number the people.
W.C.R. Job was another case.
J.T. It is a very remarkable case. I was going to speak about Job in connection with the first quotation here. You will notice it is in connection with a man's circumstances, the needs of his body. The more a man has in this world, the more conspicuous he is, the greater the area on which Satan can act.
W.B-t. That comes out remarkably in the difference in the way Satan affected Job and Peter. The Lord says, "Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat", (@Luke 22:31). But he deals with the two men very differently. Peter seems to have nothing he can take away, while Job had so much he could take away.
J.T. Yes, Satan had a wide field to work on in Job's case.
C.A.M. Apart from the fact that he has a wide field with some, the Lord was without earthly possessions and yet the test of circumstances came. So the test of circumstances is a thing that affects every Christian.
J.T. Yes, it does, but the more you have of this world's goods the greater opportunity the enemy has,
{287}
and the more God can act on you, too, to humble you. Job had seven sons and three daughters, and he had a large number of sheep and oxen and camels; he was greater than all the men of the East. Satan says, in effect, to the Lord; You have hedged him in, not only personally, but all he has you are watching over. This was true, and it is very comforting that we can invoke God's blessing on our belongings; but if God is pleased to discipline us, every one of those things affords an opportunity for Him to do so. God says to Satan, "All that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand". (@Job 1:12) The Lord here had no earthly belongings, but Job had, as I said, vast wealth, and the record of Satan's attack on Job begins with the fact that his sons and daughters were having a feast in their *elder* brother's house. The passage begins with that, showing, that in these circumstances of Job's *nature* ruled. Faith did not rule. Things were on the principle of nature. The eldest son had the place of honour, and hence the Sabeans come and they take away the oxen and asses, and slay his servants. Fire of God comes down from heaven and it does something; and the Chaldeans come; all showing the wide area Satan has to act on if God permits it. If a man has means Satan can employ the Sabeans, the fire, the Chaldeans, and the wind. The wind comes last of all and it smites the four corners of the house where nature ruled, and the children are destroyed. So Job affords us a solemn lesson as to the seriousness of earthly possessions if they are not held with God; and even if held with God, if God is pleased to discipline me He can do it that way. He can lift the hedge and let Satan attack me. Job is bereft of his children and his goods. Satan returns and God allows him to touch Job's body, but he must save his life. The Lord's position here corresponds in measure, for Satan attacks Him first
{288}
through His bodily needs. But His perfection shines. He needed food, but He would not move a finger to get food if He did not have the word of God for it. It is a wonderful picture. It brings out the perfection of dependence in a man. As He says, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth".
C.A.M. It does seem, as you say, very solemn, because ordinarily, you would say, It is perfectly legitimate to make provision for food, and then you acquire all these things possibly. Therefore the moral greatness of this emphasises itself.
J.T. It does. "Every word which goes out through God's mouth". It is not a special word, but *every* word which goes out through God's mouth. That is man's food.
S.T. To meet any situation?
J.T. Yes. I remember a statement of Mr. Darby's, that he had come to the point that if material things passed away he could rest on the word of God. That is the point to come to.
B.T.F. The Lord never went out of the appointed path of dependence and righteousness.
J.T. He would not move to alter His circumstances; but see what He brings in as a principle, that man is not to live by bread only, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth.
W.C.R. I have a family and have to care for them, for instance, and it is legitimate and right that they be cared for.
J.T. I think that brings up a very important line; that is, piety. If a man does not provide for his own he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel, so the apostle's doctrine is that we are to work with our hands the thing that is good, to provide things honest before God and man. That is quite in keeping with this.
W.B-t. The Scripture says, "Yet have I not
{289}
seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread". (@Psalm 37:25). It would be a very great exercise if a man found himself and family without bread.
Rem. It goes further, "that he may have to give to him that needeth". (@Ephesians 4:28).
J.T. Quite. The man came to the Lord and said, "Speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me". (@Luke 12:13). The Lord speaks from that point, and he says that a man's life is not in his possessions. He may take an inventory, but he cannot include his life in that. That is not in the assets, and he goes on to show that a man may have such abundance that he has to pull down his barns and build greater, and say, "Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry". The Lord's word is, "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be?" (verses 19,20) That shows the position, and then the Lord goes on to show that we ought to be dependent on God in regard to this matter. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you"; (@Matthew 6:33) that is, all that you need. If God is pleased to add more, it is a question of God adding, and that places you under responsibility as to what you do with it.
W.C.R. Stewardship comes in.
J.T. Yes, we must not be on the line of socialism. The Scriptures are wonderfully balanced, and so the apostle says on this very point, "Charge them that are rich". He does not say, Tell them to destroy their means, but "that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute", (@1 Timothy 6:17,18). You have the means, but he says, do not trust in them, but lay hold of that which is *really life*. That is the thing.
C.A.M. The forty days here would correspond with the forty years of Israel's history in the wilderness.
{290}
J.T. It is Deuteronomy ground, and the Lord enters on it.
D.R. I suppose that the brazen serpent had been lifted up already, and the Holy Spirit had been given to the people, typically. The Lord comes in on that ground.
C.A.M. So what we get here is the *end* of the pathway in the wilderness. That only is touched on.
J.T. That is what is touched on. It is a Man in the wilderness in the power of the Spirit.
W.C.R. There is a word in @1 Corinthians 10:13: "No temptation has taken you but such as is according to man's nature; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear, but will with the temptation make the issue also". It is not that you escape the thing, but He makes an issue. You get gain out of it if you see that the thing through which you are passing is for your good. That is the issue.
W.B-t. The limitation of forty days helps, and the angels ministering to the Lord.
J.T. And so I think the same thing is seen in the address to Smyrna, "Ye shall have tribulation ten days". (@Revelation 2:10). The time is limited.
B.T.F. I was thinking in closing, you might say a word or two as to the King.
J.T. I think what we had in chapter 3 is very plain as to what marked the King. He came down to the circumstances of the remnant, and at that point He is recognised by heaven; and then in chapter 4 He is carried into the wilderness so that it may be shown that He is capable of contending with the enemy. He is single-handed. That is what comes to light.
B.T.F. And the saints would come under the same testing here as is delineated in chapter 4?
J.T. Yes.
{291}
THE KING IN HIS BEAUTY (3)
@Matthew 4; 5:1 - 12
W.B-s. In the third temptation here in @Matthew 4 we get the "high mountain"; in the third temptation in @Luke 4:9, we get the "pinnacle of the temple". Why the difference?
J.T. The religious side comes second in this gospel; the "holy city" and the "temple" point to what is religious. The "high mountain" and the "kingdoms of the world" refer to earthly, political glory. Probably Matthew has Israel's history in view; Luke that of the Gentile nations.
E.H.T. The devil gets three designations here: "the *tempter*", "the *devil*", and "*Satan*".
J.T. The identification of the devil is a feature of Scripture. In the book of Revelation you get all his titles put together, so that his whole history should be identified. The devil sinned from the beginning and his identity is maintained. It is the same one from the outset.
W.C.R. There can be no doubt as to who he is.
J.T. It is important to be able to discern his workings and to recognise him. As the Lord said to Peter, "Get thee behind me, *Satan*". (@Matthew 16:23). He discerned that it was Satan. Although Peter was ostensibly governed by kindly feelings towards the Lord, the Lord quickly discerned what was actuating him.
W.L.P. Do these three temptations signify that Satan was absolutely conquered by the Lord, because he leaves Him?
J.T. Yes, and the titles employed would show he had exhausted all his ammunition. Satan is the *adversary*, the great adversary of God, and being defeated he leaves Christ. It is the tempter, the devil, and then Satan.
W.B-s. In this gospel, it says, he leaves Him,
{292}
and stops there. In Luke, it says, he leaves Him "for a time". I suppose he appears again in the garden in Luke?
J.T. Yes, Luke has that in view, that he would come back in another way.
W.L.P. Would that be a temptation?
J.T. At Gethsemane? Yes. The Lord had said to them, "Pray that ye enter not into temptation". (@Luke 22:40). It was a temptation of an extreme kind. The enemy was bringing to bear on the Lord the power of death in order to divert Him from the path of obedience.
B.T.F. Do you think this answers to the secret trial of David through the lion and the bear, in the wilderness?
J.T. To some extent, I should say, yes. That was a test to him.
A.A.T. There is a Scripture, "Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations". (@Luke 22:28). Has that any connection with what is before us?
J.T. No, there was no one with Him here. That would refer to what they had gone through with Him after they became His companions, but He has no one here. The Lord begins to gather disciples after this, as we see in the next part of the chapter.
A.A.T. What is the setting of this temptation? There must have been a reason why after the baptism He went right into the wilderness and was tempted.
J.T. It is to bring out the beauty and moral integrity of the King here, I think, what He is as left alone with Satan. What would you do if you were left alone with Satan? What would I do? But if we look at this scripture we see what Christ did. We see the triumph of a Man who had to contend single-handed with Satan.
W.C.R. The kingdom is in view, and the Lord is to give character to it. He is here binding the strong man and is about to spoil his goods.
E.H.T. Do we not get the full solution of both
{293}
good and evil set forth here: in what the Lord sets forth of good and what Satan sets forth of evil J.T. In a way. He is single-handed with Satan. As it says, "Jesus was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil". It was designed. It is not an accident in His path, it is designed so as to bring out what was there. *Afterwards* He hungered, and it is then the enemy brings forward this great test as to the necessities of His body. The more you study it the more wonderful it is, that in that state of hunger, which was real and not feigned, for His humanity was as real as ours, the enemy, knowing well what that meant for man, Jesus stands out and refuses to minister to Himself *because there was no word for it*.. Hence he says, "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth". That is what a Man says who is hungry after forty days fasting. We must not suppose that it is any miracle here; it is a real Man who needed food, as we do.
D.R. Would the Lord's answers not emphasise the necessity of reading, so that in the event of any temptation coming our way we should be able to say what is written and stand on that?
J.T. Having the word, that is it. I am afraid there is great want among the saints of God from lack of reading, private reading, family reading, and collective or public reading.
A.A.T. It is not only reading, but it seems the Lord knew how to apply the Scripture in the right way. He had the Scripture that governed the position in each instance, which is a very important way of applying Scripture.
J.T. Philip says to the eunuch, "Understandest thou what thou readest"? (@Acts 8:30). It is not merely the routine of reading, but the understanding that we need.
W.C.R. The Lord had "the sword of the Spirit". (@Ephesians 6:17)
{294}
If we are to meet the enemy in conflict we must have the sword of the Spirit too and know how to use it. Is that your thought?
J.T. Yes. The passage corresponds very much with David's position in the valley of Elah. "He took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand", (@1 Samuel 17: 40). He *chose* them, that is what a Christian should do. We see it here in perfection in Christ. He selected His scriptures from Deuteronomy, showing His perfect knowledge of the arsenal, the armoury and the weapons that were there. He knew where they were and what was suited to this crisis. He says: "It is written".-- "It is written" -- "It is written again". He could bring forward the suited scripture in each case.
W.B-s. I think this point of reading is a very important one. @Proverbs 22: 17,18, reads, "Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips". This involves reading, meditation on the word, and the time would come when they would be fitted together in the lips. The Spirit of God would bring them forward at a time they were needed.
J.T. And then, too, to know how to use the Scriptures in a comely way, as fitting your own experience. One is to think soberly so as to be wise, as God has dealt to each a measure of faith. One has to know one's measure; and I think David's sling would be like his measure, and the choice of stones would be in relation to that, and hence the effectiveness of his service. He could not wear Saul's armour; he had not proved it.
B.T.F. Would you say a word in regard to not only knowing Scripture but *comparing* Scripture?
{295}
J.T. It is very important to compare one Scripture with another, and especially the types, as affording details which the New Testament does not afford. Some may assume there is no need now of reading the Old, because we have everything in the New, but that is an entire mistake. We have the truth of Christ unfolded in the New, His path, His death, His resurrection, His glorification, and the coming of the Holy Spirit, but there are details that cover all this in the Old Testament which are not in the New, and these details help out immensely in our warfare, and in our ministry, and for our souls enjoyment. Mark you! the food here is *every word* that proceedeth through God's mouth, and that includes the Old Testament.
D.R. The Lord uses the Old Testament, as we see here.
W.B-t. How often one sits down to read and does not understand, and finally lays the book down. I think there is many a one here who has gone through that experience, and I was thinking of that scripture in @Matthew 9:24, where the Lord said in the ruler's house: "Give place; for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth". Give place! Is not that important in connection with reading and understanding? We have to give place in our hearts to the Lord. It will not do to take up light reading and lay it down and then think we can take up the Scriptures and understand them. We must give place to the Lord. Would you go with that?
W.C.R. It says, "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them", (@Isaiah 8:20).
W.B-s. So it is not the literal word merely; it is God speaking to you.
J.T. Yes, so wisdom is the principal thing. We are encouraged to get wisdom, but "with all thy getting get understanding". (@Proverbs 4:7)
{296}
C.A.M. You feel in connection with reading that you are very dependent on the Spirit, because we do not go on spiritually if the Spirit is grieved.
A.A.T. There is a good deal of reading that goes on outside of Scripture; I mean the reading of writings by brethren. I would like to have a word on that. It certainly has its place, has it not?
J.T. Reading is the next mode of communication to speaking. God has employed both modes and it is right that we should employ them. If we cannot speak, we can write. As I was remarking last night, the scribe is a very important officer in the divine economy; one who can write. It is a question, of course, of what he writes, but if spoken ministry is effective there is no reason why written ministry should not be effective proportionately, and it should not be ignored. It is a mistake to ignore it. Anyone that despises it is despising, in principle, a method or means that God has employed Himself.
W.B-s. Peter and John both spoke of what they had written.
W.L.P. If it is necessary for one speaking to speak as the oracles of God; it is also necessary, if writing, to write as the oracles of God.
J .T. Quite. Now, coming to these temptations, I am glad that we were able to speak about this because it is of value for us to know how to use Scripture. It is like an armoury, that the man of war may go to for his weapons. Now the Lord says of Himself that in contending with this strong man He took away his armour in which *he* trusted. The enemy did not reckon on that, that the Lord would even deprive him of his armour: not only of his weapons but of his armour.
A.A.T. To what does that refer?
J.T. Well, whatever it was Satan trusted in, and had used effectively in contending against God heretofore, he is now deprived of.
{297}
W.B-t. It says in @Job 41:15,16: "His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. One is so near to another, that no air can come between them".
C.A.M. Is it not remarkable that the devil uses Scripture? When a spiritual man uses Scripture words take on an entirely different force, do they not?
J.T. Yes, and he quotes it accurately and in its connection; whereas the devil does not. It says, "He shall give his angels charge concerning thee; and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone". Well, that was not accurate, for @Psalm 91:11 says, "keeping thee *in all thy ways*".
E.H.T. In using Scripture, as indicated by what you have said of the five smooth stones, you read it with exercise and, if not read that way, you will not get it very accurately.
J.T. Yes, one would be concerned about using Scripture aright. The Lord carefully selects these scriptures. They are not used haphazardly; so when He is about to preach the gospel and stand up in the synagogue of Nazareth, He *finds* the scripture. He turns, so to speak, to the chapter and verse. He knew it was there.
Rem. He chose a stone out of the brook.
J.T. It was the Scripture governing that position. Isaiah, I suppose, is the most evangelical of all the prophets, as Deuteronomy is the storehouse for the wilderness that is, the wilderness for those who have the Spirit. When presenting the gospel the Lord selects a Scripture from Isaiah.
A.A.T. And He quotes so much and no more.
J.T. Quite. But this religious test, you know, is a very severe one, especially when one is on a pinnacle of the temple, for that is what we get here. "The devil takes him to the holy city, and sets him upon
{298}
the edge of the temple, and says to him, If thou be Son of God cast thyself down".
E.H.T. I suppose you have in mind that the severe test was the prominence of the place, as much as to say to the Lord, If you make a display of yourself the whole world will follow you.
J.T. Yes, and you do not want anybody to rule you religiously. In that realm, the realm of "the holy city" and "the temple", *God* determines everything. It is quite obvious that it is not Satan's sphere. God will give a man his place. He will not fail to do that.
Ques. You use the temple here in a moral way?
J.T. The reference is to the religious sphere.
W.B-s. It is presumptuousness on the part of Satan here.
J.T. I think so.
C.A.M. Does Satan hold the religious place at his disposal? Would you go that far?
J.T. Apparently in the world; but here, you see, it is the temple of the holy city, which belonged to God, and one does not want to be led there by anyone. It is a great mistake to patronise anyone in connection with the things of God. You are for yourself, so to speak, in the house of God, and it is a question of what *God* may do with you.
D.R. Then would this answer to spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places?
J.T. Well, it may. It is spoken of as "the holy city" and "the edge of the temple". That is, the general buildings are alluded to in which anyone may be found. It is not necessarily the priestly place.
C.A.M. Referring to what you said as to patrons, it is interesting to notice that Peter, when he speaks to Cornelius, and Cornelius treats him with great reverence, says, "Stand up; I myself also am a man". (@Acts 10:26).
{299}
J.T. Yes. One can leave one's self with God, for if an influential brother promotes you in any way you may get beyond your depth. Peter's attitude was very different from that of his so-called successors at Rome!
B.T.F. It has been spoken of as one being made an object of religious veneration.
J.T. Yes, the Antichrist will occupy a similar place. He will set himself down in the temple of God. Satan wished the Lord to cast Himself down; but the word was, "It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God".
E.H.T. That verifies what you said, it was the sphere *of God*.
Ques. Would that not be taking away his armour?
J.T. It was. What could he do against a Man like that? It is the Lord saying, I could not tempt God by casting *myself* down.
W.L.P. Was this a literal meeting of the Lord and Satan?
J.T. Oh, quite. How it happened in detail that He was led into the holy city and placed on a pinnacle of the temple, I do not know.
C.A.M. I suppose you cannot very well account for the fact that after the death of Christ, as recorded in this gospel, saints came out of their graves and entered into the holy city and appeared to many. You cannot account for that either.
J.T. No, it is just stated. We bow to the statement of the Scriptures. They do not satisfy natural curiosity.
E.H.T. The Lord would not accept a place of prominence, except the place God would give Him and the principle you are trying to emphasise is that you must only take the place that God gives you?
J.T. Yes, quite. There is much you can read between the lines. The Lord did not enter into detailed controversy with Satan; one smooth stone
{300}
is enough. Hence He only refers to the casting down side; but you can see how the enemy would attack any of us by offering us, if we have the ability for it, a position religiously. We must avoid that.
Ques. Do you not think we lose by not seeing that the Lord took fully the place of man?
J.T. Whilst we keep His Deity before us always in thinking of Him, yet we must not forget He was a real Man, and in grace entered into time and material limitations, and acted in them according to the position He had taken. The point in all these scriptures is that *man* is to be subject, man is to be guided and nourished by the words of God.
B.T.F. Would you say the temptations answer to John's description of all that is in the world "the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life"? (@1 John 2:16)
J.T. Yes, they do. Satan, from his long experience with men, knowing what would appeal to a man, brings forward these tests so as to accomplish the fall of the Lord Jesus, and the way the Lord meets him is most admirable. Really one ought to dwell upon it; how, without any controversy, He just cites the scripture that fits, and the enemy is defeated. So that in the end He says, "Thou shalt do homage to the Lord thy God.". In the last temptation the enemy discloses what he is. He says, "All these things will I give thee if, falling down, thou wilt do me homage". We have the full exposure of the enemy now.
A.A.T. It is almost the best scripture we have for the exposure of the enemy. It shows what his motives are.
J.T. Quite.
E.H.T. And it shows what is at the end, a political and religious man.
J.T. Quite. Satan has not given this up. He still has these ideas.
{301}
W.C.R. This will be completed in the first and second beast.
J.T. Just so. It is not that he has any care for them; Satan is seeking that he himself should become an object of veneration, so the *dragon* is to be worshipped.
W.B-s. What is undoing the works of the devil? "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil", (@1 John 3:8).
J.T. I think He binds him here and then He goes about spoiling his goods, but for the complete undoing of Satan's works, Christ had to die.
E.H.T. Is it remarkable that you discover the Lord's object? "Thou shalt do homage to the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve".
J.T. Yes, so the last temptation brings out that Satan is against God. He is Satan, the adversary, and the Lord virtually says in using this term, Now you have exposed yourself; you are not merely opposing me, you are opposing God. That is what often comes out in difficulties among the people of God. It may appear that it is feeling, and it may be, where feeling may exist between two individuals the devil is behind it. He is not thinking of the two individuals. They are nothing to him; he is aiming at God, and the Lord names him aright in this last temptation. It is the adversary, not of man only, but of God.
W.C.R. It says, "Our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies"; (@Ephesians 6:12). As you say, the conflict is not between men. We do not have to battle with men; it is what is behind it all, spiritual wickedness.
W.B-s. The kingdoms of this world do not belong to God at all, do they? They have no
{302}
connection with God. In @Revelation 11:15, "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ"; but that is a different world.
J.T. Yes. The kingdoms referred to here are comprised in the system from Babel, beginning with Nimrod. It is remarkable how the kingdom of God, in its characteristics, is set up to offset the kingdoms of this world. It says, "the beginning of his kingdom was Babel", (@Genesis 10:10) that is, Nimrod's kingdom. The beginning of God's kingdom you might say was in Melchisedec. He was "priest of the most high God" (@Genesis 14:18); but then he was "king of righteousness", and "king of peace". (@Hebrews 7:2). The gospel of Matthew brings to us the real King, the kingdom that is to mark the world of our Lord and His Christ. We have the King here.
Rem. So the question of authority is a great question all the way through.
S.T. It is remarkable that in beginning with man God speaks of the kingdom. "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God". (@John 3:3). There must be a work of God in him to see it.
J.T. Yes. Here it is the King. You are directed to the Psalms in reading these passages, for the Psalms give us the experience and appreciation of godly men in regard of the One that we have had before us. "I speak of the things which I have made touching the King", (@Psalm 45:1). And so in @Psalm 72, the King's Son, referring to Christ, having come on the scene, the prayers of David are ended. You are assured now of the accomplishment of everything, of every thought of God, in this Person. Assurance comes into your heart as you see how He meets the enemy and binds him.
W.B-t. Will you say a little on the eleventh verse?
J.T. The devil leaves Him, and angels come and
{303}
minister to Him. He is the Object of heavenly attention. And then it goes on; "But having heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galilee: and having left Nazareth, he went and dwelt at Capernaum, which is on the seaside in the borders of Zabulon and Nepthalim, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying, Land of Zabulon and land of Nepthalim, way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations; the people sitting in darkness has seen a great light, and to those sitting in the country and shadow of death, to them has light sprung up",, (@Matthew 4:12 - 16).. Now we have the Lord in relation to the darkness of this world and those "sitting in darkness". That is a very remarkable Scripture.
W.B-s. Why does it state these countries here, Zabulon and Nepthalim, indicating they are of Galilee, of the nations?
J.T. It was in proximity to the nations. Matthew makes much of that region because he wanted to show the believing Jews, and all the Jews, when he wrote, that God had rightly slighted Jerusalem; that His testimony was towards the nations in view of the fact that the Jews rejected their King. He was King of the Jews, and the nations responded. Indeed, wise men of the nations had come to find Him, whereas the Jews were asleep in regard to Him.
W.B-s. This is a quotation from @Isaiah 9:6, and there we read, "the government shall be upon his shoulder". The King is seen in that chapter.
J.T. Yes, it is "unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given". That is Israel speaking by faith.
A.A.T. You had something in your mind about "the people sitting in darkness".
J.T. It shows how things stand; they were *sitting* in it. Satan had brought about a state of darkness in the world and a state of death, and men were restful in that. So it says, "The people sitting
{304}
in darkness has seen a great light, and to those sitting in the country and shadow of death, to them has light sprung up". They were sitting in darkness, and sitting in the country and shadow of death.
W.B-t. Why is John the baptist brought in here in verse twelve?
J.T. To show the perfection of the Lord's ministry, that He would not begin to serve until John had finished His service. And now as we proceed, it says, "From that time began Jesus to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh". *From that time*. First we have the Lord *dwelling* in Capernaum; thus He was *light*; His ministry follows that; see verse 17.
S.T. Does He accept His rejection there also, in John being cast into prison?
J.T. I suppose He foresees it, but I think it is rather that it makes room for Him to come forward to minister. But it says, He *dwelt* at Capernaum. It is not yet His ministry exactly; it is, the light that shines through His *dwelling* in the place. "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us". The light shone in the simplicity of His blessed life.
B.T.F. Does the preaching commence at a different point here in a moral way from Luke's gospel?
J.T. Oh, yes. First he was dwelling here. He dwelt at Capernaum, it says, and then we are told where it was. "Which is on the sea-side in the borders of Zabulon and Nepthalim, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias". I think His dwelling there involved that a great light shone there and fulfilled prophecy; and those there are marked out as people that sit in darkness and in the country and shadow of death. It was a wonderful thing for them; but then He begins to preach. We have not as yet come to His ministry. His ministry begins in the seventeenth verse, "*From that time*".
{305}
W.B-s. He preached the same as John, just the same words He uttered at the first.
J.T. The same words exactly.
E.H.T. I would like to ask about the Lord dwelling at Capernaum. Capernaum was exalted to heaven; Christ dwelling there made it tremendously responsible. I suppose responsibility comes in in connection with privilege, and things do not happen accidentally; the Lord selects the place and He selects our localities.
J.T. He gives you your local position, but the danger is of making too much of your locality. Brethren are often too parochial; we have our parishes, and so on. Responsibility is right to a point; but the house of God is the great thought for the believer and the principle of the house of God is universality.
E.H.T. A house of prayer for all nations.
J.T. Yes, and if you have any light, according to the next chapter, it is not for your locality especially, it is for the house. You put it on a candlestick, that it may give light *unto all that are in the house*. That is to say, gift is not for a locality. You may be a deacon in a locality, or an elder, but a spiritual gift is not for a special locality. Hence, it says of the Lord, in @Luke 4:31, speaking of this very town, Capernaum, that He "descended to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbaths. And they were astonished at his doctrine". Then He enters into the synagogue, and it says in verse 42, "And when it was day he went out, and went into a desert place, and the crowds sought after him, and came up to him, and would have kept him back that he should not go from them". That is, they would keep Him in that locality, but He says, "I must needs announce the glad tidings of the kingdom of God to *the other* cities also". Not simply "other cities", but "*the* other cities"; *all* the cities must
{306}
be enlightened. Now that is the principle of gift. @Zechariah 6:12 says of "the man whose name is the Branch", that "he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple". That is one side of the Lord's position. Then when He began His ministry He went to Nazareth, where He was brought up, and they say, "Whatsoever we have heard has taken place in Capernaum do here also in thine own country". They would take advantage of Christ to add to their city and their locality, but the Lord brings in the prophet, quoting from the Old Testament to prove that God would not benefit any locality when He was acting from Himself. He sent Elijah to the widow of Sarepta; and Elisha healed Naaman the Syrian, showing that when God is acting from Himself in grace, as He is in the gospel of Luke, He will not be limited to any locality. If you have gift, it is not for any locality, it is for all. It is set in the house. I am obligated to brethren *everywhere* in regard to any gift I may have from the Lord.
W.B-t. I think that is very helpful.
J.T. If it is not observed we become parochial, and if we have a gift in our parish, we think our parish is to that extent dignified, and we begin to get metropolitan and expect to influence other districts; whereas if you recognise gift in its relation to the whole house it does not add to you any more than to me. It is in regard to the house.
A.A.T. If a brother has a gift and wishes to exercise it generally, is there not a question raised in connection with fellowship with that gift? I mean a brother might go out and not have the fellowship of his brethren.
J.T. You get instruction in regard of that in the Acts. Barnabas and Saul had lived a whole year at Antioch before the Holy Spirit calls upon the saints to commit themselves to these two gifts; so one has to be in the confidence of the saints. How can
{307}
you gain that unless you live with them? They went in and out amongst them for a whole year.
A.A.T. Then it is a right principle that those "out in the work" should be commended by their local brethren?.
J.T. Yes; those among whom they have grown up. Barnabas and Saul made a circuit and they *fulfilled* the work, it says. (@Acts 14:26). They finished it before they came back, and they *came back to Antioch*. So I think we have in that chapter in Acts a pattern for levitical work; it goes out from the assembly.
E.H.T. You are speaking now of individuals who have places in the economy of God for special things; you might say specific things. What about a local meeting? Is one to serve locally, having in view the benefits of the house of God?
J.T. Surely, what you do is in the light of the assembly.
C.A.M. You drew a distinction between an office and a gift. You might hold an office and not necessarily have a gift?
J.T. Scripture speaks of an elder labouring in the word and doctrine, saying that he is thus to be honoured all the more, but it is not necessary that he should have a gift.
W.L.P. An assembly then can get along without a gift?
J.T. All the gifts in the assembly are ours. As the apostle says to the Corinthians, "whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas ... all are yours". (@1 Corinthians 3:22). I understand that is how they stand, they belong to the whole assembly. "God has set certain *in the assembly*"; that does not mean the local assembly at Corinth, because there were no apostles set there. The word says, "first apostles, second prophets". (@1 Corinthians 12:28). It is the whole assembly.
{308}
C.A.M. Mr. Stoney has said, 'You do not need gift, but elders'.
J.T. Elders are needed; and I would like to have a word about the necessity among us of the principle of oversight.
A.A.T. Both Philip and Stephen were deacons, or had offices at the beginning, but they developed gift.
J.T. They purchased to themselves good degrees and much boldness in the faith. Caring for the saints is open to any young brother or sister. A sister may be a deaconess; may exercise the service of providing for the needs of the saints.
W.C.R. Phoebe was a servant of the assembly at Cenchrea.
W.C.R. How would it work out with a sister to be a deaconess?
J.T. Visiting, caring for the bodily needs of the saints. You will notice in @1 Timothy 3, that *women* were to serve in this way; their qualifications are given.
W.C.R. You get Priscilla coming out beautifully in that way; "who for my life staked their own neck"; Paul says, showing how they served him, and no doubt others, (@Romans 16:4).
E.H.T. Several women in that chapter qualified, beginning with Phoebe.
J.T. To come to the latter part of @Matthew 4, I want to call attention to the Lord walking by the sea of Galilee. It says in verse eighteen that He saw two brothers. I wish to call attention to the way the Lord gathers according to Matthew. It says: "And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers". He calls two pairs of brothers. He saw two brothers, "Simon called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers and he says to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men". They were brothers and they
{309}
were acting as brothers; they were acting together, doing the same thing, and so the Lord says, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men". We have been saying that in baptism we place ourselves under a grave responsibility to Christ; but if the Lord is to make anything out of any one of us, or any two of us, as in this instance, we must come after Him. "Come after *me*, and *I* will make you".
A.A.T. Are you emphasising the coming after or the brothers?
J.T. Both. So far they were acting in family relationship; there was evidently in that household a recognition of the family institution. They were brothers and acting together, and the Lord recognises that. And then they were not idle, they were casting a net into the sea.
S.T. Does that agree with chapter 18:19, "If two of you shall agree"?
J.T. To some extent. I think the Lord honours family relationships where they are recognised.
W.C. You are speaking now about natural relationships?
J.T. Yes, a divine institution.
C.A.M. Then you were emphasising the idea of leadership. The Lord is before us as a leader.
J.T. They were casting a net into the sea when He saw them. He says, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men". If the Lord is to make anything of me, I must come after Him.
E.H.T. Peter and Andrew dropped all and followed Him.
J.T. They were so far right. The Lord recognises what was there. They were brothers and they were acting together, and they were employed in legitimate, profitable work, and He calls them to come after Him. And then it says, "And going on thence he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their
{310}
father". You see this is a greater thing in a way, that the two brothers should be "*with their father*".
A.A.T. And they were mending their nets.
J.T. They were occupied well, *mending* things, showing that they were men of concern. They were not wasters. I am speaking now for the young people, because it is a great point with God that young people should recognise family relationships. The two brothers are with their father in the ship, and they are not wasting time; they are mending nets.
A.A.T. I have heard it said that the way these brothers are mentioned in Scripture for the first time gives an insight into their ministry afterwards. The first two were fishers of men, and the last two menders of nets, and able to preserve the fishes caught.
E.H.T. What is it significant of that they are with their father?
J.T. The family bond existed. They were working *with their father*. Instead of a young man going off to the city, or to some other place to have his fling, as is common today, and family relationships disregarded, this passage shows how the Lord honoured the recognition of them.
W.C.R. You get the same thing with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob; they dwelt together.
J.T. Yes. He dwelt in tents with them. What I wanted to call attention to, in regard of this second set, is that it says, "he *called* them"; and He does not say He is going to make them anything. These are James and John, the second two, and it is only recorded that the Lord *called* them; and it says, "and they, having left the ship and their father, immediately followed him". The Lord holds out nothing in the way of inducement in His call to James and John. He does not say He is going to make anything out of them. It is a *call*. I suppose it is intended to suggest the general position of the saints. We are simply called. We cannot assume
{311}
to be something official, but we are "called saints". (@1 Corinthians 1:2).
Ques. Why did He not call the father?
J.T. That is a question of the Lord's sovereignty. He selects whom He calls. In view of the verses read in chapter 5, I just want to call attention to the fact that all we have read, and the miracles that follow, bring in a crowd. You will notice it says, "And great crowds followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan". Now in many people is the strength of the King, but these people must be regulated. So it says, "Seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth, he taught them". We have not time to dwell on it; but I think this section is the King legislating. Things must not be on the principle of a crowd, because a crowd is not co-ordinated, each one is independent of the other; whereas, the Lord would take them and form a kingdom, and give a law to that kingdom by which it should be governed.
C.A.M. This is really the way things are administered in the kingdom of the heavens.
J.T. Yes. He sat down and taught His disciples, and what is to be especially noticed is that it is for *blessing* first. It is, "Blessed", "Blessed", "Blessed". What a kingdom this is going to be!
B.T.F. Does this fulfil @Isaiah 8:16? "Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples".
J.T. Quite, it is the disciples.
D.R. Would you say, in principle, that this was the Lord forming an assembly. He gathers the material first, and then forms the assembly by having the disciples around Him.
J.T. In the principle of it. Here it is giving law, it is legislation. In @Deuteronomy 33 the law is said to be the heritage of the people, and so these three chapters, @Matthew 5, 6 and 7, form a wonderful
{312}
heritage for the people of God. It is called a "fiery law" in @Deuteronomy 33, but this is not a fiery law. It is an immense asset to any country to have a good code of laws.
C.A.M. I suppose we have here the principles by which the kingdom is to be governed.
J.T. Quite.
W.B-s. It is like Joseph teaching his senators wisdom.
J.T. That passage in Deuteronomy is worth looking at, at this point, because it shows the moral value of the law. Chapter 33, verse 2, reads, "The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them. Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words. Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together". It is very like this passage. It is what the disciples were, in relation to the King, and the law that He gave them.
C.A.M. They will thus be fitted to rule by-and-by, in the day of display.

THE KING IN HIS BEAUTY (4)
@Matthew 8; 10:1 - 6
C.A.M. What was in your mind, in a general way, in connection with these chapters in Matthew?
J.T. To call attention to the *King* and the *princes*; that we might see Him as the remnant speak of Him in the Psalms, and as Isaiah speaks of Him; "the King in his beauty". (@Isaiah 33:17). Indeed, the Psalms should be read with this section because it presents the King to Israel, and brings out the remnant. The disciples here have to be viewed in relation to Israel; but in the next section in relation to the assembly. So you will observe here they are enjoined to go only "to the lost sheep of the house of Israel", whereas at the end of the next section, the last chapter, they are sent to make disciples of "all nations". (@Matthew 28:19). So this section is the King presented to Israel, and if we read the Psalms in connection with it our hearts will be brought into unison with the exercise of the remnant in regard of the King. There is the statement; "I speak of the things which I have made touching the King". (@Psalm 45:1) We have covered, in a way, the first four chapters; but the next three, unfold the law of the kingdom, not exactly the law of the kingdom as it is established in relation to the assembly, but the law as it shall be in the millennium, and a law that is to be known beforehand by the remnant. They become thus a witness to the kingdom as having the law of it, and knowing Him who fulfilled the law, before the public establishment of the kingdom. These are points of the last moment in regard to a position of witness, before the public establishment of that to which you witness. The book of Revelation, of course, fits in because it shows the remnant with the Lamb on mount Zion, a hundred and forty-thousand, as there viewed administratively.
{314}
They follow the Lamb wheresoever He goes, and that is what these chapters unfold. They show the principle of following the Messiah; and, then, the authority vested in the twelve, not in regard of the assembly, but as preliminary to the setting up of the kingdom. You have, therefore, in this section the law of the kingdom and those who are commissioned to exercise the authority of Christ in His absence, covering the three and a half years prior to the establishment of the kingdom after the assembly is removed. There are to be witnesses of Christ. Indeed this ministry indicated in chapter 10 is to be resumed; see chapter 10:23.
C.A.M. So that the witnesses by-and-by will connect intimately with the companions of Christ in His pathway here.
J.T. Yes, they are the continuation of this section. What follows in this gospel is parenthetical; that is, it is assembly history. This is not assembly history, but it is history of the greatest value to us indeed, it was written for Christians.
D.R. In the light in which you speak of the Lord in this way, would it be right to have in our minds at the present moment what God has said of Him, that He has set His King upon the holy hill of Zion?
J.T. That is what the Psalms begin with. The second Psalm gives us God's purpose, and these chapters present the Messiah to us as He appeared among His people. But the Psalms give us what these chapters do not; namely, the exercise of the remnant in regard of Him, so that we have the beautiful expressions of @Psalm 45; "I speak of the things which I have made touching the king". That is the result, but from @Psalm 2 and on you have witness, especially in @Psalm 20 and @Psalm 21, of the desires of the remnant in regard of the Messiah. In looking at it in that light there is gain for us, because we can come into line with their exercise. And then we
{315}
see the legislation which the Lord has formulated, which is to govern the saints in this period; and then the authority for the enforcement of that law, for without authority to enforce a law the law must become a dead letter. I think the authority is in chapter 10, but the comparison of the Psalms with what we see here will show us that those commissioned were morally equal to the commission, because of their affection for the Messiah.
In the beginning of chapter 5, we read: "Seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: And he opened his mouth, and taught *them*, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit". Now in Luke, in a corresponding passage, He lifts up His eyes upon His disciples and says, "Blessed are ye poor". (@Luke 6:20). They are more immediately before Him in Luke, whereas, while they are before Him here, it is not so much them that are in His mind as the general law, the law in its general application; so it is not *ye* poor, but, *the* poor here, whoever they are.
C.A.M. Could you make that clearer?
J.T. When you specify who they are then you have them personally before you, but when you say, "*the* poor" it is the abstract and applies to *any* poor, so that in Matthew we have more the legislation, which would have *general* application.
A.A.T. Why does He not teach the crowd?
J.T. Because He must first bring the disciples into accord with Himself by teaching; then the crowd will get the benefit through them.
W.B-s. It mentions the crowds being there.
J.T. Yes, but it is as seeing the crowds He went up into a mountain. It seems to me that the Lord, as it were, said that the crowd would not do. It is all well to have a great result from the ministry; but we must have law, we must have teaching, we must have principles, otherwise the crowd would not
{316}
co-ordinate. The idea of a crowd is simply so many individuals, each with his own idea, but that does not comply with God's thoughts.
C.A.M. So the crowd is evidently different from those who follow the Lamb.
J.T. Quite. Those that follow the Lamb are numbered, but the crowds are not numbered. According to Luke, when the Lord fed the crowd He numbered them. He made them sit down by *fifties*.
W.L.P. The crowd is to come into order and blessing through the disciples.
J.T. I think so.
B.T.F. Is your thought to apply this to the present day; that souls, being helped, are brought into the assembly, into the sphere of order and rule?
J.T. That is the thing that we have to come to see. There must be a code of laws, or of principles, in every kingdom.
W.B-s. Now the question is rather the *King* and *princes*, as you were saying, and the crowd might represent democracy if they had power in their hands.
J.T. It comes through the *King* and the *princes*. That is the divine idea. So He takes the disciples up to the mountain, because they were to be the princes, the ones that were to rule, as it says, "in righteousness". "A king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment". (@Isaiah 32:1).
S.T. They must come under His authority, and therefore recognise His authority here.
D.R. Is there not implied in this that the Lord sat there with the disciples around Him to indicate that the heads of Israel had refused him a place? As it says after His death, "had they" [the princes of this world] "known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory". (@1 Corinthians 2:8).
J.T. Yes, the princes of this world were already showing their hatred of Him.
{317}
E.H.T. Is it true that the Lord, ignoring the crowd in a certain aspect here, wishes to bring in His own order, Himself as King, and the disciples as acting, under Him?
J.T. Yes, and for order, in the application of the law, there must be those numbered and known. There is a passage in @Deuteronomy 33:6 which, I think, helps: "Let Reuben live, and not die; And let his men be few". That is, as it says in the margin, that *can be counted easily*. If you have a large congregation, the likelihood is that you do not know them all. Now the idea of Christianity really is not a congregation, but an assembly. To some extent they are interchangeable words; otherwise an assembly involves mutuality. A congregation is so many people, not necessarily known to each other or co-ordinated.
A.A.T. But there is a point when an assembly becomes, so to speak, a congregation, when the number is very large?
J.T. Yes. One idea of the assembly is that we all know one another. In Parliament, for instance, or in Congress, the members are known to one another. It is not an unordered crowd. Each one has a known status there, and there is mutual recognition and contribution.
G.A.T. As we know each other we can bear one another's burdens.
J.T. I think when a company gets so large that the individuals are not known and visitable, we lose the idea of the assembly.
E.H.T. Does not Paul state that? He says, "that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me". (@Romans 1:12).
J.T. That is it "mutual faith". In @Revelation 7, the saints are numbered and sealed. The number suggests administration. Then you have a host "which no man could number", (verse 9) but they are not
{318}
taken up for administration. The hundred and forty-four thousand are a known company, with limitations, and they follow the Lamb wheresoever He goes. Now you get that here.
C.A.M. Administration in that day connects with the life of Christ here.
J.T. Yes, that is the point. We can see the features of the King coming out, and how He associates the remnant with Himself; and then legislates for them, teaches them, and then they become His princes; then they follow the Lamb wheresoever He goes, and the result is that they are seen with Him on mount Zion. Then you get their character, what they are as in entire keeping with the Lamb.
W.C.R. Those who surrounded David in his rejection, became mighty because of association with him. They became what he was.
J.T. That fits in here, and the principles that the Lord unfolds in these three chapters are the principles that are to regulate His followers. And not only so, but they were to teach others what they had learnt; indeed, they had authority to enforce the principles of the kingdom. In a kingdom you have the *legislative* branch and the *administrative* branch. If you have not the administrative branch, the legislation must fall to the ground. These three chapters present to us the legislation; the following chapters bring in the administrative side.
B.T.F. Are there not wonderful moral thoughts in chapter 5, that are very applicable and essential to us now?
J.T. Yes, the fact that this is written by one of the apostles of the assembly indicates that it was written for Christians; that it is for us, but its *primary* application is to Israel; "He came unto his own". (@John 1:11). The King's relation with Israel and the remnant's relation with the King are in view.
{319}
B.T.F. Does the teaching of the Holy Spirit to the assembly at the moment go beyond @Matthew 5; that is, what would be fulfilled in the way of righteousness in the believer, walking in the power of the Spirit, is found in @Matthew 5, is it not?
J.T. To some extent; but you see the section that deals directly with the assembly begins with chapter 11. From chapter 11 onwards it is the kingdom in relation to the assembly, and therefore we have wider principles. Chapter 18 is the law of the kingdom in its relation to the assembly. These chapters present to us the law of the kingdom in its relation to Israel, looking on to the millennium.
W.B-s. In chapters 8 and 9, the Lord Himself is seen ministering in the way of cleansing and healing; and then in chapter 10 He calls "the twelve" and appoints them for that purpose also.
J.T. And the ministry presented in chapter 10 will be resumed after the assembly period. It is well to note that; that there is a regular system provided in view of the assembly's removal, to carry on the testimony of God, and those who serve then shall have this instruction. They will not, I apprehend, take up chapter 18, but I have no doubt they will take up this section, to some extent at any rate; and they will have authority too to represent Christ, pending His own public appearance.
A.A.T. Will there not be one thing lacking? They will lack that contact with the Lord which we see in this chapter, or shall they be in contact with the Lord?
J.T. The book of Revelation I think helps there. They follow the Lamb wheresoever He goes, and they are seen with Him on mount Zion. That does not mean that He is there personally at all. It refers to what is true in the faith of their souls, because it will be a faith period.
{320}
C.A.M. Like the present time. *We* should follow the Lamb without His being personally with us. We have the written word to guide us.
J.T. Only we are seen in relation to the assembly; they are seen on mount Zion.
W.C.R. Will mount Zion have the same meaning it has to us now?
J.T. To us it is a question of God's sovereignty. We are said to have come to it. It is the principle on which we stand; but the hundred and forty-four thousand will have the literal mount Zion in view, because it is a question then of God taking up His rights on the earth. The Revelation has to do with the disposition of the earth. Christian epistles have to do with the assembly's place in heaven. Hence mount Zion in Revelation is a question of God's purpose regarding this earth. The populace celebrate the "God of heaven" (@Revelation 11:13); but the point in Revelation is not that. The point is, that He is the God of the earth, and His purpose in regard of the earth is that mount Zion is to be the centre of rule, and the fact that the hundred and forty-four thousand are with the Lamb there shows that they are divinely instructed. The Lord has instructed them so that they have intelligence. In chapter 7, they are numbered and sealed; but in chapter 14, they are *with* the Lord; they are *following* Him, which shows that they love Him. It is not now their own needs, but the purpose of God that is in their minds, and the description given of them shows they are in every way in keeping with the Lamb; they have learned to sing a new and exclusive song. (@Revelation 14:1 - 5).
E.G.McA. Is there a kindred thought between this mountain to which He goes and mount Zion?
J.T. In Revelation mount Zion represents the sovereign purpose of God. In the gospels, *mountain* is often in contrast with the *plain*, but there is usually the thought of separation and power connected with
{321}
it. This may be called *the mount of legislation*. In chapter 17 we have *the mount of transfiguration*, which is said to be a *high* one.
E.G.McA. I was wondering if it would indicate the character of their witness and administration?
J.T. In this chapter it is rather a place of power and withdrawal from the plain below, the influence below -- "Seeing the crowds". It is I think, withdrawing the disciples from that influence so that they might be unhindered.
W.B-s. In Luke He speaks to them on the plain.
J.T. He goes on to the mountain in Luke to pray, that is what you get there. Then He chooses the apostles, and then comes down *with them to the plain*. That is Luke's way, because it is a question of God coming to man in Luke, not the King exactly. So He descends with the twelve on to the plain, meaning that these twelve, as well as Himself, are for the benefit of men. That is the point in Luke; and so, after He comes to the plain, He lifts up His eyes on the disciples. Here it is not that. It is all on the mount; because He does not come down until the end of chapter 7.
G.A.T. In order to live in power amongst the crowd we have to be on the mountain with Him first.
J.T. Not only that, but to get the benefit of the legislation and teaching. The greatest need among the saints is to come in for the good of the law that governs *our* position. I am not saying that these three chapters govern our position exactly, but the principle is that every position is governed by certain principles and the thing for us is to be instructed in these principles.
B.T.F. You get them in chapter 5.
J.T. Well, there are principles throughout chapter 5 that have an application to ourselves. The Lord begins with, "*Blessed*". What a richness there is in such a beginning as that! Certain ones are
{322}
blessed, and they are not the rich, or those in advantage in this world, but the opposite. And then He indicates the position of the disciples, that they were "the salt of the earth", and they were "the light of the world". That was a great place. What an obligation would rest upon them as the Lord's words fell upon their ears; that they were to be the salt of the earth; that they were to preserve things. There is a great point in that. How much am I preserving for God?
B.T.F. You would apply it now?
J.T. Certainly. It is a question of what am I preserving for God, and what light shines in me. "Ye are the light of the world".
G.A.T. "Blessed are the poor in spirit". What is the meaning of that?
J.T. Well, he is not living in anything that the flesh lives in. Even though he may have the things the flesh lives in, he does not live in them. As regards all that men live in, he is poor *in spirit*.
D.R. Referring to the hundred and forty-four thousand connected with mount Zion, the seat of the Lord's kingly power and authority, they are found following Him as the Lamb there. Does that indicate the harmless character of His administration here?
J.T. Yes, and that He is a sufferer. The idea of suffering goes with the Lamb. The subject of the Lamb begins in @Revelation 5. He is seen in the midst of the throne, but as slain. He suffered and so He opens the seals, because it is a question of the saints. The Lamb has the saints in His heart, and the opening of the seals brings them to light.
C.A.M. It is remarkable that the Lamb is connected with the tribe of Judah; there is a correspondence with this gospel.
A.A.T. There are chapters 8 and 9 to be considered.
J.T. I wanted particularly that we might have the principles that the Lord unfolded for the disciples
{323}
before us. He brings in the law in @Matthew 5:17, which cannot be abrogated. The law of God holds. Not one jot or tittle of it shall fail. The Lord's own authority is next mentioned. "*I* say unto you". That is to enforce His authority; and then He brings in the character of the Father. The Lamb's Father is spoken of in Revelation. The remnant have the mark of the Lamb's Father in their foreheads, and this chapter shows how they are to be like their Father. It will be a very great testimony in those days, when the assembly is gone, that the character of the Father will be presented in the disciples of Christ. They are to have the name of His Father in their foreheads. The others have the mark of the beast.
W.C.R. You mean that they are to be intelligent as to the Father.
J.T. I think so The forehead indicates that, and it is the public confession too. It is what everybody can see.
G.A.T. Do I understand there are going to be men here, after the assembly is gone, like Christ was Himself here?
J.T. Yes, in some way He makes Himself known to them and teaches them. They will not have the Holy Spirit; they will not be a *body*, the truth of the assembly will not be there; but the Lord will teach them and He will become an object of affection for them so that they follow Him.
E.G.McA. In connection with the *King* and the *princes*, is all in contrast to the present administrations in the world? Ofttimes you find administrators with a wide divergence of opinion from the King, but what the Lord is introducing here will set forth exactly every thought of the King.
J.T. I think that is very interesting. In this country and all countries the legislative branch of the government is not always in accord with the administrative
{324}
branch. And so the Lord here is instructing His disciples in the principles that are to govern them in their administration, indeed these are the principles which shall govern the whole world in the future.
W.C.R. And these principles that you get in chapter 5 were to mark the disciples. They were to have the same mind, feelings and sensibilities as the King.
J.T. Yes, and they are to be like their Father. He says, "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who insult you and persecute you, that ye may be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens; for he makes his sun rise on evil and good, and sends rain on just and unjust". Again, "Be ye therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect", (@Matthew 5: 44,45,48). They are like the Father, and that is what government should be. If the sun is made to rise and shine on evil and good, and the rain comes down on the just and unjust, government should be in accord with this.
W.B-s. In the Psalms, the prayers of Israel are somewhat different from this, they pray for the destruction of their enemies; in @Psalm 69, for instance, you get it very prominently. This is "Love your enemies".
J.T. Yes, you do, and these chapters I think would show that the testimony of the remnant, pending the return of the King, shall be tempered by this teaching. Although the souls cry from beneath the altar (@Revelation 6:9), in general, they are in keeping with the character of the Lamb. It is a time of suffering and moral superiority to the opposition. That is what should mark the witnesses, I think, pending His return. The retributive side of the kingdom is not presented here. It will be found in its own place.
{325}
C.A.M. While they will not have the Lamb here personally, they will have this written record of His life, and there will be a connection with the heavenly saints.
J.T. Surely: when you come to chapter 6, you have access to the Father. They are to pray: "Enter into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret". (@Matthew 6:6). That will be open to them, and indeed He gives them the formula so they might know how to pray in those days.
Ques. Is this teaching going on after the assembly is taken away?
J.T. This is teaching that will apply then. The Lord will put Himself in touch with the remnant and teach them along these lines, so that in result they come into an administrative position, and that is seen in @Revelation 14. The hundred and forty-four thousand are with the Lamb on mount Zion, and if you will turn to that chapter you will see the result. You see we get their description. In the fourth verse it says, "These are they who follow the Lamb wheresoever it goes. These have been brought from men as first-fruits to God and to the Lamb: and in their mouths was no lie found; for they are blameless". And then it says: "And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having the everlasting glad tidings to announce to those settled on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come; and do homage to him who has made the heaven and the earth and the sea and fountains of waters". Now, you see, there is the basis of the everlasting gospel. It comes in after you see this administrative company with the Lamb on mount Zion.
C.A.M. You were alluding to their prayers, and is not one beautiful thing about our present position,
{326}
as entering into the good of this, that we will be sympathetic with those prayers by-and-by?
W.C.R. Sympathetic with the suffering remnant, and we learn that priestly service now.
J.T. We shall be in a priestly position; so in the beginning of @Revelation 8, you have an Angel at the golden altar before God, making the prayers of all saints efficacious. Well, you can understand how this chapter would fit in there. If you enter into your closet and pray to God, the Angel, who is the Lord, the great High Priest, at the golden altar will take that up and make it efficacious.
E.G.McA. And is not that sympathetic attitude expressed in the formula? The first thing the Lord says is: "Let thy name be sanctified, let thy kingdom come, let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth". (@Matthew 6:9,10).
J.T. God's name is first you mean?
E.G.McA. Yes, the kingdom coming and God's will carried out on the earth.
J.T. Yes, think of the advantage in that. The remnant shall have access to God on those lines, and the Angel at the golden altar makes all these prayers efficacious; He has the incense.
W.B-s. Would you say Pentecost was a partial fulfilment of what is yet to come? That it was in a way the anticipation of it? Signs and wonders, miracles of healing, were seen at that time, but not to the full as we have in Joel. That is yet to come?
J.T. I think all this precedes the pouring out of the Spirit. The Spirit shall not be poured out during the period of the absence of Christ. It is the introduction of the millennial scene, really. But now in chapter 7, they are taught not to judge another. "Judge not", He says, "that ye may not be judged; for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you. But why lookest thou on the mote that is in
{327}
the eye of thy brother, but observest not the beam that is in thine own eye?" (verses 1 - 3). He brings in the principle of judgment, but it is in regard of one's self, and that helps you with the brethren. Chapter 7 is to show them how they are to be in relation with one another. Chapter 5 is the law, in a general way; chapter 6, prayer or access to God; and chapter 7 sets them in relation with one another. All these things shall go on, for you cannot have disciples here administratively without this instruction. We must know how to be in relation with one another, and we must not be on the line of judging one another.
C.A.M. Think of Matthew in the great position he will have by-and-by, on the throne with others judging the twelve tribes; but, really, the thing starts with himself.
J.T. If you cannot judge and rule yourself you cannot judge and rule others. The point here is to set them in relation to one another, and, to begin with, you must not judge one another.
B.T.F. Supposing there has been actual wrong done and you judge it?
J.T. That comes under the head of administration. This is to set the saints right in relation to one another, not to judge one another. There must be judgment of course. Princes are to rule in judgment; that is collective.
W.C.R. This refers to a censorious spirit that may mark a man.
J.T. That must not be among God's people. That is what the Lord shows here; then He goes on in chapter 7 with these instructions; and then He comes down from the mountain. I am not saying that this is all in these passages. He shows them in His own service how things are to be done in chapters 8 and 9. In chapter 4, His works of power are presented promiscuously and great crowds are the result; but in chapters 8 and 9 you have isolated
{328}
cases, what you might call specific cases, to call attention to the way the King did things; and then in chapter 10, the disciples are formally named apostles, and endued with power, and sent out. *They* are now to do things.
C.A.M. So, by following the order in these two chapters, you learn how the thing was done.
J.T. That is it. They have the law in their hearts, and they have prayer; they have access to the Father, and are right in relation to one another; and now the Lord shows them how He does things; and in chapter 10, the *princes* come in and what they are to do.
G.A.T. If I have myself regulated with the Lord it will be much easier for me to be regulated with my brethren. I find it very much easier to pass judgment on my brother than on myself.
J.T. That is it. The apostle would not justify himself even though he had a good conscience. A good conscience in itself is not a vindication. He says, "For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord. So that do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts", (@1 Corinthians 4:4,5).
G.A.T. Now say a word about a case coming up that *must* be judged.
J.T. Let us be princes! If you get princes you will have right judgment.
W.C.R. I suppose we little realise how mixed our motives are.
J.T. I think that is a remark worthy of note. Even the apostle would not trust his own motives.
W.L.P. What would help us in regard to our motives?
J.T. Being in the presence of God. The word of
{329}
God is said to be "living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart". (@Hebrews 4:12). It is being in the presence of God; so it is the word of God and prayer. The word of God exposes what is in my heart, and enables me to judge of my motives; and prayer is to be in keeping with that.
W.L.P. That is more than knowing the Scripture.
J.T. It is the presence of God Himself, because it says: "All things are naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do". (@(Hebrews 4:13). Therefore it is being in the presence of God.
G.A.T. Does that correspond to the salt of the earth?
J.T. It would. If one is in the presence of God there is no corruption. The salt has not lost its savour.
C.A.M. You do not learn from the letter.
J.T. It is the presence of God known in the soul, and God speaking to you, and you speaking to God.
W.C.R. There may be things not according to God, and in prayer it is discovered to us; and, if we are sensitive, we answer to it.
C.A.M. Were you going to give any general outline of those two chapters before you come to chapter 10?
J.T. I was going to say that the crowds again appear and a leper comes to the Lord. This is an isolated case, a sample case; then the centurion's servant, the paralytic; and what is afterwards unfolded in the chapter is the principle of *following*. When the centurion said, "I also am a man under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes"; the Lord turns to *those that followed*,
{330}
and He says, "Not even in Israel have I found so great faith". The point is that the followers get the light, get His mind.
C.A.M. These correspond with the ones that follow the Lamb. Matthew, himself, was a follower in the next chapter. How well he will understand it by-and-by.
J.T. And then the Lord says, "I say unto you, that many shall come from the rising and setting sun, and shall lie down at table with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens; but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth". The followers got this light also. No doubt it will help those who preach the "everlasting gospel". Later, we have a very important miracle in Peter's house, for evidently there shall be households, as there are now, recognised in the time that is to follow. We have it elsewhere alluded to, the fathers hearts are to be turned to the children. Now, it says, "When Jesus had come to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law laid down and in a fever; and he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose and served him". He put the household right; a very important service.
C.A.M. That is very good. The thing for us is to study what the Lord did, is it not?
J.T. That is the point. If you are to serve you must see what He is doing, and how He does it.
C.A.M. We often upset households, but if we learn from this we become helpers.
J.T. In @1 Timothy 5 Paul speaks about busy-bodies, people who go about into houses and do harm.
C.A.M. Yes, such add to the fever that may exist, instead of curing it.
W.C.R. I thought the Lord did not adjust anything
{331}
here, that He left things as He found them. I do not quite catch the thought about setting the household right.
J.T. The Lord set it right here. It was in a bad state of fever. He does not set the world right yet, but He adjusts the households of believers. If Christian households are not right, the assembly will not be right. The secret of difficulties is very largely in the households of the saints.
G.A.T. If a man cannot rule his own house he cannot rule in the house of God.
J.T. That is what we get in Timothy. But this was a very awkward situation. The *mother-in-law* was living in the house.
C.A.M. Is it not remarkable that the Lord can adjust even that?
J.T. There is nothing He cannot do. The Lord touches her and instead of complaining against the son-in-law, and all that, she serves Him. In Luke she serves *them*, but here she serves *Him*.
L.G.M. Possibly Peter had tried to help his mother-in-law, but could not do so. He had to have the Lord do it.
J.T. In Luke they pray about it; they ask Him to do it, but here He meets the need without being asked.
D.R. Should there be room for any relative in the house and yet be order and liberty to serve the Lord?
J.T. Christianity is great enough for that.
E.G.McA. Coming to ourselves, when coming in, in the spirit of the Lord, we bring peace and quietness.
J.T. If you visit a household, that is the principle that ought to govern you. As it says later, "Peace be to this house". You have nothing else in your mind.
G.A.T. In the Song of Solomon the bridegroom
{332}
put his hand through the hole in the door, and when she came to the place there was a sweet savour of Christ there, a good testimony.
J .T. Here He touched her *hand*. The point is, instead of complaining, you ought to be doing something. When He touched her hand He meant that she must be doing something. So, she arose and served Him. Sisters ought to be occupied. In Timothy there is instruction in regard to the younger and elder women.
To proceed further in regard of the household, it says in the next chapter, verse 18: "As he spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler coming in did homage to him, saying, My daughter has by this died; but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live. And Jesus rose up and followed him, and his disciples". And then it says, "When Jesus was come to the house of the ruler, and saw the flute-players and the crowd making a tumult, he said, Withdraw, for the damsel is not dead but sleeps. And they derided him. But when the crowd had been put out, he went in and took her hand; and the damsel rose up". I just want to say a word on that, contrasting it with Peter's house. It is not the mother-in-law now, it is the daughter, the child. It is not the fever, but *death*, and it is a question now of how life is to be brought into this household where death, as you might say, ruled; and what one notices is a most extraordinary thing: they were making *a noise*. The "flute-players" are those that incite the imagination of the flesh, and here they make a noise in the presence of death. It is a test as to our houses, what we allow there. Evidently this ruler of the synagogue had these conditions in his home. If you have flute-players, or anything like them in the house, how can you expect the Spirit of God to work? The man was in earnest about the daughter; but what about the state of the house?
{333}
W.C.R. These things being brought in hindered the daughter coming to life.
J.T. That is it. The Lord can do nothing.
W.C.R. In other words, hinders the children getting blessing.
Rem. Hezekiah was ordered to set his house in order.
J.T. Yes. Well now, you see the Lord says, virtually, I cannot do anything with all this here. It is a matter now for the things to be judged, so He says to the crowd, "Withdraw, for the damsel is not dead but sleeps. And they derided him".
G.A.T. Do you mean to infer by these remarks that it is not a good thing to have these musical instruments in the home?
J.T. Here it is *noisy* things; things that drown what is of God.
B.T.F. You would say, if the heads of the houses were right and owned, the beneficent rule of Christ would be administered there, and all these contradictory elements would be outside.
W.C.R. I suppose the household becomes the means by which the assembly is kept alive. In other words, it should be a beginning for the house of God.
J.T. You graduate from it into the house of God normally, and therefore children ought not to be brought up in these noisy elements. They do not make for the house of God, because it is silence and waiting on God that marks the house of God. You are to be "swift to hear, and slow to speak", (@James 1:19) there. It is not a place of tumult. To return for a moment to chapter 8, verse 18: "And Jesus, seeing great crowds around him, commanded to depart to the other side. And a scribe came up and said to him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou mayest go. And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven roosting-places; but the
{334}
Son of man has not where he may lay his head. But another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go away and bury my father. But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead. And he went on board ship and his disciples followed him". They followed Him without being asked. I want to notice the emphasis laid on the principle of following in this chapter; that is, disciples now follow Him without being enjoined to. One man proposes to do it, and the Lord says, If you are going to do it, I want you to know how much it cost Me. Another said, I have a certain thing to detain me; but the Lord will not allow that. He goes into the ship and the *disciples* follow Him. They are now developing and follow the Lord voluntarily, as it were.
Ques. What would be the idea of the ship?
J.T. Going to the *other side*. It is death really. When you have followed as a result of the testimony, you have accepted death. It is a question of going to the other side.
Rem. You would say these disciples wanted to follow Christ regardless of the circumstances.
J.T. They followed Him "whithersoever He went".
C.A.M. It is gracious of the Lord not to leave us in any doubt as to what the thing will cost.
J.T. It is indeed. And now in regard to the ship, those that followed Him in the early part of the chapter got light, but those in the ship got light as to His Person; so that if we come into severe circumstances we do not come into them for nothing. We get gain from them.
C.A.M. Spiritual gain costs us something then.
G.A.T. The ship being tossed about shows His protection and that He is able to take care of us.
J.T. Yes. And it says: "The men were astonished, saying, What sort of man is this"? It is
{335}
a new feature of Christ coming before them. "Even the winds and the sea obey him!"
Rem. They follow without question and in doing so they get light. They wondered at what was being done.
J.T. They come into an increased appreciation of His Person.
Ques. Would that indicate that that is the way we learn God by going through these things?
J.T. As following the Lord, accepting the circumstances, the Lord reveals Himself to you in them. I have no doubt the book of Revelation indicates the same thing. The hundred and forty-four thousand develop through experience into acquaintance with Christ, and take on the character of His Father, so they are found with Him in relation to the purpose of God.
C.A.M. It is not following the pathway of the Lord in the letter of the narrative, but following Him in your heart and soul.
{336}
REDEEMING THE TIME
@1 Peter 4:2; @Ephesians 5:16; @1 Chronicles 12:32
I desire to say something, dear brethren, in connection with the *times*. God has ordained that the history of creation should be marked by time, and, whilst it existed before the creation of the sun, moon, and stars, it was decreed that these bodies in the heavens should regulate time. It is said of them that they were to "be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years". (@Genesis 1:14).
Spiritually, I apprehend, that time should be regulated by Christ, for it is He who regulates everything, whether it be your tiny life and mine, or the history of the assembly here, or the millennial period: all is necessarily regulated by Christ. He it is who in the heavens sets the beginning of things and the end. Indeed He says of Himself that He is the beginning and the end; a statement conveying great light morally, implying that all else goes for nothing save what begins with Christ and ends with Christ. So in the first of Genesis, in that way we have an indication of consideration on the part of God that time should be regulated by One who had sympathy and care for those who should have part in it. It was not simply the result of the revolution of heavenly bodies.
Now you will observe that in the verse from which I have quoted in @Genesis 1, there is nothing said about weeks. The weeks are not determined by these heavenly bodies, although it is true, as I will show, that Christ regulates the weeks also. The idea of a week is seen in the Sabbath, and the Sabbath is introduced, not as a necessary end of a period governed by any heavenly body, but arising from a divine necessity; that is, rest. God "rested on the seventh day". (@Genesis 2:2). The week is very interesting, especially in view of the place it holds in Scripture. Christianity
{337}
began, as you might say, with the first day of the week, for we may date it from the first day of the week. The Holy Spirit did not descend until fifty days after, but the new thing began in Christ arising and entering into the assembly, or the company of His own, in the upper room at Jerusalem; and, following upon that, on the next first day of the week He came again. In that way, He inaugurated what may be called a weekly period. In other words, *assembly* life, as one may say, is composed of weeks; the Lord having indicated this, not by commandment but by *precedent*. Christianity is much more established by precedent than by precept, although we have precepts, commandments, and ordinances in Christianity, each of which is obligatory in its place; but the precedents established by the Lord Jesus acquire a peculiar place in the minds of those who love Him.
It was not only *what* He did, but *how* He did it: not only *what* He said, but *how* He said it. All these things enter into the experience of a lover of Christ, and the disciples were all lovers of Christ at the beginning. They all loved Him and they had impressionable hearts, and the impressions that they received from the Lord were to be passed on to us, and they have been passed on. Precedent in that way becomes an impression, and what one would desire more than anything else is to convey a spiritual impression; and this is not only by what may be said, but the manner and spirit in which it is conveyed.
Now the precedents I refer to are those which the Lord set after He arose. Indeed the facts attending His resurrection are recorded so as to produce certain impressions. There was a total disregard of human restrictions and limitations. The stone was rolled away but that was not necessary for Christ to come out. He came out before and everything in the tomb was in order; there was no evidence of a struggle,
{338}
And, being out of the tomb, He is not seen by the public eye, but He appears to Mary in the garden. She thought He was the gardener, but He says, "Mary". What an impression that must have made on her mind! If the Lord were to call one of us by name, you can understand that a lasting impression would remain. I believe He will pronounce all of our names. He calls Mary by name. He intended to produce an impression on her, and then He sends her with a message to the brethren, to *His* brethren, by which He intended to produce an impression on them, and now He appears in their midst, *the doors being shut*, and He says, "Peace be unto you". (@John 20:19). He *stood* in the midst. It does not say that He sat down. The present is a provisional period, and so the Lord *stood* in the midst; but in standing He says, "Peace be unto you".
All that, and much more that I cannot mention now, was intended to produce an impression that should remain, so that Christianity should be a reality in this world, a spiritual institution with the impress of Christ on it; and so He established the principle, or practice, of weekly visitations to His own. Do you not, therefore, readily perceive how a lover of Christ at the beginning would regard his history, viewed in relation to the assembly, as a weekly one? I can well understand it. I can understand Peter or John saying, The Lord came the first day of last week, and He came another first day. It was not necessary that every visitation should be recorded. We have the principle established that they were *weekly*; not that one would limit the Lord, for He is sovereign, but He did establish that precedent. Hence, dear brethren, the assembly's history, as in time, I apprehend, is in this respect, made up of weeks.
What I may be for God individually, and what I learn through discipline in a scene of contrariety, is
{339}
daily, I understand, so I take up my cross *daily*. I am enjoined to do that, not weekly, but daily. But when you come to the first day of the week my collective relations are in evidence. We read that on that day the disciples came together to break bread; this was necessarily a collective act; the Lord comes before us peculiarly; we are for Him and He manifests Himself to us. The Lord manifests Himself and the exercise of the soul that loves Him is to apprehend Him in the special way in which He would manifest Himself on each occasion, and whatever that is it is to mark that week. Each week has its own stamp on it.
People speak about the humdrum life of Christians, the sameness of it. This is true of some of the so-called Christian churches, the Anglican, for instance, but not of genuine Christianity. If I take up an English Episcopalian prayer book, I find that the scripture enjoined to be read on a given Sunday in 1620 is that which is to be read on the same Sunday of 1920. Is that not sameness? What were the manifestations of Christ during all these Sundays? What are they to the worshipper, so-called, who uses that volume as his medium of worship? He has lost the great feature of Christianity, the manifestations of Christ to His own. *We* do not want to miss these, beloved brethren. We get them in their blessed varieties in the beginnings of our weeks. Let us not for a moment entertain that the Lord is inactive; He is not inactive. He can come to His own and make Himself known afresh week by week.
But what I am saying is the secret of all the light we have had. I believe that the things that have come to us during the last century are the effect of these manifestations, the Lord making Himself known from time to time in His own gracious way to His people, to His servants, with the result that we have had freshness; we have had vigour; we have had
{340}
life, and we must not lose these things, dear brethren. We do not want to drop down into an unordered period of time. We want to have our weeks, beginning them with Christ. The life of the assembly is involved in this.
But then, as I said, there is the *daily* life, and that leads me to the passage I read in 1 Peter: "No longer to live the rest of his time". Now that comes to me, and it comes to the youngest one here, as it comes to the very oldest. What about the rest of *your* time? You will have to account at the judgment-seat of Christ in regard of all the years that have passed, all the days that have passed, for we are to give an account to God; as it says, "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body ... whether it be good or bad". (@2 Corinthians 5:10). It is not here the rest of the assembly's time; it is individual; "the rest of *his* time". How is that to be spent? I speak for a moment to the young people here. If one "will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile" (@1 Peter 3:10); further the young are enjoined: "Honour thy father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth". (@Ephesians 6:2,3). This is not a promise to be despised. It is given to the young. The first commandment *with a promise is given to the young*. "That thy days may be long". How are they to be employed? What have you in your mind as to your days? Prosperity in business? Well, it says in the passage before us that the rest of your time is to be *for the will of God*. As doing the will of God you are in accord with the Ark of the covenant; to use the language of the types, you are a board in the tabernacle.
Now I speak, as I said, to the young, and I would urge it upon you, not to be deceived in regard to
{341}
present conditions. The commercial conditions are very promising. I know of no time in the history of the world when opportunities were as great for commercial prosperity as the last few years and the present one afford; but it is most deceptive. If you go through Scripture you will find that the Spirit of God lays great emphasis on the commercial feature of the world, and the prince of the commercial world of ancient times; that is, Tyre, is likened to Satan himself in @Ezekiel 28. I just mention that so that we may not be deceived by commercial prosperity. You may say, I have to make my living, I have to work with my hands the thing that is good as the scripture enjoins. How am I to do that and escape the spirit of competition that the world encourages at the present time? Well, I will tell you. Hold the rest of your days, for the will of God. If you are here for the will of God you will not want. "That he no longer should", it says, "live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God". That is the sure antidote to the evil of accumulation of wealth in this world for one's own pleasure. As here for God's will my earnings are held as subject to that will.
In Ephesians you have not only the rest of your time, little or long as it may be, but *the* time. The time has to be redeemed; that is, you see how much enters into the time. You are not wasting it. You do not usually waste what you pay for; what costs you something you are liable to value. So it says, "Redeeming the time". Buy it up if it is available. Make the most of it. The epistle to the Ephesians, affording to us the portion that is coming to a heavenly people, a people that have access to what is not bounded by time, enjoins that we are to value the time; we are to redeem it, and why? "The days are evil"; every opportunity is therefore to be seized and turned to the best use.
{342}
Peter sets before us the general principle that what is left of one's time is to be spent here for the will of God, whereas Ephesians speaks of *the* time, and it is to be taken advantage of so that one does not waste it. The moments are precious. There is a moment in which I can do something for Christ; in which I can speak a word for Him; in which I can say something to a thirsty soul. The Lord Himself said in Spirit, "The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned", (@Isaiah 50:4). "That I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary". We have here a touching indication of the manner and object of the Lord's gracious and lowly service in this world. Let me say here, dear brethren, that though there is very great inactivity amongst the people of God, the activity that marks us, as compared with the light and privileges we enjoy, is very meagre. Say unto Zion, "Let not thine hands be slack". (@Zephaniah 3:16). It is not that I would make you legal, but I do urge this on myself and on you, that the time is to be redeemed; it is short; there is much need, and hence much work to be done. In writing to the Corinthians the apostle says, "the time is short"; not the life of any of the Corinthian saints, but the period of testimony is short, and he says, "that both they that have wives be as though they had none", (@1 Corinthians 7:29 - 31). That is, you hold things lightly here. Your one aim is the furtherance of the Lord's interests in this world. His testimony is to be constantly before you. "The time is short".
Well now, in turning to Chronicles I wanted to amplify this a bit; because I think the men of Issachar are like Ephesian Christians. It is said of them that they "had understanding of the times". It is not now that they redeemed the time, or that
{343}
the time was short, but that they understood the times; and so I just seek to enlarge on this point because understanding is so important, otherwise, what we do we may do amiss. They had understanding of the times, it says, "to know what Israel ought to do". In other words, it is a question now of assembly obligations. It is not simply what *I* do, it is what *Israel* ought to do; and, may I inquire, dear brethren, as to whether we are accustomed to view the saints, and clothe the saints with assembly thoughts? If I meet a saint I am to clothe him, as it were, with assembly thoughts; if I meet two or more saints I clothe them in the same way. In other words, I have understanding of the time and I apprehend what Israel; that is the assembly, speaking in Christian language, what the assembly ought to do.
Now I dwell on this thought of understanding, and in order to make it clear I would refer to Daniel. Daniel, in chapter 9: 2, tells us that he "understood by the books". Now I do not urge you to read everything, but it is important to *read*. We read of Ezra as "a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given", (@Ezra 7:6). I would be disposed to read anything that Ezra wrote. I am not saying that Daniel acquired his knowledge by such literature (he speaks of *the* books, the Scriptures) as may have been written to meet the local need of the saints, but I have no doubt that Daniel would gladly read any helpful production, and if you cannot *hear* a man whom God has qualified to minister, then do not despise what he may *write*, for God uses scribes. There was a scribe in David's regime; there was a chronicler also. The scribe or secretary, was a man who would write down at the king's mouth what the king might wish to communicate. Such a man is of great importance, especially in a day like the present, when the saints are so widely scattered, and many isolated. The preacher
{344}
in Ecclesiastes indicates the exercises of one employed in this service. He says: "The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth", (@Ecclesiastes 12:10).
The Holy Spirit has given much for the people of God and it is for us to get the benefit of what is available. So it says, "The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd". (verse 11). There are words of wisdom, words of truth, carefully set down as food for the saints. Well now, Daniel said he understood by books, and by these books he gathered that there were certain time limitations, seventy years, and then there should be a return of the captivity. We gather the mind of God in this way from reading. Daniel understood by books that there should be a return of the captivity after seventy years, and so he *prays*.
I have been speaking about reading. Now I would urge prayer; so let us turn, for a moment, to the book of Daniel. It says, "In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; In the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem". Thus he acquired an "understanding of the times". And now he says, "I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: And *I* prayed", (@Daniel 9:1 - 4). How much do we pray, dear brethren? I have been speaking about reading, but I ask, How much do we pray, and how far do we travel in our prayers? The more you are with God the wider shall become the area covered by your prayers, until the whole household of faith is embraced, and indeed "all men". Do not be satisfied with
{345}
your prayers until you, as it were, cover the whole household of faith. As Scripture enjoins: "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints", (@Ephesians 6:18).
So Daniel set his face to prayer; and then it says, "Whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God; Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation". (@Daniel 9:20,21). What a wonderful experience that was! It was about the time of the evening oblation, and that was what his prayer was. It was an oblation; it ascended to God. And so Gabriel speaks to him:
"He informed me, and talked with me". (verse 22). Is it not worth while to pray? Pray on, until you, as it were, receive a divine communication. Something from the Lord will come into your soul. "He informed me", he says, "and talked with me". Those of us here who have had to do with God in prayer know something about this. It is a wonderful experience to have to say to God, and as you pray and embrace the saints in your prayers, you get an impression from God; you become assured He has heard you. "If we know that he hear us ... we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him". (@1 John 5:15). It is inexpressibly precious to be conscious that God hears us. And then it says further, "And said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding". (verse 22). These things are all within our reach. Is there any young brother here who desires to have the mind of God? "Consider what I say", says Paul, "and the Lord give thee understanding", (@2 Timothy 2:7) but prayer enters into this. Gabriel says further: "At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment
{346}
came forth, and I am come to show thee; for thou art greatly beloved". (verse 23). Think of that! As you are praying, God looks into your heart; He knows what is going on in your heart, and He greatly loves you, as you pray, taking into account, as Daniel did, the state of His people, bearing them on your heart before Him. And then it goes on:. "Therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision". And now look! "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy". What a message!
As we look abroad in the world as it is, what a message this is! "To finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy". (verse 24) God had determined seventy weeks and there cannot be seventy *one*. There shall be just seventy; seventy weeks are determined. What are they determined for? "To finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity". What great results to look forward to for a man like Daniel! And then, "To bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy". Can anything fail? No! There were just seventy weeks determined for the accomplishment of all these things. And who acquires the knowledge of this? The man who reads and the man who prays! *He* comes into the light of all these great facts. In like manner the mind of God may be acquired by ourselves. Thus by reading and prayer, we become like the men of Issachar, we have understanding of the times; we know the times, and not
{347}
only that, we know what Israel ought to do. And that to me involves *assembly* obligations at the present time.
You may ask, Where is the assembly? Well, I cannot show you the assembly but I know it exists here on earth. "The Lord knows those that are his"; (@2 Timothy 2:19) and if I am an Ephesian saint, so to speak, I love *all the saints*. I am concerned about them all; I pray for them, for I have "understanding of the times", and I know "what *Israel* ought to do". Hence it is a question of assembly obligation and, as we apprehend that, *we clothe the saints with assembly thoughts*. The Lord clothes them thus. As we sit down to partake of the Lord's supper we are taking it in the light of the assembly, and the Lord views us in that light. If others are not there we miss them, if we are with God. The Lord misses them. One would always be prepared to partake of the Lord's supper if it is available. The Lord looks for you there, and those who love you look for you. It is a question of what Israel ought to do. I believe that in these last days the Lord has shown us that there is at least that which Israel ought to do; namely, to partake of the Supper. The Supper belongs to the assembly, and every member of the assembly should partake of it. If not, why not? If something is wrong, judge it; there is grace with the Lord to adjust you, so that you should be qualified to respond to His desire. Those who have "understanding of the times" know that Israel ought to do that, and it is for you to have part in it.
Well, beloved brethren, I have nothing more to add, but I think my thought is clear enough and simple enough, that the time is precious and it is for us to fill it out, not only in regard to our personal history but the history of the assembly; the little that remains is to be redeemed and used for the Lord and naught else. May God bless the word!

Pages 348 - 429 -- "The Assembly in Relation to Divine Administration", Belfast, 1920 (Volume 49).
THE ASSEMBLY IN RELATION TO DIVINE ADMINISTRATION (1)
@Matthew 11:25 - 30; 12:1 - 30
J.T. My exercise was in regard to the assembly as presented in this gospel. In these passages the necessity for the kingdom, as we know it, and for the assembly becomes apparent.
E.N.H. I suppose in verse 25 of chapter 11, there is an emphasis on the words "At that time".
J.T. It was a time occasioning disappointment, if such were possible, for the Lord, for those among whom He had ministered had proved utterly indifferent to what He ministered; so "At that time" points to the superiority that marked Him; in other words, the truth of the kingdom and the truth of the assembly are introduced by the Lord in complete superiority to the most adverse circumstances.
E.N.H. When John the baptist was put to death, the Lord's works and He Himself were rejected, but He had something better than what His previous testimony involved to bring in, that is, the revelation of the Father and of the assembly.
J.T. He first recognises the supremacy of the Father, and praises Him.
E.M. Why does He say, "Lord of heaven and earth" in addressing the Father?
J.T. To indicate ownership; so that He can dispense all at His pleasure. All was given into the hands of the Son, and He brings forward the assembly. I think His position is somewhat in the light of the preacher in Ecclesiastes. Matthew's gospel is what you might call an assembling gospel. The word *preacher* signifies "former of assemblies", one who by his preaching forms assemblies, and the necessity
{349}
for this is brought out in a striking way in this gospel. The ministry of Christ from this point has special reference to the forming of the assembly.
E.B.McB. Was not Matthew specially qualified to present the Lord in that way?
J.T. It was he who received the Lord into his house and made a great entertainment for Him. He invited those into his house whom he knew would be agreeable to the Lord, and he is employed by the Spirit to present that feature of Christ's ministry which specially forms the assembly as the vessel of administration here. I think that Ecclesiastes helps as to that. The preaching of the gospel according to Matthew would have in view the calling out of a company on earth which should have this place. It is not so many people congregated; the word *congregation* does not convey the thought although it is largely used in Scripture, but the word *assembly* which is also used in Scripture does, and has its own meaning. In the New Testament it implies that the saints are *called out*. Paul's service at Corinth illustrates the position, because the saints in that city were to be specially taken up and recognised by the Spirit as "the assembly of God" there.
J.McF. Would you say a word about the close of chapter 11?
J.T. The Lord rejoices in what the Father was doing; He speaks of the Father's supremacy over the heavens and the earth, and that He had revealed certain things unto babes; then He speaks about the revelation. We are in the presence here of very great facts; the supremacy of the Father, and that He was hiding things from the wise and prudent and revealing them to babes. This was the line of His operations, and the knowledge of the Father and the Son was connected with it. We are here in presence of the most momentous facts in regard to the disposition of the heavens and the earth; and then we have
{350}
a model presented in the Lord. It is an entirely new beginning, but a new beginning in view of administration. We have several beginnings in Scripture; @Genesis 1:1, @John 1, and @1 John 1, but this is a beginning in regard to administration.
E.N.H. Do you connect that with the words, "All things are delivered unto me of my Father"; Christ having come to take up everything?
J.T. That is right; everything now is in the hands of the Son, so that John and Matthew touch each other here, only that Matthew brings out the thought as to outward administration, whereas John deals with life. Matthew deals with the public assembly, John with administration in regard to life.
Ques. What do you mean by administration?
J.T. We have it indicated here. "All things are delivered unto me of my Father". Then in the next chapter we have the Lord as supreme, breaking the bond with Israel, and emphasising that there was One there who was greater than Solomon and greater than Jonas; the greatness of His Person is emphasised. Then in chapter 13 it is what He produced by sowing; in chapter 14 He is administering; that is, showing the truth of it, so that His disciples might learn from Him. In chapter 16 is "my assembly" on the line of Paul's administration, and in chapter 18 He refers to that vessel as something here on earth that should be authoritative, that should be *heard*.
R.D. What is the object of administration?
J.T. To make God known; and we can understand that from the Person who administers. The Son is the Administrator, and the teaching from this chapter to chapter 18 is to bring us into accord with Him.
R.D. The preacher in Ecclesiastes brings us to view the ruin, and then he turns to the wisdom of God.
{351}
J.T. He speaks with the greatest authority, because he had by God's help investigated everything under the sun, and he was therefore in a position to speak with authority and, as you might say, to draw man out of the world; that is the effect of the book of Ecclesiastes. If all is vanity, we might as well give it up. The preacher was wise; he set in order many proverbs; these would be a means whereby the minds of the saints would be kept right, and, moreover, he says, "The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies", so that the saints are regulated in their minds; then it adds "which are given from one shepherd". So that all is under the Lord's gracious administration.
R.D. From this point do we get the establishment of the assembly, that against which the gates of hell should not prevail?
J.T. Yes, beginning with the *babes*, and we have all to begin in that way. The epistle to the assembly at Corinth intimates that God was not specially taking up men of wealth or education. He began with what was despicable, weak things, as we have here; "and hast revealed them unto babes". There is a beginning from the bottom. Judaism therefore did not furnish anything; the learning of the scribes contributed nothing to the assembly. Colossians contends against the principles of the world, so everything is put under Christ in Colossians. So here, the revelation is to babes, and then if there is one who labours or is heavy laden, he is to come to Christ who is the model, and all is to be formed after that pattern.
Ques. Would you distinguish between the babes and those who might be weary and heavy laden?
J.T. I would. The expression *babes* refers to the disciples; they had a peculiar place in the Lord's mind.
{352}
E.M. The babes set forth a moral state and the revelation is given to such.
J.T. You remain a babe as regards your *taste for the word*."As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word", but spiritually we are to advance to manhood. The word babes is here set over against the products of Judaism; it is not a question of family gradation in this scripture, but of what they were relatively as contrasted with "the wise and prudent".
E.N.H. The babe state as seen in the gospel is receptive.
J.T. I do not think it is a question of the babe in its relation to the family; it is the babe in contrast to the wise and prudent; it is what the disciples were as compared with the learned ones among the Jews. The Father had hid these things from the one and revealed them to the other.
In John Jesus cried, "If any man thirst" (@John 7:37); here He calls, "all ye that labour and are heavy laden". We know that the Jewish system involved heavy burdens, hence the import of the message here, "Come unto me". He would give them rest, but He also becomes a model from whom they are to learn. "Learn from me". The babes had already come under His influence, and in principle were already delivered, but others were also in His mind. The more pious a man is, the more he is burdened by a legal system, it is a burden hard to be borne. The word "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise", (@Matthew 21:16) in no way accredits the babe state; it is simply a question of what God does; as the Lord said, "If these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out". (@Luke 19:40). It is what God can do. But then the assembly is not composed of babes; that is what we want to get on to; the vessel of administration is composed of grown men.
{353}
Rem. As regards the attitude you present to men, you do not assume to be among the men of rank of this world.
J.T. No. In Acts, the apostles were said to be ignorant and unlearned men, and yet they were taken up to be servants. "Such as I have give I thee", Peter said (@Acts 3:6). The twelfth chapter of Matthew is to call attention to the legal system; Christ was Lord of the sabbath, and had power to break the bond with Israel; He was greater than all that had preceded Him. Then He says, "How much then is a *man* better than a sheep?" That is another point; the man He spoke of had a withered hand, and it was about to be restored whole. By His instruction in the beginning of the chapter, the Lord breaks down the structure which had been erected before He begins to build the new structure, and He does it as one having authority, and not as the scribes. As Son of man, He was Lord of the sabbath. The model is a Man it the presence of God; (@Matthew 11). He praises God in the hour of adversity; that is the model for Christians. He says, "I am meek and lowly in heart", and that is set over against the pretentiousness of this world. We have the great facts set before us here that marked the dispensation in view of administration; the Father is seen in His ownership of heaven and earth, and revealing to babes; then the Lord gives the invitation to burdened ones to come to Him, so that you have in principle a perfect solution of everything. The world has become an utter breakdown morally, now here is a new beginning. Chapter 12 brings in the greatness and power of Christ to sustain the faith of the saints in the present time, hence He says, "If I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you". That is a fact to be recognised; then chapter 13 is what He produces. It is an agricultural reference, so that the kingdom in its
{354}
different phases is presented to us as the result of what Christ sowed; then His administration is seen in chapters 14 and 15. In referring to this dispensation it is well to bear in mind that the word *administration* refers to administration through the house of God. God administers house-wise. It is well to keep that in mind, because He shows how those who are to form the house are prepared, and the dispensation is to be in faith. Compare @1 Timothy 1:4.
Ques. Does it support Paul's system?
J.T. It does. I think Corinthians treats of the assembly in connection with the ways of God on the earth, so that it is said to be "the assembly of God which is at Corinth". (@1 Corinthians 1:2).
Rem. The new thing involved the whole of the human race.
J.T. Yes; so it says, "How much then is a *man* better than a sheep?" It makes no difference whether he is a Jew or a Gentile; that is what the Lord had in His mind. The assembly would take the place of the Jewish Council, representing God on earth, so the Syrophenician woman comes in, in chapter 15 as helping to show that "my assembly" would be universal in its bearing, and not confined to the Jews; only that those of the Gentiles had to accept and own their governmental position as dogs. In chapter 13 the Lord sits down by the sea; the nations are in His mind in the sowing of the seed; the preaching goes out to all. The preacher in Ecclesiastes had the whole realm under the sun in his mind. In the @Song of Solomon 8:11, we have a further reference that may be helpful; "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon". Baal-hamon signifying "place of a multitude", refers to the fact that he was master of that place. The sowing of the seed in chapter 13 would bring in a multitude, but that multitude has to be regulated. The assembly
{355}
is not simply a multitude, but companies regulated by divine principles, so that the expression "master of assemblies" would have in view the ordering of the assemblies, for the assembly was to take form in localities. All these assemblies were to be regulated by the same principles; they are all governed by one Shepherd, and that involves catholicity. In these companies you have right forms of expression too, "acceptable words". These would be the legacy of the saints; we are not to import into the things of God words that are unsuited. The preacher was concerned that there should be a right form of words. These chapters in Matthew are, I believe, all intended by the "master of assemblies" to regulate the saints in regard to the assembly.
Ques. Is it like having an outline of sound words?
J.T. I think it is very much like that. It is not that we make a man an offender for a word, but when you have a wrong *system of words*, then the offence is apparent, hence the importance of having the right form of words. The Lord had received everything from the Father, but then He in turn was to delegate this authority to others. This is a point that we must notice; the authority that the Lord exercised here was delegated. The Father had delivered everything into His hands, and now He in turn delegates His authority, and chapter 18 shows that it is delegated to the assembly. The sixteenth chapter shows the capability of the assembly to exercise this authority on account of what it is formed of. If you speak of exercising authority on the ground of what we get in chapter 18 and ignore what we get in chapter 16 you are sure to be wrong. The latter enables us to understand what the assembly is in regard of Christ. "On this rock I will build my assembly". "Thou art Peter"; (@Matthew 16:18) the material is thus pointed to. Chapter 18 speaks of administration, but that must not be divorced, as
{356}
I have said, from chapter 16, otherwise you have a formal prerogative without inward power. The inward thing is *Peter*, that is the material. The assembly takes the place of the Jewish Sanhedrim; it is a place of deliberation. In Corinthians the expression is "the assembly of God". (@1 Corinthians 1:2). Matthew is occupied with what is called "the assembly", something which should represent Christ and His authority here. There is what answers to the law of the house spoken of in the Old Testament, and where that law is recognised I think you get administration; it is carried on. *Babes* is an expression set over against the wise and prudent; but when you come to the spiritual side, they were to develop into manhood. "In malice be ye children, but in understanding be grown men". (@1 Corinthians 14:20). The apostle had in mind that the Corinthians should be men spiritually.
{357}
THE ASSEMBLY IN RELATION TO DIVINE ADMINISTRATION (2)
@Matthew 14 and 15
J.T. What came before us previously was, that in presence of the rejection of the Lord's ministry by Israel, He is consciously superior in praising the Father, recognising Him as Lord of heaven and earth, and as revealing to the babes what He was hiding from the wise and prudent. Then Christ Himself becomes a model for all who labour and are heavy-laden; coming to Him they would find rest, and would learn from Him, so that He stands out as the model in view of what He had before Him to introduce, namely, the kingdom as we have it now, and the assembly. He therefore becomes the beginning. Then in chapter 12 He is Lord of the Sabbath, having in that way authority to break the bond that existed between God and Israel, the sabbath being the sign of that bond, and He calls attention to the relative value of a man as compared with a sheep, indicating that *men* were now in view, not simply Israelites; that is, men as such. He deals with the man with the withered hand so that it becomes whole, further announcing that a greater than Solomon was there, and a greater than Jonas; and thus chapter 12, coupled with chapter 11 brings the Lord before us in an objective way; then chapter 13 brings in His sowing; He sits down to announce the truth. "He went into a ship and sat down". (verse 2) The thought of His sitting down is in evidence, which, I think, points to care and deliberation as to what was before Him; an element that we do well to take note of, because in the Lord's service we are apt to be rash. It is well to be deliberate and thoughtful. In the synagogue at Nazareth He stood up for to read, but here He sits down.
{358}
E.N.H. Do you think there is added force in the fact that it is not a Person who is said to be greater than Solomon or the temple, it is *more* than Solomon and *more* than the temple? Do you think it is not only the Lord Himself; but what He is bringing in, the assembly?
J.T. I suppose the kingdom was included at any rate, so it is not so much He, but *what* is greater. I think it involved the kingdom. "If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you". (@Matthew 12:28).
E.N.H. Do you think it involves more than the kingdom?
J.T. I think He refers to Himself and the power that He exercised.
H.H. How do you regard the sowing? Would you regard it as having a subjective effect?
J.T. The position of sitting suggests that He sowed with the greatest deliberation, and in conscious superiority; He was not troubled by circumstances. The sowing refers to what is subjective; it is an agricultural reference which is invariably subjective. The sun, moon, and stars represent what is objective, but when you come to the earth it is what is subjective. We do well to take note of the deliberation with which the Lord carried on His service.
E.J.McB. We left off yesterday at what was a very interesting point in the reading, when the question was before us as to the importance of the house.
J.T. I think it fits in with chapter 14, which takes up definitely the question of administration, not only in the hands of Christ, but in the hands of the disciples. Chapters 12 and 13 present what He carries on Himself; His own work, and the principle of example appears throughout. It is of great importance in service to be restful. God would have us on His own side; in service we are on God's side.
{359}
God is not disturbed by any conditions, so that the Lord is here in complete superiority to conditions, whether on the shore or in the boat. He is perfectly restful, so that the work is carried on with deliberation.
Ques. Would you mind repeating what was said yesterday in regard of administration?
J.T. Administration marks chapters 14 and 15, but we went rather wide afield yesterday. I wanted to get to the point in chapter 13 of the example that the Lord set in regard of ministry. No farmer would sow under unfavourable conditions; I think the Lord sitting shows that He is in supremacy, He will not be disturbed or forced by conditions, He sows with deliberation. The truth is too important to admit of conditions affecting one in the work. Then He proceeds to speak the remarkable parable of the sowing of the seed, with a view to fruit.
Ques. Why does Jonas come in here?
J.T. He was a remarkable servant of God; his experience was unparalleled; he was three days and three nights in the fish's belly; a most extraordinary experience. He was a type of the Lord Himself. Think of a man coming out of the fish's belly on to the dry land and then being sent to Nineveh. I suppose the Jews would regard him as a most remarkable servant of God.
H.H. I think you said that as being in the fish's belly, Jonah was a type of Christ.
J.T. He was, and these two personages, the queen of the south and Jonah, being introduced, hint at what was in the Lord's mind -- the area of the place of service was going to be extended.
R.D. What did that cover?
J.T. The greatness of Solomon had extended beyond the limits of Israel, so that it affected one so far away as the queen of the south. The Lord intimates that there was something greater; He hints too at the world-wide testimony that He was about
{360}
to render; and it was for them to take heed to that.
R.D. Is that in view from the very outset of Matthew, the Lord being spoken of as the Son of David and Son of Abraham?
J.T. No doubt the evangelist had administration in his mind. Abraham was the depositary of the promises, David the administrator of them.
R.D. I thought that scope was in view.
J.T. Yes, and so Solomon comes in as the counterpart of David; the area of his administration was widened out to the queen of the south.
E.J.McB. Is it important to notice that He is presented first as Son of David before Son of Abraham? That is, as Administrator He is on the line of promise.
J.T. Quite so; David is the one raised up of God to be the ruler, and he administers. "Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him?" (@2 Samuel 9:3) He was a suitable man to administer what was of God in divine bounty.
E.J.McB. I thought the man coming out of the whale's belly would suggest that he is beyond the limitations of the national thought of Israel.
J.T. Jonah got his experience outside the limits of Israel. These men were qualified to administer. Solomon is the counterpart of David, in fact he is a type of Christ as Son of David.
H.H. In connection with the result of the sowing it says, some an hundred fold, some sixty fold, some thirty fold. What would you say as to that?
J.T. This chapter presents the kingdom in seven phases, and in this particular parable of the sower, Matthew contemplates the *decline* of power in result, whereas Mark contemplates *increase*, thirty, sixty, a hundred. I think Matthew treats more of what is connected with the public vessel of testimony, whereas Mark is occupied with what is connected with the Spirit; the end is greater than the beginning, he himself being an example of that. Mark was more
{361}
efficient after he had been restored than he was at the beginning.
E.N.H. Luke gives only a hundred fold; would that be the result of the Lord's own ministry?
J.T. It would be the full result of the grace of God, without modifications. It is humiliating to have to be reminded of decline; thirty is a fair yield, but when you think it might have been a hundred, it humbles you. If you review your history, you see how much better things might have been than they are.
E.M. As to the favourable conditions you referred to, why did Paul say that Timothy was to preach in season and out of season?
J.T. I was speaking of a person's state of soul. If you consider the weather you will not go out, but I was not speaking of that, but of state of soul. The Lord here shows His complete superiority in service; He was not affected at all by conditions. I think @Acts 2 compared with this shows how the testimony began. Peter was not in any way under the influence of what had preceded in his own history, otherwise he could not have stood up as he did at Pentecost; he would have been hampered by his own state. Now he is in such deliverance that he can speak to them about their having denied the Lord. One always goes back to his sermon for an example; he stood up with the eleven, the eleven accredited witnesses of Christ, and announced the message. It is therefore important that anyone serving in the world should be free in his own soul; he should see to that himself; and the saints should see to it too. Paul considered for Timothy: "See that he may be with you without fear". If a man work the work of the Lord, be sure you do not throw any hindrances in his way, but rather the opposite. Timothy was evidently a retiring man, and naturally timid. Paul said to the Corinthians, "I look for
{362}
him with the brethren"; (@1 Corinthians 16:10,11) instead of the brethren coming with him, he came with them. He was just a brother, and therefore a model for the last days; he was to be with them without fear, not hampered in any way. The letter to him places the responsibility on *his* shoulders, but the letter to the Corinthians places responsibility as to him on *their* shoulders.
E.M. A servant needs a sympathetic atmosphere.
J.McM. Sowing supposes fruit. Is it that there should be those who should carry on the administration?
J.T. The sowing in chapter 13 brings in the multitude. "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon (master of a multitude)". (@Song of Songs 8:11). The multitude is set in order in chapters 14 to 18. There we get instruction how we are to be regulated, but the sowing brings in the multitude. In the Acts you have the thing historically; there were multitudes of those who believed, but the "master of assemblies" has to consider how the saints are to be regulated, so that they should be here locally as vessels of God's will. The instruction in chapters 14 to 18 is in order that we should be regulated here as the assembly of God. A good deal of instruction is necessary to qualify us to take up that position.
J.McM. Under the Lord?
J.T. Surely. He has redemption rights. The yield of the vineyard was to be in silver; there was to be an answer there to redemption. The Lord has His rights over His people.
R.D. "Everyone for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver". (@Song of Songs 8:11)
J.T. That is what I was thinking of. The trumpets in @Numbers 10 were to be made of silver, and those would bring the saints into rank, whether it were for war or for discipline. The silver trumpets
{363}
were employed to call them into line; and that is the side which this gospel emphasises.
Ques. Do I understand there are three thoughts in your mind; first the model, then the gathering of the material, and then the adjustment of the material to the model?
J.T. That is right, but the lack with us is that we are content to belong to the multitude, but Solomon looks for a yield, he let the vineyard out to husbandmen. Evidently a lover speaks in verse 12, "Thou, O Solomon must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred". He got his full yield, and we should not be content with less than that, and note too, the keepers get their portion. I think all that comes out in the assembly.
W.K. I hope you will be able to show us how it does come out.
J.T. That is what we are aiming at, and as we go on with our chapters, I hope we may see how these principles apply. This is preliminary; the Lord is showing us how *He* does things.
Rem. The Lord is now introducing a new thing for God, and it is transitional; He starts with a small thing, the seed, and then it grows.
J.T. We are not told what the first seed is that He sowed, it was some grain. The point evidently is that there was a *sowing*, but in the next parable it is wheat, and in the next a mustard seed. The first parable impresses us with the principle of sowing, and how a man sews; it is occupied with the fact that he sows, and the result of his sowing; then in verse 31 it is a grain of mustard seed, the least of all seeds. Wheat is obviously a grain of very great value. The enemy would try specially to spoil that by imitation.
R.B. Where does this find any analogy in connection with the work of the Lord?
{364}
J.T. I think the reference here is to the service of the apostles.
R.D. In the beginning of Acts?
J.T. Yes. The first four parables refer to what was public and the effect of it, the last three refer to what belongs to the assembly.
R.D. What about putting the good into vessels?
J.T. That is spoken of in connection with the house.
R.D. I wondered if you had in your mind the general idea of forming assemblies in connection with putting the good into vessels?
J.T. Fish are living things; we have in the first of Genesis vegetable life and animal life; both are typical of Christianity; when you come to the net, you pass on to the fifth day of @Genesis 1.
E.J.McB. The agricultural figure is then dropped?
J.T. Yes. The fish would be living creatures; in the first of Genesis they are called souls, they have life.
Rem. He spoke in parables in regard of things kept secret from the foundation of the world.
J.T. Yes, and I think the moral reality of the first of Genesis was secret until the Lord came; so you have in this chapter the idea of antiques. "Every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven ... bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old". He has in his treasure all the things of the Old Testament that refer to Christ; the older they are the better they are. Elsewhere old things are to be discarded, but here they are valuable; the Lord brought them out in @Luke 24:27. "He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself". They were all the beautiful antiques, one might say, of the Old Testament.
H.H. The scribe would look at all the Old Testament as having reference to Christ?
J.T. The enemy would lessen its value, but that
{365}
is only a stepping stone to attack the New Testament. The Scriptures cannot be broken; they have their own value. Every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens has a treasury.
E.J.McB. I think the human figure is exceedingly good; if a person buys a house and furnishes it, the more he would value antiques.
J.T. In other words, the more spiritual you are, the more you would value the Old Testament.
E.J.McB. We would like a little help in regard of chapter 14, how we are set in order, so that we might become distinct from the crowd.
J.T. The crowd is seen in verses 14 to 17. The Lord says, "Give ye them to eat". The first service in this connection is to give people something to eat.
E.N.H. Then they have to bring the little they have to Him, and He uses them as instruments through whom He can give abundant supplies.
Ques. Would the five loaves and two fishes represent the Old Testament?
J.T. It is what *they had*, it did not represent the system at Jerusalem, it represented what was spiritual; what the Lord was taking up, and was going to use.
R.W.G. What do the twelve baskets over represent? In the following parable we have seven baskets. I understand the twelve are small hand-baskets, while the seven are large baskets. Is the thought of the twelve, administration at the beginning of Christianity? If so, what do the seven large baskets represent?
J.T. The Spirit, I suppose; the miracle in chapter 14 would set forth apostolic administration, and that in chapter 15 what there is for us by the Spirit.
R.W.G. Is there more food for the saints at the end of the dispensation, than there was at the beginning?
{366}
J.T. I should not care to minimise what they had at the beginning, but I think the seven large baskets point to the fulness of the Spirit. That is a great encouragement now, and although the apostles are not here and *public* administration has disappeared (I think the brethren will not misunderstand that), yet spiritual administration has not disappeared; it remains. There is that which lies in the Spirit, and there is no limit to it; there is administration in a spiritual way for those who are humble enough to keep out of sight; the Spirit is with them, but public administration as represented by the word *twelve* has ceased. I think we must accept that. Chapter 15 gives us the seven large baskets; what they represent remains.
R.D. Would not what we have in chapter 14 be a great gain to us as a model?
J.T. That is important. If we are to get the truth, we must go back to the beginning and see what then existed. By comparing that with what now exists publicly, we have a sense of the ruin brought home to us.
R.D. It is a great study for us, the way the multitude was fed.
G.W.W. In our souls we hold on to the twelve as light, but as to actual fact we avail ourselves of the seven.
R.W.G. In regard to the administration of the twelve, was not their support in what was spiritual?
J.T. There was nothing official at the beginning that was not supported by the Spirit. That which was official and that which was spiritual were correlative at the beginning; in time the two separated. The addresses to the assemblies in the Revelation show that they did, but the Holy Spirit remains. @Matthew 16:18, "On this rock I will build my assembly", should be connected with the spiritual side. The administrative side has collapsed; those who profess
{367}
to be the apostolic successors are not spiritual men. We could hardly say they have the Spirit, whereas the Spirit remains here and is in those who are out of sight and who in accepting that are of no account. Such get the good of the Spirit; they have the light in their souls and act on it in their private capacity, but do not assume to be in the position of administering publicly on the behalf of Christ.
Ques. "Bring them hither to me". How do you apply that?
J.T. Take those whom the Lord employs in a spiritual way now, they would not fit into any official place at all. We have to accept that we are not fit for the public official thing as it is now regarded.
R.D. In this respect it is still the character of the babes in chapter 11.
G.W.W. Do both the miracles of feeding the multitudes teach us that we are not self-contained? In connection with administration, we must have to do with the Lord. It is not that we have something we can carry on with apart from Him.
J.T. That is an important lesson. Taken together the fishes and loaves represent what was to be administered. Two fishes would have their own meaning, a *testimony* to something. They were very little taken together to meet the situation; it was a serious matter for the disciples, but they were to learn how the Lord could enlarge what they had. The Lord will take what you have and enlarge it, so that you need not go beyond your measure. The disciples *knew* what they had. A lesson that may be gathered from this passage is that at the present time we should not exclude from our thoughts anyone that belongs to Christ. It corresponds with @Psalm 132:15, "I will satisfy her poor with bread". We may be in danger of a sort of super-spirituality, arrogating to ourselves what really belongs to *all*;

every one of Zion's poor must be taken account of. No one who seeks to minister Christ should have anything less than that before him. We are to be thinking of all, and what the Lord is giving is in relation to all. It is wonderful how one hears of souls getting refreshment in unheard of ways. We are apt to get on to narrow lines unless we take into account all that belong to Christ. "The Lord knoweth them that are his". (@2 Timothy 2:19).
H.H. The Lord commanding to sit down on the grass, has that reference to His personal authority in the house?
J.T. That was a mark of His consideration for them. He took account of the grass; it would afford certain comfort as they sat down. Whilst we do not take the place of being public administrators, the administration goes on; the food is available in that way. We want to consider for the saints. These chapters are to qualify us for what is brought out in chapters 16 and 18.
R.G. Would the sitting down involve quietness of spirit on our side in being ministered to?
Rem. The New Translation reads, "He caused the crowds to recline". We have to seek to get them quiet, so that they might get the benefit of what is administered. It is not only that we ourselves have to be quiescent, but we have to get others into a quiescent state.
G.N. What is the character of public administration in contrast with spiritual administration?
J.T. Public administration was in connection with the apostles. The epistle to the Corinthians was the public recognition of the assembly. Now that having become "a great house", as @2 Timothy 2:20 indicates, it is a question for all the saints how they are to walk in the light of that letter now. That is the exercise. I think @Matthew 15 helps us on that point, because it is a question now of what is spiritual.
{369}
As to our public attitude, we are humble about it; the assembly is a failure publicly; there is no value in trying to re-establish it. We have to accept the situation, and go on under reproach. No one knows us; we have to appeal to the Lord. What is the use of pretending to be administrators in an official way? It is better to accept what exists; all that we need will be there, food and everything else, but there must be no pretence.
R.B. Do you connect the feeding of the multitudes in chapter 15 with what obtains now?
J.T. I do. The Lord calls attention to the seven loaves, and the mind is at once occupied with *that number*. The presence of the Holy Spirit here and Christ on high as the Head of the assembly have been called attention to, and are still available. It seems to me that we get instruction in the facts presented in chapter 15, as to what has been recovered in these last days.
H.H. Do you look at chapter 15 in the light of divine Persons?
J.T. Yes. In chapter 14:19, the Lord looked up to *heaven*; but in chapter 15:36, He gave thanks simply. It does *not* say He looked up to heaven, because administration is in connection with heaven; The kingdom of the heavens is the administration of heavenly bounty here. In chapter 15 it is the Lord speaking to God simply.
H.H. We can still have things in relation to divine Persons; this suggests John's ministry, "We know that the Son of God is come". Things are viewed in relation to divine Persons; and on the other hand we can have things in Paul's ministry which are light and direction to us in relation to the failure and ruin which have come in as in 2 Timothy when difficulty and departure are contemplated.
J.T. I think John's ministry would fit in with chapter 15, the way in which the giving of thanks is
{370}
spoken of. The Lord simply gives thanks as if the ministry of the Spirit is centred in that form. I refer to the Lord's supper having acquired such a remarkable place in the affections of the saints; the Supper brings Him in in a peculiar way, and the food that is connected with it; the Holy Spirit bringing in the wealth of God. All that is pictured for us in chapter 15, and corresponds with what, through grace, we have proved in some measure. It is well to remember the unlimitedness of the Spirit; the ministry goes on; the Holy Spirit Himself speaks at the end to the Lord, "the Spirit and the bride say, Come". (@Revelation 22:17).
G.W.W. In the first incident you have five thousand and in the second four thousand. Does five suggest the possibility of weakness, and four that which cannot break down?
J.T. No doubt, and that which is universal too.
{371}
THE ASSEMBLY IN RELATION TO DIVINE ADMINISTRATION (3)
@Matthew 16
J.T. We have noted in chapter 13 how the Lord took up the position of sitting when He spoke the parable of the sower, suggestive, I think, of the deliberation with which the testimony was rendered at the beginning; then in chapter 14 how He carried on His administration. Chapter 13 brings in the multitude, and in that connection we referred to the Song of Solomon, in which it is said, "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon", (@Song of Songs 8:11) signifying "master of a multitude". Chapters 14, 15 and 16 show how He regulates the multitude, with a view to the saints being here in the assembly. It was pointed out that the administration in chapter 14 stands connected with the ministry of the apostles, the number *twelve* appearing there, and that the administration in chapter 15 is rather connected with the Holy Spirit, so we get *seven* full baskets of fragments.
E.J.McB. I thought what helped us greatly this morning was the importance that you attached to the position of the Lord at the beginning of chapter 13; the quiet spirit of deliberation in regard to the sowing. Also, I thought we had a great deal of help in regard of the conditions favourable to feeding, getting the multitude into a restful condition.
J.T. They were made by the Lord to recline on the grass.
E.J.McB. What is the main thought in your mind in this chapter?
J.T. We arrive formally and definitely at the assembly here as that which had been in the Lord's mind in all this instruction, He calls it here "my assembly", and in chapter 18 "the assembly".
{372}
In chapter 18 He assumed that it should be a court of appeal as we speak, one could appeal to it as having authority from Him, but here it is "*my* assembly".
R.W.G. This is the first mention of the assembly in the New Testament. Why does it come out first in the gospel of Matthew, and only there?
J.T. Because Matthew has administration in view in his gospel. It was pointed out this morning that the Lord being presented by Matthew as Son of David and Son of Abraham had in view that He was to be the great Administrator for God.
R.W.G. It is remarkable that it is in what we would call a Jewish gospel that the assembly appears first.
J.T. Yes, it is to show that the Jewish system is formally superseded by the assembly.
R.D. What was in your mind in pointing out that He says "my assembly" in this chapter?
J.T. It is that which He will have to the end; it does not break down.
R.D. You mean it is not the public thing here so much as what is His own building, and vital?
J.T. Yes, what is spiritual; *He has* that. The addresses to the assemblies in Revelation show that He has not the public thing; it has given way.
E.J.McB. This would be the answer to His giving thanks to the Father.
J.T. I think so, The Father operated here; He had already revealed certain things to babes, but what these things were is not specified; here the revelation is formally declared.
E.N.H. Does "my assembly" bring in the thought of what the Father gives Him as a recompense for His loss of Israel, for the joy of His own heart?
J.T. No doubt, if you take up the type of Rebecca, but it is presented here as "my assembly", and "the gates of hell shall not prevail against it"; so that it is from the side of His own work or building.
{373}
E.M. Why does He ask His disciples saying, "Whom say ye that I am"?
J.T. In order to bring out this. It was important if He were going to build, that it should be brought out in this way what the Father had done. He was about to announce the great fact that He was going to build, but He would bring to light first where the foundation was. The foundation was the Father's work. The Father had already revealed things to babes, but it does not say what the things were; no doubt they were things that He had already spoken of in His public ministry; but the revelation made to Peter is not exactly what the Lord had spoken of to them.
R.D. So that He takes account of something that is now in Peter's soul.
J.T. That is right, and the putting of this question brought that out.
E.M. Would it be going too far to say that it brought out what the Father had effected.
J.T. It would lead to deep searching of heart as to what apprehension each one had of Christ.
Rem. They would if they were believers, apprehend that He was the Messiah.
J.T. There was much to indicate that He was that, of course, but He was about to bring out what the Father had effected.
J.V. Is "my assembly" in contrast to "the assembly"?
J.T. I think in chapter 18 it stands in contrast to the Jewish Sanhedrim. Here the Lord never had anything, Messiah was cut off and had nothing; His rights as Son of David and Son of Abraham were not coming to Him for the moment, hence there is this thing that He Himself would build, the foundation of which originated with the Father. It takes us back to chapter 11, in which He speaks of the Father revealing. In that chapter He says the Father had
{374}
revealed these things unto babes, but they were there for the wise and prudent, because they referred to all. But this referred to what the Father would do; it was therefore a wholly new thing, something that the Lord Himself has, His peculiar portion.
R.W.G. How does verse 18 come in? He adds, "And I also, I say unto thee". The Father's work was manifestly there, and then He adds, "I *also* I say unto thee".
R.D. Is it that the Father laid the foundation, and now the Lord is going to build on the foundation?
J.T. The "also" means something additional to what the Father had done. The Father had revealed to Peter that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God and now the Lord says, as it were, 'What *I* say is Thou art Peter'. It is His own assembly, it is His part. "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" (@John 5:17) fits in here.
E.N.H. Does the name given to Peter indicate the material of which the structure is built?
J.T. Quite. It does not say, 'Thy *name* is Peter', but "*Thou* art Peter".
H.H. What is the material that Christ builds with?
J.T. That which is the result of the revelation; what a believer is in the light and apprehension of the Lord as "the Christ, the Son of the living God". One who apprehends Him in that way is not going to turn to man to do anything, nor is he going to rely on what decays, and perishes, and disappears. He relies on what is living.
S.L. It was Peter's apprehension of Christ as Son of the living God that constituted the foundation on which the structure rested.
J.T. The Christ, the Son of the living God is the foundation or the rock, but it is a subjective idea; Christ as apprehended in the souls of the saints. Chapter 14:33 testifies to the fact that He
{375}
was already known objectively as Son of God by His works.
R.D. So that it is important to see that it is the Father's doing; it is a subjective work.
J.T. We have to apprehend that *in which* the foundation is laid, and the foundation itself. The revelation to Peter laid the foundation, so that it was the Father's doing. The Lord had already been recognised as the Son of God according to chapter 14, so that it is not what came out in His ministry that is in view, but the revelation of the Father made to Peter's soul.
J.M. It is what is wholly new. Is it not important for us to have the truth of the assembly in this way in our souls, for it is of Christ's building?
J.T. "My assembly" remains; it is what is His own.
Rem. There is a building *in* and a building *up*.
J.T. He gives a name to Peter's confession, and He gives a name to Peter because he made it; then the confession itself is called the foundation or rock.
Ques. I suppose you would not say there was much building in Peter's case?
J.T. The thing did not take form in a concrete way until the Holy Spirit came down.
E.M. In the working out, would it not involve quickening?
T.M.G. "To whom coming, as unto a living stone". (@1 Peter 2:4).
J.T. The fact that we come shows that there is life; there is power to move.
H.H. That raises an interesting question; it links it up with Peter's epistle; perhaps you would say a word on that.
J.T. The epistle shows that the saints, as desiring the pure mental milk of the word, grow up to salvation. The epistle supposes growth in us, that we become free of all worldly influences. "If so be ye have
{376}
tasted that the Lord is gracious". (@1 Peter 2:3). You apprehend Him outside the present order of things, and join Him there.
H.H. That is rather analogous to the previous chapters that we have been considering a little.
J.T. The teaching of the previous chapters shows how a believer is led on to be clear of the world. In this chapter it says of the Lord that "he left them and departed". Evidently there was a distinct move there, and a break, but the weakness of the disciples, as ever, comes into evidence, they had forgotten something; there were the discrepancies that marked failure, and it led to confusion in their minds as to what He was saying.
H.H.. What is the thought of having forgotten to take bread?
J.T. I suppose they themselves were the bread, and it was a question of their being unleavened. The figure of bread, as we get it in @1 Corinthians 5, enabled the Lord to speak of what we are so exposed to.
R.D. How is that a hindrance to our apprehending the new thing?
J.T. Leaven is such an insidious thing. The Lord introducing it here would mean that the saints would always be exposed to that hindrance to entering into the truth of the assembly. Leaven is a terrible thing, whatever form it may take; it tends to inflation. Inflation is a sure hindrance to the working out of the truth of the assembly. Our section in this gospel begins with this; "I am meek and lowly in heart".
Rem. The Corinthians were puffed up?
J.T. Yes; leaven comes in in so many ways. Here He speaks only of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
W.K. It is important to get a general idea of what leaven is.
{377}
J.T. The leaven of Herod would be political, that of the Pharisees religious pretension; the leaven of the Sadducees is more the mind of man working in the things of God.
G.W.W. Do you think there was an advance as Peter moved on in his soul, from the thought of Cephas, the name the Lord gave him in the first of John, to the name Peter that He now gives him? He was there presented to Peter as Messiah; now that was over, and He was taking another position outside of all that, and Peter had to move in his soul. Is not that the move that really saves one from this leaven?
J.T. I think that the way leaven is introduced here and in @1 Corinthians 5 helps us to apprehend how it works to interfere with the truth of the assembly. You cannot have the assembly developed where there is leaven, whatever kind of leaven it may be. Christ our passover, coupled with the unleavened bread, indicates how the saints are to be held free of leaven.
G.W.W. To apprehend Christ as the Son of the living God and in the new position which He has taken, must keep the soul free of inflation.
E.J.McB. You could not very well inflate a stone.
J.T. We have to bind on humility. Peter says, *bind* it on; it brings us into correspondence with Christ. Paul speaks of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, so that leaven would mean insincerity and falsehood, hence the importance of being sincere and true in our relations one with another.
R.B. In regard to the confession, the Lord recognised in Peter that which the Father had wrought, which was akin to Himself, and it was in connection with that that He said, "Upon this rock I will build my assembly".
J.T. The confession rendered Peter a stone.
{378}
The coming of the Holy Spirit consequent upon redemption made Peter that in a practical way.
G.W.W. Do you think that in effect what it comes to is that the revelation of the Father laid the foundation, but that Peter had to take account of himself as being of the order of Christ? Is not that important when He says, "I also, I say unto thee, thou art Peter"? It is as if the Lord said, 'You have to take account of yourself as being of My order'.
J.T. Quite.
S.L. There is a difficulty in some minds, namely, as to whether Peter's apprehension produces the rock. Peter had to apprehend, as I understand it, that he was of the order of Christ.
J.T. Well, he had to apprehend both things. What the Lord said was intended to enlighten Peter; he had to apprehend the Rock, and what he himself was as well. "This" refers to the confession. It is what Peter confessed; it is not what the Lord had set out in His ministry.
S.L. It is what Peter confessed, not his confession. It was Peter's apprehension of Christ that indicated that he was of the same order as Christ.
J.T. There are two things in the Lord's words: "Thou art Peter", that is what *he* was because of the confession, but then He says further, "And on this rock": that is *what he had confessed*. I think we have to distinguish, to take account of the Rock by itself. The Rock is not a creation or a work. It is Christ Himself, but as apprehended by the Father's revelation in Peter. Peter's confession proves a work of God in him.
E.J.McB. Then you would agree with the statement that if you want to look at the Rock in its generic force, you think of Christ personally?
J.T. Quite right. It is the truth of Christ's Person come in *that way*. The truth of His Person
{379}
revealed by the Father, and the confession consequent upon that makes Peter a stone.
S.L. I have no difficulty about that; that covers the ground and I quite accept it.
J.T. Therefore the Lord names him first, then you have the Rock on which the material is to be erected; but then the confession itself does not refer to Peter, but to Christ; therefore the Rock is *what he confessed*.
E.J.McB. A little earlier in the meeting you made a statement as to the difference between the foundation and the Father's work with Peter in relation to the foundation.
J.T. That has to be distinguished.
J.M. So that his confession indicates that he knows Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, as a new Centre outside of this world altogether.
J.T. That is right. Now there is the material. Peter is the material.
J.M. This was the Father's revelation to Peter.
S.McC. The Christ the Son of the living God is the foundation.
J.T. It is the foundation, because it has come in in that way; that is, by the Father's revelation. For us the foundation is already laid; that is the principle of it, and each Christian has to come into the light of it. Peter's confession is light; it is for you and for me, and as we come into it, we are of the same material as Peter. "The Christ, the Son of the living God", is the foundation; He has come in in that way. These things refer to Israel too, but there is no such structure in Israel as this, nevertheless Nathanael confessed the Lord as Son of God, he said, "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God", and he represented the Jews. That was a confession too, but there was no intimation that anything should be built on it. Here it is not only what came out in
{380}
Christ's ministry, but what came out in this special way so as to make room for Christ's building.
R.W.G. Would it be right to connect @1 Corinthians 3 with this? The apostle had laid the foundation, and every man was to take heed how he built thereon.
J.T. This is the *Father's* doing. What Paul laid at Corinth had reference to the public thing; it does not say, 'Other foundation can no man lay than Christ the Son of the living God' but "than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (verse 11); the order of man that the gospels present is in new. It was to set aside the order of man they were glorying in at Corinth. Paul says, "I have laid the foundation", and no doubt refers to the result of his work, and ministry in Corinth.
E.M. Would you say that when the Lord says, "Blessed art thou Simon Bar-jona", it shows the value He set on what He saw there?
J.T. Surely; there is nothing like this anywhere else. Paul's work is not this; his work refers to the public structure on which others might build, and build bad material, too, alas!
R.W.G. This then is the sovereign side, and the other the responsible side.
T.M.G. What *Paul* built in was in the *souls* of the Corinthians, however.
Ques. Do you distinguish between the foundation and what is laid on it? What is laid on it is akin to the rock.
J.T. The Rock is the Son of God, a divine Person in manhood.
E.J.McB. I think the point is important because the question was raised, and one had to face it, as to the Rock being the totality of the work of God in the saints. It raised a difficulty in one's mind, as one could not quite adjust it in connection with this chapter.
G.W.W. Did the confession indicate that Peter
{381}
was the right material, or did it make him the material?
J.T. The revelation and confession go together; the latter proved that Peter was a stone, but it is a feature of the stone. The apprehension and confession of the wonderful fact that the Man before him was "the Christ, the Son of the living God" made him a stone; he was illuminated by the revelation. When he became true to his confession, what kind of a man was he? He was entirely free from this world. See him preaching in the Acts; he is entirely free; he says to the man at the gate of the temple, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee ... rise up and walk". (@Acts 3:6). In his soul he had no dependence on anything save on Christ. The whole fabric of Christendom is a negation of this. The idea of *Peter* as a stone, is the negation of the whole religious world around us, it is all a denial of what Peter represents. The important point for us is to keep to this and thus we prove ourselves to be living stones.
Ques. What is the difference between this and the treasure we have in earthen vessels? (@2 Corinthians 4).
J.T. There the apostle was referring to the ministry he had received. The foundation refers necessarily to the apprehension Peter had of the Lord; otherwise the peculiarity of this passage would be unintelligible. Think of the change it made in Peter! Even as a believing man he would have Jewish hopes, whereas when he came into the good of this fully, he would relinquish all these and make everything of what is involved in the revelation made to him of the Father.
Rem. Nothing could overthrow that.
J.T. Nothing. So that if we are not already on that line in our souls, we should be exercised to come to it.
{382}
J.M. A soul that knows Christ in this way will not turn to man or things here.
J.T. "The Christ" *does* everything, so we would look to Him for everything; then being "the Son of the living God", He is incorruptible, He surmounts death. I think that is what we arrive at when we come into the good of these things.
E.M. His assembly is viewed here as answering entirely to Him; the gates of hell cannot prevail against it.
J.T. When we reach this we desire to hold ourselves as available for Christ. If I speak about the assembly, what am I thinking about? I am thinking about the saints; then am I available to Christ as of His assembly?
G.W.W. The mere fact of Christ being such as He is here said to be is one thing, the apprehension of Him in that way in the soul is another; the latter could not be without an effect being produced in the soul. It involves a work in the soul.
R.D. One should be exercised about having the Lord in this way before our eyes and hearts. It is the greatness of the Builder we should have before us here.
J.T. If we are to stand for the Lord, that is the thing to aim at. The question is: Am I a *Peter*? Am I in accord with Christ as confessed here?
R.D. We could not speak of the assembly in this way as a structure against which the gates of hades could not prevail unless in the light of the Builder.
J.McG. In God's sight every true believer belongs to this.
J.T. Yes, everyone who has the Spirit, only there is the thought of *coming* to Christ as the Living Stone. Christ does everything for God, and for us, and being the Son of the living God, what He does cannot be affected by death. The question is, Am
{383}
I in the apprehension of this revelation? If I am, I move. I cannot settle here in connection with anything that man does, I want to be in that which subsists beyond death. "To whom coming, as unto a living stone ... ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house". (@1 Peter 2:4,5). We have to take it as it stands in Scripture.
P.S.P. It is an evidence of the Father's work in the soul today when one comes to the apprehension of Christ as the Son of the living God?
J.T. The revelation has already been made; once revealed, it remains for all; we come into the light of it, and this latter would be the work of the Spirit now. On the day of Pentecost, Peter was in spiritual power, he had gone through exercise in connection with his denying the Lord, and had come to the end of the flesh. I think that in order to apprehend what Peter signifies, we have to *study the history of Peter*.
J.P.G. I suppose that Peter leaving the ship in @Matthew 14 illustrates his joining the Lord.
J.T. I think there is an indication there that he was a stone. He broke down in it, but he had a certain faith that enabled him to step out and join the Lord.
Ques. "All of one". Is that on this line?
J.T. In a way, I think. It is the generic idea; they all come from the one stock.
T.M.G. Peter speaks of all flesh being as grass. Peter came to that himself.
J.T. Yes he did. The matter is a very serious one because it is a question of whether I am relying on anything that man can do or be, or resting on anything that death can touch. We have to move away from our moorings to come to Christ's assembly. If we are not here entirely for Christ, we are not in the good of His assembly.
{384}
Ques. Is the building what Christ builds in the soul?
J.T. *You* are the stone; it is not something in you, it is *yourself*.
R.D. Is there not a very great dignity belonging to this assembly, Christ's assembly?
J.T. It is marvellous to think that we belong to that which is invulnerable; Satan cannot touch it, nor can death. But how can that be true if I am moored to natural things, or rest in what man may be or can do?
R.D. Is the thought that Christ's wisdom is to reside there for administration, the assembly being for counsel and deliberation?
J.T. I think so; it is that in which counsel is taken. The assembly is for counsel; deliberation and resource mark it.
G.W.W. One fears whether we are quite clear in our souls as to Christ having taken a definite position outside of flesh and blood, and while we have to move in a flesh and blood condition of things, yet all these things lie outside that region altogether.
J.T. That is what I have been saying. One has to move away from all natural moorings.
Ques. I wanted to ask in connection with the word of Peter, "to whom coming"; is not that to be characteristic?
J.T. You mean that one is marked by that. Yes, it is not something done once for all like conversion; it is not "having come", but "to whom coming".
{385}
THE ASSEMBLY IN RELATION TO DIVINE ADMINISTRATION (4)
@Matthew 17
Ques. Would you outline for us what you have before you in connection with this chapter?
J.T. It brings in the heavenly side; not only the testimony of Peter, that Christ was the Son of the living God, but that those who are to take the lead, in a way, are to be in the light of heaven; so the Lord takes these three men, Peter, James, and John, up into a mountain, and was transfigured before them. What took place was for *them*. "His face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light".
R.D. Was it that they might see the glory of the Administrator?
J.T. I think so. The reference to the sun takes us back to the first of Genesis. The sun was to rule the day; here the Lord's face shines as the sun; we are reminded that the rule is to be beneficent. The rule exercised through the assembly is to be a benign rule, to be seen in those who are formed according to heaven, for this is really a heavenly scene.
E.N.H. I suppose the glory of His transfiguration was so great that it excluded every other man; even Moses and Elias, so that we read, "they saw no man save *Jesus only*".
J.T. Yes.
R.D. You mean that the reference to the sun suggests the bringing in of light and blessing into the universe?
J.T. It would be the reflection of all that God is; the glory of God shining in the face of Jesus Christ. Here it is seen because of what is in view in this gospel; that is, ruling.
{386}
E.M. Would you say that what is spoken of in chapter 16 entails this outshining?
J.T. The chapters are all educational. The three disciples who were taken up to the mount were permitted to see His glory in order that it might stamp their ministry afterwards, and that the whole assembly should get the good of what they had seen. Peter says, "but were eye-witnesses of his majesty". (@2 Peter 1:16). Their ministry was all to be coloured by this wonderful vision; after the Holy Spirit came, He would bring them into accord with it.
E.J.McB. The three men rather suggest two ideas; the thought that we have been having, and what is heavenly. Peter suggests the stone, and James and John the brethren. "The brethren" is a heavenly idea.
J.T. In @Mark 9:8, what is said after the vision was past is "Jesus only with themselves". That is the way in which Christianity began and it should continue so; Jesus only with themselves. Here it is "Jesus only"; the Lord Himself as the One who alone is to be heard is specially before us.
Ques. Is this in connection with the previous chapter, the Son of man coming in His kingdom?
J.T. That is what it refers to. "There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom". (@Matthew 16:28).
G.N. Would you say you get the sun in this chapter and the moon in the next?
J.T. Yes, that is right. Chapter 18 is the assembly as reflective of what is seen in Christ in this chapter. We have the two great luminaries referred to in @Genesis 1.
J.M. It is educational for us at the present moment, in view of the day of manifestation?
J.T. Yes, and in view of the function of the assembly now, as seen in chapter 18. If we are in the light of Christ, we reflect His light as the moon
{387}
reflects the light of the sun. Christ is hidden for the moment, but as the Sun of righteousness He is about to appear with healing in His wings, but His saints are already in the light of the Sun, hence the light they have. @Matthew 18 should be read with @Proverbs 31; it is what the assembly is in the absence of her husband. "Tell it to the assembly" the Lord says; that is, the authority for the moment. If the Lord were here, it would be told to Him. This chapter 17 is to qualify them by their seeing His glory. It is not simply that He was transfigured as a fact, but He was transfigured *before them*; that was the point.
R.W.G. What is the thought of Moses and Elias being in company with the Lord on the mount, and that they were known as Moses and Elias?
J.T. They represented the witness of the Old Testament; "the law and the prophets".
R.W.G. Is it the thought of the authority of a past dispensation, but now all is vested in this Person?
J.T. Yes. Moses represents the authority of God, and Elijah was the testimony to God's faithfulness, calling the people back to that authority. Now they disappear and all is in the Son; there is not only authority, but the speaking; "hear him". Rule is by speaking rather than by the sword. Moses in @Exodus 17 was to take the symbol of his authority, his rod, and smite the rock, but in @Numbers 20 he made a mistake in smiting the rock; he should have *spoken* to it. So here, it is not the rod of authority but the *word* of Christ. "Hear him"; refers to Christianity. The regulation is by the word of Christ.
R.W.G. Moses and Elias have passed off the scene, and all is now vested in this One who is to effect everything for God?
J.T. Yes; so *He* is to be heard.
{388}
E.N.H. I suppose Moses was quite content to withdraw. He himself had said, "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you ... like unto me". (@Acts 3:22).
J.T. Yes. John the baptist's ministry was the termination of what these two men represented, and John disappeared in joy; he said, "this my joy therefore is fulfilled", (@John 3:29) because he had heard the bridegroom's voice. There is a connection between the bridegroom and the sun. The sun is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and as a strong man running a race, and there is a voice which is to be heard. Compare @Psalm 19.
J.S. Is this voice the voice of revelation?
J.T. Yes; primarily, but there is a present voice for the assembly, "he that hath an ear, let him hear". There is the Lord's authority in the messages to the assemblies, and then there is what the *Spirit* says.
H.H. I thought there was just a little connection between what we have been having about the master of assemblies and the angels of the assemblies.
J.T. Yes, I think so, only the angels are representative. The Lord speaks to the assemblies as being Himself in the position of Master of assemblies. There is *His* authority, also *what* the Spirit says. What the Spirit says has to be distinguished from what the Lord says.
W.K. Just another word as to the distinguishing?
J.T. Turn for a moment to @Revelation 1. In verse 11 the Lord speaks, and in verse 12 John turns when he hears the voice, "And I turned to see the voice that spake with me". That is a remarkable expression, but evidently it was to see the Person who spoke; then it tells us what John saw; being turned, he saw Christ clothed with official garb, and he is seen as armed with judicial authority to enforce His rule in the assemblies. It is not one
{389}
speaking in love, ministering to the needs of the assemblies; but asserting His rights to rule, and showing that He has power to enforce the rule. "Out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword". (@Revelation 1:16). That refers to what He *says*. Then in chapter 2:1 John is told, "To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write". The One who has authority and supports the public assembly, the seven stars now speaks, and after He says what He has to say, the word is, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". (verse 7). The Spirit brings in another thought.
R.B. How do you distinguish between what the Lord says and the Spirit's voice to the assembly?
J.T. The Lord's word is according to His authority; from time to time He asserts it; things occur which bring out that it has been set aside and He reasserts it. He gives the saints to understand that they have disregarded His rights, but what the Spirit says involves what He ministers to the saints. The Spirit speaks to our hearts of Christ.
R.D. The Lord's word in the main calls attention to the conditions, and the Spirit's word would be a present ministry to meet the exercises that such a word would produce.
J.T. I think so. The Lord in what He has to say speaks with the utmost discrimination as to what is to be commended and what is to be condemned; it is a judicial message; He judges the thing with the most accurate discrimination. All that is creditable is mentioned first, but then all that is discreditable is also given, so that there might be a true conception of the conditions as the Lord sees them and His judgment about them. Then there is the voice of the Spirit which is continuous.
Rem. All that refers to the present moment.
W.K. It is the present tense, what the Spirit *says*.
{390}.
R.D. It is said in Timothy: "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly". (@1 Timothy 4:1).
E.J.McB. The overcomer is the consequence of the Spirit's voice in the first three assemblies.
J.V. In @John 16:13 the Lord says of the Spirit, "whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak".
J.T. The Spirit, being here, has His own voice, and He ministers to the saints. In the addresses to the assemblies, the appeal to hear the voice of the Spirit in the last four assemblies is given after the reference to the overcomer; in the first three, it is different; see chapter 2, verses 7, 11, 17; but when you come to Thyatira you have the overcomer mentioned in verse 26, and verse 29 says, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". It is now supposed that there is no ear save as overcoming first. Apostasy had set in in Thyatira, and from that point onward there must be overcoming, otherwise there is no recognition of the Spirit. In the public body things are hopeless.
H.H. We have not the Ephesian phase of the assembly now in a public way. When the case of the assembly is hopeless in Thyatira, the Lord says to the overcomer, "I will give him the morning star". There is recovery to the Lord, and, as you were saying, the order is changed.
J.T. The principle of *speaking* marks this dispensation, so in regard to the assembly, "If he will not *listen* to the assembly"; it is what the assembly says; authority is in the speaking; it is not a sword. By and by the Lord will rule the nations with a rod of iron, but now rule is to be exercised through speaking. When the assembly has to deal with one who is obdurate there is an appeal, every possible effort is employed to reach the man through speaking; even when it is said, "them that sin rebuke before all". (@1 Timothy 5:20). The point is to convict before all; that is, to bring the facts to bear that would convict of the sin.
{391}
R.D. For power to do that we must be hearing Him?
J.T. That is the point; we have to listen to Christ. If Moses and Elias are to be referred to, it must be through Christ. So in @Luke 24:27, "Beginning at Moses and all the prophets ... he expounded the things concerning himself".
J.M. You mean that the Old Testament can now be read in the full light of Christ, and it is not, in this sense, to be connected with the legal system, nor does it make souls legal.
J.T. Yes; we must begin with Christ, then it loses all its legal features and becomes spiritual, for the Lord is the Spirit of it. The spirituality is in the way the Scriptures are brought in by the Spirit; hence Paul says "Every scripture is divinely inspired", (@2 Timothy 3:16) but the Lord gives us the understanding of it.
Rem. In the feeding of the multitudes, the Lord brake the loaves and gave them to the disciples and the disciples to the multitude.
J.T. Yes, that is what we get in the synoptic gospels, but in John it is not so; see @John 6:11 (New Translation). It was Jesus who distributed to those who were set down, showing that a time was in view when they would look *directly* to Christ; the food would come directly from the Lord's hands.
T.M.G. In @Matthew 5:22, the Lord says, in contrast to what Moses says, "But *I* say unto you".
J.T. Yes; then He says, "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled". (verse 18). All is fulfilled through Him.
R.B. Had not the apostles a peculiar place? The apostle John says, "he that knoweth God heareth us". (@1 John 4:6).
J.T. Yes; they represented the Lord's authority. Peter in @Acts 2:14 stands up "with the eleven", calling attention to the fact that these were specially delegated
{392}
to speak on behalf of Christ. "Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life". (@Acts 5:20).
J.McM. Would the result of hearing Him be that everything is done His way?
J.T. The point in this chapter is to prepare them for that, so that they might learn how to do things. In @Matthew 18:21,22 Peter says, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? till seven times?" The Lord says, "until seventy times seven". That is the principle on which things are to be done while the Lord is absent.
H.H. Is your thought, that in this chapter the assembly has a kingdom setting?
J.T. Yes, but I wish we could get the thought of the *heavenly*; this wonderful vision was special, and it is what is special that gives character to what is general.
R.D. Have you anything to say about the garments here? I wondered if it had to do with what He was officially in administration.
J.T. I suppose it had. Garments are usually symbolical of surrounding circumstances; this whiteness marks the beginning of Acts. The oil descended to the skirts of the priest's garments; the garments would be the saints as they were seen at Pentecost; the purity that marked the Lord shone there. In writing to Philadelphia it is the same thing; He is the Holy and the True.
R.D. So that what we see in the Lord in the gospels comes out characteristically in the saints who have part with Him in this administration. He associated Peter with Himself in the end of the chapter, in saying, "Lest *we* should offend".
J .T. He brings Peter into associations as one of the "sons".
R.B. How do you carry the thought of the garment as having reference to circumstances?
{393}
J.T. Jude says, "hating even the garment spotted by the flesh"; (@Jude 23) if there is even a spot of the flesh on it, it is to be hated.
R.D. Speaking practically, one could not take part in the working out of chapter 18 unless one's garments were in correspondence.
J.McG. It has a bearing on our walk and ways.
J.T. Here His garments became white as the light. There was no disparity between what shone in His countenance and His garments. If we are to have moral authority, we must correspond with what is presented here.
E.N.H. Is it like Hebrews, where you get the speaking from heaven?
J.T. Yes.
G.N. The garments He wears in @Revelation 1 are suited to the conditions to which He has to say.
J.T. Yes, but the garments here had reference to what He was about to bring in as we see at Pentecost. What He set up then was in accord with Himself; what is presented in @Acts 2; that is the saints as seen there, corresponds with this scene.
G.W.W. What you are saying really runs through the Old Testament scriptures. Wherever there was a change of circumstances, there was always a change of garments. Joseph, when he came out of prison, changed his garments.
J.T. Yes; so with Joshua the high priest; "Take the filthy garments from off him". (@Zechariah 3:4)
G.W.W. Circumstances were changed, and that necessitated a change of garments.
J.T. So that it is a great thing to have suitable garments; in fact, you have in Scripture the idea of a wardrobe. Huldah, the prophetess, was keeper of the wardrobe. You cannot get your coat anywhere; a goodly Babylonish garment will not do.
R.B. When the disciples were sent out, they were not to have more than one coat.
{394}
G.W.W. Is it not therefore important that we should see to it that we have changed our garments in accordance with the present way in which Christ is presented?
J.T. I think we have to be in accord with Christ in His judicial attitude in regard of the conditions that exist around us.
G.W.W. Yes, in Revelation we have to apprehend the changed position which He takes, and adjust ourselves accordingly.
J.T. Romans brings us into accord with the light; the putting on of the armour of light is protective. The reference to the garments in the transfiguration scene has a voice to us. "His raiment was white as the light". "If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another". (@1 John 1:7).
Rem. "Put on therefore, as the elect of God". (@Colossians 3:12). You have there the idea of putting on.
E.N.H. The garments of course take in the way we present ourselves: "be clothed with humility". (@1 Peter 5:5).
E.J.McB. What was in your mind when you drew attention to the importance of getting this heavenly vision? Am I right in thinking that the import of the close of chapter 11 governs the situation in a way up to chapter 16? Now I am to get the import of Christ with His face shining as the sun.
J.T. It is no longer what He was here on earth; this chapter supposes what He is up there, and that is to give heavenly colour to all else. If we are to come out properly as in accord with @Matthew 18 and 1 Corinthians, we must have Ephesians. We do not eliminate Ephesians for that is the heavenly side which lends colour to everything.
E.J.McB. That is what I wanted to get at, that we might get the benefit of what these three got. The voice would cause us to rise from among those who are sleeping and to get the benefit of the shining.
{395}
J.T. This would correspond with the royal priesthood, showing forth the praises of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvellous light. This is the "marvellous light". (@1 Peter 2:9).
J.M. They are king's sons too, at the end of the chapter?
J.T. Quite. The end of the chapter greatly helps us to understand the beginning of it. The Lord had in His mind that Peter should know that he was one of the sons.
S.L. You made reference to Ephesian truth. I would like to hear a little more in that connection.
J.T. It is what the saints are "in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus", (@Ephesians 2:6) and is in view of display in the ages to come, in view of public shining in the future. So the end of the third chapter is a doxology; it is an outburst of worship on the part of the writer; "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age". (@Ephesians 3:21) That is the shining then; but what is to be now? @Ephesians 4, 5 and 6 have in view the shining here now, hence that section begins, "Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness ... endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace". (@Ephesians 4:1 - 3). We are called back to the end of @Matthew 11, to our model. "I am meek and lowly in heart", (@Matthew 11:29) but we take up that position as in the light of the heavenly calling.
T.M.G. What it comes to is that we should be marked by the spirit of Christ.
E.N.H. I suppose we should come out as being imitators of God, as dear children.
J.T. Ephesians and Corinthians go together. I think Romans and Corinthians go together as regards God's ways down here, but Ephesians is a special thing; we come out in what we may have to do in the assembly in a heavenly way here.
G.W.W. If we attempt to go through from
{396}
Romans to Corinthians without the exercise of Ephesians, we cannot carry out the directions in the dignity and grace that become them.
J.T. If we rightly understood the magnitude of the assembly's position here for God, we should understand the necessity for Ephesians. Divine principles were to be maintained in a company of men and women in a given locality in the Spirit and grace of Christ, and that in spite of all opposition and contrariety that might exist. If an angel, for instance, were seen in the most adverse circumstances, he would never lose his temper; he would maintain his balance; the heavenly would shine there. We are to be spiritual whatever happens; we have to be exercised to carry ourselves in heavenly demeanour at all times; when tested we are to be like Christ.
S.L. Peter, walking on the water, desired to get near the Lord, and he got the support of the Lord.
J.T. Just so. In dealing with things in the assembly you seek to be in the dignity that marks a heavenly man. I think Stephen is a typical Christian. Paul as a minister stands out, but I think that Stephen is designedly presented as a typical Christian; some one has remarked that he was stoned because Christ was seen in him. He was like Christ; his face shone as the face of an angel when he stood before the council; that is the idea. An angel represents what is heavenly, and if the spirit of Stephen is continued, we should not have any contention; things would be carried on in a heavenly way; there is moral weight in the newness and power in which things are done, so that the saints are preserved. We go by precedent in a general way, but every emergency calls for fresh exercises, and the Lord gives a new thought as to how to meet things. The heavenly man is never baffled. I am sure Ephesians is the special book for us, but I fear that as a study of the heavenly colour it is neglected.
{397}
G.W.W. At the close of the epistle to the Romans Paul refers to the mystery; that was the way they had to come.
R.D. You were speaking about being equal to any contingency that arises; the two instances that follow in our chapter show that the disciples were not equal to the occasion.
J.T. So the instruction which the Lord gives helps greatly: "this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting". Then the other instruction is that the *sons* are "free". We are reminded of the necessity for prayer and fasting; they become a heavenly man; the Lord was marked by prayer; then we are reminded of our calling.
R.D. Peter's answer indicated that he had not laid hold of that.
J.T. The Lord says, "Take the first fish that comes up". Leave things to the Lord; take the *first* one; do not use your own judgment, but act according to His instructions; that gives Him His place; you recognise Him. You will find what you need; a piece of money, "When thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money".
G.W.W. Have you any thought as to why the fish comes in?
J.T. It indicates the Lord's right over the fish of the sea. What do you think?
G.W.W. It is in connection with the temple. I wondered whether the Lord would bring up from the vast sea of the nations the resources for the effectuating of His purpose, and He indicates this to Peter.
J.T. I think so. The Son of man is put over the fish of the sea; (@Psalm 8). It is really a vision of the Son of man coming into His kingdom; the nations are available to Him.
G.W.W. It would have been just as easy for the Lord to say to Peter, 'Under the first stone that
{398}
you come to you will find a piece of money'; but the fish of the sea has a special significance.
H.H. One who commands the fish of the sea ought certainly not to be under tribute.
J.T. The sons are to accept that outward conditions remain unaltered. We do not want to alter them; the point is to know how to act for God in them; so the Lord says, "Lest we should offend them"; that is important, they were to avoid being an offence.
R.D. That is to say, with the light of sonship in our hearts, we accept the present conditions and limitations, lest we should offend.
J .T. I think we should be sufficiently dignified spiritually to do that.
R.B. Would you say in connection with meeting contingencies that might arise, that we take the first that the Lord gives?
J.T. Well, it would imply that you do not discriminate, you are acting under His word. The Lord knew that Peter was accustomed to fishing; He did not tell him how to do it. It helps us at the present time; we do not exercise choice, we take what the Lord gives as available. The *hook* may mean that we have our part to fulfil according to His word, but it is the Lord's doing; the situation is met by Him.
E.N.H. The Lord might just as well have said, take the second fish; but the point was to do as He directed.
J.T. Yes.
H.H. Peter asked the Lord's permission to set up three tabernacles.
J.T. I think he had a very poor thought of Christ. Had he been instructed in Scripture, in the mind of God, he would have known that there was only *one* tabernacle -- the tabernacle made in the
{399}
wilderness, and that was for the Shekinah. Peter did not know what he said; he was ignorant.
E.N.H. How did they recognise Moses and Elias?
J.T. I do not know, but the fact is stated that they were recognised. Peter's speaking was ignorant speaking, and so, while he yet spake, a bright cloud overshadowed them. The cloud would remind Peter of the wilderness, only now it is a *bright* one instead of a thick cloud; this was, I suppose, because Christ had become Man.
E.N.H. Is that what you connect with their entering into the cloud?
R.W.G. Could you give us a little on the Father's voice? We are privileged to hear that voice. Would you connect it with the end of @Numbers 7? After the tribes are set in order Moses heard the voice of One speaking to him from off the mercy seat?
J.T. The voice here is really the Father's, speaking *about* the Son. At the end of @Numbers 7 the voice comes in where unity was established; God then communicated from off the mercy seat. This voice is from the cloud. I think it is a millennial scene; the Son of man coming in His kingdom. The heavenly and the earthly saints are both seen. @Numbers 7 is typically, *through* Christ, the mercy seat; here the voice is *about* Christ.
R.W.G. This is a privileged company, and it will be our privilege for ever to hear that voice.
J.T. No doubt.
R.B. You were speaking in your address about the administration being carried on by speaking. Not only the Spirit speaks and the Lord speaks, but *we* speak; the apostle says, "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God". (@1 Peter 4:11).
J.T. The point is to learn how to speak in a divine way, so that what is said carries authority with it, as of God.
{400}
R.D. Peter was not speaking as "oracles of God" here when he suggested three tabernacles; he went before the Lord here.
J.T. Yes. To go before the Lord is a serious matter. It says about Stephen, that "they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake". (@Acts 6:10).
J.S. Death and life are in the power of the tongue.
Ques. How would fasting apply now?
J.T. It is denying ourselves legitimate things. We can only do it according to the measure which God gives to us. We acquire the habit of fasting by spiritual power.
H.H. The disciples were not prepared for the voice from heaven, they fell on their faces and were greatly terrified. Peter does not say anything about that later on.
J.T. No, that had nothing to do with the ministry: "when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ". (@2 Peter 1:16).
H.H. How do you understand verse 20? "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place".
J.T. It was to remind the disciples that Judaism would disappear, to make room for the assembly.
{401}
THE ASSEMBLY IN RELATION TO DIVINE ADMINISTRATION (5)
@Matthew 18
J.T. For those who were not present this morning, it may be necessary to remark that we read chapter 17, from which we gathered that there is a special education needed in order that we should correspond with our being made partakers of the heavenly calling, so that we should come out here in the assembly after a heavenly fashion. The Lord selected three of His disciples, Peter, James, and John, and took them up into an high mountain, and was transfigured before them; His face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light, all to the end that they might be impressed with what He is as in the heavens. It was, in principle, ascension. We also saw, at the end of the chapter, that the Lord is pleased to associate us with Himself in our position here, saying to Peter, "that we may not be an offence unto them ... take that and give it to them for me and thee".
E.J.McB. Perhaps you would add a word as to the reference made to Ephesians; it would help.
J.T. It was thought that Ephesians corresponded with this, for that epistle presents what is special in view of bringing in the heavenly feature practically with us. It speaks about the blessings with which *we* are blessed, saying that they are in the heavenlies; that is special. This cannot be said of all the families who are blessed: it is said of us, and furthermore we are said to be raised up and seated in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus, so that we are fitted to come out here, not only in righteousness, but in heavenly lustre, and therefore, in taking part in the administration of the assembly, we are not to become affected by fleshly feeling. Stephen was spoken of as the
{402}
example of a heavenly man; his face shone and he was in that way like Christ in the midst of the most adverse circumstances. He maintained a right spirit; yea, the spirit of Christ marked him throughout, even having liberty to kneel down and pray, asking for forgiveness for those who stoned him. A wonderful model for us in a man of like passions to us. So it is well to have chapter 17 in view in order to understand the position in chapter 18, where the assembly is formally referred to as, so to say, a court of appeal. How essential that those who form it should be heavenly, for it is only in that way that the heavens rule now. In chapter 18 the assembly is brought in only in an incidental way; the subject is the kingdom, but the assembly is there to be appealed to.
R.B. Do you draw a distinction between "my assembly" in chapter 16, and "the assembly" here?
J.T. I think that "my assembly" refers to what is wholly spiritual; the saints are taken account of in the light of the work of God in them. Whilst we recognise the work of God in the saints, the stones that form the building refer to the saints themselves. Scripture takes account of us abstractly as identified wholly with the work of God in us, but it also takes account of us as we are in our mixed state, and having the flesh in us; it is in the latter sense that we are said to be "the assembly of God"; men and women are taken account of in it; it is what we are here before men; (@1 Corinthians 1: 2).
R.D. In that way you can speak of it as a court of appeal. "Tell it to the assembly".
J.T. Yes, but obviously chapter 16 is the inner, and gives its character to the outer. "My assembly" is what we are spiritually in relation to Christ; "*the* assembly" is what we are here before men. Scripture speaks of "the Jews the Gentiles and the
{403}
assembly of God", the latter being the aggregate of all the saints in any given city or place. @Matthew 18:17, refers to a local company. Scripture does not contemplate the whole assembly on earth acting in matters of discipline. @Matthew 16 refers not to a local company, but to the whole assembly, viewed as built by Christ of material wholly according to Himself.
E.M. Why does this chapter begin with a little child being brought forward?
J.T. Because the Lord is treating of the kingdom. He had been instructing them as to the heavenly side of things in chapter 17; then chapter 18 begins, "In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?" This furnishes the Lord with an opportunity of pointing out what the kingdom of the heavens really is as seen in the present time. We have in the previous chapter the Son of man coming in His kingdom; we have no thought of a little child *there*; the little child is in connection with what is *here* at the present time. He called a little child to *Him*, and then set it in the midst of them. The little child called to Him would be fitted to represent what the Lord had in His mind.
Ques. Would "the assembly" correspond with the body of Christ on earth at the present moment, and "my assembly" refer to the whole of the redeemed from Pentecost onwards?
J.T. The epistles to the Corinthians, generally and @Matthew 18, refer to the local company, "the assembly". @Colossians 1:18, would include all the saints from Pentecost; @1 Corinthians 12:28, and @1 Timothy 3:15, refer to what existed when these letters were written.
J.P.W. The spirit of the little child sets forth what is heavenly down here.
{404}
J.T. It forms the heavenly texture in one's demeanour. A little child is not self-assertive.
E.J.McB. It would correspond with "meek and lowly in heart". (@Matthew 11:29).
J.T. "As *this* little child"; it was *that* little child, the one whom Jesus had called to Him. I suppose it was a special one.
J.P.W. What is the difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens?
J.T. In this gospel it is almost invariably the kingdom of the heavens, referring, I judge, to @Genesis 1, and the book of Daniel, that "the heavens do rule". (@Daniel 4:26). The kingdom of God is the exercise of grace in power, and is connected with the Holy Spirit here: "If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you". (@Matthew 12:28). The kingdom of the heavens is the rule of Christ as in heaven.
J.M. Would it be the result of the education in the earlier chapters?
J.T. I think so; but we do well to occupy ourselves with the little child whom the Lord called to Him. He called it first and then set it in the midst, so that it would rightly represent His thought. The Lord knew the little child He called; He had others in His mind for He says, "Whosoever shall offend one of these little ones". You are not to offend them, or despise them, because "their angels do always behold the face of my Father".
E.J.McB. And He refers to "one such little child".
H.H. What is the force of "unless ye are converted"?
J.T. That is a general statement, assuming that men had turned away from God. First they had to be converted, and then to become as little children. Many are converted, but do not become as little children. It is very beautiful what follows; "whosoever
{405}
therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven".
E.J.McB. In Mark's gospel the Lord took up little children and put His hands upon them. He does not do that here.
R.D. We become like that little child through humbling ourselves. It is open to us, is it not?
J.T. Yes, in order to have an entrance into the kingdom of heaven.
E.M. And yet you say this is in view of administration?
J.T. The kingdom is in view here. We should always remember that the subject in @Matthew 18 is the kingdom. As in the kingdom you are a subject, and the instruction is for the subject; how you are to conduct yourself towards a fellow-subject, "thy brother".
H.H. You would bear in mind that the teaching of chapters 16 and 17 comes before this. It is the kingdom in the light of what has gone before.
J.T. Certainly. The heavenly man is to have the character of a little child. I have no doubt that the little child would represent one in the light of the previous chapters.
J.H.L. Would the child answer to one of those who heard Him?
J.T. The Lord calls the child to Him, and the little child comes; he is regulated by the Lord's word.
E.M. What might become an offence? Why is it so serious to offend a little one?
J.T. Because he is of such value in the eyes of the Lord.
Rem. Samuel was another child whom God called, and he heard Him.
G.W.W. Is your thought, that something morally analogous to this little child is to mark us if we are to take our place properly in the kingdom. There
{406}
has been a preparation and a call from the Lord, and we are to be found here marked by the spirit of a little child, taking our place in the midst of the saints.
J.T. I think so. The question is, can the Lord point to you or to me as a model?
G.W.W. I was wondering whether it is a model of the spirit that is to mark everyone of us before we reach the place that the assembly is to occupy.
J.T. Yes; it is brought about by the Lord bringing in a model, so that the saints learn what Christianity is in such an one. The apostle Paul speaks of himself in that way; he was pre-eminently a model for Christians.
R.D. It is remarkable how in Philippians 3:17 he is spoken of in that way; he is a man in the good of what is heavenly.
J.T. You will remember how Barnabas went to Tarsus to seek out Saul, and he brought him to Antioch. Paul was in Antioch for a year with Barnabas. He taught the assembly for a "whole year", (@Acts 11:26) and then it is added that the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch. The inference to my mind is perfectly clear; Christ was expressed in that man and the effect of his ministry there was that the saints were like Christ. In the next chapter it is said of him, "Saul, who also is called Paul" (@Acts 13:9); that is, little. He had no thought of himself; he was little in his own eyes, and he conveyed by that the true idea of Christianity; what the kingdom of God is. It is composed of those who accept littleness publicly, and are content in it.
J.H.L. What was said of the first one who was anointed king in Israel was, "When thou wast little in thine own sight". (@1 Samuel 15:17).
J.T. Yes, but he did not remain little.
R.D. He never had his name changed.
J.T. That is a very good remark; whereas Saul
{407}
of Tarsus had his name changed; so in appealing to others he says, "I myself, Paul, beseech you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ". (@2 Corinthians 10:1).
E.J.McB. Then your idea is that the Lord would have the model that He could call to Himself in this way?
J.T. I think that any movement on the part of the Lord among His people is marked by that, and brings out some who are descriptive of Him; not only in their teaching, but in their manner of life. It is in the manner of life that a man is seen, *what* he is.
H.H. The apostle says, "Thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life". (@2 Timothy 3:10). Timothy would suggest the model.
J.T. I think Timothy was timid to a fault, but he was Paul's child, so Paul sends him to the Corinthians, and says of him, "who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ", (@1 Corinthians 4:17). The letter would be supported by the spirit and ways of Paul, as seen in his child.
H.H. He is the suitable man for the last days.
J.T. A man who could come "with the brethren" (@1 Corinthians 16:11) not assuming to be special amongst them. The saints were to see that he should be amongst them without fear, because he worked the work of the Lord, even as the apostle did; not to the same extent, of course, but after the same manner.
Rem. When it says, "Saul, who also is called Paul", it adds that he was filled with the Holy Spirit; that is the first time that the change of name is mentioned. The opposer was "full of all subtilty" and Paul was full of the Holy Spirit. (@Acts 13:9,10).
E.N.H. Perhaps we get an *example* in the woman of @Luke 7:44, the Lord said to Simon, "Seest thou this woman?"
J.T. She appreciated Christ and is a model in that respect. Now when you come to the question
{408}
of trespass we are introduced into the jurisdiction of the court of appeal; that is what I think the Lord might help us on at this time; "Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee".
E.J.McB. Would you say a word on offending one of these little ones before going on to that.
J.T. I think it is in the way of setting a snare before him. Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe unto him by whom they come. The Lord is thinking of Christians, and how the world would in time influence and ensnare them. Offence is in the sense of a fall-trap being set, something that would occasion stumbling.
E.M. Stumbling so as to hinder movement toward God?
J.T. Yes, like Gideon's ephod in Ophrah, (@Judges 8:27). The same became a snare to the people, and a very great blemish in Gideon's history.
H.H. Were you going to say a word as to offending oneself?
J.T. The Lord turns to that in verses 9, 10. One has to watch that one does not allow one's hand or foot to offend oneself. Better be without hand or foot than not to enter into life. The hand would be work, and the foot would be walk; something we might allow that would in time turn us away. Others might turn us away, but one might do it oneself. Our foot might lead us into paths that would ultimately ensnare us.
R.D. Is it that we should be at liberty from every influence, to be available to the Lord? You were going to say something about the next part.
J.T. I was thinking of what leads us on to assembly discipline. I am speaking of how things worked at the outset, so that we might see how things should be *now*.
R.D. It is important to see that at the outset
{409}
there was assembly authority. Is it involved in that expression in @1 Corinthians 1:2, "the assembly of God at Corinth?"
J.T. I think it is. That expression implies that there was something at Corinth which would represent God. With this passage we can see how it stands in relation to the kingdom.
R.B. How does that work out now, telling it to the assembly?
J.T. We see clearly that it worked at the beginning, because there was a company formally designated as the assembly of God. Then we have to inquire whether we can carry it out literally today since there is no company that we can see and call the assembly of God. Hence as Christians we have to wait on the Lord to find out how to act in these altered circumstances. Therefore 2 Timothy comes into evidence as that which is given *subsequently* in view of the breakdown, in order to guide the saints.
S.L. Would you say that the assembly of God is as much in Belfast today as it was at Corinth, but that it cannot be taken account of?
J.T. It is not available in a concrete way.
Ques. What do you mean by available?
J.T. The aggregate of saints in Belfast never meet in one place; they never take counsel together, so we have to accept the ruin.
E.J.McB. If you could get the assembly of God in one place, its voice must be final.
J.T. That is what is said here.
G.N. Do you make any distinction between authority to act and power to act?
J.T. I think power is the ability to act, whilst authority is something delegated to us by another, by Christ.
R.D. You could not speak of delegated power.
J.T. No; authority is delegated. The power is in the Spirit, and that I hold to exist today, as
{410}
always, only it is to some extent hampered by the outward conditions. To take it up in a public way would be very presumptuous, for the reason that we have not got all the saints in one place.
E.N.H. Whereas at Corinth they had?
J.T. Yes. "Tell it to the assembly", wherever it might be, in whatever locality; there was that which could be spoken of as the assembly of God. We see from this passage that there was a company formally designated as the assembly of God, that could be appealed to. The question is, What am I to do now? I cannot give up this precious light; I must hold to that.
E.M. And if a brother trespass against you, the matter must be put right.
J.T. Yes, you must gain your brother; that is another thing that is imperative, and therefore you would turn to those available to you in the light of this.
T.M.G. Principles never alter?
J.T. Quite: the principles are unalterable, so that you would tell it to those who are available, clothing them with divine thoughts too, but avoid clothing them with authority as the assembly of God in any public way; that would be unbecoming, and indeed could be very easily detected by others as very pretentious and unwarrantable.
Ques. Supposing there were only one or two in a place?
J.T. Then you could not go very much further, because you require them all to see the brother; yet you might humbly convoke those two or three together and communicate your exercises to them, and the Lord will be with you in it, but it will not do to clothe them with assembly authority.
G.N. When you say walking or acting in the light of this, it does not mean that you give up the commandment?
{411}
J.T. Far from it; you love it.
J.M. You could not walk in the light of it if you gave it up!
J.T. I do not know anything that is so precious as the truth of the assembly. When you look at it in Corinthians you see something that God has, in which He can make His mind known, in which He can express His authority against evil, and deal with evil.
H.H. In making those remarks I presume you are thinking of 2 Timothy. Would you say a little as to how you understand 2 Timothy in relation to the thought of the assembly.
J.T. Well, I would like to put myself in Timothy's position when he received the second letter, because he had received one before, and he would have to put the two together. In the first one the apostle said, "These things write I unto thee ... that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God". (@1 Timothy 3:14,15). Timothy would compare the two, and he would see that in the second the apostle does not say anything about the house of God or the assembly of the living God, but he does speak of "a great house". Timothy would no doubt, say, Things have changed!
J.M. The principles given in the first letter are not cancelled in the second letter.
J.T. Far from it; Timothy would have them in his mind, and would cherish them as he loved the Lord. Compare @John 14:21.
J.McG. You distinguish between the "great house" and the real house?
J.T. Certainly. At one time the spiritual and the official were commensurate, they were equal, but the official, the public assembly, has outgrown in dimensions the spiritual structure; in fact, we may say the addresses to the seven assemblies disclose complete break, so that the Lord had to say, "Unto you
{412}
I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira ... . I will put Upon you none other burden". (@Revelation 2:24) The Lord is not putting the onus of dealing with things on the remnant so He speaks about the kingdom; that would be the only remedy. But the Lord was already dealing with evil without the remnant: He said, "I will cast her into a bed". (@Revelation 2:22). *He* was doing it.
H.H. Attention has been drawn to the importance of divine principles; these cannot be set aside, but there is a peculiar exercise as to how in a day of ruin like this they can be carried out. Would you agree with that?
J.T. Yes, certainly. The second letter to Timothy indicates how it is to be done. He would cherish in his soul the light of the first letter; "the things that thou hast heard of me". (@2 Timothy 2:2). These included the first letter and many other things, and they were to be committed to faithful men who would teach others also, so that nothing is given up. It is only a question of *acting becomingly* because of the ruin, in the light of the things indicated.
H.H-y. I suppose you would say that Timothy knew the great change that had come over the assembly; "this thou knowest, that all which are in Asia be turned away from me". (@2 Timothy 1:15).
J.T. I am sure he did; that would enable him to understand why the apostle added further instructions. Throughout the letter generally the thought is that *God* deals with public evil.
J.M. And along with that you would say Timothy puts himself right?
J.T. That is what the second chapter means, how Timothy was to regulate himself in regard to those new conditions, Timothy or anyone that names the name of the Lord.
J.P.W. Does the state of things in second Timothy
{413}
result from not being in accord with the spirit of a little child?
J.T. I think so; they had turned away from Paul. He not only mentions that, but he says, in a great house there are vessels to honour and to dishonour; thus in the plainest way pointing to certain things in the public body that were entirely inconsistent with the truth of the assembly. The apostle had spoken, in writing to the Corinthians, about different kinds of material, wood, hay, and stubble, being built in, but these were extraneous and foreign, the things of man. Alas! They have found a place in the outward thing, but they are not of God. All vessels, great and small, were according to @Isaiah 22:24, to hang on Christ, but vessels to dishonour would not be hung on Christ, still they are in the house, and a Christian has to adjust himself in regard of them, but he cannot get outside the professing sphere which has now the character of "a great house", @2 Timothy 2:20.
W.K. Have you light from Scripture as to how adjust oneself?
J.T. Well, it goes on to say, "If a man therefore purge himself from these". (verse 21). "Purge" means that *he* is clear; he has separated himself from vessels to dishonour so that he may be a vessel unto honour. It is a serious thing to have to say formally to this one or that one, 'I can no longer walk with you'. We are speaking now of Timothy, to see how the instruction to Timothy helps us.
W.C.G. In @Matthew 18, is it not adjusting matters between brethren rather than discipline?
J.T. We were speaking of 2 Timothy to see how we are helped by 1 Corinthians, or @Matthew 18 now. "If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and meet for the master's use". He is therefore a vessel that the Lord can take up and use in the light of all these
{414}
chapters; he comes back to the principle of "my assembly"; he is fit for the Master's use. But that is not all; he is to "follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart". (verse 22). Note, it does not say, 'If you find them there', because it supposes that they are there. The Lord never intimates that the number should be reduced to one, He had in His mind that there should be others.
W.K. Your associations lie inside that company?
J.T. That is right. All those following righteousness would have the first epistle in their hearts; they would have the things that Paul had ministered to Timothy and others.
W.K. That is, the order of the house of God?
J.T. Yes, so that in regard of our *relations with one another*, we are not on individual ground at all, we are on collective ground. As soon as we find one following righteousness, we know he has the Spirit, and having the Spirit, he is a member of the body of Christ, and so are you, hence we take up that great truth, as being linked together in the Spirit.
J.M. Along with that, there might be a danger of assuming to be something that is not true of all the saints in a place. I understand from what you have been saying, that we reach this individually and by the teaching of the Spirit in our souls; and as having found each other in this way, being of one mind and one spirit, we can act together collectively without the assumption of being anything.
J.T. *Publicly* the ground taken is that we are following righteousness.
W.K. We are doing it together; that is the important point. There is necessarily a difference between those who have purged themselves and those who have not.
J.T. So that whilst the public ground is that we
{415}
are following righteousness together, privately we are walking in the light of the assembly.
R.D. I think it is good what you say about what is private and what is public; that needs to be sharply defined.
J.T. If we stop simply with the fact that there is a company of persons following righteousness, we do not go far enough, because we can clothe these persons with assembly thoughts, but in doing that we are not excluding any other persons belonging to the assembly. The twelve tribes were always in view with those who acted in faith in the Old Testament.
J.S. Discipline was always connected with the whole of the local assembly?
J.T. The church economy was carried out locally. We must not, in seeking to be humble in regard to our public position, lose our great privilege as having part in the house of God; for having the Holy Spirit, and having a few Christians to walk with, we have the thing *in principle*, and we want to make the most of it. The Lord helps us in that way.
E.M. Why do you come down to two in @Matthew 18?
J.T. That was to remind them of the *resource* they had; it is not exactly for a day of declension. The Lord was putting before them, first of all, the advantage of having the assembly, that you can go and tell the assembly. "If also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee one of the nations and a tax-gatherer". *You* are done with him; but if you introduce 1 Corinthians, you know the assembly has not done with him. Then He says, "Whatsoever ye shall bind". The Lord intimates the great resource that the saints had in having the assembly to look to; they could deal with a man, and heaven would ratify what they did. Then He says, "If two of you shall agree". There is another resource, prayer,
{416}
on the ground of spiritual unity. Then "where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them". He is there to help them.
E.M. Can we have that privilege now?
J.T. Certainly.
S.McC. What about binding on earth? Would you take that ground today?
J.T. I would not take that ground publicly today, but I believe that the thing is done.
H.H. Would you say the Lord takes account of the exercises of the saints now in regard of difficulties amongst them?
J.T. He helps them in their difficulties, and in time things are adjusted amongst the saints. All the conflicts we pass through are waged in the consciences of the saints, and in due course God brings the saints to a right judgment. The need of patience is therefore evident.
R.D. You mean that in all simplicity, as governed by the light of this, we may pursue these lines, and we shall have the Lord's support.
J.T. I think so; in fact, I know it is so, and I reckon on it.
R.B. Are not assembly exercises in the way of education for the time when the saints will judge the world?
J.T. No doubt.
G.N. Does following righteousness involve the necessity of dealing with evil?
J.T. Yes; it is involved in the pursuit of righteousness. It would not be righteous to go on with a wicked person.
W.A.W. You still think that @Matthew 18:18, can be acted upon at the present day?
J.T. It is acted on *in principle*. We do not act formally as if we were *the* assembly, but God helps His people as they have to deal with evil and confirms
{417}
what they do as they act in the light of the principles given to govern the assembly.
W.K. It supposes that they have done it, and have done it in such a way that heaven can ratify it.
R.D. That is important; it is done in such a way that heaven can ratify it.
J.T. It is a question of *how* you do it. I believe that God carries on discipline as ever.
W.K. What would become of us if there were not discipline?
J.T. I do not think that brethren with whom we are walking have the least thought of giving up discipline; it is a question of the *modus operandi*; 2 Timothy indicates that. Privately we know that God maintains discipline; we are not only relieved of the person, but God deals with him, and restores him as of old.
J.M. Do you not think that the education indicated in these chapters and the spirit that is suggested in them, in spite of the altered condition of things, would be a great help to us?
J.T. I am sure of it. I believe the Lord has a distinct voice to us, and it will have an effect that will abide to the end, because the Lord is bringing about assembly affections, so that the saints should be prepared to meet Him.
E.J.McB. Would you say a word in regard to having @1 Corinthians 5 in one's heart when dealing with evil in 2 Timothy days?
J.T. Well, we have the law of the house; the law governing that particular circumstance; hence, in dealing with a wicked person, we have that before us; but we have to keep before us too that conditions have altered. The discipline however, is as effective as ever; God has the person in view that he may be restored.
G.W.W. Heaven takes account of altered conditions, and it will not do to violate the truth as regards
{418}
how heaven looks at things on earth now; and therefore, if an action is to command the approval of heaven, there must be a taking account of the change that has come in according to the mind of heaven. 2 Timothy is, so to speak, heaven's recognition of the altered conditions. One might ask oneself how far we have all been in real distress of soul over the altered conditions? When Timothy had the second epistle in his hands, it must have been real distress to him to take account of them. If that is lacking, we are not in the mind of heaven about things.
J.T. I am sure the Lord is very jealous as to those whom He would support. The Old Testament abounds with evidence that He cannot be with us except under certain conditions.
Rem. Timothy's tears suggest the state that our brother refers to.
J.T. That is a very important word.
J.M. "Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things". (@2 Timothy 2:7).
Ques. Does "yourselves" in @1 Corinthians 5 include the whole assembly, "all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord"; as well as the assembly at Corinth?
J.T. "Yourselves" there would be the company at Corinth. Discipline is always exercised locally, never by the whole assembly. When things declined Christians adopted general councils, and decisions were rendered, but the original constitution, the economy of the assembly, required that things should be decided locally. The assembly at Jerusalem is the only one that is referred to without mentioning the locality. Paul went up and "saluted the assembly", (@Acts 18:22); meaning the assembly at Jerusalem. It had a peculiar place; no other assembly had that place.
{419}
REGULATION BY THE WORD OF CHRIST
@Luke 19:1 - 10, @Acts 2:47 (latter clause)
I am exercised to point out that we have to be regulated in all our relations by the Lord Jesus. It is a simple thought, but as I hope to show by the Lord's help, a most essential one for us today; for if we are not regulated by the Lord, however well regulated we may regard ourselves, religiously or socially, it will not only be outside His direct influence and to that extent without His law, but we shall also be deprived of the privileges which He has for us as those who obey Him. He is the Regulator according to divine appointment, not only of the saints, but of everything, just as of old Joseph was set over the Egyptians, and Pharaoh said to him, "according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled". (@Genesis 41:40). Hence, as a type of the Lord Jesus Christ, we see in Joseph the divine thought that all the saints, and indeed all the nations, and Israel as the head of them, as well as angels and all things are to be regulated and ruled by the word of Christ. This is perfectly clear from the Scriptures, and I want to show you how essential it is for us; for if we do not go beyond the acknowledgment of our allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ in our baptism, we are simply a multitude without order. The Israelites came up out of Egypt, not indeed as a disorderly mob, but they did not go out according to their tribes; they came out in military rank, "harnessed" (@Exodus 13:18); that is, by fives, five in a rank thus presenting a military front to the enemy; they were under divine control, but not yet according to their tribes. I want to show you that the divine thought is that we should be regulated according to our tribes; in other words, that we should take up assembly position in our
{420}
souls. That is what the Lord has in His mind for every one of us.
Now when a young Christian begins his course he recognises the lordship of Christ; that is the initial feature of his confession. In his baptism he confesses that Christ is Lord, but baptism does not set us in our tribes; it does not place us in the fellowship of God's people; that is a later consideration, a further step, but obviously we begin with the acknowledgment, not only in the outward form of baptism, but in our souls, of the lordship of Christ. The one thing that is indicative of Israel's faith is that they crossed the sea, so that baptism is only effective as it is taken up in faith; it is a dead form otherwise. We as parents do it for the child, but in order that it may be effective for the child it must be in faith with him, so that he may be said to have crossed the sea. He never crosses it truly except by faith, so that he begins his Christian career publicly in that way by the acknowledgment of the lordship of Christ. This is what Romans teaches us: "for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation". (@Romans 10:10). So that he makes a good start in that way, with the heart affected by faith, and the mouth confessing what the heart has yielded to. Then the apostle goes on to say, "For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself, ... whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's". (@Romans 14:7,8). Let us recognise that. Then he adds, "for to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living". (verse 9). Thus the Lord has an incontestable right to rule over every soul; He has the keys of hades and of death; He can enter hades at any time and announce His right over everyone there. For the moment His rights are announced by the gospel testimony through redemption, and as it is accepted in the souls of believers the lordship of Christ is
{421}
owned; as Saul said, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (@Acts 9:6). He not only recognised the Lord's rights over him as a matter of property, but he said, "what wilt thou have me to do?" that is a levitical resolve.
Now, the people came out of Egypt, and in their song, joining as they did with Moses, as it is said, "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord", they say, "The Lord is a man of war". (@Exodus 15:1, 3). That is how they apprehended Him; not yet as the Jehovah who would dwell with them, although no doubt they had it in their hearts, but what the song contemplates is the thought of a military Leader, so that they come out victoriously. They were not led by the way of the Philistines, "lest peradventure", God said, "the people repent when they see war". (@Exodus 13:17). Before we fight, we must learn to be subject.
Now the book of Numbers is the great regulating book in the Old Testament, and I want just to touch on it for a moment. In the beginning of the book it is said, "And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation". (@Numbers 1:1). That was the position of the tabernacle; it was in the wilderness, and God spake out of it, in that position, and the speaking had in view the regulating of the people in regard to their tribes. The tribes, for faith, henceforth were always in view. No one who loves the Lord will ever let the assembly out of his mind; the assembly will be always before him; hence you find that where the Lord Jesus is typically seen in Moses as dwelling in the affections of His people, it is said "he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together". (@Deuteronomy 33:5). It is as Christ is recognised and held in the affections of His people that they are regulated by Him in assembly relations. Moses says in @Deuteronomy 33:3, "Yea, he loved the people". The Lord would have us in assembly relations, and
{422}
as in those relations, the heads of the people and the tribes assembled will be seen there. The Lord is seen there; if as yet He is not acknowledged in the world, yet is He acknowledged there in affection. I believe that is what the king in Jeshurun signifies; Moses was held in the, affections of the people; so you can see the importance of the tribes. Those who are not walking in the light of the assembly are not holding to Christ.
Thus we see throughout the Old Testament, and in the New, that the tribes are always in view *for faith*. You get them in Elijah; you remember how he built an altar of twelve stones, recognising the twelve tribes. In the Psalms too the tribes always come in for affectionate recognition. Jerusalem is a city compacted together; it was not a city of endless suburbs like modern cities; it was divinely regulated, "whither the tribes go up". (@Psalm 122:4). One loves to think of the saints in assembly order as before God; the Psalmist says, that the tribes go up for "a testimony to Israel", (@Psalm 122 4). So the apostle Paul speaks of them; he says before Agrippa, "our whole twelve tribes". (@Acts 26:7). What a witness! No one can explain how that is, only we see that it is on the principle of faith. So James writes to them too, "To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad", (@James 1:1) for him they were all there; he does not hint at "lost tribes"; Scripture knows no such thought. We hear people say that the British people are the lost tribes; this is not so. The scripture has all in view; you do not write to lost people. I only speak of it in regard to the assembly, my desire being that we might have before us the thought of the entire company, as being under the eye of the Lord, and moreover that if anyone writes today, he writes as having all the saints on earth in view. Scripture not only speaks of speakers, but also of writers; every scribe is like unto an householder we read. James writes to the
{423}
twelve tribes, and so if you write it is not only for the few you know, it is for all. Anything that the Lord gives, He gives for the whole assembly, because His thoughts of the assembly are never narrower than to include every member of it. The Lord knoweth them that are His, they are not lost in this sense.
Now to come to the thought of regulation. In the book of Numbers Jehovah is said to have spoken to Moses out of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and the word was one of regulation. It is in keeping with Corinthians, which is the word of regulation for the assembly. The Lord, through the apostle, addresses Himself to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, "with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours". (@1 Corinthians 1:2). There is only one Lord; wherever there is a company calling on His Name He is their Lord, as He is of all other companies; and then as the apostle proceeds, you discern that one rule or law is to govern all; all are to be regulated by the same principles. So the apostle says, "Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you". (@1 Corinthians 11:2). There were some directions which they kept, and others which they disregarded, but he credited them with those they had kept.
I dwell on the point of regulation because although there is to be no assumption to the position of the assembly in a *public* way, yet we must cling to first principles, those which were given to the apostle by the Lord to govern the saints. So it says, "But if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom". (verse 16). It is contrary to the assembly to have contention, "It is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious and angry woman", @Proverbs 21:19. Contention is foreign to the assembly, so the apostle says, "We have no such custom, neither the assemblies of
{424}
God". Men might meet on Mars Hill to dispute about matters, but not so in the assembly; it is a place for subjection to one another in the fear of Christ, hence the importance of rule. So the apostle says to Titus, "For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting" (@Titus 1:5); things were to be set in order.
When you come to the regulations in Numbers, the principle was that Judah was to have the first place; that cuts straight across nature. Nature and all its interests and prejudices must be excluded in the ordering of the house of God. Reuben was the firstborn, but he has not the first place in regard to the ordering of the tribes; Judah had that; not that he was any better exactly, but God would assert His rights. Judah gets the first place in relation to the tabernacle; and that is a very important principle; we must recognise God's sovereign right. He does what He will in the armies of heaven; no one lifts up his head against divine ordering.
Now, another point in regard to that; Reuben is the firstborn of Israel, he represented natural right. Natural right was wholly refused in the ordering of the tribes, so that Reuben had his own place, and that place was adjacent to the family of the Kohathites; alas! they influenced each other injuriously, and the result was a party spirit; a servant of the Lord allying himself with those who had a natural right, and so they rebelled against Moses and Aaron. There was the alliance of natural right and prejudices with those who had the position of being servants of the Lord; but that moral combination led them to become rebels against the authority of Christ in Moses, and the priesthood of Christ in Aaron. We are so apt to gender party feeling locally; whilst the Lord emphasised in Numbers the principle of local responsibility, yet that very principle involved a danger, that is the danger of local party spirit.
{425}
If we have large meetings, or a number of large meetings in a locality, we are apt to think that we must be in a leading place. The leading place is determined by divine regulation and not by numbers. There were in that combination two hundred and fifty princes, men who had acquired renown. Renown is right in a spiritual way, for in Numbers the heads of the tribes are said to be men of renown. Paul was renowned spiritually, but you get men living on their own renown; there you have the danger and the result is party spirit. The Lord comes in and decides the thing. "I will make to cease from before me the murmurings of the children of Israel". (@Numbers 17:5). These men came up to the tent of the tabernacle in their brazen rebellion; they murmured before God. God says. I will make a test, and He did it by setting up Aaron's rod to bear fruit in the sanctuary. The answer to all this rebellion is in life; life only can meet it.
In the book of Numbers you have the great principle of regulation; the people are all regulated according to their tribes and set round about the tabernacle, God Himself dwelling there in love in the midst of them; each tribe had a divinely given place round about the tabernacle. "Shine forth before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh", (@Psalm 80). The position of these three tribes was in immediate proximity to the holiest; God was to shine forth on them. How important to occupy your place, for you never can tell when God may shine forth on you. It is His prerogative to shine forth, He shines in the face of Jesus Christ; "Wake up thou that sleepest ... and the Christ shall shine upon thee". (@Ephesians 5:14).
Now to come to Zacchaeus; I want to show how the principle of regulation works out in the individual. Zacchaeus is a remarkable man; he is the type of a believer, but of a believer unregulated. This is true of many today, alas! The Lord had passed through
{426}
Jericho, the place of the curse, and here is a man evidently exercised. He had heard of Jesus, and wanted to see Him, "who he was"; that was the exercise he had. I wonder if we have that exercise, to see Jesus, *who* He is. You remember how the Lord had put that question to the disciples, but He did not ask it of Zacchaeus; that was not the point then; Zacchaeus had not had the opportunity to know as the disciples had had. Zacchaeus runs ahead; "he ran before" it says, and climbed up into a tree, but he thereby placed himself in a very awkward position spiritually, as we are all liable to do, with the very best intentions, unless we are regulated by the word of Christ. He was one of those men who go before the Lord; never do that! You may be puzzled to know what to do, you may have the best intentions but do not ever run on before. A man who goes before the Lord may be called an extremist; extremists are never in the mind of the Lord, hence the importance of waiting for definite regulation by the word of Christ. He will come and regulate you if there is any uncertainty.
In the previous incident in chapter 18:39, before the Lord had passed through Jericho, there were certain "which went before", and they would have silenced Bartimaeus, they would have hindered him from coming to the Lord, and that was a very serious matter, but the Lord asserts His rights and stood and *commanded* him to be brought. So Zacchaeus had run before the Lord, and he found himself, as I have said, in a peculiar position spiritually. Suppose the Lord were here today, how many people who profess to own Him would He have to look up to according to man's order? A great many, I fear; if I am in a position in which He would have to look up to me, or even in which one of His people would have to look up to me, it is a position to be given up. I very much prefer to be on a level with
{427}
His people. Timothy comes in as one of the brethren: he came *with* them, it is said, not they with him. I would not be happy to find myself in a position in which the Lord Jesus, if He were here, would have to look up to me. He had to look up to Zacchaeus, and in His grace He did look up to him, but it was to bring Zacchaeus down, in order that he might be regulated by His word, and that he might have the privilege of the Lord's company in his house. It is a very much happier position to view the Lord and to see Him in the environment of the home, than to view Him from the sycamore tree. Things were not right here. If that be your case, let the Lord regulate you, let His word enter your heart, for as of old Joseph's word was to rule all Egypt, so Christ's word is to rule, and regulate you and me.
So Jesus says, "Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for today I must abide at thy house". He encourages him to come down, because He says, I am going to abide at thy house. Is it not worth while to come down so as to have the Lord? If you have never tasted what it means to have Christ in your own house, then, as one who in a measure has tasted it, I would encourage you to listen to His word. He would be near to you so that you might see Him in His beauty. The house of Zacchaeus was no doubt a well-furnished house, quite in keeping with his means, but the Lord did not say a word about Zacchaeus's riches; He had spoken to another man about his riches, for riches were hindering him, but obviously that was not the case with Zacchaeus. He loved the Lord, and the Lord knew it, but He says, Zacchaeus, you must be regulated by My word, and in order that you should have Me it must be so. I would urge you, to be obedient to His word, not only to His commands, but to His word. What the Lord said to Zacchaeus was an appeal coupled with a promise: "For today I must abide at thy house".
{428}
So he made haste, he complied with the Lord's word, and received Him joyfully. It is a beautiful picture. How one can follow the Lord going through the door, and how Zacchaeus would attend upon Him. What a different scene from that presented in @Luke 7, the Pharisee's house! Here He says, I must *remain* in thy house. The Lord is not in a hurry to leave anyone who wants Him.
Well, I need not dwell further on that point; I turn now to @Acts 2, to say a word as to verse 47. The Lord comes in in grace to your house that you may see Him in His beauty, but I draw attention to a beautiful and forcible expression, in the Psalms, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord ... to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple". (@Psalm 27:4). It is not now that the Lord might be in my house, but that I might dwell in His. You remember how beautifully David distinguishes; he says, "I dwell in a house of cedar", (@2 Samuel 7:2) but he did not invite the Lord into that, but he went and sat in the Lord's house. Have you ever done that? As he sits, inquiring of the Lord, the word comes. I cannot enlarge on that now, but you can understand it. David was willing to forego his own house, to dwell in the Lord's house all the days of his life, and in that house he would see the beauty of the Lord. So, in Acts, we have described what the effect of Peter's preaching was; three thousand were converted, and it says all that believed had all things common, "and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers"; then it says, "and the Lord added daily those that were to be saved".
Has the Lord done that for you? That is what He is doing; adding to His assembly. I do not overlook the fact that we have no visible assembly. A brother told me lately that the expression "the
{429}
invisible church" is St. Augustine's; it is in that way a supplementary reference; he must have come to differentiate between the real church and the visible church; at any rate, it is very suggestive of that. We have to differentiate between the visible and the invisible; the visible is in ruins, but the invisible remains and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it. Thank God, there is that here, the members of which are linked up together by the Spirit, a formation that cannot be dissolved, that will never disintegrate. The Lord holds it, and at the end it is again presented, for it says, "The Spirit and the *bride* say, Come". (@Revelation 22:17). I believe the Lord is adding to that, as at the beginning, *daily*; every day. Are you added? We have been speaking today of the revelation made to Peter as once for all; it is for you and for me to have the light of it in our souls, so that there may be a spiritual foundation for a structure to be erected upon. It is for each one to know whether he is in that structure.
Let us see to it that we have a spiritual foundation, that we have not only outward, formal links, but that we may be of those of whom it can be said, "The Lord added to the assembly". When I call someone my brother, do I mean it? Do I mean that that person is a member of Christ's body, and in that way linked vitally with me? It is all very real, and the Lord would have us to be regulated by these words for these words convey light to the soul, and if we are regulated by them we shall come into blessing. The Lord said to Peter, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona". (@Matthew 16:17). And it is a wonderful day in your soul when the light of Christ as "the Son of the living God", (verse 16) comes into it. You will then be designated *blessed*, your place in the assembly will be known to you, and you will apprehend what the assembly is to Christ.
May God bless His word.

LEVITICAL ENERGY AS SEEN IN PAUL
@Acts 11:20 - 26; 12:5 - 17; 16:23 - 32
J.T. One has had in one's mind the order and energy that marked the service of the apostle Paul, a service to which he was called and for which he was separated at Antioch, and I thought the passages read would suggest this for our consideration. The narrative records facts without commenting on them, but it is interesting to note the manner and methods of the saints at the beginning, and the remarkable link of sympathy seen in Barnabas which found expression in his bringing Saul to Antioch.
As regards chapter 12 I thought the facts recorded there, interesting as they are, and denoting beautiful piety in the saints, show a certain decline. The fact is stated that there was unceasing prayer made for Peter, and while many were gathered together praying in Mary's house at the time of his release, yet when he came to the door, those present could not believe that it was he. I think their surprise at the fulness of the answer to their prayers perhaps evidences a certain decline, though outwardly things continued as they should.
In addition to this, one might remark, with no disrespect to Peter, that he was asleep; and while in one way this betokens faith, yet if one compare the scene with that described in chapter 16 there is evident contrast. In the latter case, spiritual energy is most marked; Paul and Silas in prison prayed and sang praises unto God; they did not sleep. I only mention this as giving an outline of what was in my mind. If one thinks of the economy set up under the twelve, one sees the marked difference between that and what was set up by Paul; praise and worship are secured for God in a peculiar way
{431}
through his service. No doubt it was God's pleasure that Peter should sleep under the circumstances that obtained at the moment, still it was negative. Even in chapter 10, while considerable energy on the part of Peter is recorded, and one has to own God is in it, and the work is done, yet it is not quite what we get in Paul.
P.S.P. Do you associate Paul's energy with the fact that the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch?
J.T. Yes, it is mentioned in that connection, and it is for us to form our conclusions from that. The method here is remarkable. The principle of local service is seen in Paul before he begins to take up what is levitical in a universal way. He remained a whole year in Antioch before he was separated for the work by the Holy Spirit. It is very suggestive that the Levite should begin his service at the age of twenty-five. There is not much said as to what he did at that age, but we know he was not duly qualified until he was thirty years old, so it says here, "And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch". This took place before the Holy Spirit said, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them", (@Acts 13 2).
P.H. I think you said once, God teaches by models.
J.T. The book of Acts is a book of precedents; models are set before us. Paul was the typical Levite, so he remained a year at Antioch, he was serving in his own locality first, and thus the brethren had every opportunity of knowing him.
H.N. In Mark's gospel the disciples are seen with the Lord before He sent them forth. Would that correspond with what you are saying? Would it suggest spiritual education?
{432}
J.T. Yes; it says, "he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach", (@Mark 3:14). Then they get the D.D.s, so to speak. He gives them names, too, indicative, no doubt, of what they were qualified to be. James and John he surnamed Boanerges; that is, sons of thunder; he gave them that name for a purpose. All this was after they had been with Him, after that period of retirement. Their names would suggest what was to mark their ministry.
H.N. So education for the ministry is a right idea.
P.L. The great point is *where* you take your degree. Here it is among the saints gathered together.
J.T. If we compare this with the passage quoted in Mark, we can see the connection. The Lord goes up into a mountain and calls to Him whom He would, then in verse 16 it says, "And Simon he surnamed Peter". He gets his degree, as it were. He is now a stone in relation to the building. @John 1 brings that into evidence. Jesus said to him, "thou shalt be called Cephas". As last Adam the Lord is seen giving names. He had title to give Simon that name. In Mark it is a surname that Peter receives and it indicates something that will distinguish him in his ministry. Then there is the name Boanerges. I think it is all a question of levitical titles which follow and are given consequent upon the disciples being with the Lord on the mount.
H.D'A.C. Would you connect the expression "sons of thunder" with the ministry of John? Thunder is universal.
J.T. That is an interesting question.
H.N. Would it suggest the way John, in his ministry, claims the earth for God?
J.T. No doubt. It speaks of the supremacy of the Lord over all earthly things. Thunder is so
{433}
overwhelming. John's ministry rises majestically over everything here. It is very interesting consideration. I would connect the levitical titles which the Lord gives in Mark, as has been said, with the qualifications of Saul here. He is a year in the place before the Holy Spirit calls on the assembly to commit itself to him. His custom was to meet with the saints; his methods were assembly-wise, so to speak; "for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly".
J.M.K. Is it in the assembly we win our degree?
J.T. Yes; you remain a certain time with the saints to prove what you are.
F.F. Timothy obtained a "good degree".
J.T. Yes; that word is used in relation to a deacon, one who went about doing the most unpretentious kind of work.
F.W. If a brother is more at home outside of his own meeting, that is out of order spiritually.
J.T. The principle is that the branch grows up out of his place and maintains what is due to God there, and thus qualifies for universal service. How can you lay your hands on a brother for general ministry unless you know him?
Rem. These principles would thus not be solely for an apostle, but would apply to each one of us.
J.T. Yes; because all are to be Levites. All were taken account of in Numbers from a month old, and each one would be reminded as he grew up for what he was destined. So, applying it to the present, you grow up in your own place, and when the time comes that the Lord definitely calls you, you have the saints with you; you are not acting on your own exercise merely. A year's experience at Antioch would give Paul the opportunity of being with the saints in all weathers, as we say.
P.L. So Timothy is taken up as one of good report among the brethren. The first mention of him in the
{434}
Acts is "who had a good testimony of the brethren in Lystra and Iconium". (@Acts 16:2).
J.T. That is the idea. "Ye know the house of Stephanas", the apostle says; ye know it; "that it is the firstfruits of Achaia", *it* was that; (@1 Corinthians 16:15). The Corinthians knew the man and his house, and that they had addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints, and were thus worthy of respect.
H.N. Would this year at Antioch correspond with the year in which the Levites abode round the tabernacle before it was set in movement?
J.T. No doubt. A whole year, as we were saying, gives opportunity of knowing the saints in all weathers.
Rem. Summer and winter.
J.T. The assembly at Antioch was marked by a sovereign action of the Holy Spirit. That is seen in the early part of chapter 13: "As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them". It seems to me, that these are the conditions in which the Holy Spirit acts in assembly character in connection with levitical work; and in due consideration for the brethren in that company, these two men were there a year, so that they were well known as being qualified for service, hence brethren could lay their hands on them in fullest confidence.
H.N. There would not be the touch of spiritual completeness apart from the assembly.
J.T. You must be an assembly man to be a Levite. Much damage has been done because this has not been recognised.
P.L. One's service is not likely to contribute to the building up of the saints on assembly lines unless regulated by that.
J.T. In other words the dispensation is assembly-wise, and all levitical work is to be carried on in relation to the assembly; hence one comes back to
{435}
it. The narrative proceeds up to the end of chapter 14 to show the wisdom and accuracy of divine choice and how those selected men proved themselves qualified, and were true to their levitical obligation. See @Acts 14: 26 - 28. "When they were come [to Antioch], and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them".
H.D'A.C. Paul really planted churches wherever he went, and he had to be instructed in the practical bearing of such before he could do this.
J.T. The apostle had light in his soul regarding the assembly, and how he would delight in the working out of it at Antioch.
P.L. "All things are yours", (@1 Corinthians 3:21) is that the levitical idea? The Levites belonged to the assembly. The apostle would learn in this way the dignity of the company.
J.T. When Moses came down from the mount with the light of God in his heart there was idolatry in the camp; he could not work out divine thoughts there, but Paul came into a company where he could work out the light in his soul, the material was there. What a year they must have had together! There was detachment from an earthly centre and attachment to a heavenly one. The position is very great if we think of a man coming into a place with light from heaven. The Lord had said to him, "Why persecutest thou me?" (@Acts 9:4). Paul would know what that meant. He had the light of the divine system in his heart and there at Antioch was the material in which it was to be worked out.
H.N. You were referring at the commencement to the thought of sympathy. All the light in the apostle's soul was brought into a sympathetic atmosphere, and if levitical service is to flourish, must we not have such an atmosphere now?
J.T. Yes; John makes room for the working
{436}
out of Paul's line of things, after what is public has broken down.
F.F. Is there any advance in the position at Ephesus on the Antioch position?
J.T. Ephesus is the climax of Paul's service. He spent three years there and more is said about his service there than in any other place. He said to the elders, "I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God", (@Acts 20: 27). The structure is complete at Ephesus, so to speak, it forms the top stone of Paul's ministry, Christ in His place in the affections of the saints as the chief corner stone.
P.S.P. These chapters we are considering furnish a model of instruction for us in connection with levitical service.
J.T. Yes. The fact that the Levite was to begin his service at thirty and was not to serve after he was fifty shows it was a question of spiritual energy; there was to be no flagging; whatever was put upon him he was to accept it. Paul affords us a pattern of spiritual energy in this way.
H.D'A.C. There is no limit in connection with the exercise of what is priestly.
Ques. Is not this priestly service in chapter 16?
J.T. No doubt; but the energy is what strikes you. This dungeon becomes a temple. Luke takes account of the effect of the stripes, as a physician would, yet in spite of this the energy of the apostle rises to think of God; he sang praises.
F.F. In that sense Paul and Silas were not prisoners.
J.T. They went in as prisoners, wretchedly treated, but they come out after a very different fashion. "Sirs", the jailor said. What a change in his mind in regard of them! The Levite ministers to the priest, and here we see levitical energy developing into priestly service. A man's service in this way ought to help him as a priest, and his common ordinary
{437}
work should help him as a priest, too. Our daily work should add to our spiritual power, and our service as Levites should have this effect also.
It may be remarked that the priestly food in the main was the meat offering; that refers to what; Christ is as man under the eye of God, and feeding on Him thus builds up a priestly constitution. Manna sets forth what He was under contrary circumstances. It was specially for the wilderness, a pot of manna was kept in the holiest as a memorial. The allusion in @Revelation 2:17 might be to this, "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna". It is Christ once humbled here.
H.N. How would you bring in shewbread in relation to the priest?
J.T. It was connected with administration. We see from Leviticus that the meat offering was the principal food of the priest, though he had part in all the offerings. Priesthood depends so much or our being formed after Christ, that order of man.
H.N. Would not the meat offering be food for our affections, while the shewbread would fit us for administration? Luke would supply priestly food?
J.T. Yes, and at the close of his gospel he brings in an order of priests who were continually in the temple praising and blessing God.
{438}
THE NEED OF A PRIESTLY SPIRIT
@Hebrews 3:1 - 6; Luke 10:38 - 42; 11:1 - 13
One is struck with the priestly skill with which the letter to the Hebrews was written. It is not written in an official way. Although undoubtedly the author is Paul, it is not written with the authority of an apostle; but the skill of a priest is easily discerned in it. In the passage I have read this is seen in the form of the address to the "holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling", and in speaking to you, dear brethren, one would desire to follow such an example, for while we carry on levitical work we are always to be governed by the priestly spirit, that is, the spirit of divine intelligence and *holiness*; levitical work if not carried on in that spirit is very likely to be profane. With Moses, great servant though he was, and accredited in this passage with general faithfulness (he was faithful in all God's house), yet there was this blemish, alas! that he addressed the people of God as rebels. That was not a priestly touch.
As we shall see, the writer here sets before us the opposite of that; he addresses the brethren as holy brethren; and he further adds, "partakers of the heavenly calling", he took account of them in that way, as I said, in priestly intelligence and holiness. He would not admit of any profane suggestion even; the saints are holy brethren, and partakers of the heavenly calling. He lifts them up from the platform of the flesh, and if the thoughts are received in our souls, they produce a right appreciation of what is said.
I desire to speak to you in that light; for it is important, not only that I should speak holily and intelligently, but that you also should be both intelligent and holy, for the things of God, the
{439}
operations of the Spirit of God, are in relation to what is holy. We are to keep our vessels holy, and so the thought I have, is to call attention to Christ, as this passage does, as the Apostle and High Priest of our confession. The word is *confession* not *profession*; it is what we confess rather than what we profess; and we *have* a confession. The *we* and the *us* of this epistle are the *we* and the *us*  of mutuality. The speaker places himself alongside his hearers as one of them, magnifies what they have, and then takes his part in it mutually.
One would love to bring out in its true bearing what our confession is. I do not intend to attempt it, but it is a thought I would suggest. What the apostle desired to bring forward here was that they might consider the Apostle, the Apostle of *our* confession. You see much has come to us that we enjoy without thinking of the vessel through whom it has come. Abroad in Christendom the light is to some extent appreciated, at any rate in the measure in which it adds to men in this world; but there is no thought of the One through whom it has come. So the point here is to consider the Apostle; consider Him; and in thinking of Christ in this way we have to look into the gospels. The gospels, according to the point of view in each, present to us Christ in this light.
You recall how when Aaron was to be anointed and consecrated, and his sons with him, that they were brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. It is a lovely scene typically in @Leviticus 8. Moses is the active servant, and Aaron is the passive one; so that they are both there, and besides, the tabernacle is there. The tabernacle represented the divine thoughts, and I want just to say a word about that, because Christians at times seem so limited; it seems that they have little to say one to another. The tabernacle represented the
{440}
divine thoughts, and in this letter to the Hebrews it is said to be a figurative representation of things in the heavens; a very vast thought that, a "figurative representations of the things in the heavens", (@Hebrews 9:23).
Now when Christ came from heaven He began to unfold the things, so that it is no longer a figurative representation of them, but the plain unfolding of the things in the ministry of Christ. You see, the gospels are not so many scattered narratives, or records of scattered events; they are records of divine thoughts methodically unfolded, and they hang together; as Luke said to Theophilus, "it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order [or, with method], most excellent Theophilus". (@Luke 1:3). In him, at least, we have the methodical unfolding, by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, of the ministry of Christ, so that it is all of one piece, and understood spiritually in relation to the other inspired gospel narratives; we have the things in the heavens set before us in a spiritual way. It is said in this epistle to the Hebrews, that the Lord came in connection with a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand; that is, not of this creation; it was a great spiritual system that He unfolded in His ministry. Hence, dear brethren, the importance of paying attention to the Apostle first, considering Him, and then listening. Then, in @Leviticus 8, the high priest is brought to the door of the tabernacle; that is to say, Christ Himself has taken up a place as Priest in resurrection in relation to all that He unfolded as the Apostle.
Now, in entering into Martha's house in @Luke 10, it is evident that the Lord had a certain liberty in that house, for He spoke in it. In seeking to serve, there is nothing one craves more than liberty in a spiritual way, and that greatly depends on the environments;
{441}
in other words, on the state of those to whom one ministers. Martha, indeed, did not afford much that drew out the words of the Lord; there was no interest in her. You can understand, that as the Lord in thought turned to Martha, although she very kindly received Him into her house, for she was apparently a hospitable woman, and the Lord would not be slow to value that; yet one can understand that as His thoughts were turned to Martha there was nothing there to draw out the wonderful thoughts that He had in His heart. On the other hand, Mary was all rapt attention; she discerned what a fountain of light, what a fountain of communication was there, she was all attention, and she was sitting. You see, it was not an occasional stop to listen to what the Lord might have been saying; she sat down to it. There was deliberation in her attitude. Had there been others there like her the interest would have been all the greater; it would have been augmented, but there was at least one heart open, ready to receive *all* that He said; mark you, she was listening to His word.
Here was the great Apostle of our confession. In Simon's house, as you recall, He also spoke; but He only spoke as occasion required it there; that is in His grace He speaks according to the state of people; it may be in rebuke, as in that instance, or it may be to justify some persecuted one. He was not free, for Simon's house was not the environment for the unfolding of things in the heavens; a house full of religious pride and superciliousness is no house in which to open up the things of heaven. Think of what is in heaven, dear brethren, all the Father's thoughts and the myriads of angels; the infinite holiness and brightness and glory of that place! How can you bring that into a house such as Simon's? It is wholly incongruous. Nevertheless, the Lord would speak in Simon's house, and He did. He
{442}
rebuked Simon and He justified the sinner; He will do that. But the unfolding of the heavenly things required a suitable environment, as I said, and so, although Martha was not ready, Mary was; she was attentive, and hers was the privileged part of listening to what He was saying. She would not have directed the Lord as to what He should say; she would prefer to leave it to Him. Whatever He said was of interest to her.
Let us not think that any part of the tabernacle, the great spiritual tabernacle, is of minor importance. Every peg is essential although made of wood; every item of the great spiritual system unfolded and set up by the great Apostle of our confession is essential; and you want to hear every word. We must not miss anything. Mary represents one who considers and listens to the Apostle of our confession, and I have no doubt that the next chapter sets before us the Priest. The Apostle is the One who speaks *from* God. The Priest is the One who speaks *to* God. So in the next passage we are told that He was praying in a certain place. It does not say in Martha's house; the place is not the point, but what He was doing; He was praying. I do not suppose anything could be more interesting to a priest; that is, to one who is spiritual; you will understand that I am using the word as conveying the idea of a spiritual person; nothing could be more interesting after the unfolding of the great tabernacle system, in the word of Christ, than that He should be seen in relation to all that in prayer; that is, as Priest.
In order to be in the spiritual order of things to which we are called, we have to consider Christ, we have to consider Him first as the Apostle, and in considering Him thus and hearing Him you get the idea of the tabernacle. But now you want to see Him as Priest, and the opening of chapter 11 sets before us the Lord praying. Elsewhere we get records
{443}
of the identical things that the Lord asked for. One feels that one is on peculiarly holy ground in approaching John 17. We are, as it were, admitted to hear the actual breathings of Christ to His Father. I do not think that this chapter is set before us as a model for us; it is the Son speaking to the Father; His pre-eminence must be fully admitted in our souls in approaching that chapter; it is peculiarly holy, every breathing of it is holy; the soul is impressed with the peculiar holiness of the scene. Luke is peculiarly holy and priestly in the way in which he writes his narrative; he has in mind to bring in the priestly family. You will recall how he begins with a priest, Zacharias, and Elizabeth the daughter of a priest; and in recording the birth of our Lord, His nativity, and His boyhood, he throws out, so to say, a priestly atmosphere, so that the natural mind should be rebuked in looking at the subject.
And so, throughout, Luke has in view that the saints should become a company of priests. Hence, when you come to the end of his narrative you have the disciples led out as far as Bethany by the Lord. It is a beautiful scene, a most touching scene; and having arrived there He lifts up His hands and blesses them, that was a priestly act; and having blessed them, He is parted from them and carried up into heaven; that is, He has gone up in their view, and disappears out of their view as a Priest; and, dear brethren, one might add to that, we have Him in heaven in that office.
There is an anti-priest there, too, one who accuses the brethren. It is a dreadful thing to be on that side. The Lord is there as Priest. He is there to uphold us, and not only us, but to uphold the whole system that He unfolded in His ministry; and *it is* upheld; let us not think, for one moment, that there is any failure from that point of view. He is there "A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle
{444}
which the Lord pitched, and not man", (@Hebrews 8: 2). The Lord has pitched it, and He is there as a minister of it, and the ministry is being carried on perfectly; were it not so we should not be here as we are.
There is a great spiritual system that no effort of the enemy can touch; it subsists in Christ, the great Priest. The disciples had a view of Him as He lifted up His hands and was carried into heaven, they had a view of Him going in, and He remains there, and is supporting the whole system that He unfolded in His ministry. But now they are left on earth, that is how Luke's gospel ends. The disciples, it says, "returned to Jerusalem with great joy: and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God", (@Luke 24: 52,53).
Now, when you come to the beginning of the Acts, the same men are seen, not in the temple, but in the upper room, "where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew". The room where they abode was in keeping with their confession. A huge building such as the temple was literally not in keeping with *their* confession. It is true that the temple was recognised for a while in a provisional way; but there was the great spiritual temple in connection with which they were to serve, and that is developed in Paul's ministry. Peter says, "Ye ... are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ". So that we are thus, according to Luke, qualified priests; the saints are qualified priests; they are set here in relation to what the Lord opened up and set up through His ministry; the great thoughts of God unfolded by Christ and set up in a systematised way; so that now, what you come to is that those who are spiritually set together form the temple. The thoughts of God are there, and the priests in relation to that.
{445}
One would love to make clear what the exercise, what the function of the saint is in relation to the great spiritual system that is set up, how we are a "holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices". Peter is not speaking of what you might give of material things; these also may be sacrificed, and "with such sacrifices God is well pleased", (@Hebrews 13:16). To "do good and communicate" of your substance; even that is pleasing to God. But what Peter is speaking about: is not that, but spiritual sacrifices.
Well now, the passage in Luke shows us how the disciples, having seen the Lord exercise, as I may say, His priestly function, desired to be taught to do the same. It says, that one of His disciples, having seen Him pray, said, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples". And the Lord immediately answered, "When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name" (@Luke 11:2); that is the first principle of priestly service. Now, dear brethren, do we pray? "When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do", the Lord says elsewhere, "for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them". (@Matthew 6:7). The prayers of Scripture are short, and usually very pointed, certainly this is; it is striking how brief and yet how comprehensive it is. But the first thought in it is "Hallowed be thy name". The Speaker is thinking of God.
A priest always thinks for God. I do not begin with my own needs; the priest thinks for God. So, in the Lord's wonderful prayer to which I have alluded, He says, "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do". He came in relation to God, and to carry out the will of God; and above all, in making God known and finishing His work, to have here a sanctified place, a holy place, a place in which God can dwell.
{446}
What a wonderful thought He had, the Lord Jesus Christ! He would set up here in His people that in which God could dwell. But how dwell? By the Holy Spirit. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. If God is to be in our hearts, He dwells there in holy love; He prepares the ground by the gift of the Spirit. Being the Holy Spirit He sheds the love of God in our hearts. Now think of that. Think of the divine intent which the Lord Jesus conceived in the Spirit of holiness. You see how holiness marks Him from the outset. On the cross He says, as recorded by the Spirit in the psalm, "But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel". (@Psalm 22:3). And so in resurrection He declares the Father's name.
Hence the next thing is, "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee". The divine habitation must be in holiness, so that the prayer here, simple though it is, begins, "Hallowed be thy name". I do not proceed to details, only to show how that you have in the Lord's further word a "Friend", and a "Father". We can pray to a Friend and we can pray to a Father. I need not enlarge as to who the Friend is. We have a Friend in heaven. We have One there who has befriended us in death and who befriends us in life, and we can pray to Him. The passage enlarges on the importance of importunity; but that does not in the least suggest that there is any disposition on the part of our Friend to withhold what we pray for; the point is to *seek* and to *knock*. Let us not be at any spiritual disadvantage! There are no difficulties that can arise in our spiritual history that cannot be met. But the Lord would have us so to value what He can do for us, that we are urgent about it; you *must* have the thing, so you keep on asking; and you get it.
Then, He says, "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?
{447}
or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?" No father does that. And so He says, "How much rather shall the Father who is in heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" What a priestly prayer that is! You have the priestly side in Luke. How the advantage of it is pressed upon us! Then let us pray. Let us draw near to God. He has become our Father. We think of His name. Let is be hallowed! And what will He not give us? Even, as the Lord says, the Holy Spirit. The greatest possible gift we may have for prayer. I am not now speaking of an individual asking for the Holy Spirit. I am only pressing the point that the passage emphasises, that is, the importance of prayer.
The Lord seizes the opportunity afforded by the question raised by the disciples to unfold to them the great advantage of prayer. We learn to pray aright, intelligently and effectively, from Christ; He teaches us how to pray; and He shows that in praying you may get the greatest possible gift. "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?" (@Romans 8:32). But the point is that we get them for asking. God gives us all things, according to @Romans 8; having given Christ He gives all things freely from His own side; but the point here is what you get for asking, and asking according to the pattern of Christ, the true Priest.
May God bless His word to us!
{448}
THE PRIESTLY PRESENTATION OF CHRIST AS SET FORTH IN SIMEON
@Luke 2:25 - 35
I want to show from this passage how the priestly state marks, and should always mark, the presentation of Christ, taking up Simeon as one in whom that state is seen. I want also to draw attention to the peculiar and holy emotions that marked, according to this gospel, the introduction of the Lord Jesus Christ into this world. The Spirit of God brings forward in this narrative certain instances of men and women in whom such emotions were evident, and I shall dwell on these for a moment before coming to Simeon.
It is always well in presenting the testimony of God to go back to the beginning and test everything by the beginning, for the end is to be in keeping with the beginning according to God. It ought to be an exercise with every one who has opportunity of presenting Christ in testimony to do so in a priestly way, and yet withal, in the energy of the Levite. The priest ensures holiness of thought and accuracy and skill, the Levite ensures energy; the Levite, as you will remember; was to serve in the strength of manhood. His service was rendered between the ages of thirty and fifty; old age disqualified for the work. "And from the age of fifty years they ... shall serve no more". (@Numbers 8:25); but there were no limitations of that nature with the priest. The Levite was to serve in the energy of manhood, and so one would endeavour, and one *should* endeavour, to combine the priest with the Levite in the presentation of the gospel.
Apollos is an example of this; he suggests to us the energy of a Levite; we read "He *mightily* convinced the Jews" (@Acts 18:28) but then he had to be instructed as to how to do things, "whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto
{449}
them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly", (@Acts 18:26). He would henceforth know not only the power of levitical work, but the skill and holiness of priestly service; in other words, he would know how to come in and water what Paul had planted. He would know by priestly intelligence that it was not new seed that was needed in that garden, but watering; the seed was already there, hence the priest knows what to bring in; he knows the need of his congregation. Paul had planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase; both services were owned; we may reckon on that still, but how important to be priestly, and, as I said, to go back to the beginning even although we may be at the end, and test everything by the beginning.
I wish now to dwell upon what I have already referred to, the spiritual and holy emotions that marked the introduction of Christ into this world. We should continue on that line and be moved in our presentation of Christ, whether we are formally preaching or otherwise. I call attention to the instances of this in Luke's gospel. In chapter 1 we get Elizabeth, and then Mary the mother of Jesus, and finally Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist; and in chapter 2 we get the angel of the Lord coming to the shepherds in the field by night, and then the multitude of angels of the heavenly host. In each instance there were deep emotions with regard to Christ. In no case is it a matter of presenting doctrine, but of movement in the light of the introduction of Christ in manhood.
We read that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; even the babe, before it was born, leaped at the accents of the voice of the mother. "As soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy". Think of that; an unborn babe moved by the accents of the voice of the mother
{450}
of the Lord; and then the mother herself is filled with the Holy Spirit. She was now truly a daughter of Aaron, for Elizabeth being filled with the Holy Spirit "spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb". Then Mary following upon that, for she was with Elizabeth in her seclusion, says, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour", (@Luke 2:46,47). I cite these as illustrative of the soul movement in these holy women in relation to the birth of Jesus, the coming of Christ into this world. In the case of Zacharias, the father of John, he was dumb for a season on account of his unbelief but when the child was born, he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, "His name is John", and his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spake and praised God, and he was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied. He not only spoke from the emotions of his heart, but he conveyed divine thoughts prophetically which all centred in this blessed One who was coming in.
In @Luke 2 when the Babe is actually born in Bethlehem, attention is called to shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night, while others slept. We read, "And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them"; he was a messenger of peace, such as one would desire to be. They were terrified, but he said, "Fear not". How that spirit of "Fear not" is breathed in Luke. There is no need of any terror in man's heart now, for God is approaching man in a Man, yea, in a Babe; "Fear not". Is there any one here tonight who does not know the Lord, and who on account of a certain dread as regards God is hindered in his faith? The word to you is "Fear not". If you are going into the world, you have good reason to fear. God is to be *feared*, but as approaching
{451}
you in grace, He would allay every fear that would come into your heart. "I bring you good tidings of great joy", the angel said. Think of that! "I bring *you*"; and then it adds, "which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord". What a message!
We can say much more than that today; not only has a Saviour been born, but He has died and risen again. He has witnessed here for God, He has brought God in, brought Him near to men; He went about in manhood doing good, for God was with Him; he relieved all who came in His way. The gospel announces this, as the apostle says, "How that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and that be rose again the third day according to the Scriptures". (@1 Corinthians 15:3,4). That is what the evangelists can tell now, but the angel told all that it was possible to tell then. "The glory of the Lord shone round about them" as the message was announced, as if God would shine out in the light of the message, One being here in whom all His thoughts and love would be disclosed, and who would know perfectly how to express Him to men. One would love to set that forth so that souls should understand God.
The shepherds were illuminated by the light of the glory of God. One was here who could bring God near to man, and make Him known to men's souls. There could be nothing in the world greater than that God should be known in a man's heart, and God now had a Person here capable of bringing the knowledge of Himself into the heart of man, "The light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". What glory for God! "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts", (@2 Corinthians 4:6). All is in the countenance of Jesus Christ. As the psalmist says
{452}
"I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance", (@Psalm 42:5). All that God is is there to be made known to those in whose hearts God had caused the light to shine.
But to return to the narrative in Luke. The angel made known that the One born was none less than Christ the Lord, not that He *should* be that, but that He *is* Christ the Lord. It is well to take account of the way Scripture speaks. Then it says, "suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host". I think it is peculiar to Luke that heaven should come into evidence. Heaven was all astir in the light of this wonderful occurrence that the Son had become Man, and that He was there in the manger, and so these heavenly intelligences were moved. Let us dwell on that for a moment, for one feels the hardness and deadness and coldness that mark oneself, as well as others, in regard of Christ and Christianity, whereas this scripture brings before us the emotions of hearts. The heavenly host was saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men". They were occupied with the great event, and were moved, and the outcome of their emotions was that they praised God and said, "Glory to God in the highest". What a portion it was for God! Already, before the Child grew, God was reaping His harvest, and reaping it as He was approaching men by causing emotions in this one and in that one in regard of what was happening.
Now God looks for that in us as Christians; He looks for this kind of result in connection with the presentation of Christ here, and in connection with His testimony, He looks for a movement, for a stir, in the hearts of those who are professedly interested. Paul was a "sweet savour of Christ" (@2 Corinthians 2:15) unto God in his service. I believe his heart was always moved. It is affecting to sit down, as it were, and listen to
{453}
him as he spoke before Agrippa. He refers on that occasion a second time to his conversion; he had already referred to it at Jerusalem in addressing the Jews, now he refers to it again, and he speaks of the light from heaven which he saw. It was not only a "great light", but a "light above the brightness of the sun". His heart is astir as he says, "At midday, O king". His heart is so filled with the magnitude of his vision that he ejaculates "O king" as if he would say, '*You* should have it, it should be in your heart too'. So he says, "King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest". Then said Agrippa, "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian", and Paul replies, "I would to God that not only thou, but all that hear me this day were both almost, and altogether such as I am except these bonds". (@Acts 26) He desired, not simply that they should believe what he was saying, but that they should be as he was, except his bonds. Paul was triumphant at that moment. He was greater in his soul, *far* greater than any of his judges. His only desire was that souls should be moved in the light of the glory of Christ. Such was Paul; he was a true priest, and more, he was a worshipper, for his heart was filled with the magnitude of what was before him.
So with the multitude of the heavenly host, they said, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, good pleasure in men". They have in their mind what God has in His mind, and they looked on to the time when peace would be established on the earth. All was there in "the babe lying in a manger", it only awaited development, Christ would bring about a state of peace on earth, for He is Prince of Peace. He is not a war lord, though He is a. "Man of war" if war is to be waged, and war will be waged, but characteristically He is Prince of Peace. He is essentially set for peace, whether in your soul, or
{454}
in heaven or on earth; He brings peace to the human heart. In the assembly He said to them "Peace be unto you", and He will yet bring peace to Israel and to the nations; there will be peace in heaven, indeed it begins there, for in dealing with evil the Lord dislodges it from thence. He says, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven". (@Luke 10:18). He will be hurled with rapidity from heaven; Christ will bring that about and all with a view to peace, for there can be no peace in heaven while Satan is there, nor on earth while the devil is there, nor peace in my heart while any unjudged flesh is there on which he can act.
The Lord can bring peace into human hearts now as He will bring it in universally on earth by-and-by. So the angels celebrated peace, and not only that, but good pleasure in men. The Lord Jesus in becoming Man had a harvest of *men* in view and the angels discerned that as in the mind of God. Doubtless the immediate thought of the passage is men in contrast to angels, but it is *men*, not babes. God's "good pleasure" is not quite connected with what is immature, but with *men*. The Lord speaks in @John 17:6 of "the *men* that thou hast given me". We do not exactly afford "good pleasure" to God as babes, even though babes in Christ.
One can thank God for every babe in Christ. If you are a babe, you are a believer and have access to God; if you can only bring, according to the type, a handful of meal, you are accepted; the least bit of faith in a child's heart is acceptable to God. It is faith in Christ, and the meal speaks of Christ in some sense, but a babe is not a man. You have a representative in heaven true enough, but you cannot take care of yourself, you have to be cared for. You say, 'That is a remarkable thing to say', but it is well to bear in mind that God looks on to your having a certain means of keeping yourself. None can do
{455}
this absolutely, but a man can discriminate, he can avoid danger, while a babe rushes into things without any thought and is damaged. The Corinthians were babes in Christ. The apostle says, "I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual". (@1 Corinthians 3:1). To be spiritual is to be a man in divine things. Wisdom has men before it, and so the angels here spoke of good pleasure in men, fully developed men, not babes. I wonder if it is so with us? The apostle says, "in malice be ye children" (@1 Corinthians 14:20); that is if there is a tendency to malice or envy, think how a babe would act toward another babe, but "in your understanding be men". God is to dwell with men, not with babes. There may be need for a nursery now, but not then. His pleasure is with men, with those who can intelligently reciprocate His love. That is the idea of men: the good pleasure is in men.
But I must hasten on to Simeon, and I want to point out how he is marked off. It says it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, as if to emphasise the fact that he was essentially a priest; that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. It was not simply that he had arrived at this fact by the Scriptures, but it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit. Simeon was a just man and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. That is the kind of man the evangelist Luke presents.
No doubt each evangelist presents a type of man at the beginning of his gospel, suggesting what is in the mind of God in the gospel. John the baptist is the typical man in John's gospel. He is introduced as a "man sent from God" (@John 1:6), whereas Luke brings forward a man of whom it is said, the Holy Spirit was upon him. Witness must be by the Holy Spirit. So the writer of this gospel makes a great deal of the Holy Spirit. I ask myself, Am I marked by the Holy Spirit? Am I occupied simply with the past, with
{456}
what others have ministered, or am I enjoying what the Holy Spirit is saying and doing now? Am I in it? I think Luke would suggest that, he would suggest the importance of the Holy Spirit and of the anointing, hence you have all these different persons marked by the Holy Spirit. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and the same is said of Zacharias and of Simeon, the Holy Spirit was upon him. Let us be assured of this. We can rely upon the Holy Spirit only for testimony; it is a question of continuing in the energy of the Spirit of God. If one is in the recognition of the Spirit one does not grow old, one's spirit maintains a freshness and a vigour that always suggest God to men.
It is said of those that be planted in the house of the Lord, that they shall still bring forth fruit in old age. The house is where the Spirit of God is active, and those planted there, whose roots are there, shall flourish; so that, in that way, one would never cease to be a Levite. Energy would be unabated, like Moses, of whom it is written when he was one hundred and twenty years old, that "his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated". (@Deuteronomy 34:7). That is the man. I think that is the fruit of the Spirit; it is the result of the recognition of the Spirit.
Simeon, although he was an old man, took the child Jesus up in his arms; he held the Child in priestly fashion, as it were; it was not a matter of strength, but of affection. It is said that he came by the Spirit into the temple, and he took the Babe up in his arms. How beautiful! One would love to be in that attitude in presenting Christ. It involves a measure of levitical energy, but more especially the priestly state. When it says that he came by the Spirit into the temple, it shows that it was not by his own energy or by his own wisdom he did so. All that is written is written for a purpose; in this case to show, I believe, how at the beginning it was
{457}
in the energy of the Spirit of God. Simeon is satisfied; He says, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel", (@Luke 2:29 - 32). It is as if he said, Lord, there is One here now who can undertake for thee.
One would not like to be removed unless one saw that God's things would be taken care of. No priest of God could be otherwise minded. Paul said, Having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better. Nevertheless to abide is more needful for you, and I know that I shall abide. The Lord can detain some, and He can raise up others, but Christ sees to everything, so Simeon says, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart ... for mine eyes have seen thy salvation". What a picture is this! but he does not stop there, he goes on and announces what Christ should be. "Thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel". That is what Christ is. The word *lighten* is *apocalypse* or unveiling; that is, this light should not only shine down like the sun, it is not the thought of enlightening them, but the bringing the Gentiles under God's eye. It would take some time to show how that happens, but if Christ comes to your side as Man, He brings you in before God. He brings you to God's attention, for He is the Son of man, and He is here in relation to men, and so He brings the Gentiles in before God. That is what the light does, "A light for revelation of the Gentiles". He has brought all the Gentiles in before God, in order that they might be saved. Paul speaks of himself as being "the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable,
{458}
being sanctified by the Holy Spirit" (@Romans 15: 16).
When Peter used the key to open the door to the Gentiles, God acted while Peter was yet speaking to Cornelius and his company, and the Holy Spirit fell on all them who were listening to him; God took account of what was in their hearts. He gave them the Spirit, but He gave them the Spirit in view of what was in their hearts. God looks into your heart, it is a question of what is going on there, and He acts for you in that relation. Christ is a light for the revelation of the Gentiles. Simeon makes the two announcements; "a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel". They are the outgoings of his heart to God, and then he blesses Mary and Joseph and says to Mary, "Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against", (@Luke 2:34). I desire to bring that in, for I think there is a principle in it. He is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel. I apprehend the passage to mean that if one is brought down that one is to be raised up. There must be a going down if the Lord is to raise one up. One must humble oneself before God in the light of this grace. Nothing humbles like it, for it is the goodness of God that leads to repentance. The light of this Man coming in as He did is what moves one to humble oneself before God. "Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted". (@Luke 14:11)
Then Simeon says to Mary, "Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed". What a word for a mother! How blasting to every natural hope! There is nothing to be built up on the Child in relation to nature. Surely one has to take that home, especially if one has any natural hopes in regard to Christ. How many take up Christianity in that way as an adjunct, as an aid in this world. It is not intended to
{459}
aid men in this world; the thought is to bring us down, to make nothing of us here, but to raise us up and set us among princes spiritually; so that any natural hopes that one may cherish in regard of Christ are blasted by this word. There is nothing for nature but a sword. Hannah learnt the divine way; as she says, "He bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up". (@1 Samuel 2:6).
Then further, Simeon says, "that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed"; and how many hearts were revealed, beginning with the heart of Christ, and then as the narrative of the Spirit opens out, we get the heart of Herod, of Pilate, of the soldiers, the priests, the disciples and the heart of the blessed God Himself, for one may say reverently His heart was revealed as no other was but the secrets of humanity were all brought out too. Nothing is hidden, for God shall judge the secrets of men; they will all be brought to light, but if there is anything for God in the heart, Christ brings that out too. If there is any one here who has not yet believed on Christ, but who nevertheless bears evidence of a work of God, I would like to say, God takes account of it. The thoughts of your heart may be somewhat mingled and confused, but nevertheless you *have* thoughts Christward and Godward, and God takes account of these and the saints take account of them, too, knowing that one day they will develop and you will become a believer.
May God grant that in the light of the Man set before us here, we may all be transparent! It is well that we should face this now, as everything will come into the light one day, but coming into contact with Christ now brings about a state of transparency. Paul speaks of it, he wished to be manifest in the consciences of the saints, and in Revelation attention is called to the sea of glass, referring to that transparency which marks the people of God.

SUMMARY OF TWO READINGS ON ESTHER
@Esther 1;2:8 - 17; 4:13 - 17; 5:1 - 3
It was thought we might read Esther as suggesting certain features of the assembly. There are evidently features which may be taken up as assembly exercise set out in pattern here that are not found in the other figures that we have been contemplating as relating more particularly to the assembly, and it may be helpful to view these in a simple way. No doubt the book viewed dispensationally is occupied with the exercises of the Jewish remnant, but it should have a very distinct moral bearing on us, having been written, like other scriptures, for our learning.
Esther, as raised to the throne and as standing in relation to the king in affection for he loved her, might set forth the power that flows from that position and relationship as seen in Ephesians, a power that can spiritually influence things for the preservation and protection of the saints in a scene where the enemy is ever at work to crush them and to overthrow the testimony. The privilege side of Ephesians would not be in view, but rather the position the saints are set in and how that can be turned to account for the deliverance of God's people and the furtherance of His thoughts on earth. Esther puts everything at stake, using her queenly position that she may rise to the privilege it afforded her of standing by and preserving the testimony in an evil day, making everything subservient, so to speak, to what she is as a sister, prepared, if her brethren perish, to perish with them.
We get in the first chapter the divine ideal in regard to the kingdom. The scene can be viewed as describing what will be manifest in the millennial day, the imperial rule of Christ. The Spirit of God dwells
{461}
largely on the thought of rule seen in the headship of Christ universally in the coming day, and what is emphasised is the importance of that principle permeating every household in the realm. The book thus shows how God is to secure supreme rule over the whole world and display His majesty, and how this is worked out in relation to His government, the unchanging character of which is indicated in the reference to the laws of the Medes and Persians, which alter not.
Vashti is not in sympathy with the moment; she prefers her own circle and her own feast. This carries its own warning. It typifies, perhaps, the indifference of the Jew who, as the elder son in @Luke 15, would not go in, and may be compared to the attitude of Christendom now. Then what comes to light is the way sovereignty works in the presence of such a situation to secure a responsive element.
The vision of Ahasuerus kingdom is no doubt a prophetic allusion to the kingdom of Christ. Reference is made to his "glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty", language which at once suggests Christ. The light of the kingdom in display comes to us in the way of confirmation; that is a principle in Scripture, so that chapter 1 would be a support for all that follows. Abraham was shown the land, Moses was shown the pattern of the tabernacle, and in this book the glory and magnificence of the kingdom become the light to sustain the soul in view of exercises to follow. It is Peter's line. Captives in an evil day need confirmation, those who are scattered and unknown and despised are rallied and sustained by the light of the millennial day. Esther presents a kind of complement to Ezekiel. In Ezekiel we have the light of the temple in a future day; here we have the light of the imperial character of the kingdom so that account is taken of the large number of provinces, and the
{462}
isles are brought in at the close. These two books thus fill out in a kind of prophetic way Ezra and Nehemiah, where the house and the walls of the city are built in days of adversity.
When we come to detail, the hangings of the court are interesting, as indicating the kind of atmosphere and surroundings that would mark the throne. The colours, "white, green, and blue", might speak of the purity, the fresh verdure and the heavenly character given to the kingdom down here by the heavenly city which will influence all that is set forth in figure here. Then there is the pavement, "The beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble". The pavement would no doubt suggest the complete working out and disentanglement of good and evil; a scene of rest will be introduced on that basis. The white and black marble or alabaster and black marble would seem to point to this complete disentanglement of good and evil in a public way, the public answer to the Cross.
But this is not all that the rest of God is based upon; in the blue there is added what is from heaven, while the red might suggest the distinctive character that is imparted to all the Lord effects. If what has been brought to pass in the death and resurrection of Christ is to come into public display, certain elements must be wrought out in the saints. These are set forth in what follows in the book. Mordecai considers for the rights of the king when his life is in danger; so, too, he cherishes Esther, walking in the court daily, concerned as to the promotion of what is of God here. These elements will come out in the kingdom.
Luke might, in principle, give the hangings, and Matthew the pavement. The Lord says, "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up". (@John 2:17) Luke gives you the care with which He as the anointed One enshrines
{463}
the spirit of the kingdom in the hearts of His own, and leaves them at the close in priestly care of all that is divine on earth. Then in Matthew you have the solution of every issue in connection with the disentanglement of good and evil. Kingly glory is prominent in this gospel, so we have described the way every rival will be overthrown publicly, the power of the enemy's opposition being annulled at the cross, culminating in all power in heaven and on earth being committed into the hands of the King in resurrection for God's glory and man's blessing. Rest comes in, as has been said, on that basis.
Vashti's refusal to recognize rule and to contribute to the glory of the king indicates a moral element of discord which would overthrow the universe, if that were possible, and which can only be met by the assertion of the truth of headship. It is worthy of remark that if God displays anything for the confirmation of His own, a lawless element is always brought to light, and God shows that one lawless element threatens the happiness of all. Here it was the best -- the queen. Vashti had no consideration for the glory of the king. She is like the man without the wedding garment. It is solemn to discover this element in one's heart. The woman was intended to be for the glory of the man. We learn in Vashti that the flesh will not do, that line is to come in no more before the king; if we come in it must be on the line of Esther. Vashti's rejection was according to the counsel of the wise men. They would represent those who are in the secret of the Lord for the moment, and who know what is suited to a particular crisis or emergency. They "saw the king's face". Their wisdom shines, too, in that they can get beyond the immediate details to the underlying principle. The import of Vashti's act is discerned by them, and her conduct is made but a vehicle for the establishment of the principle that is violated. The very
{464}
details of a difficulty often hinder us from arriving at the principle that is at stake.
If a crisis arises that jeopardizes the rights of the throne it must be faced in every heart and every house, and met by the unswerving maintenance of divine principles. Such crises have arisen from time to time and have threatened to overthrow everything, but the enemy has been defeated by the issue being faced. God will have rule and headship established in His kingdom, and every man should be exercised on this line as to his house. If this principle is maintained in the houses of the saints evil cannot advance at the pace with which the enemy would forward it in the world. He cannot override spiritual power, and there is great spiritual power accruing from the saints being governed by divine principles.
The speaking of our own language would set forth the influence that flows from headship. It is a sad house where there is a mixed language, as in Nehemiah's time, when the children of the Jews spake half in the speech of Ashdod and could not speak in the Jews language. @Zephaniah 3:12 speaks of the Lord leaving in their midst a poor people who would speak a pure language. One has to think of this feasting in a moral way. The thought of spiritual festivity has place in Scripture. The drinking was according to the law, so it cannot be condemned in this connection. The heart being full of wine would point to the hour of supreme joy. One has to view wine in the scriptural setting as that which cheers the heart of God and man.
It would rob the chapter of its beauty if we were to regard Ahasuerus simply as a heathen monarch, nor would the Spirit of God occupy us with details of a heathen festival. The one who refuses to grace such a scene, typically that of Christ's display, must go out; and yet what comes to light is the king finds a way to bring in what is for his glory without
{465}
weakening the commandment that has gone forth. Esther is in full accord with this, as seen in chapter 5. When all is at stake she comes in before the king in her *royal apparel*; she in principle cherishes what is for the glory of God, and is prepared to die, if need be, with those in whom that glory is to be displayed, who, moreover, are her brethren, but as queen she represents the people of God through whom He will display His glory. Haman, like Athaliah in an earlier day, would destroy *all* "the seed royal".
All the light of this in chapter 1 is intended to support us in suffering. You first get the impression of what you are suffering for, then you can afford to surrender in the sense of it. So when the throne is under alien influence the enemy's machinations are circumvented by the priestly exercises expressed in Esther; thus the saints are preserved and the hostility of the enemy is exposed and nullified. Esther indicated in her readiness to perish when the test came how well she had answered to her six months with oil of myrrh, then her delight in bringing Mordecai forward that he might be supreme showed how she answered to the six months with spices. Six months with oil of myrrh might speak of the way we are nurtured under the grace of the anointed Man; then the six months with spices would suggest the way we become graced in His spirit; not now what God is to us in Christ, but what Christ is to God having place in our hearts. Mary in @Luke 10 had her six months with oil of myrrh, and in @John 12 she comes out in the good of the spices. There is nothing like a crisis to discover how we have spent our six months!
When Esther went in to the king in chapter 2 she required nothing but what Hegai appointed; Hegai would suggest the Spirit. What is of God only desires what is divinely provided. Liquid myrrh and spices
{466}
would speak of the graces of Christ. Can we come before the King in the character and grace of the anointing? In the holy anointing oil liquid myrrh was to prevail; in the grace of that God accepts a man, so it is suggestive of what would mark the assembly. The anointing puts you in suffering sympathy with all who are suffering today for Christ. Esther did not simply send a sympathetic message to her brethren, but cast in her lot with them. She was not on the list, but she put herself on it voluntarily. "If I perish, I perish", she said. Are we on this line? Some of us could circumstantially stand aloof from the pressure on our brethren; are we ready to do so? Esther remembered she was a sister before she was a queen, and recognises her obligations to her brethren.
It is interesting to note that Miriam, the first typical sister in Scripture, comes to light as watching over and seeking to preserve that which is precious to God, the babe in the ark of bulrushes. When the *sister* is introduced is it not in this connection, as setting forth the affection that would lead one to cherish and jealously guard what is precious to God? How far are we prepared in a crisis in the history of the assembly to perish for the preservation of the saints? Paul says, "Salute Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus, *who for my life staked their own neck*", (@Romans 16: 3,4). Then in Mark's gospel the Lord says, "For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother". (@Mark 3:35). We have thought a good deal of the brotherly element, but let us not neglect what is suggested in the sister, the readiness to perish for the testimony; its continuance hangs on such a spirit. The brotherly element might have activities more in view and might be seen in Mordecai. He is outside and Esther inside, but both are governed by the same spirit.
{467}
One is reminded in this connection of the opening of Acts. The spirit of Esther is seen in the close of chapter 4, where the disciples are gathered for prayer. There is the thought of fasting and an appeal to God for the protection of the throne; then the spirit of Mordecai might be illustrated in a vessel such as Stephen, who publicly defends the throne. In the prayer of the disciples we can realise how they discerned that all was aimed at them in the hostility of the enemy was really aimed at the throne.
Mordecai in result gets his right place in the kingdom, first in testimony in chapter 6, and finally in public administration in chapter 9. Thus we find the faithfulness of the saints in this way causes the schemes of the enemy to issue in Christ being brought into public evidence. In Philippians the magnifying of Christ among the saints means they "stand fast in one spirit ... and in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God". (@Philippians 1:27,28).
Haman, in presence of Mordecai's exaltation, departs to his house in shame. What is set forth in Haman has to be judged in one's own heart. No doubt he represents Antichrist, but John tells us already there are many Antichrists. He represents a great Babylonish element that would command respect from the flesh, but would destroy what is of God. How important to judge every principle in one's heart that would answer to what has been set aside. Haman's ten sons were hanged on the gallows. Every product of Babylon must be unsparingly dealt with. "Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones". (@Psalm 137:9).
Finally the blessing extends to the whole empire. The most distant part of the realm renders the king his due. It says, he "laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea", and Mordecai becomes
{468}
acceptable to all. He was "next unto Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed". A beautiful suggestion of the conditions which will exist in "the habitable world which is to come of which we speak" (Hebrews 2:5), for the display of which all creation waits. Then shall be seen "the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days".

Pages 469 - 513 -- "The Revelation of God in Luke and John". December, 1920 (Volume 51).
THE REVELATION OF GOD IN LUKE AND IN JOHN
@Luke 7:11 - 18; @John 11:1 - 5; 32 - 46
J.T. The subject is rather a large one, but I thought we might touch it very briefly. The scriptures read should help as to the distinction which has to be made between the revelation of God as presented in Luke and as presented in John. Luke presents the compassion side, the compassion of God; John, the love of God. I was connecting it in my mind with the "appearance of a man" presented in Ezekiel on the throne, and the expressions "from the appearance of his loins even downward" and "from the appearance of his loins even upward". (@Ezekiel 1:26,27). We might see in Luke the thought of the man "from the appearance of his loins even downward", and in John "from the appearance of his loins even upward". Love is connected with the counsels of God, but we see the form which the love takes in relieving you and me in the way of compassion "from the appearance of the loins even downward". Perhaps Romans might be taken to correspond with the loins downward, and Ephesians with the loins upward, the great love of God in connection with His counsels.
R.D. You have taken up two scriptures speaking of the raising of the dead?
J.T. The widow of Nain is not said to be loved by the Lord; it is not said that He knew her before. It was entirely a question of compassion for her, the Lord taking account of her need, whereas in John the Lord knew the persons concerned, those who were affected, and it says He loved each of them. Death being the most powerful means of affecting the human race, it becomes in that way an occasion of meeting its effects, of God showing consideration either in the way of compassion or in the way of love.
{470}
R.D. In John, the Lord having set His heart on each one of those mentioned, there is the purpose of God in view?
J.T. I think so. We have to take account of death as affecting the family of God, which is loved by the Lord and already known to Him. Jordan was the great barrier between the wilderness and the land; it would correspond with @John 11 in that way.
W.L. You would look on death not only as the penalty of sin, but as the expression of the love of God?
J.T. It was in the death of Christ that the love of God was expressed. I think Romans presents the death of Christ from the compassion side, and Ephesians from the love side. The compassion side is wider because it takes in the whole race, humanity is in view.
R.D. The last scripture has the family of God in view?
J.T. Yes, and the accomplishment of His counsels in the family.
E.T. Luke brings out the side of grace?
J.T. That is what I had in mind, and I hoped it might move us a little as to the gospel. It may be those who are specially privileged may limit themselves a little too much to the family side, and lose sight of the compassion side.
R.D. I am glad you speak of that, because it is a present exercise. The Lord is engaged at the present moment in both these ways.
J T. I am sure He is. He is engaged in the gospel: I am sure of it; the compassions of the Lord are toward all. He had compassion on the widow; it does not say that He loved her.
Ques. Would you say God loves the world?
J.T. Well; it is put in the past tense, "God so loved". (@John 3:16). I should not like to put it in the present, because the world is exposed. It has shown its hand
{471}
as opposed to God and to Christ; but that was how it stood *then*.
E.T.S. There is still compassion for anyone in the world.
J.T. Yes, certainly. It is answered by that word in @Romans 3:22, "towards all". Then in chapter 5:8 you have, "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us". It does not say He commends His love toward man. In Titus it speaks of the kindness and love of God, but that is more the idea of philanthropy.
W.L. When God gave His only begotten Son, the world disclosed itself as hostile to God, but the magnificent proof of His love still stands.
J.T. Yes, but you must not go beyond Scripture.
J.P. "Whosoever believeth"; that is present.
J.T. Just so; that I am sure is important. One has very little difficulty about anyone speaking of the love of God to the world, but it is well to be accurate, and Scripture is infinitely accurate. I suppose the reference is to the world as it then existed, and this in the abstract will come about in the future. The world had not disclosed itself then as hostile to God and to Christ. I suppose you can always draw attention to what God has done.
R.D. You have to follow that on to get the benefit of it: "He gave", "that whosoever".
J.T. The force of "whosoever" there is that it applies to the Gentile as well as to the Jew. John's writings discredit the claims of the Jew. The love of God is spoken of in Romans, but when it comes to beseeching, the apostle beseeches by the compassions of God. The general thought in Romans is compassion.
Ques. Is not His love behind the compassion?
J.T. Yes, surely. So I have referred to Ezekiel because it is God in a Man, and the prophet saw the appearance of fire from the loins upward and from
{472}_____
the loins downward. If God is to act judicially, it is wholly in keeping with His love. In Revelation you see the Lord girt about with a golden girdle; the love is pent up, but it is there. God is love; and whether it takes the form of compassion or of direct affection, it is love. Love is what He is.
W.L. Would you not say that God was love before there was any need?
J.T. Yes. In Ephesians it is that we might be holy and without blame before Him in love; that to my mind is connected with "the loins upward". It was on account of His great love wherewith He loved us. He acts toward us in that way because of His great love; it is not exactly taking compassion on us, but it is because of His great love. @1 Timothy 2:3,4 says, that supplications and prayers should be made for all men, and then it goes on to say, "God our Saviour: who will have all men to be saved".
R.D. The scripture you are calling attention to in Timothy presents the world just as it is; "kings, and for all that are in authority", (@1 Timothy 2:2) and your outlook is in regard to the gospel, God's thoughts for men generally.
J.T. Yes, and I think we need to be reminded of the fact that atheism is brought in by the enemy to meet the great awakening. There is great poverty as to the preaching side of the word; there is very little public gospel testimony now. Those whom the Lord may have used in the past have passed off the scene, and they are not followed up by others. There seems a great dearth of gospel testimony in the world.
F.W.B. Why is that?
J.T. I am rather afraid that those who are privileged to have light from God have been too circumscribed.
R.D. It is quite possible that we lack compassion. We need to come under the hand of the Lord as He is
{473}
presented here to have our souls filled with His feelings towards men generally.
J.T. That is exactly the exercise I have; that we might be able to have compassion for men as they are, in all their circumstances. I think Romans, if rightly understood, would move us to take account of all men. There is a great movement among men for spiritual satisfaction. There is very little today to oppose atheism. The influence of God is recognised in the spiritual world, but the enemy is making use of it to bring in the grossest error.
R.D. Paul's spirit was stirred within him when he saw what was going on at Athens. The moral beauty of the incident in @Luke 7 is that the compassions are fully adequate to the need.
J.T. In Luke, when the Lord calls the apostles, He first prays the whole night. He names the apostles, then He descends with them to the plain. They get down to the level of men. Being up with the Lord in the mount, you come on to the plain with Him. I think Paul beautifully illustrates it, because he is on the plain with men. He identifies himself with them: "For in him we live, and move and have our being;" (Acts 17:28). He is on the same level as they are.
E.T.S. Do not evangelists sometimes develop into teachers?
J.T. Young brothers find in preaching an outlet for spiritual energy that they could not find otherwise.
W.L. We are sometimes apt to think that the end of the dispensation is so near that the gospel day is over.
R.D. I am thankful for these exercises; it is desirable that there should be a distinct testimony in the gospel before we go.
J.T. "And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely". (@Revelation 22:17). That seems particularly applicable today.
{474}
Ques. Have you any thought that there should be a going out into the highways and by-ways?
J.T. I think so, if we are sufficiently humble about it. Ezekiel helps us in that respect. These are humiliating days: it is a day of captivity outwardly. God has allowed the world to captivate the church; if there is to be recovery, it must be on individual lines. Ezekiel tells us that he sat among the captives.
P.S.P. It was when the house of Israel showed themselves to be humbled and ashamed of all that they had done, that the prophet could show them the form of the house and the *outgoings* thereof, as well as the comings in thereof.
J.T. Quite so.
R.D. Do you not think that the compassions and the opportunity meet? If we were moved with compassion, there would be an open door for us. When the servant came back he said, "Yet there is room".
Ques. In the revelation of God, you would include the gospel as set forth in John as well as in Luke?
J.T. Yes, but Luke runs alongside of the assembly testimony. The breakdown had not occurred. The ministry of the gospel is Luke and Romans, the ministry of the assembly Colossians and Ephesians.
R.D. Paul pursued his service until the saints came into the good of the "loins upward".
Ques. Do brothers drop the gospel as they get older, or do they present it in a different way, as knowing it perhaps a little better?
J.T. Well, Paul did not drop it. He says, "that by me the preaching might be fully known". (@2 Timothy 4:17). He dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, preaching the kingdom of God. No doubt the more developed he was, the more fully he could present it.
F.W.B. Do you connect the gospel more with the grace of God than with the love of God?
J.T. Yes, I do.
{475}
F.W.B. What do you understand by the gospel of the grace of God?
J.T. Grace is God acting from Himself, adapting Himself to human need. The two ministries should go together. God would not tell anyone to preach unless he was qualified. Anyone with the gift of an evangelist would be instructed by the Lord before he was sent out to preach. They were taken up to be with Him; as with Him,. He would instruct them as to what was in His mind,
J.P. The Lord had compassion on the widow. I thought it was on the line of @Psalm 72:12 "The poor also, and him that hath no helper". It is the blessed Man who is in authority.
J.T. It does not follow that because a man has the gift of an evangelist, he has not another.
Ques. What would answer to the city in @Luke 7:11?
J.T. The world systematised, the world beautified. All that the world can do is to turn out the dead body of a man.
Ques. Would you encourage young believers as soon as they are converted to begin to preach?
J.T. I would not. A man has to be sent from God to preach. The principle is set out in @Acts 11. Barnabas went to Tarsus to seek Saul, and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch: he was at Antioch a whole year, going in and out among the saints. The preachers are first of all well-known in their locality. A preacher needs to be qualified, and to have the fellowship of his brethren. He should have the opportunity of moving among his brethren and getting acquainted with them. The Lord would first of all instruct us as to what is in His mind. The Lord had wrought at Antioch before Paul and Barnabas went there, and had provided what was requisite for the assembly. In undertaking any work that seems to have a public bearing, we
{476}
ought to make it clear that we are humble about the position. If we turn to the Lord in recognition of the need, He would make opportunities and give power to meet the need.
R.D. We see in John that God is love, also that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
J.T. Yes. In @Isaiah 6:8 there was the need of a messenger. "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" The Lord is on the throne: there is no lack in that way, there is power for any ministry. Am I prepared to take up a service of that kind? One should have the confidence of his brethren in what he is doing. Gift is not local: it is for the whole assembly. God has set certain "in the assembly". (@1 Corinthians 12:28). The thought of a local gift would add something to our locality. In @Luke 4:43, the Lord preached at Nazareth where He had been brought up, but He says, "I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also".
{477}
LIFE AND LIBERTY
@John 12:1 - 11
Ques. The man who died in chapter 11 was a member of the family of God.
J.T. The Lord is said to have loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus, linking them as a family. He speaks of Lazarus later in the chapter as "our friend". The chapter suggests a family known intimately and loved of the Lord, and such a family affected by death. Death is viewed in John as to its effects on the people of God; in Luke it is more the Red Sea aspect. The Red Sea was an extended body of water, suggestive of the general power of death over man. Jordan was condensed in a river, and suggests a more limited thought: it was the barrier between the people of God and the promised land. It was that which stood in the way of the accomplishment of the counsels of God's love.
E.L.M. There is no thought of an association formed in Luke, whereas in John there are links formed. What are the links that would enable us to pass from one to the other?
J.T. The woman in Simon's house in @Luke 7 is a continuation of the subject. The Lord says to her, "thy faith hath saved thee: go in peace". (verse 50). That would not be the end of her history: she would find the Lord in more congenial circumstances than Simon's house. Compassion acted in Simon's house, but it was not the place to form family association.
R.D. Having been touched by the Lord's compassion, the women are found in the next chapter following the Lord and ministering to Him.
J.T. Quite so; that is very good. It is ministry, but not the formation of family affections.
Ques. Is Luke on the line of extrication, and John, of introduction into the family?
{478}
J.T. Yes. In Luke, at the end of chapter 10, Mary is learning, listening to His word. The next chapter says the Lord was praying, and the disciples say, "Lord, teach us to pray". (@Luke 11:1). That leads on to the Holy Spirit. "How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" (verse 13). The Holy Spirit received would link us on with John. I think the link is in the Holy Spirit. So Romans develops the truth on the same line. You may go from @Romans 8 into Ephesians. In that chapter the truth of the Holy Spirit is presented in many connections. Having received the Spirit of sonship, whereby we cry; "Abba, Father", you are in the family.
R.D. It refers to His children, so that you can move into John's ministry from that point?
J.T. Clearly. In @John 11 there was a family without a head. That is how matters stood in the Old Testament: there was no head,
R.D. In the tenth chapter, the matter is settled for the sheep.
J.T. In the house at Bethany there were a brother and sisters, but the Lord was not yet known as Head. He was a Friend of the family only. I think chapter 12 shows the sequel to chapter 11. It is a result of the service rendered by the Lord. Lazarus is let go: he is a typical man. He is not given back to anyone, as the young man in @Luke 7; who was delivered to his mother. Lazarus is let go.
R.D. You see affinity there: he moved into the family circle.
J.T. Chapter 12 gives us the circle in which Christ is supreme. Before, He was not supreme, although He was held in honour. Luke does not present the family circle. The beginning of chapter 8 is the outcome of the seventh; those who had grace ministered to them became ministers; they ministered unto Him. But here was a family without a
{479}
head; there were no parents It is the same circle, but you have the element of resurrection introduced into it: "Where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead".
E.L.M. That circle is proof against death.
J.T. That which is presented in the beginning of the twelfth chapter is a living thing. In the eleventh the family is there, but the pressure of death is on it. The Lord enters into that, feeling it on their account. When He saw Mary weeping and the Jews weeping, He wept, and shuddered. He took account of the awfulness of death and its effect on the people of God, He was "deeply moved in himself", we read. We can hardly take that in. He shuddered, but it shows how really He took account of death. The thing has become so common that the reality of it is hidden from view. In Jairus's house the little girl was dead, but they had flute minstrels there, making a noise, taking the edge off the experience. The Lord put them all out. Here Jesus wept and not only so, but He groaned, and was troubled.
E.L.M. Whilst He touched the bier in Luke we do not read of Him acting in that way here.
R.D. The Son of God is glorified in chapter 11.
J.T. Yes, His Person is brought into view.
R.D. That is the way the Lord becomes endeared to our hearts: He removes all the pressure. You do not think of the family of God as a circle where there is any pressure at all.
J.T. No, the pressure of death is not there. The Lord knew the cause of their sorrow, and He entered into it. The Son of God is dealing with death; we are on the brink of Jordan.
P.J.F. God had visited His people: we have the compassion of God in that, but in John it is, "Behold, how he loved him".
J.T. Yes. I was noticing that: the love of the Lord comes into evidence. The children are being
{480}
set free: "Loose him and let him go". Where will they go? Lazarus is let go: where does he go? Chapter 12 shows where he goes.
R.D. There seems to have been a goodly company there: the disciples were there too, but Lazarus is the leading figure. As "my brethren" is the leading thought in chapter 20, so Lazarus is the thought here. Christ's companions are those that are risen.
E.L.M. Everyone there has in principle been served by the Lord in the way that Lazarus has.
J.T. The Holy Spirit occupies your mind with Him because He wants to impress you with the sequel. There they made Him a supper, and Christ is supreme amongst them. The epistles free us from the grave clothes, then we come back to the gospels. If the Christian is released from all the grave clothes, where is he going? What does he read? Christ is before him now. If he reads Scripture it is Christ, and in the gospels the Old Testament scriptures are referred to as speaking of Christ -- "they are they which testify of me". (@John 5:39). The epistles speak of the holy Scriptures as meeting our need. Every Scripture is inspired of God, and is profitable, "that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good work". (@2 Timothy 2:17). In the gospels the Scriptures are spoken of in reference to Christ. "He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself". (@Luke 24:27). You read the Old Testament with Christ before you, and that is how you feed. Otherwise you read the Scriptures to minister to yourself, or to preach from. The Scriptures testify of Him, and you ought to know what they speak of Him.
Thus there is a living man set forth, and he is at liberty. John takes account of what is effected in the man. In Luke he is given back to his mother, but here he is set at liberty, and he knows where to go. This man is known to the Lord; He calls him by name. His sheep are viewed in chapter 11 as
{481}
under the pressure of death, and He calls them by name. The glory of God is seen in that a man came forth from the grave, but he came forth bound. The Lord does not take off the grave clothes. He does what we cannot do, but what we can do He allows us to do. "Loose him and let him go". This brings in brotherly love and consideration, so that you have not only the Lord endeared to you, but the brother as well.
Ques. Is that the way He wrought with Saul of Tarsus?
J.T. Yes; he was told to go into the city, and there it would be told him what he had to do. Ananias comes in in that connection. Saul opened his eyes on a brother; after that he preached Christ as the Son of God. In that family circle the affections of the Son of God are in activity. Paul spent certain days with the brethren, then he preached in the synagogues, wherever there was an opening.
Luke presents man in his need; but when you view a Christian as identified with the work of God, you can trust him; he can be let go; he is in the circle of life. One great mark of the persons the Lord delights in is life.
In Acts the apostles are not in evidence in the Lord's operations from the sixth to the ninth chapters, with the exception of their connection with Samaria, which was dispensational. The work was carried on by the two deacons, but when the record of the apostolic service is resumed in chapter 9 we must have life. Things must not depend on those who have an official place. Every saint must be taught how to act for himself. So Peter says to Aeneas, "Jesus, the Christ heals thee; rise up, and make thy couch *for thyself*". (@Acts 9:34). He does not make it for him, though he raised him up through the power of God. Then in Dorcas you have one who had been active, but she died, in spite of her activity. When Peter came,
{482}
they showed him all the garments that she had made; but those who were concerned were only the widows. Peter goes to her chamber and puts them all out, raises her up, and then he calls the *saints* and the widows and presents her alive. That is all that is said about her. The point was not garment making, but life. John's ministry develops that. There is life abundantly. That is what God looks for now. The hymn book, for instance, however excellent it may be, can never be a perfect vehicle for the out-goings of divine affections, because the New Testament does not contain a formal instrument for the outgoings of the affections of God's people. The Old Testament had a book of Psalms; it was intended to be the means by which the people of. God could express their worship. In the New Testament it says, they sang a hymn; we are not told what the hymn was. It is for us to see that we approach God on the basis of life; that we are living. One evidence of life is that the odour of the ointment will fill the house. I would not disparage the hymn book for a moment, but it is often employed beyond the state of those who use it. The best hymns are given out most frequently, but when I give out a hymn the question should be: Is that hymn in keeping with my state of soul? Or am I giving it out because it is customary to give it out? You cannot limit the Holy Spirit. "We are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God". (@Philippians 3:3). There should be constant progress on that line. It is really in accord with Colossians -- life, and a company in resurrection. The question is what you have. "I will speak of the things which I have made touching the King;" (@Psalm 45:1). It is that which cost Mary something. Lazarus represents one side, Mary another: she had the ointment and that was the precious thing. We are risen by faith of the operation of God, but Mary is more that we are quickened with Him; that is the work in the soul. The movements
{483}
in chapter 12 are all normal and right: all are in order. From this point the counsels of God are developed. Colossians lead on to Ephesians. The anointing of the feet would involve following Him in a reverent way. "She has this against the day of my burial". She saw what was before Him; she was intelligent in what she was doing. One's part now is governed by intelligence, but the spirit comes first: "I will sing with the spirit". (@1 Corinthians 14:15). What about that hymn? Does it express what is in your spirit? Then is it a hymn that suits the present circumstances? That is intelligence. What Mary did was intelligent. It must have been most pleasing to Christ, because she was in accord with His own mind. The widow in @Luke 7 thought of what was past, and what He had brought in for her, but Mary thought of His departure by way of death; she entered into His mind. They made Him a supper; there is not a word about the benefits she had acquired.
Judas has his counterpart in Christendom. It suggests a warning as to making everything of the compassion side: he speaks of the poor; the Lord had said, the gospel is preached to the poor. You get people bringing in one side of the truth to nullify the other, and Judas shows that spirit, which the saints are also exposed to. This incident beautifully helps us to understand how one holds the Head in affection, and how as we are true to Christ He defends us.
Ques. What place has Martha?
J.T. She serves: that is a very important feature in the house of God. She is not burdened with it here. When service burdens us we are hindered. "Let not thine hands be slack". (@Zephaniah 3:16). There is great need now, and the question is whether one is doing what one's hand finds to do. There is much work for the sisters too: the book of Proverbs is largely made
{484}
up of the activities of the woman. The virtuous woman knows how to serve in the absence of her husband. One is to be "fully fitted to every good work". (@2 Timothy 3:17) One has not necessarily to be an evangelist, but to do the *work* of an evangelist. It says Martha *served*. Peter's wife's mother arose and served *them*, meaning those that might have caused her annoyance when she was ill of a fever; the effect of the Lord's work was she served them. In another gospel it says she served *Him*. Here the emphasis is on *service*. In the circle of the saints there is work for each one. Lazarus represents the position, the status; Mary the intelligence; Martha service, the practical side.
Ques. What is life?
J.T. It is power of action. "I am come that they might have life". (@John 10:10) "He that liveth and believeth in me shall never die". The principle of life is worked out Godward. If God is to be approached, it must be in a living way. Dorcas is presented living, a living person. Christ was crucified in weakness, but He lives by the power of God. So Paul says, "we shall live with him ... towards you". (@2 Corinthians 13:4) They would find out that the power of life was in Paul. Christ is our life according to @Colossians 3, but if that be so, Christ will come into evidence in a moral way. Lazarus describes the status of all who are there. I think that the power of life lies in the sense of being quickened together with Christ.
Our safety lies in not having a place. If you seek to be anything different from your brethren, you become a persecutor. It is greater to be a brother than a gift. "I look for him with the brethren", (@1 Corinthians 16:11) was said about Timothy. Timothy does not seek to be anything different from the brethren; he comes with them, instead of their going with him. It shows how Paul thought of the brethren. One would never like to be a prominent one in a company, but to be
{485}
one of them. They made Him a supper: the Lord is in their hearts; it is the idea of the circle. "One is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are brethren". (@Matthew 23:8) Mary had said, "If thou hadst been here my brother had not died", and now it is no longer Lazarus, but Christ. This is a picture of the circle on earth; it is Philadelphia in principle, brotherly love.
{486}
THE REGION OF THE SPIRIT
@Colossians 2
J.T. It helps in regard of Colossians to see that they were marked by order. The apostle said; "I am with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order". What we may call the wilderness side was right: they were regulated, externally at least, by divine order. Romans and 1 Corinthians run together in that way. The Colossians were regulated by the principles that should govern the assembly publicly; but what the apostle is aiming at is to lead them into spiritual regions, and the question of order does not enter into that. The idea of furniture marks the room where the Lord's supper was instituted, but in @John 20, which corresponds with this epistle, we do not find any reference to furniture:
R.D. Luke's gospel presents the Supper from the wilderness side; everything is in order.
J.T. Paul refers to their order here, so that there were conditions for going on to what was spiritual. In @Luke 22:12 the Lord says: "he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready"; furniture being in keeping with what is external, everything must be in order.
R.D. It also refers to the time in Luke's gospel. We are within time limitations.
J.T. 1 Corinthians gives instructions for what you might call the ritual, and we must not make light of it, because it was the very point they were defective in. Paul said to them, "ye come together ... for the worse", (@1 Corinthians 11:17) for they were in disorder as to what should take place in the assembly.
Ques. Would that govern our feelings towards one another?
J.T. I think so, because he goes on to say:
{487}t
"everyone taketh before other his own supper". One isolates oneself perhaps in relation to a few in the meeting, in that way not embracing *all* the saints. The apostle makes a good deal of the order that is becoming; it embraces the state of the saints because the disorder was the outcome of a bad state; not indeed but what we may be orderly outwardly and yet have a bad state. But there was a bad state at Corinth; there were sects. One has to be regulated individually, according to the ensign of his father's house (@Numbers 2:2); then the priestly family comes in. You may be right individually, but without the priestly state you cannot have things for God.
In the beginning of Numbers you have each individual, then his locality, his father's house, his tribe; all that is external, but the priestly family secures things for God. The apostle makes much in the first letter to the Corinthians of the fact that they observed the regulations, and he praises them; but where they did not; he says, I do not praise you. "God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all assemblies of the saints". (@1 Corinthians 14:33) The book of Numbers helps greatly in regard of Corinthians, because in the first part of the book it is a question of the order that is suited to God in connection with the tent of testimony. But after the Holy Spirit is formally recognised in @Numbers 21 you read very little about the tabernacle, because it is a question now of what is inward, what is wholly spiritual, and that leads up to Colossians. What is spiritual runs within certain limits.
Ques. In chapter 11 of 1 Corinthians he does not take us beyond the wilderness?
J.T. No, not beyond what is external, tarrying one for another, and so on; the chapter ends with that. What comes after the breaking of bread is seen in Colossians. The spiritual state of the saints
{488}
and the headship of Christ come into evidence, and these are not set in moulds; they set us wholly outside of time limitations. There is no description in Colossians; it is a question of what you find out, things to be known and enjoyed. There must be adjustment of what refers to the earth before we can take up what refers to heaven. It is due to God that this should be so. What @1 Corinthians 11 describes is the order of God in the present creation; that is, the relative position of the man and the woman that must be understood and recognised before we can come to the Supper.
Ques. What is the difference between Christ as Head of every man and Christ as Head of the body?
J.T. In the body there is neither sister nor brother, male nor female; a sister has direct access to Christ, there is no thought of the man coming in between. You could not have things right in the assembly without recognising the order that God has set up outside, because in Corinthians the assembly is a public thing. As loving Christ, you accord Him His place in regard of the first creation. In @John 20 the enemy was Judaism, but in the Greek world it was philosophy and vain deceit. "The doors being shut", shows that there was a wholesome fear of an element that was then threatening and that would spoil everything. But the spiritual realm is not bounded by what is material; the Lord comes in in spite of closed doors. One person who is harbouring what is prejudicial to the meeting is sure to damage the whole; we feel it. So the Supper helps us to close the door; it is there where everything is judged. Each one has to discern for himself what is in his own heart. "Not discerning the body" refers to the Lord's body.
Ques. Might we break bread and partake of the cup and yet not take the Supper?
J.T. Yes, the true import of it might not be
{489}
discerned; hence we have, "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you". For what cause? Just because there was no self-judgment. One has to appropriate the significance of the death of the Lord; you would come to the Supper with a sense of judgment. As sanctified by the body of Jesus Christ, one is in accord with the body. It is a dead Christ that is before us publicly; that is what we are committed to; the life separate from the body, in the blood. It is exceedingly solemn. So if you partake of the emblems unjudged, it is eating and drinking judgment to yourself. If you are in accord with the death of Christ, there is no room for religious flesh of any kind.
In Colossians the apostle can go on to the entrance into Canaan. It is not a question of outward order, but of spiritual state, the headship of Christ. The Supper sets the affections in motion, and there is now a readiness to go on. "Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away". (@Song of Solomon 2:13) The Lord would take us up and lead us on. How far can you go spiritually? "The firmness of your faith" must govern everything: He is leading on to spiritual lines. "Jesus the Lord", (verse 6), refers to Romans and Corinthians; it keeps up the connection, but *Christ* is the point in Colossians. You have what belongs to Colossians set in @Romans 8 to complete the subject: "If Christ be in you", but it is not developed. Here the Lord is brought in, but the point is the headship of: Christ; "the Christ, Jesus the Lord". Christ is everything, and in all. Romans and Corinthians go together, Romans dealing with the individual and Corinthians with the saints viewed collectively, whereas Colossians recognises both, but it is to lead us on to spiritual lines. "So walk ye in him" would refer to your everyday circumstances. You did not receive Him in connection with philosophy; as you have received Him, so walk in Him.
{490}
Ques. As to the Lord being known in the midst, is that only on the spiritual side?
J.T. Well, I think He comes to us on our side, but you could hardly expect Him to come where there is disorder.
Ques. No, but does He come according to @Matthew 18, to support and make us know His power and control, or is it to know His presence as in @John 20?
J.T. @Matthew 18 refers to our position in administration here: the Lord comes in to support us in anything that we have to do in His Name. It is not, "I will come to you", but "there *am* I"; it is unfailing. @John 14 is, "I am coming to you", without saying what He comes for. If you apprehend the Lord in a spiritual way, you pass over; His coming is a wholly spiritual thing. Then you discern that He is connected with a wholly new order of things; that is where spiritual enjoyment lies. We apprehend Him as "everything and in all", that is, in relation to God. As we come together, we have before us the fact that Christ has died here. So it is, "As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death". (@1 Corinthians 11:26) The fact before us is that He has died. I sit down in the presence of these emblems and let the thought settle in my soul that it is the Lord's death. But that is not all, there is a spiritual side. Luke brings forward external order; "a large upper room furnished", because it is a question of what is of God being maintained in an adverse scene, so that there must be order. Now that all that was against us has been taken out of the way, there is nothing to hinder the soul from going in. So when you come to the Jordan, the waters have disappeared. He destroyed principalities and powers; the higher you ascend, the more you realise the extent of His victory. We are apt to think that we can carry in some little distinction that we have in the flesh. The last enemy is death, death as seen in
{491}
Jordan, which stands between the people of God and the inheritance. The people's history now is from the bottom of the Jordan: the stones came up from the bottom of the river; there is a people out of death. Baptism in Colossians is not like baptism in Romans; in Colossians you have not only burial, but resurrection.
Ques. What is the difference between baptism and circumcision?
J.T. Circumcision means that all that attaches to you as a man is put off; "Mortify therefore". So that whatever attaches to you, and perhaps very strongly, has to go: you have to make sharp knives. It might be ancestry, or learning, or money, all that goes to make up what we are in this world; it requires something sharp to cut that off.
The thought of burial is very important; we are all disposed to cling to what gives us a little advantage. Burial is not only that I die, but that I disappear altogether. Adam was to go into the ground from whence he was taken. So here, my old history is closed up in the burial. The order in Colossians is circumcision before baptism; I think circumcision is involved in the reception of the Holy Spirit. Historically it comes in with baptism, although in Cornelius's case they received the Holy Spirit before they were baptised. It is in the power of the Holy Spirit that you put to death your members which are on the earth, not the body, but the members which are on the earth. Christ died vicariously, and if He died vicariously, He was buried vicariously. Adam had to go back into the ground from whence he was taken; that had to be accomplished in Christ for us. When the Lord said, "It is finished", He had all that in mind. From the grave we have a totally new beginning; we come up out of the grave. The Son of man in the heart of the earth is a sign of what would come about in all whom He represented.
{492}
His burial is treated of, as is His death in @Romans 6. God begins there; He takes up Christ out of death.
"Putting off the body of the flesh" is positional; the next chapter is the active side. I am entitled to take it up in the power of the Spirit. This chapter is to clear the ground; we have always to come back to Gilgal; it has to be maintained. In @Joshua 6 you have the man with a drawn sword: Joshua says, "Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?" The Lord says, "Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come". It is for you to find out what I am going to do; I am not on party lines. You see the saints in relation to God. It is not "our meeting", but what the saints are Godward, and you wait to see what He will do. @John 12 shows that risen people, those who are spiritually on the ground of resurrection, act rightly; it is not what He did, but what they do. They know how to do things in relation to Christ; they are energised by Christ, and He accepts what they do. Colossians is "being let go", and Ephesians is where we go. I remember someone telling me that Mr. Darby asked Mr. Stoney where he put Colossians: he said, 'It is not Canaan exactly, it is *entering*'; it is the adjusting period. The man with a drawn sword comes in there; the sword is, "Have your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on the earth". (@Colossians 3:2) It is like the boundary that keeps you from going back to the earth again; you go over to the other side.
{493}
THE ADVANCE OF THE TESTIMONY AND PETER'S RELATION THERETO
@Acts 9:23 - 43
It is well known to those familiar with the early part of the Acts that while the record of Peter's service practically ceases at the end of chapter 5, the thread of it is resumed in chapter 9, and what I have in mind is to show, by the Lord's help, the result of this new service, or new exercise of apostolic power. The early chapters, as we all know, are full of Peter's service; indeed, so prominent was he and so effective, that even his shadow was looked to and reckoned upon for relief; and yet notwithstanding that, and the great effectiveness of his service there is a break, chapter 6 introducing a development among the saints of a certain sectional feeling. The Hellenist believers murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. Notice it was *their* widows, those in the Greek provinces. If they had complained about the neglect of widows *in general*, it would have been a different matter, though, indeed, it is serious to complain at all in regard to the things of God; any complaint must be established on a solid foundation to be justifiable at all. I think the word "murmuring" is used for the first time in Scripture in this chapter in relation to Christians, and it certainly is a sinister feature in the things of God. Now, the Hebrew widows were of just as much interest to Christ as the Hellenist widows, both were equally precious as believers to Christ; *He* has no sectional feeling at all. You will recall how John in alluding to John the baptist in his gospel says. "He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world"; (@John 1:8,9) or, as it should read, "which
{494}
coming into the world lightens *every man*", @John 1:8,9. That is what Christ is; He is concerned about *all*. And so the house of God, being a general thought, and embracing all the saints, is cared for by Christ, watched over by Him; and He has, as I said, no preferences of any kind as regards persons, nations or cities. Hence the development recorded in chapter 6 is a very sinister one, for the element of murmuring is introduced as the result of divisional discrimination.
Now, I mention this at the outset as giving rise to the new movement on the part of the Lord, for if the enemy moves, taking advantage of a low state among the people of God, the Lord will also move and His movement will more than outwit and withstand that of the enemy. So here we have a completely new departure. The apostles meet the complaint raised by suggesting to the brethren that seven men be appointed to take up the matter. We have other business to do, they virtually say, than serve tables, our business is to minister the word and pray. Most worthy work, surely! But they were circumscribing their activities, for widows and needy ones *have* to be attended to; we cannot evade that. The need of the saints, whether spiritual or otherwise, is of paramount importance. Indeed, there must be *no* need; as Paul says, things are to be "on the principle of equality"; there is to be a levelling up, as one might say, so that need may be met. Even the apostle Paul himself was ready to carry the saints bounty to Jerusalem, in order that all that was necessary might be supplied. So here the twelve, realising that there was sectional feeling working amongst the saints, said, "Look ye out among *you* seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business". That was very wise. The saints were put on themselves, so to speak, they were to select
{495}
seven men *from themselves*, and what is to be noted is that the Hellenists got the advantage, showing that the Spirit of Christ was, as yet, dominant among the saints. We may thank God for that. The Hebrews did not arrogate anything to themselves, they did not supply all the persons; the deacons, judging by their names, were mostly Hellenists. So we see the Lord triumphs here, as He will in relation to anything that arises as the product of a low state among the people of God. The wrong feeling referred to appears to have been met; right men came forward to deal with the matter, and among them Stephen, a man, the word tells us, "full of faith and of the Holy Spirit". We may well accept in a humble spirit things that are humbling among the people of God, sensible that the Lord triumphs, as He does here, taking occasion by the very complaint to introduce a man like Stephen.
So now the work develops under two of the deacons, Stephen and Philip. The former was found with a face like that of an angel. What a face was his! First, we are told, the men who disputed with him could not resist the wisdom and spirit with which he spake. The Lord is pleased to put him forward, and indeed the enemy compelled him to come to the front, for he was attacked, and the very attack brought out the spirit of his Master. It says that they could not resist his wisdom and spirit, and then it adds, that as he stood in the council, "Looking steadfastly on him (they) saw his face as it had been the face of an angel". It is a wonderful outcome and triumph from the petty murmuring and national feeling existing among the people of God. The enemy is defeated, the testimony develops, and is marked by this remarkable address of Stephen recorded in chapter 7, ending with the wonderful reflection of his Master already referred to. He "kneeled down", the word says. Think of a man in
{496}
an atmosphere rife with murderous hatred, his life being beaten out of him with stones, kneeling down and crying to the Lord for the pardon of his *murderers*!
Then in the next chapter we have Philip. He goes to preach, though without a commission; and the apostles are introduced in verse 14 to link on with Jerusalem the work which the Lord had been carrying on in Samaria apart from them. They pray and the Holy Spirit is given through the laying on of their hands. What I wanted to bring out is what we may look for where there is any retirement on the part of those immediately responsible in the house of God. The Lord proceeds in His own way, for the work must be done. If we impose limits on the sphere of our activities, the Lord says, as it were, If your sphere is not as great as Mine, I shall go on with Mine. "Lift up your eyes", He said to the disciples, "and look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest", (@John 4: 35). The harvest belongs to Christ and if my service does not extend to the whole field, the Lord will bring in others, for the harvest must be attended to and He is Lord of it. A very great obligation rests on those who have light from the Lord; if *He* impose limits we must abide by them, but let us not impose limitations for ourselves, let our sphere of responsibility not be any less than the whole house of God. The word says that the light is set on the candlestick "to give light to all in the house" (@Matthew 5:15) -- *all*, not merely as to those in your locality. The great thing is to hold yourself as in relation to the whole house.
Now, that was the divine intent for the apostles, but they imposed limitations on their service, with the result, as we were seeing, that the Lord moved on without them. Not only the widows, but the Samaritans and the eunuch were met and ministered to, and the work goes on, until Saul of Tarsus is
{497}
broken down, all showing how the Lord had Himself intervened at this peculiar juncture. Satan had endeavoured to bring in schism in chapter 6, now he is attacking the assembly from without; he would destroy what he could not corrupt, but the Lord steps in. We may always reckon on His intervention, for He will deal with anything that lifts up its head against His way and against His people. Happily, in this instance, the man who opposed is himself secured; grace is ever active on that line. Saul the great champion of evil is met and challenged: "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" the Lord says. He calls this man by name; it is a beautiful touch, and Saul is brought down and secured in his affections, so that immediately after receiving sight he announces in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. Wonderful trophy for the Lord to carry away from that conflict! The great opponent of the saints is completely won over in his affections so that, as the word says, "straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus that he is the Son of God".
Such is the effect of the Lord's gracious way. If we in any way impose limits on our responsibility or on our service, He can get along without us. We may lay that down as a fundamental principle. If we are not available He will secure those who are, and probably the most unlikely men, men who "have purchased to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus", as Stephen did. Note, it says "purchased", It cannot be gainsaid, such a degree is acquired through serious exercises and humiliations. Then you get such a trophy as Saul brought in by the Lord, one who is subdued and loves Christ. That is what counts, dear brethren, love for Christ! Saul loved Christ and so he was able to present Him as the Son of God.
{498}
And now the assembly is at rest; happy result of the Lord's intervention! Everything must give way to Him, and *does* give way, the effect being that the assemblies had rest and were edified and multiplied. At this juncture, you get the thread of Peter's service resumed, and what one would remark is, he seems to have gained greatly by his experience. The reason I give for saying this is, that he says to the first man he helps, "Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals thee: rise up and make thy couch for thyself". What he virtually says is,. Now, Aeneas, you must learn to help yourself; the time has come for that. 'Make thy bed for thyself.'. I would suggest the question to everyone here; What can you do for yourself? You cannot trust to anyone in this world, you must learn to do things for yourself. Certainly you can trust the Lord, and I am not disparaging what God may do in us; but it is quite obvious that what Peter had in his mind was that this man should be set up in his locality able to do something for himself. For eight years he had been a paralytic, and so a burden to others, but this state of things was to come to an end.
May I ask, How much do you rely on others for spiritual life? Many live, I fear, on what they get at meetings and they have little outside of that. Now, the Lord has indeed ordained that there should be meetings for the dispensing of food and it is a very great honour to be able to supply food for the saints; that is of the Lord without a doubt. The faithful and wise servant provides food for the household, in season, but notwithstanding that, each member of the household has to learn to do something for himself. In saying this I am not turning anyone away from Christ or from leaders He raises up, for He does raise up such, but I believe I am correct in assuming that Peter discerned that the time had come when souls should learn to do
{499}
things for themselves, hence he says to Aeneas, "make thy bed for thyself"; learn to do *that* much, do not wait for someone to do it for you. I believe we have arrived in a peculiar way at this moment: a moment when saints have to recognise their direct responsibility to God, each to do some thing, if only in relation to their own personal need, that they look to that. I am not denying the fact that there are others there to help you, as Peter was here, but it would alter the state of things greatly among the saints if the significance of the apostle's words to Aeneas were taken in.
The next case is Dorcas, and she does not need to be told to do anything like this, for she was a woman of very great activity, so much so that her name has been handed down in connection with work done for the poor and needy; and what a place it has both in the world and among the Lord's people! We have Dorcas societies today, and these are societies that *do* things; and not only do their members look after themselves, but they also look after others. It is very remarkable that this and the preceding incident should be put together. But what we find is, that in spite of her good works and almsdeeds, this woman Dorcas *dies*; her activities do not keep her alive. Understand, dear friends, I do not wish to minimise what she did, but I do wish to emphasise this, that she died; and I would elicit from this passage that we, too, may do much, and yet come short of living, so to speak. What is made prominent at the close of the narrative is that Peter presents her to the saints and widows, *living*, and it is no longer the idea of Dorcas, not a word is said as to what she did then; all that we have is a living woman presented to the saints, and that is enough. If you have a woman alive spiritually you do not need to say much. Making garments is all well, but that is not life; God's great end, looking at things
{500}
in this connection, is that there should be life. Worldly societies make garments, but *they* are not alive.
You will notice here also that *widows* are spoken of. They were there and weeping, but it has to be acknowledged that widows tears are not always spiritual tears. You will understand I am not speaking of anything personal, but of known facts. The Spirit of God puts things down for a definite purpose; it is not recorded merely in a historical way that this woman was mourned for by widows. It was not surprising that it should be so, for Dorcas had befriended them; but it is noteworthy that before Peter meets the situation *he puts them all out*. Now, spiritual people are not put out. You will also notice that it says in verse 14 that Peter, "having called the saints and widows presented her living". Saints are distinguished from widows in this verse, and the widows were the weeping ones. You will wonder, I dare say, why I dwell on this, but I want you to recognise that what you do must not be simply something that calls out the sympathy of unspiritual people; what is of interest is the sympathy of spiritual people, and the Spirit of God distinguishes between widows and saints. Widows are obviously not always saints in that sense; they remembered the good deeds of Dorcas, praiseworthy indeed they were; I am not belittling them in any way, but the fact remains that in spite of their tears the widows were put forth. It is searching. The Holy Spirit is working through Peter, there is a spiritual movement, and I may be faced with this that I can have no part in it in spite of the fact that I am moved and weeping. My very emotions might become a hindrance spiritually. It is a serious matter here, a question of death and life, and tears avail nothing. Let us ask ourselves the question: What are our activities? What is the end of them?
{501}
Peter here puts the widows forth, then he kneels down and prays; he needed the power of God, and that is just what *is* needed.
So, conscious of this, he must not be interfered with, the atmosphere must be cleared of all natural sentimentality which avails nothing, it hinders. And now he turns to the body and says, "Tabitha, arise, And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up". I suppose Peter represented for the moment God's power, and Tabitha, opening her eyes and looking upon him, sits up. Then it goes on to say, having given her his hand, he raised her up; there was the power of God exercised through a man. This woman would never forget this wonderful touch, and the effect of Peter's hand lifting her up. And Peter "having called the saints and the widows, presented her living"; she is a living woman now, that is the thought. Life is a great thing. To my mind this fits in with John's ministry, and it seems as if Peter in this lapse between chapters 5 and 9, had been spiritually helped of God; one speaks of it with great respect for the apostle, for he says in effect, Now it is a question of life, people must be known as living. So he presents her to the saints, as if to say, Here is a living Dorcas for you, not now a garment maker, but a living woman spiritually. It is spiritual life, I need not remind you, that is contemplated, that which would answer to God. "The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day", Hezekiah said (@Isaiah 38:19). If there is anything one would love, it is to be among the saints as alive spiritually. We want that, as the apostle says, "God ... has quickened us with the Christ", (@Ephesians 2:5). He quickens each of us in our souls, so that we live Godward. But we are quickened *together* also; (@Colossians 2:13). This woman is presented living to the saints, and henceforth they have a living woman in their midst, whose heart from that moment will
{502}
be wholly for God, for Christ, and for the saints.
One felt it might help us to have our attention called to this peculiar result of apostolic service as the narrative is resumed in this part of the Acts. The product of it is a man who was a burden to others, now able to make his bed, and a woman who dies though she had a great reputation, but who is now made to live and is given back to the saints as alive
{503}.
FISHERS OF MEN
@Matthew 4:12 - 25, 5:1,2
One is always inclined to make comparisons between the different gospels, and in taking up Matthew, one has in mind that he discredits and disparages religious pretension. Anyone resting in mere religious practice for his soul's salvation, or hiding behind religion, earthly religion, as a refuge, is exposed in Matthew. He takes occasion always to dissipate all such claims and pretensions; they are of no value in God's account. However much they may be worth in the eyes of men, for religion is a great asset in the world, they are of no avail in God's account.
So Matthew introduces the Lord's ministry as beginning in Galilee, in proximity to the nations, and He ends that ministry in Galilee. God was setting aside the claims of Jerusalem which stood for religion. It represented, not an ordinary religion, but one that God Himself had primarily set up and owned. Indeed, the Lord Jesus had the deepest affection for Jerusalem. He recalls what the city represented in the mind of God. It was the city of the great King; there David had ruled, and Solomon, and many other kings. As Jesus was ending His journey on earth Jerusalem came into view from mount Olivet, and He wept over it. But weeping over it did not save it. "O Jerusalem", He says, "thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!" (@Matthew 23:37) The temple stood in all its majesty on mount Zion; the priesthood was there, and the service was carried on every week; Moses was read there, but they would not recognise or respond to the divine overtures in Christ.
{504}
What must Jerusalem have represented in those days to a religious mind, as the temple was looked at across the ravine from mount Olivet! The Lord, sitting on that same mount, says, looking at the buildings, "There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down". (@Matthew 24:2) Such is the end of mere religion. If God has refused it, it is without value, and it must go. So the quicker you get from behind it, seeing its worthlessness, and you surrender to Christ, the sooner will you secure the benefits that are in Christ. "Ye would not", He says; their will was active. Although they read in the temple the scriptures that spoke of Him, they would have none of Him. So Matthew takes that point of view, and instead of the ministry of the Lord beginning at Jerusalem, or ending there, it is in Galilee of the nations.
Now Luke, on the other hand, being minded not to stir up any feelings of resentment in men, introduces the thought of God coming down to where men were. Whether they were Pharisees or Sadducees, or ordinary Israelites, Romans, Greeks or barbarians, Luke presents God coming down to men where they were, without raising any question as to their temple, or religion, or national customs. It was in the spirit of what the apostle Paul said, he became all things to all men that he might gain the more. There is no effort to create any irritation in Luke: hence he begins with the temple. He begins with a priest who is a righteous man in it, Zacharias, who was serving in the order of his course. Things are right so far. He is at the altar of incense in the holy place, offering up incense, and the angel appears to him at the altar of incense, and reveals to him that his prayer is heard. That is Luke; he comes in on the line of reconciliation. God wants your soul. He is not raising any religious or political question: He wants your soul.
{505}
Paul, on Mars Hill, stirred by the idolatry that he discerned, preached to the men as one of them; he wanted those men for God, and tonight, I would not irritate anyone, or stir up anyone's prejudices. Christ wants you in spite of your prejudices. That is Luke; and you must remember that when the Lord ordained the twelve apostles, He looked out on the wide field of men and women and children of Adam's race, and saw the great need. The need remains; everyone who is with God recognises that. How the heart of God went out to all those men and women! They were to be enlightened. "A light for revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel" (@Luke 2:32); that is what Christ was. So the Lord comes down after a night of prayer and appoints the twelve who were to be His witnesses; and at the end of Luke's gospel it says, "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem". (@Luke 24:47) Jerusalem must not be irritated; the gospel must begin there, for God has nothing else in His heart but forgiveness for everyone in Jerusalem, even for the murderers of Christ. The apostles were to wait in Jerusalem until they received the promise of the Father; the Holy Spirit should come, and in the power of that Spirit they should go forth. The Spirit coming from the Father, think of that! He sent down the Holy Spirit so that there should be a power here to carry the glad tidings to the utmost bounds of the human family.
The apostleship of the twelve was only to emphasise the authority in which the gospel should go forth. God *commands* all men everywhere to repent. The more authority you have the better, if the authority is what is good. And Paul further tells us, "Because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained: whereof he hath given assurance unto all
{506}
men, in that he hath raised him from the dead". (@Acts 17:31) So that the resurrection of Christ is an assurance of the guilt of man. The Lord having appointed the twelve, He comes down from the mountain on to the plain. How one would love to bring the Lord to you; He would come down to where you are. As the verse of a hymn beautifully puts it:
<blockquote>"Sinner, see thy God beside thee, <br>In a servant's form come near: <br>Sitting, talking, walking with thee, <br>Drawn by love, no longer fear". (`112:3) </blockquote>
He comes down in grace, and He is on the plain, so that He is available to everyone. You have not to climb the mount to reach Him; He has come down to be beside you, to talk and to walk with you.
What you notice in @Matthew 4 is that when Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon and Andrew, casting a net into the sea, and He calls them whereas in John, Peter is brought to the Lord by Andrew. Now what I would remark about John is that he emphasises the work of God in the soul. Luke does not emphasise that, neither does Matthew, nor Mark. All are inspired by the same Spirit, and there can be no possible discrepancy or contradiction. The Spirit has an object in each narrative. So John, amongst many other things, emphasises the work of God in your soul; he sets you in movement. But how can men move unless they have power? John supposes the work of God. Andrew is one of the two who hears John speak, and he follows Jesus. Now he moves, and finds his brother Simon, and brings him to Jesus. Have you ever been conscious of any movement of that kind in your soul? Something that would lead you away from evil? Any principle like that is not natural, it is of God. Any power or influence in your soul that
{507}
drags you away from evil and that would lead you to learn about God in Christ, however faint or indefinite, is of God. The Lord's people discern it: they see there is something introduced into your being that is different from what was there. Your parents know about it, they have been watching you. It is the work of God, without which the gospel must be ineffective. And so Andrew is moved; he abides with Christ that day, and he brings his brother Simon. The Lord looks upon him. It is not his ability to fish that is evident; the Lord beholds him, and gives him a name.
In the same chapter, Philip finds Nathanael. Nathanael is sitting under the fig-tree: that does not indicate movement. It is all well enough in millennial times, but with sin and need in this world, and death reigning, it is hardly the place. Movement is the order of the time. Philip says to Nathanael, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph". Philip was instructed in the Scriptures; it is a great thing to know the Scriptures. Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote about Him, and Philip adds, "Jesus of Nazareth". Nathanael says, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" His mind is on Nazareth, and he forgets Moses and the prophets. Had he been spiritual, he would have dwelt on Moses, and the prophets, and on what they said. They were much more important that the town of Nazareth. Philip did not reason with him, he said, "Come and see". John's ministry is to bring to light the work of God. If there is no work of God, then no preaching is effective. So I say to you tonight, if you are inquiring about Christ, Come and see. Many of us have come and found what is in Christ. So Nathanael arose for the work of God was there. He came to Jesus, and when Jesus saw him coming, He said, "Behold an
{508}
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile". (@John 1:47) He did not call him that while he was sitting under the fig tree. There is no evidence of the work of God in your soul as you sit just as you are in your everyday circumstances.
In @Matthew 4 the people were sitting in darkness, oblivious to the fact that it was darkness. Multitudes of people are sitting there. They have no exercise about things; they go to their employment in the morning, come home at night, and follow their ordinary routine week in, week out. They have no thought of God, no sensibilities as to the death that is all around them; they are sitting in darkness, quite at home in it. So Matthew says, "they that sat in the region and shadow of death". Think of people sitting there, in the region of death, and the shadow of it! Whilst Nathanael was sitting, the Lord did not call him by name. There is no evidence of the work of God in you until you become exercised. When you read the Scriptures, when you realise that you are a sinner, God takes account of you. One would love to see souls coming to Christ. One can easily discern how it is the declension has set in, when the difficulty arose about being able to distinguish between those who were real and those who were not. Who are the real ones? Those who move. Those who sit still and are oblivious of the conditions that exist, are the unreal ones. If you are sitting in the region of death, wake up! The light is shining, and directly you move, the Lord will take notice of you. You will become more interesting to your parents. They watch for their children, and directly there is a spiritual move, they take note of it; it cheers their hearts.
Well now, coming back to Matthew, the Lord is presented, in the passage I read, as the light, and the Spirit goes on to say that "from that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom
{509}
of heaven is at hand". In verse 13 it says He dwelt in Capernaum.. How affecting to one who loves the Lord now dwelling in heaven, to think of His actually living in some house in that little town, in the district of Galilee! If one had lived close to Him and seen His life and ways, one would have felt the effect of it. The Spirit says, "The people which sat in darkness saw great light"; but it does not say they were all affected by it. John says, "The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not". (@John 1:5) But it was there, so he says further, "That was the true light, which coming into the world lighteth every man". That does not mean that every man is affected by it. So John says later, "The true light already shines". (@1 John 2:8) That is Christianity: the light is shining; it is for you to respond to it.
Now it says, "From that time Jesus began to preach"; that was when the preaching began. His dwelling among men preceded the preaching. As John says again, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us". (@John 1:14) Think of the wonderful privilege of those people! God was there, and there in a Man, who moved about as a Man amongst men. He saw these two brothers, Simon and Andrew, who were fishers. I believe that God today is in a very great measure working family-wise; He has great interest in His own institutions. The family is a divine institution; there are divine exercises there, whether of the parents toward the children, the children toward the parents, or the children toward one another. Satan would disrupt families; he hates every divine institution, whereas Christianity is intended to preserve such intact. God would preserve the family; He preserves parents, children and others connected with the family, and through the relationships He has formed in nature He would speak to souls. So you find in the gospels, parents exercised about their children and praying to
{510}
the Lord about them, and He answers them.
Here were two men, comparatively young, engaged in the same employment, the same calling, and they are acting together; they are doing the same thing at the same time, casting a net into the sea, and the Lord calls them. How He would call some child here, the child of some godly parent or parents, and how He would adjust that child in regard to his or her parents! But then He wants you for Himself. He is not going to rob your parents, for you will come back to them after you have been to Him; you will come back to them a better child.
Now He says, "Follow me", and He adds what might be called a premium: He says, If you follow Me, I will make something out of you. I believe that many young Christians today have no conception of what the Lord would make of them. We are altogether too general in our apprehension of things. I want to know, as a Christian, not only that I am the Lord's and that I am saved, and have all the benefits of His death secured to me, but I want to know what He is going to make out of me. Have you any exercise about that? He is going to take you up in relation to His people here. Are you not going to be occupied with something distinctive yourself? He says here, "I will make you fishers of men". They would understand that. The Lord does not put anything before you in the way of service that is beyond you; He takes you up in relation to what you are fitted for, and employs you in that. Perhaps you say, If only I had a college education! But the Lord knew you had not had one when He took you up. Or you may say, If only I had So-and-so's ability! The Lord is going to make something out of *you*. He did not tell John what He was going to make out of. Peter. What He is going to do with you is a secret: it is for *you* to know; the result will come out later.
{511}
It was a considerable time before Andrew and Peter became fishers of men. It is a time of work, not that *I* would put you to work, but I would impress upon you levitical responsibility. If you go to the Levites book, the book of Numbers, you will find that every Levite was taken account of for service from a month old. He could not do anything when he was a month old, but he took up the work when he was ready for it. So the Lord, who is indeed the great Prince of the Levites, as typified by Eleazar, says, "I will make you fishers of men". Would to God that we were moved today in regard of men! They are in dire need, and the Lord would lay it upon us to go after men. But then we have to be *made* fishers of men. Peter might say, I know how to fish. Yes, but not in the sea of the nations. The *Lord* would have to make him a fisher in that. It is when he announces the gospel on the day of Pentecost that he fishes for men, bringing the truth to their souls, and three thousand are caught in one haul, a wonderful result of the Lord's formation of Peter for this great work.
Now you will observe there were two other brethren, James and John, "in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets". That is what they were doing. I do not dwell on that, only that I have no doubt it indicates John's line, mending the nets. What you will observe is that they were not only two brothers acting together, but they were with their father. The family tie was evidently there, and the Lord calls them. Now He does not say anything as to what He would make out of John. It is not that He did not intend to make something out of him, but there are no repetitions in Scripture. The Scriptures lay down a principle, and it is there, then the Spirit of God goes on to something else.
So now it is a question of the call, a call without any premium attached to it. Jesus called John and
{512}
James, and they immediately left the ship and their father. Perhaps you may say in regard to your case that it would be no great hardship to you to leave your employment and your father. If you are not content in your employment and in your father's company, you are not subject to the will of God. What is mentioned here indicates the opposite of that. They were quite satisfied in their father's service and in their father's company, but they valued the call, and they followed Jesus. Are you prepared to come just for the call, without anything else added? John could do that; he valued the Person of Christ, and he followed Jesus. How important, to be on one hand occupied with the service, and on the other content to be with Christ, to leave all to Him! So it says they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed Him. It meant something for them to leave their father and to follow Jesus.
Now you will see the great result of Christ's service: there followed Him great multitudes of people. The Lord sees the necessity of that crowd being regulated; it is a great thing for a young Christian to be regulated by divine principles. In @Luke 14:25,26) He tested the crowd; "He turned, and said unto them, If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother ... he cannot be my disciple". Terrible! But He said that to them, when He saw that they were following Him for some other reason than a spiritual one. But here, seeing the crowds, He goes up into a mountain, sits there, and teaches His disciples. It is a question of legislation; so when His disciples came unto Him, He opened His mouth and taught them. God would not have a crowd here; Christians are set up and regulated by divine principles. I say to anybody who is not in fellowship, Christian fellowship is regulated by legislation according to divine principles. When the Lord sees
{513}
the crowd, He goes to the mountain, in order that the crowd should cease to be a crowd and become an assembly. He teaches the disciples, in order that they in turn should teach the crowd.
May God bless His word!
